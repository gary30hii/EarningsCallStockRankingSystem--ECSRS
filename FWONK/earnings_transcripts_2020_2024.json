During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, August 10th. I would now like to turn the conference over to Courtnee Chun, Chief Portfolio Officer and Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nCourtnee Chun: Thank you.

The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media and SiriusXM Schedules one and two can be found at the end of the earnings press release issued today, which is available on our Web site. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Liberty President and CEO, Greg Maffei.\nGreg Maffei: Good morning, and thank you, Courtnee. Today speaking on the call we will also have Formula One's Chairman and CEO, Chase Carey and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Chief Principal Officer, Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. First, I hope you all are healthy and safe and have been enjoying your summer given these challenging circumstances. Second, I'd like to again thank our management teams and employees that have done such an impressive job managing through this COVID-19 crisis. So first looking at Liberty SiriusXM. We completed the previously announced rights offering, it was fully subscribed, generated proceeds of $754 million and we used that money to fully repay the intergroup loan that Liberty SiriusXM had to the Formula One Group. During that period, we paused our share repurchases as we were prohibited from being in market during the rights offering. We are certainly aware that if this panic remains and we have ample liquidity at LSXM and expect to take full advantage of the discount opportunity. Our ownership at SiriusXM now sands as of July 28th at 72.9%. SIRI also paused it's buybacks in Q2 due to market conditions and the depths of the COVID crisis, but recently extended their authorization by $2 billion. We remain very focused on getting to 80% as SIRI. Looking at Sirius itself, like our other subscription businesses, Sirius has proved resilient during the crisis. Sub pay net adds, subscriber adds were 254,000 and turn was down 1.6%. During the quarter, we generated over $0.5 billion of free cash flow. We also announced the deal to acquire Stitcher, creating a full service platform for podcast creators, publishers and advertisers and also announced a smaller deal Simplecast with podcast management and analytics platform services. SiriusXM continues to provide innovative programming and launching new apps, including the Beastie Boys, Bob Marley, Coldplay, Queen, you know how much I enjoy Freddie Mercury and the comedian Jim Gaffigan. With strength and visibility in the business, we offered new 2020 guidance at SiriusXM. Turning briefly in the Formula One Group, and you\u2019ve hear more from Chase in a moment. We returned to racing at beginning in July and we now completed five races, and are still targeting a 15 to 18 race season and we continue to move the business forward. We have a new lower cost capital build effect in 2021, we have new broadcasting and sponsorship deals. The teams and all of our partners have been doing a tremendous job of returning to the track. Yesterday, we had an exciting race in Silverstone where Red Bull and Max Verstappen had a great strategy that they execute on very well upon to win, so it\u2019s exciting racing. Turning to Live Nation, their top priority in the recent months has been strengthening the financial position announced an amendment to the credit agreement, which suspends their leverage covenant till the end of 2021 and provides increased flexibility. They recently reported results last week, still bullish on the future of live events even with the near-term of ticket is turbulent rather. They've already sold 19 million tickets over 4,000 concerts and festivals, which are scheduled for 2021. Management expects live events can return to scale in the summer of 2021. In a positive note, 86% of fans opted to keep their ticket for rescheduled shows even if they're offered refunds. Two-thirds of their fans keeping tickets for canceled festivals so they can go to next year's show. Virtual concerts are generating big demand with fans over 67 million fans used 18,000 virtual concerts globally in the second quarter. We had over 150 performances for a virtual Lollapalooza and we launched socially distanced shows in permitted locations, including New Zealand, France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Finland and select cities across the U.S. Now turning to Braves. Glad to see that Braves return to field and they\u2019re off to a strong start with 11, six records, including seven and two at home and they won all three series though its part. In series play, they are five in one, which is tied to the most such victories in the majors. And we\u2019re very sad our number one Mike Soroka end the season early with a torn Achilles and we do wish him a speedy recovery. But the Braves still have four former first round picks and starts and starting rotation with Max Fried, Sean Newcomb, Kyle Wright] and Touki Toussaint. Early in the year, Markakis opted out of the season but he since returned and he returned with a bang with a walk off homer last week in his debut.\nCourtnee Chun: Greg, are you on?\nBrian Wendling: While we wait for Greg to return, I will continue on and then hand it over to Chase. Good morning, everyone. At the end of June, we amended the term loan and revolving credit facility at Formula One. The net leverage covenant will not apply until our first testing day for the quarter ending March 31, 2022, providing the business additional flexibility to operate during this uncertain time. Brave Holdings is expected to be out of compliance with certain debt covenants at the end of the quarter. We continue to work with the lenders to obtain waivers and covenant modifications. These discussions are going well and we're optimistic that we will have a favorable resolution by the end of the month. Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, restricted cash and liquid investments of $154 million, excluding $1.8 billion of cash and restricted cash all with SiriusXM. We have $870 million of undrawn margin on capacity at the parent level. The value of the SiriusXM common stock and Live Nation stock held at Liberty SiriusXM as of Friday\u2019s close was $22 billion, which excludes the value of the Live Nation call spread, which is held at Formula One Group valued at $210 million at quarter end. We have $2.1 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings.  Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principle amount of debt is $12.6 billion, which includes $9.4 billion of debt at Liberty SiriusXM. Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $1.4 billion, which excludes $324 million of cash at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.6 billion, which includes the $2.9 billion of debt held directly by Formula One, leaving $733 million at the corporate level. And lastly to the Braves, we had attributed cash, liquid investments and restricted cash of $329 million and attributed debt was $718 million. With that, I'll turn it over to Chase to talk more about Formula One.\nChase Carey: Okay, thank you, Brian. And I guess I\u2019ll keep going and wait for Greg to return at some point. We were thrilled to return to racing with the launch of our 2020 season in Austria, the first weekend in July. It was an exciting race that saw a lot of competition in the midfield with an action packed last few laps that are Lando Norris\u2019s first podium finish. In the five races so far, we've seen Lewis Hamilton fighting for his 7th World Championship. The continued strength and ingenuity of Red Bull, the struggles of Ferrari, the emergence of McLaren and Racing Point as serious contenders. Our data through the first four races of the season have produced solid viewership growth across the race weekend, especially in key markets like China and there's tremendous growth on our digital platforms measured in video views, social media interactions and traffic across the Web sites and app. The drama in the Paddock built this summer as a number of driver changes were announced for 2021. Ferrari decided not to renew four time World Champion, Sebastian Vettel, and instead signed Carlos Sainz. His open seat at McLaren went to Danny Ricardo, which will make for a strong and entertaining pairing with Lando Norris. Renault decided to fill their vacancy with former Champion, Fernando Alonso. And Valtteri Bottas resigned with Mercedes for 2021. There's continued speculation around Sebastian Vettel, so more to come. Just prior to the start of this season, we launched our, we race as one initiative, to tackle the major issues that we as a sport and a society are facing. We used our restart to show that we stand united against racism and are doing more to address inequality and diversity in Formula One, while also taking a moment to thank people around the world for the fortitude they\u2019ve shown against the global COVID-19 pandemic. We will be establishing a task force to listen and identify the right initiatives required to increase diversity and inclusion across Formula One, specifically focused on identifying employment and education opportunities and the required actions to affect change. We're in the process of creating a foundation that primarily finance internships and apprenticeships within Formula One for underrepresenting groups. These efforts build on ambitious sustainability, diversity and inclusion strategy set out in November 2019, which set goals of having a net zero carbon footprint by 2030 and ensuring all of our events are sustainable by 2025. Getting back to racing, there\u2019s been no easy feat I'd like to thank the FIA, our employees, the teams and drivers, our promoter partners and local authorities. Together, we developed an extensive code of conduct and testing protocols that are being closely followed and have been working well. Our priority has always been to safely transport everyone and to enable those individuals to operate in a safe and secure manner. We've been publishing our testing results each week as we believe it's good to provide this transparency. At Silverstone, we saw firsthand how our safety procedures are robust and effective. Sadly, Sergio Perez tested positive for the virus but our trace and test procedure handled the situation safely and with efficiency with no impact on the race weekend for the wider sport. It shows how far we\u2019ve come into Australia and it's a testament to the diligent way that we've returned to racing. We have now announced 13 races in the revised calendar and expect to get to between 15 and 18 races in 2020. The newly added three races bring exciting circuits that were not part of the original 2020 calendar. Portimao in Portugal will be a completely new circuit, while we welcome back Imola and Nurburgring that have hosted World Championships in the past. Unfortunately, due to the fluid nature of the ongoing pandemic it will not be possible for us to race the Americas this season, but we\u2019ll look forward to being back in 2021. We expect to release the final details of the 2020 calendar in the coming weeks. While we\u2019ve been extremely focused on 2020 season, we continue to progress the business for the long-term. We reached a long term exclusive rights agreement with Sky Deutschland beginning in 2021. Sky Deutschland will provide fans in Germany with full coverage of every Grand Prix and include Germany's first 24x7 channel dedicated to Formula One. We also announced agreements in Austria with Servus TV and ORF and in Russia with Match TV. We're in the process of finalizing the last couple of TV deals for 2021. We've also continued to strengthen and expand our commercial partnerships. We believe our planned raise calendar of 15 to 18 races will be able to satisfy the vast majority of our contracted sponsorship revenue in 2020. To name a few recent updates Liqui Molly, the globally renowned vehicle care products experts, upgraded to an official sponsor for the next three years. Adapting to the new reality, we partnered with Zoom to deliver the first ever Virtual Paddock Club experience. Beginning with the race in Hungary, guests are treated to a range of experiences and we're working to expand this offering to our global partners and F1 teams. Furthering the fan outreach, we announced a new podcast series, The Spotify. Paddock passes hosted by Will Buxton and in these exclusive episodes, he will speak to drivers, team principles and legends of the sport. On the video front and following on the strong results of the first two seasons of the Netflix show, Drive to Survive, the film crews are already at work filming the third season. We're also partnered with YouTube to live stream the Eifel Grand Prix in Nurburgring, Germany. This is the first time fans from select European countries will be able to view the entire Grand Prix weekend for free on the Formula One YouTube channel. Before I return to the track, we took the opportunity to revisit the cost cap of $175 million announced last October. The new cost cap of $145 million will be introduced in 2021 and we\u2019ll further reduce to $140 million in 2022 and $135 million in 2023. This will advance the objective to improve the competition and action on the track and at the same time, make the sport a healthier and more attractive business for all. With our return to racing and the revised cost cap, we've moved to finalize discussions around the Concorde Agreement. We've had productive conversations with all constituents and we look forward to completing this agreement in the near future and solidifying the sport for the longer term. We've also been focused on the corporate operations of Formula One. During the second quarter, we furloughed over 50% of our workforce, but we\u2019re pleased to bring back the majority of our employees with our return to racing. We also focused on our balance sheet and announced an amendment to our debt covenants, which provides flexibility until March 31, 2022. These actions along with diligent approach to our spending will enable us to weather this difficult time. Given all the challenges in 2020, we're proud of what we've been able to accomplish and expect to accomplish. We've been in regular contact with the majority of our commercial partners to discuss the reduced race calendar and the expectations that many of our races will not have fans. Clearly, this is going to impact our revenue in multiple areas but it\u2019s still dependent on how the remainder of the year unfolds. We appreciate and value our long-term partners and we expect to resolve any contractual issues in a fair and straightforward manner. We're confident in our plans for 2020, and look forward to 2021 when we think we can return to our prior expectations for Formula One. Now I'll turn the call back to Greg.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Chase and thank you, Brian. Given the ongoing pandemic, we have decided that Liberty's Investor Day will be virtual and will happen over two days, because no one, as much as we love to, should have to be in the video call for that long. On Thursday, November 19th, we will cover Liberty Media and Liberty TripAdvisor and on Friday, November 20th, we'll include Qurate, GCI Liberty and Liberty Broadband. We'll run from 11.02 Eastern on both days. More details will be provided on our Web site, so please mark your calendars. As always, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and again, hope you all stay safe and healthy. And with that, operator, I'd love to open the floor for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne: Chase, could you talk about, I know you're obviously laser focused on 2020. But I\u2019d love to ask you a couple of questions about next season. On the sponsorship front, are you able to give us any sense for how you're thinking that this coming together for next year? I don\u2019t know if you want to be this specific. But I'm trying to figure out if '21 could be higher than 2019, or if the sort of global recession and pressure on corporate spendings maybe change the direction of that revenue line? And then secondly, I'm wondering if you're thinking about a later start to the season next year, just because of obviously what\u2019s going on with the virus and sort of continued timelines during vaccination. Just curious if you think that's an option that you guys are exploring yet, or if it's too early? And then I just had one for Greg. Greg, you again reemphasized the discount at Liberty SIRI, the buyback. Could you guys buyback any shares between June 16th and whenever you file the 10-Q, that\u2019s where we'll see what the number looks like on the share count front, because it doesn't look like you did and I didn't know if that was because you were boxed out or some other reasons, trying to reconcile the comment with the buyback? Thanks guys.\nChase Carey: Let me answer the second part first, because it sort of sets up the first part. We are planning a 2021 season that looks pretty much like what we would have expected if it to look like the beginning of this year. And obviously, we qualify that with -- we don't have any better visibility than anybody else what this virus is going to look like as we go forward. I do think one has to realize, I think we're about five months into the virus and our season in March would be still seven months away. So, there's a long time and conversations on vaccines, and treatments, and testing and the like, will obviously continue to evolve. We also obviously raised in 22 countries, so we deal with a much bigger mixed bag of issues throughout this. But we are planning on 2021 that looks like we would expect it, which probably will be a '22 race calendar, a calendar that probably starts and finishes about when our calendar has. We may make it, so there's a little more space in the front end of it and the calendar, and second half is a little busier. So we've got a little more flexibility built into it but I think that's probably a tweak to it not a real restructuring. Clearly, as this goes along we'll know more and there's always the possibility we make some adjustments as we go forward. But at this point, we're planning races that love fans, we've been in touch with most of our events, again, nobody has visibility to this. We'll obviously have a lot of sports ahead of us. What will the NBA, the NHL do as they get to next season, and one of the soccer leagues, football leagues in Europe do, as their seasons get going. So I think we do have the benefit of a lot of things that will be in front of us as templates around the world. I think as it relates to the sponsorship side, I think things went pretty quiet just in the early stage. As I said the first month or two of the virus period. I think that people adjusted to working from home and engaging in a different way. I mean, obviously virtually and connecting and the like. We actually feel pretty good about the traction in the last few months. We're actually in a pretty good place in terms of renewals. So I think the sponsorship is a place we clearly believe there's real room to grow. I think we were talking before the virus hit about the head we were making, we acknowledged we probably weren't as far along in the growth as we expected but still felt as strong as ever about the growth opportunities for us the interest is good. So we continue to expect growth and we again, our foundation is in pretty good place. The renewal we have, we're having -- we're in advanced discussions that are very positive and the interest from new parties is strong. So as much as everything is fluid, we feel pretty good about continuing to get to where we think we should be in the sponsorship world and the opportunity we have in front of us.\nGreg Maffei: And Ben, I'm happy to try and answer the other. We were blacked out for most of Q2 during the rights offering and we had our normal course blackouts prior to our earnings. The most of it is disclosed more details in the press release, so that I know we just dropped it on you but if you look in that, I think that's outlined.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bryan Kraft from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nBryan Kraft: I want to ask two questions, first on Formula One. Working capital usage has been essentially neutral year-to-date. Do you expect that to change at all in the second half based on what you know at this point in time? And related to that the season we\u2019re to be honest respectively cut shorter than the 15, 18 race plan. Would you be in a position where you have to refund fees collected for the season already? For example, those from the broadcast rights holders. Just trying to get a sense for what the potential cash need could be relative to the cash need out on the balance sheet currently? And then my other question is on the strategic front. Greg, if you were to increase your equity stake in iHeart and something closer to the 50% level that has received antitrust approval. What are the reasons that you'd be doing it through the Liberty, Sirius versus SiriusXM, maybe the pros and cons of those two options? Thank you.\nChase Carey: I think largely in terms of payments received from parties, not in all cases but I'd say the majority of our cases, we're aligning payments more with the races. So payments which would have been scheduled throughout the race season that would have started in March, obviously, the race season starting in July, it\u2019s a different start and a different pace to it. So not in all cases but I think in the majority of it we've moved those payments to be more aligned with the races. So definitely that will impact -- but certainly the impact if we didn't get through our targeted races from people who've paid us for that, for those races would be limited just because of -- again, how we're sort of looking for payments to commit more against the races as are actually occurring. And I think in terms of working capital and I'd say I don't really probably get that granular on trying to, because if we got so many moving parts, they probably use some working capital evolve. First and second quarter, we did much in the way of operations. So they they\u2019ll -- it probably limits to the amount of working capital that's -- we're generating when we're not operating the business in the third and fourth quarter, we'll obviously operating the business, which will create working capital. I mean clearly, there's an impact on our revenue start working capital it\u2019s not, we would be in a normal year just because as a result that would be in a normal year. But there will be -- but I don't actually, with all those moving parts if we got to liquidate our balance sheet sort of not -- it's not probably one of the things I forecast, or particularly kind of we manage our payments and receipts and focus more on that, and working capital, which would be probably reasonably ordinary course for reduced level of operations.\nGreg Maffei: Yes, I'd like to just add on Chase's comments before I address, iHeart. I mean, obviously, one of the reasons we did the reattribution was to put bulletproof balance sheet in place at Formula One and that\u2019s uphold go I think we've done that. So I echo Chase's points, we're very much focused on getting through 2020 and set ourselves in place with no matter what happened in 2020 we\u2019re prepared to try and get back to normal course, which we'll reasonably comp down for 2021. Turning briefly to iHeart. There are some issues there that are worth thinking about for the long-term, which is Sirius a faster growing and iHeart, how much you want to consolidate that? How would you want to account for that? There are a lot of operating synergy potential there. But candidly given the opportunities we have at SiriusXM, we like iHeart but we don't feel any rush to do that. We've all noted the discount. We've all noted some of the things that SIRI wants to do about getting to AD. We\u2019ve noted some of the things that SIRI wants to do about potentially in podcasts, those haven't been big and I don't expect they're going to be huge going forward. But the point being there are demands on the cash flow of SIRI and opportunity on the cash flow of SIRI that are interesting. And iHeart is a great management team, we like the business. But clearly, advertising is challenged in this environment and we want to watch and see what happens.\nBryan Kraft: Just one follow up on that, Greg. The antitrust approval, I assume that applies to either scenario, whether it would be acquired through Sirius or iHeart up to the 50%. Is that correct?\nGreg Maffei: I think you meant through Liberty Sirius or Sirius -- yes. I understand -- we've treated as one entity for that purpose.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from David Karnovsky from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nDavid Karnovsky: Just few for Chase, on the race promotion. In the past, I think you've discussed timing along with the locations that want to hold the Grand Prix. So just wondering if you think the pandemic will impact the willingness of local governments to subsidize and support races, even through the negative because of pressure to finances or maybe to the positive even because of the need to attract tourism in the future? And then just for this season, assuming a limited number of fans are allowed at some races. Can you discuss how this would impact promoter fee, would this be prorated based on how much of the venue you\u2019re able to fill? Thanks.\nChase Carey: So in terms of race promotion, certainly in discussions to date, which obviously therefore are beyond this year, they are not 2020. We certainly have races inserted as one offs. Some of them I mentioned in the early comments, at Portugal and Imola. But on the longer term traditional type arrangements, we've actually got our calendar pretty well set forth. We haven't announced 2021 just because of the focus on 2020 but we're pretty -- we're close to sort of finalizing 2021. We've got a couple agreements to complete where we sort at the business terms agreed, we\u2019ve got to pay for it. There's been no impact on that and obviously, those in discussions that would have began well before the virus and it's certainly not have had any negative impact. And I think in some ways, it is -- the importance of getting back to the world as we know it and re-energizing, it actually seems to be a bigger topic, the positive you're talking about as opposed to the negative. In the short-term, everybody still wrestles with how long is the virus going to last. But I think there is a broad based assumption that the world has to continue to recover and businesses have to -- everything has to start to operate and in some ways, there's a pent up demand for this. And obviously, an importance we have of places that want to attract people and the like, the types of cities we're in that obviously are very -- with tourism and their general business is important and exposure to the global -- to the world is important, probably makes our platforms more important. But the conversation and interest is not, I think any negative given our calendar for 2021. The conversations we have right now are probably early stage, because they're not for next year. If we've got next year, as I said, they\u2019re pretty much done and we're just finishing the agreements for it. So we're not pushing 2022 and beyond but there are still parties that we've talk to but again, is not in any way -- their interest hasn't diminished. We're not into those sort of agreements. We're not really into business terms. And we're talking of race that\u2019s two or three years away, because it's early stage. So you're really talking more about the opportunity and what\u2019s you can do with it and things around it, so it's not the detailed substance. The agreements we have this year, I mean it\u2019s especially a unique year. I mean, they're all over the place. I mean you have obviously -- we don't -- we\u2019re not going to have -- we don\u2019t expect the first race, we think just potential for a very small number of fans, it\u2019s probably not much yellow, but -- and probably increasing. Not still on races. And on the latter part of the schedule, there certainly we hope that fans as many as possible. In some places, the governments want to get a little closer to the date to determine what the situation is, our deals, our agreements, vary all over in some degree depend, are these long term partners are one-off partners. So, there are a lot of moving parts, some of them do have variables in it. But again, it defers in each place, which is always the case with our agreements.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from James Ratcliffe from Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nJames Ratcliffe: One for Greg and one for Chase, if I could. Greg, following on iHeart, if I recall from last November at the Analyst Day, John said something effective you see value in buying things with the momentum and evaluation levels and that there were synergies. And clearly, there will be a lot of synergies if you owned all of iHeart and combing it with SiriusXM. Can you talk about what sort of synergies you could potentially capture on a minority non-controlling stake in iHeart? And then for Chase, around some of the broadcasting rules not particularly happy with what you've gotten in Germany, Austria, it\u2019s Russia, and I think Scandinavia as well as. As you work to finalize an agreement in Spain, sounds like adding, I\u2019ll call sites to Ferrari and Fernando Alonso coming back should be positive for that. Can you provide any additional commentary on what you\u2019ve been hearing from your broadcast partners over the last few months and how are your viewing the market for sports rights specifically across some of the most important European markets? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: I\u2019ll go first, Chase. On iHeart, I think you point out that a minority stake would make some of the issues around synergies more difficult, but I don't necessarily think impossible in terms of how you share advertising sales, how you share digital build outs. They're clearly ways we could work together. They're probably ways we can work together even without an acquisition but they get easier to degree or common ownership and the easiest of all is if you're 100% certain that your point is fair. The one thing I\u2019ve noticed John talked about valuations. Obviously, valuations have come down but the business is more challenged as well. We would weigh all that. And ultimately, the goal would be to get to full consolidation, whether that takes longer or -- and is not something we could do out of the box. So as I said, right now, we're pausing on all of it. Go ahead, Chase.\nChase Carey: I guess I\u2019d say in terms of the broadcast landscape and it probably to some degree, because our deals are multiyear deals and even now we're hearing the deals start in 2021. So we're not in discussions about deals for 2020 and again, our multiyear deals. The virus has actually not had a -- I mean, if it\u2019s a positive, but it's not really had a material impact on sort of the interest in the sport. I think it's in main events, continue to sort of have a unique value. I think we continue to see that varies by country. And generally you probably say the pay side of the world given its subscription base, it\u2019s slightly different than an ad supported service. So -- and obviously the paid for sports services that navigate through not having sports, but I think if they come back, it probably reinforces the importance of those events on the sports platforms. But I would actually say in the broadcast world, and again, probably just the nature of the long-term agreements, it hasn't been -- had a significant impact on the discussions we would have been having pre-COVID. I think everybody has some anxieties about what the short-term looks like. But again, I think degree of confidence -- all the increased discussions about being at home and what you do at home, obviously, watching things on the screen kind of more important than ever.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Russo from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nBrian Russo: This one's about SiriusXM. Greg, in one of your past Analyst Days, I think you made a case that TV and film business has challenges, because certain technology companies have entered the space and they're spending more on content, because they have alternative ways to monetize or they're not valued on near-term profits. Seems like a similar case to be made for like spoken word content in the audio space. And I'd love to get your view on why this may or may not be a good analogy, and what the implications could be for Sirius\u2019 content costs? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: I think it's an imperfect analogy. There are certainly elements that might be worth considering. You've seen the case where Spotify has gotten enormous benefit from the perceived moves they -- not the perceived moves but the value of the perceived moves. The perceived value rather than move they make in podcast. I guess, I'd note that, there's certain base level that is music that all players have. There's a certain amount of differentiated content. And if you look at the amount of differentiated content that Sirius [4D] has, it pretty much exceeds most, whether it being sports, from ESPN to things like Formula One, or whether it\u2019d be the fact that you can listen to the NFL and MLB. You can listen to business, CNBC, you\u2019ve get comedy. I would say there's already a breadth of differentiated content in SiriusXM, which is one of the reasons we've been able to charge a premium and continue to have growth and very low churn, enviable churn against those other services and position ourselves very well. Our view is, I think Jim Myers eloquently stated and I totally agree is podcasting is going to be an interesting part of the business. Ultimately, it will have some percentage of the listening it will still be fairly low. It's going to be important but it'll be a fairly low percentage. And we are in the early innings of that which is drawn to podcast. There are certainly some of the people that have been signed to exclusives that are -- have an audience but there is so much content that's high value content there hasn't yet come on to podcast that we believe will come on to podcast. And a lot of it'll be based on helping those people get on to the podcast, which is one of the reasons we went out and did Stitcher and did Simplecast. So we think the value is there in podcasting. I think the market may have overreacted in a positive fashion to the moves that others have made in podcasting, but we'll see. I don't think this is like the complete world of video where you're going to have guys with other -- don't have playing in a big way, people with other outside monetization schemes have not entered in force, because they can sell some other kind of service or product and monetize through podcast. That's not what Spotify is trying to do and that's not where the world has been. So far, it's been a much less differentiated business and we already have a lot of unique content, so we'll see.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Tinker from Gabelli and Company. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nJohn Tinker: Switching gears to baseball. Could you just discuss given that some of the -- you have some rent deferrals. What the attendance has been like at the stores and the restaurants in the Battery Park? And secondly, given you wonderfully on time and on schedule on the build out and the scene means you will be sitting in a large tower watching your star game next year. You sold some, I think the rental apartments. How do you sort of see the property as part of your portfolio?\nGreg Maffei: I'll answer the second part and let Brian speak to the first about where we're at the Battery. Look, I think we try and make a decision about uses of the capital and how it gets valued. And depending on where we stand, we might or might not and then kind of valuation we would get, we might or might not try and liquidate some of the Battery portfolio. Given what's going on in real estate, both office potential and retail potential, I'm not sure that is likely in the near-term. We do get a fully lease up office space, maybe that will be different. And we are obviously not in a downtown urban corridor, which seems to be the most challenged or where people have questions about the future. We may actually be a beneficiary at some de-densification. We'll see. So I think we'll look and see what kind of lease up we get, what kind of valuation we get and make a decision on what are alternative use of the capital. Brian, could you address where we are in some of the runs?\nBrian Wendling: So with the Battery, as Georgia started to open up, the Battery started to open up. They started with take out at a limited number of venues. They\u2019re almost fully open now. There's in person dining, it\u2019s quite a few of the venues. They're following various safety protocols to make sure their patrons are safe and everything's clean. The Omni is booking up fairly well, especially those corner rooms that can see into the park, as you might expect and the Aloft just opened recently. So everything's going pretty well at the Battery.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nJason Bazinet: I just had a question for Mr. Carey. In general, investors like you as a manager and they like the Formula One asset and they like what you're doing with the asset. You said since inception that you're very focused on the long-term. You're making decisions on long-term value creation, not short-term. And the debate that's emerged is sort of room the summation of all the decisions that you've been made, and sort of manifest themselves and something that's sort of obvious to the buy side in terms of better EBITDA number make everything better. My question is based on everything that you know and based on that sort of potential reschedule you saw in 2021. Do you think 2021 could be the year, or as you sort of add up all the puts and takes and decisions, because it feel more like a 2022 or 2023 sort of story? Thank you.\nChase Carey: Look, I mean, I\u2019ve seen in reality if you go back at the beginning of this year we said, I mean I\u2019ll go all the way back, because I feel we were actually -- never exactly where you planned but we were on pretty much the track we had laid out three years ago and we talked about '17 and '18 being foundation building. I mean, I know we tried to be clear that was, again, it could take a couple of years. I mean we\u2019ve been clear what we stepped into and what we had to do and what we had to put in place. I know the market always thinks you build the foundation in three months, but \u201817 and \u201818, we're really building the long-term foundation. I think we had a real step forward, it\u2019s just first step in '19 and we have been clear. We fixed that in 2020 to be another significant step forward in 2021 to continue to be a further step forward. So, we were very much I think on a trajectory to moving, and again, it wasn't meant to be in 12 months, but moving to delivering the type of growth, it got us to a place and you\u2019re never done, so it's not like we're done in 2023 or something. I think, clearly, we've got initiative like new cars in 2022 and other initiatives, we've started with countries that -- to grow the sport in that are five to 10 years. I mean China and the U.S. are clearly not pay offs that happen in two or three years. But we were -- I think we felt -- and beginning of this year, we were on a good track and we\u2019ve got a pretty predictable business model. So ex the virus, we were very much moving to deliver the type of growth, long term growth that we had talked about. Obviously, the virus turned it all on its head. We, at this point, we're planning on a 2021 that is probably not quite but pretty close to the 2021, we would have planned. Planning anything in the virus era is obviously got complexities, because we don't know what are going to be the issue in terms of limitations of fan attendance and things. We do believe the world again has to start to function in the ways we know the world. And so we do believe 2021 can be pretty close to back to the -- on the curve or on the slope we had planned for the business. But again, none of us have the visibility we'd like through the virus. So, I guess excluding unexpected continuing encumbrances from the pandemic, we expect in 2021 and 2022 to be largely back on the curve we would have been on for sitting at the beginning of this year with '19 being a year of growth and '20 being a significant -- further year of growth.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Zack Silver from B. Riley. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nZack Silver: Two on Formula One, the first is if you could talk about how F1 TV Pro fits into some of the more recent broadcast renewals. And also whether you see that as an opportunity for some of the Pay TV partners to be more of a meaningful distribution partner for that DTC service. And the second is just on the fly rate of races that began a little later on, they're obviously more demanding from a logistics perspective. If there are any snags, would you be able to pivot back to some of the circuits closer to home, do anything contractually that precludes you from doing that?\nChase Carey: First and the latter no, that's not. So if we -- which is again, we haven't announced the last handful of races and we're creating options on all fronts. I mean there's probably some limitation on how late if something came up and we got canceled a week before the race that maybe more problematic to pivot on that. But if we've got adequate time then we certainly building in contingencies in all directions, so in latter. In terms of F1 TV Pro, again, it varies by market. Actually. I'd say right now -- I mean, it can be even most important thing for F1 TV Pro and beyond getting it quality wise. We did have glitch the very first race but it's worked well since then, and I think we feel we're continuing to get there with the product, it is the growth access to consumers. So in a number of places, we are pursuing it more as a partnership and trying to develop ways to have it be something to enhance the experience for a traditional television partners\u2019 customer with a product that is geared towards a true enthusiast. And so, it's that extra experience and work with our partners to have that be something that we can both grow -- both share the success of and benefit from. So certainly, we'd have more discussions on that front. There are places it operates more countries we certainly continue to operate it more as a standalone alternative for the traditional television. But in many ways in the short-term, I think the path that I think probably, the best short and long-term opportunities for us is if we can develop it in the right way and the right structure with our partners, as an extra dimension, and then it gives us the optionality as we go forward long-term to how does it fix -- how does it fit into a world that obviously is continuing to evolve, certainly, the digital side of our world, in many ways, in a positive way continues to explode the viewership and the engagement we've got, the products we're putting out there. There seems to be no end to the appetite for -- and we just are looking to continue to find ways to enhance and expand that. So that whole -- all those opportunities in that field, I think are becoming an increasingly important part of the sport. And it's obvious for -- in all aspects of the content world but it really is becoming, in many ways how do you talk about reach, it really is becoming reach and engagement you know with fan.\nOperator: Our last question today comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: So one quick one on sales for you. With the Stitcher acquisition, I mean you started to be seriously have been anchored more to the used car market and the conversion rates have been linked that. But with the Stitcher acquisition, you now have a brand potentially that can allow Sirius to be coupled to extent from the auto market. That has really opened up opportunities outside the U.S. to a greater extent than has been possible, and has Stitcher potentially an independent brand that can be used in that respect? Thanks.\nChase Carey: I think, we have been expanding in ways outside the car obviously for a while, look at the Pandora acquisition. But to your point about being outside the car and outside the U.S. is certainly true with the acquisitions we've made. How much about content will go outside the U.S.? How much is a play recognizing question? In general, the U.S. market, given the ARPUs, is a more attractive markets to operate in. So we're cautious about proceeding. We see the benefits of sale outside the U.S. But in general, those markets are in the less attractive markets than the market we're in, partly because of the ARPUs as I mentioned and partly because some of the protections are on the DMCA. So I think we'll approach that cautiously. One of the things I would note is our OEM auto partners in perversity would love to see us be more global, because they would love to see its bundled across all markets when they build cars, they are global players. So, we will tip toe outside the United States. We do have some obviously in Canada and Mexico already. Historically, Pandora was in some of those markets, English speaking markets outside the U.S., but we will be cautious in doing that, I would say.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you.\nChase Carey: I think that's our last question for the morning. Thank you very much all for joining. Thank you for your continued interest in Liberty, and we look forward to speaking with you again. And getting a chance to have you participate in the Investor Day, if so, remotely. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chase Carey",
            "content": "Okay, thank you, Brian. And I guess I'll keep going and wait for Greg to return at some point. We were thrilled to return to racing with the launch of our 2020 season in Austria, the first weekend in July. It was an exciting race that saw a lot of competition in the midfield with an action packed last few laps that are Lando Norris's first podium finish. In the five races so far, we've seen Lewis Hamilton fighting for his 7th World Championship. The continued strength and ingenuity of Red Bull, the struggles of Ferrari, the emergence of McLaren and Racing Point as serious contenders. Our data through the first four races of the season have produced solid viewership growth across the race weekend, especially in key markets like China and there's tremendous growth on our digital platforms measured in video views, social media interactions and traffic across the Web sites and app. The drama in the Paddock built this summer as a number of driver changes were announced for 2021. Ferrari decided not to renew four time World Champion, Sebastian Vettel, and instead signed Carlos Sainz. His open seat at McLaren went to Danny Ricardo, which will make for a strong and entertaining pairing with Lando Norris. Renault decided to fill their vacancy with former Champion, Fernando Alonso. And Valtteri Bottas resigned with Mercedes for 2021. There's continued speculation around Sebastian Vettel, so more to come. Just prior to the start of this season, we launched our, we race as one initiative, to tackle the major issues that we as a sport and a society are facing. We used our restart to show that we stand united against racism and are doing more to address inequality and diversity in Formula One, while also taking a moment to thank people around the world for the fortitude they've shown against the global COVID-19 pandemic. We will be establishing a task force to listen and identify the right initiatives required to increase diversity and inclusion across Formula One, specifically focused on identifying employment and education opportunities and the required actions to affect change. We're in the process of creating a foundation that primarily finance internships and apprenticeships within Formula One for underrepresenting groups. These efforts build on ambitious sustainability, diversity and inclusion strategy set out in November 2019, which set goals of having a net zero carbon footprint by 2030 and ensuring all of our events are sustainable by 2025. Getting back to racing, there's been no easy feat I'd like to thank the FIA, our employees, the teams and drivers, our promoter partners and local authorities. Together, we developed an extensive code of conduct and testing protocols that are being closely followed and have been working well. Our priority has always been to safely transport everyone and to enable those individuals to operate in a safe and secure manner. We've been publishing our testing results each week as we believe it's good to provide this transparency. At Silverstone, we saw firsthand how our safety procedures are robust and effective. Sadly, Sergio Perez tested positive for the virus but our trace and test procedure handled the situation safely and with efficiency with no impact on the race weekend for the wider sport. It shows how far we've come into Australia and it's a testament to the diligent way that we've returned to racing. We have now announced 13 races in the revised calendar and expect to get to between 15 and 18 races in 2020. The newly added three races bring exciting circuits that were not part of the original 2020 calendar. Portimao in Portugal will be a completely new circuit, while we welcome back Imola and Nurburgring that have hosted World Championships in the past. Unfortunately, due to the fluid nature of the ongoing pandemic it will not be possible for us to race the Americas this season, but we'll look forward to being back in 2021. We expect to release the final details of the 2020 calendar in the coming weeks. While we've been extremely focused on 2020 season, we continue to progress the business for the long-term. We reached a long term exclusive rights agreement with Sky Deutschland beginning in 2021. Sky Deutschland will provide fans in Germany with full coverage of every Grand Prix and include Germany's first 24x7 channel dedicated to Formula One. We also announced agreements in Austria with Servus TV and ORF and in Russia with Match TV. We're in the process of finalizing the last couple of TV deals for 2021. We've also continued to strengthen and expand our commercial partnerships. We believe our planned raise calendar of 15 to 18 races will be able to satisfy the vast majority of our contracted sponsorship revenue in 2020. To name a few recent updates Liqui Molly, the globally renowned vehicle care products experts, upgraded to an official sponsor for the next three years. Adapting to the new reality, we partnered with Zoom to deliver the first ever Virtual Paddock Club experience. Beginning with the race in Hungary, guests are treated to a range of experiences and we're working to expand this offering to our global partners and F1 teams. Furthering the fan outreach, we announced a new podcast series, The Spotify. Paddock passes hosted by Will Buxton and in these exclusive episodes, he will speak to drivers, team principles and legends of the sport. On the video front and following on the strong results of the first two seasons of the Netflix show, Drive to Survive, the film crews are already at work filming the third season. We're also partnered with YouTube to live stream the Eifel Grand Prix in Nurburgring, Germany. This is the first time fans from select European countries will be able to view the entire Grand Prix weekend for free on the Formula One YouTube channel. Before I return to the track, we took the opportunity to revisit the cost cap of $175 million announced last October. The new cost cap of $145 million will be introduced in 2021 and we'll further reduce to $140 million in 2022 and $135 million in 2023. This will advance the objective to improve the competition and action on the track and at the same time, make the sport a healthier and more attractive business for all. With our return to racing and the revised cost cap, we've moved to finalize discussions around the Concorde Agreement. We've had productive conversations with all constituents and we look forward to completing this agreement in the near future and solidifying the sport for the longer term. We've also been focused on the corporate operations of Formula One. During the second quarter, we furloughed over 50% of our workforce, but we're pleased to bring back the majority of our employees with our return to racing. We also focused on our balance sheet and announced an amendment to our debt covenants, which provides flexibility until March 31, 2022. These actions along with diligent approach to our spending will enable us to weather this difficult time. Given all the challenges in 2020, we're proud of what we've been able to accomplish and expect to accomplish. We've been in regular contact with the majority of our commercial partners to discuss the reduced race calendar and the expectations that many of our races will not have fans. Clearly, this is going to impact our revenue in multiple areas but it's still dependent on how the remainder of the year unfolds. We appreciate and value our long-term partners and we expect to resolve any contractual issues in a fair and straightforward manner. We're confident in our plans for 2020, and look forward to 2021 when we think we can return to our prior expectations for Formula One. Now I'll turn the call back to Greg. Let me answer the second part first, because it sort of sets up the first part. We are planning a 2021 season that looks pretty much like what we would have expected if it to look like the beginning of this year. And obviously, we qualify that with -- we don't have any better visibility than anybody else what this virus is going to look like as we go forward. I do think one has to realize, I think we're about five months into the virus and our season in March would be still seven months away. So, there's a long time and conversations on vaccines, and treatments, and testing and the like, will obviously continue to evolve. We also obviously raised in 22 countries, so we deal with a much bigger mixed bag of issues throughout this. But we are planning on 2021 that looks like we would expect it, which probably will be a '22 race calendar, a calendar that probably starts and finishes about when our calendar has. We may make it, so there's a little more space in the front end of it and the calendar, and second half is a little busier. So we've got a little more flexibility built into it but I think that's probably a tweak to it not a real restructuring. Clearly, as this goes along we'll know more and there's always the possibility we make some adjustments as we go forward. But at this point, we're planning races that love fans, we've been in touch with most of our events, again, nobody has visibility to this. We'll obviously have a lot of sports ahead of us. What will the NBA, the NHL do as they get to next season, and one of the soccer leagues, football leagues in Europe do, as their seasons get going. So I think we do have the benefit of a lot of things that will be in front of us as templates around the world. I think as it relates to the sponsorship side, I think things went pretty quiet just in the early stage. As I said the first month or two of the virus period. I think that people adjusted to working from home and engaging in a different way. I mean, obviously virtually and connecting and the like. We actually feel pretty good about the traction in the last few months. We're actually in a pretty good place in terms of renewals. So I think the sponsorship is a place we clearly believe there's real room to grow. I think we were talking before the virus hit about the head we were making, we acknowledged we probably weren't as far along in the growth as we expected but still felt as strong as ever about the growth opportunities for us the interest is good. So we continue to expect growth and we again, our foundation is in pretty good place. The renewal we have, we're having -- we're in advanced discussions that are very positive and the interest from new parties is strong. So as much as everything is fluid, we feel pretty good about continuing to get to where we think we should be in the sponsorship world and the opportunity we have in front of us. I think largely in terms of payments received from parties, not in all cases but I'd say the majority of our cases, we're aligning payments more with the races. So payments which would have been scheduled throughout the race season that would have started in March, obviously, the race season starting in July, it's a different start and a different pace to it. So not in all cases but I think in the majority of it we've moved those payments to be more aligned with the races. So definitely that will impact -- but certainly the impact if we didn't get through our targeted races from people who've paid us for that, for those races would be limited just because of -- again, how we're sort of looking for payments to commit more against the races as are actually occurring. And I think in terms of working capital and I'd say I don't really probably get that granular on trying to, because if we got so many moving parts, they probably use some working capital evolve. First and second quarter, we did much in the way of operations. So they they'll -- it probably limits to the amount of working capital that's -- we're generating when we're not operating the business in the third and fourth quarter, we'll obviously operating the business, which will create working capital. I mean clearly, there's an impact on our revenue start working capital it's not, we would be in a normal year just because as a result that would be in a normal year. But there will be -- but I don't actually, with all those moving parts if we got to liquidate our balance sheet sort of not -- it's not probably one of the things I forecast, or particularly kind of we manage our payments and receipts and focus more on that, and working capital, which would be probably reasonably ordinary course for reduced level of operations. So in terms of race promotion, certainly in discussions to date, which obviously therefore are beyond this year, they are not 2020. We certainly have races inserted as one offs. Some of them I mentioned in the early comments, at Portugal and Imola. But on the longer term traditional type arrangements, we've actually got our calendar pretty well set forth. We haven't announced 2021 just because of the focus on 2020 but we're pretty -- we're close to sort of finalizing 2021. We've got a couple agreements to complete where we sort at the business terms agreed, we've got to pay for it. There's been no impact on that and obviously, those in discussions that would have began well before the virus and it's certainly not have had any negative impact. And I think in some ways, it is -- the importance of getting back to the world as we know it and re-energizing, it actually seems to be a bigger topic, the positive you're talking about as opposed to the negative. In the short-term, everybody still wrestles with how long is the virus going to last. But I think there is a broad based assumption that the world has to continue to recover and businesses have to -- everything has to start to operate and in some ways, there's a pent up demand for this. And obviously, an importance we have of places that want to attract people and the like, the types of cities we're in that obviously are very -- with tourism and their general business is important and exposure to the global -- to the world is important, probably makes our platforms more important. But the conversation and interest is not, I think any negative given our calendar for 2021. The conversations we have right now are probably early stage, because they're not for next year. If we've got next year, as I said, they're pretty much done and we're just finishing the agreements for it. So we're not pushing 2022 and beyond but there are still parties that we've talk to but again, is not in any way -- their interest hasn't diminished. We're not into those sort of agreements. We're not really into business terms. And we're talking of race that's two or three years away, because it's early stage. So you're really talking more about the opportunity and what's you can do with it and things around it, so it's not the detailed substance. The agreements we have this year, I mean it's especially a unique year. I mean, they're all over the place. I mean you have obviously -- we don't -- we're not going to have -- we don't expect the first race, we think just potential for a very small number of fans, it's probably not much yellow, but -- and probably increasing. Not still on races. And on the latter part of the schedule, there certainly we hope that fans as many as possible. In some places, the governments want to get a little closer to the date to determine what the situation is, our deals, our agreements, vary all over in some degree depend, are these long term partners are one-off partners. So, there are a lot of moving parts, some of them do have variables in it. But again, it defers in each place, which is always the case with our agreements. I guess I'd say in terms of the broadcast landscape and it probably to some degree, because our deals are multiyear deals and even now we're hearing the deals start in 2021. So we're not in discussions about deals for 2020 and again, our multiyear deals. The virus has actually not had a -- I mean, if it's a positive, but it's not really had a material impact on sort of the interest in the sport. I think it's in main events, continue to sort of have a unique value. I think we continue to see that varies by country. And generally you probably say the pay side of the world given its subscription base, it's slightly different than an ad supported service. So -- and obviously the paid for sports services that navigate through not having sports, but I think if they come back, it probably reinforces the importance of those events on the sports platforms. But I would actually say in the broadcast world, and again, probably just the nature of the long-term agreements, it hasn't been -- had a significant impact on the discussions we would have been having pre-COVID. I think everybody has some anxieties about what the short-term looks like. But again, I think degree of confidence -- all the increased discussions about being at home and what you do at home, obviously, watching things on the screen kind of more important than ever. Look, I mean, I've seen in reality if you go back at the beginning of this year we said, I mean I'll go all the way back, because I feel we were actually -- never exactly where you planned but we were on pretty much the track we had laid out three years ago and we talked about '17 and '18 being foundation building. I mean, I know we tried to be clear that was, again, it could take a couple of years. I mean we've been clear what we stepped into and what we had to do and what we had to put in place. I know the market always thinks you build the foundation in three months, but \u201817 and \u201818, we're really building the long-term foundation. I think we had a real step forward, it's just first step in '19 and we have been clear. We fixed that in 2020 to be another significant step forward in 2021 to continue to be a further step forward. So, we were very much I think on a trajectory to moving, and again, it wasn't meant to be in 12 months, but moving to delivering the type of growth, it got us to a place and you're never done, so it's not like we're done in 2023 or something. I think, clearly, we've got initiative like new cars in 2022 and other initiatives, we've started with countries that -- to grow the sport in that are five to 10 years. I mean China and the U.S. are clearly not pay offs that happen in two or three years. But we were -- I think we felt -- and beginning of this year, we were on a good track and we've got a pretty predictable business model. So ex the virus, we were very much moving to deliver the type of growth, long term growth that we had talked about. Obviously, the virus turned it all on its head. We, at this point, we're planning on a 2021 that is probably not quite but pretty close to the 2021, we would have planned. Planning anything in the virus era is obviously got complexities, because we don't know what are going to be the issue in terms of limitations of fan attendance and things. We do believe the world again has to start to function in the ways we know the world. And so we do believe 2021 can be pretty close to back to the -- on the curve or on the slope we had planned for the business. But again, none of us have the visibility we'd like through the virus. So, I guess excluding unexpected continuing encumbrances from the pandemic, we expect in 2021 and 2022 to be largely back on the curve we would have been on for sitting at the beginning of this year with '19 being a year of growth and '20 being a significant -- further year of growth. First and the latter no, that's not. So if we -- which is again, we haven't announced the last handful of races and we're creating options on all fronts. I mean there's probably some limitation on how late if something came up and we got canceled a week before the race that maybe more problematic to pivot on that. But if we've got adequate time then we certainly building in contingencies in all directions, so in latter. In terms of F1 TV Pro, again, it varies by market. Actually. I'd say right now -- I mean, it can be even most important thing for F1 TV Pro and beyond getting it quality wise. We did have glitch the very first race but it's worked well since then, and I think we feel we're continuing to get there with the product, it is the growth access to consumers. So in a number of places, we are pursuing it more as a partnership and trying to develop ways to have it be something to enhance the experience for a traditional television partners' customer with a product that is geared towards a true enthusiast. And so, it's that extra experience and work with our partners to have that be something that we can both grow -- both share the success of and benefit from. So certainly, we'd have more discussions on that front. There are places it operates more countries we certainly continue to operate it more as a standalone alternative for the traditional television. But in many ways in the short-term, I think the path that I think probably, the best short and long-term opportunities for us is if we can develop it in the right way and the right structure with our partners, as an extra dimension, and then it gives us the optionality as we go forward long-term to how does it fix -- how does it fit into a world that obviously is continuing to evolve, certainly, the digital side of our world, in many ways, in a positive way continues to explode the viewership and the engagement we've got, the products we're putting out there. There seems to be no end to the appetite for -- and we just are looking to continue to find ways to enhance and expand that. So that whole -- all those opportunities in that field, I think are becoming an increasingly important part of the sport. And it's obvious for -- in all aspects of the content world but it really is becoming, in many ways how do you talk about reach, it really is becoming reach and engagement you know with fan. I think, we have been expanding in ways outside the car obviously for a while, look at the Pandora acquisition. But to your point about being outside the car and outside the U.S. is certainly true with the acquisitions we've made. How much about content will go outside the U.S.? How much is a play recognizing question? In general, the U.S. market, given the ARPUs, is a more attractive markets to operate in. So we're cautious about proceeding. We see the benefits of sale outside the U.S. But in general, those markets are in the less attractive markets than the market we're in, partly because of the ARPUs as I mentioned and partly because some of the protections are on the DMCA. So I think we'll approach that cautiously. One of the things I would note is our OEM auto partners in perversity would love to see us be more global, because they would love to see its bundled across all markets when they build cars, they are global players. So, we will tip toe outside the United States. We do have some obviously in Canada and Mexico already. Historically, Pandora was in some of those markets, English speaking markets outside the U.S., but we will be cautious in doing that, I would say. I think that's our last question for the morning. Thank you very much all for joining. Thank you for your continued interest in Liberty, and we look forward to speaking with you again. And getting a chance to have you participate in the Investor Day, if so, remotely. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Greg Maffei",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you, Courtnee. Today speaking on the call we will also have Formula One's Chairman and CEO, Chase Carey and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Chief Principal Officer, Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. First, I hope you all are healthy and safe and have been enjoying your summer given these challenging circumstances. Second, I'd like to again thank our management teams and employees that have done such an impressive job managing through this COVID-19 crisis. So first looking at Liberty SiriusXM. We completed the previously announced rights offering, it was fully subscribed, generated proceeds of $754 million and we used that money to fully repay the intergroup loan that Liberty SiriusXM had to the Formula One Group. During that period, we paused our share repurchases as we were prohibited from being in market during the rights offering. We are certainly aware that if this panic remains and we have ample liquidity at LSXM and expect to take full advantage of the discount opportunity. Our ownership at SiriusXM now sands as of July 28th at 72.9%. SIRI also paused it's buybacks in Q2 due to market conditions and the depths of the COVID crisis, but recently extended their authorization by $2 billion. We remain very focused on getting to 80% as SIRI. Looking at Sirius itself, like our other subscription businesses, Sirius has proved resilient during the crisis. Sub pay net adds, subscriber adds were 254,000 and turn was down 1.6%. During the quarter, we generated over $0.5 billion of free cash flow. We also announced the deal to acquire Stitcher, creating a full service platform for podcast creators, publishers and advertisers and also announced a smaller deal Simplecast with podcast management and analytics platform services. SiriusXM continues to provide innovative programming and launching new apps, including the Beastie Boys, Bob Marley, Coldplay, Queen, you know how much I enjoy Freddie Mercury and the comedian Jim Gaffigan. With strength and visibility in the business, we offered new 2020 guidance at SiriusXM. Turning briefly in the Formula One Group, and you've hear more from Chase in a moment. We returned to racing at beginning in July and we now completed five races, and are still targeting a 15 to 18 race season and we continue to move the business forward. We have a new lower cost capital build effect in 2021, we have new broadcasting and sponsorship deals. The teams and all of our partners have been doing a tremendous job of returning to the track. Yesterday, we had an exciting race in Silverstone where Red Bull and Max Verstappen had a great strategy that they execute on very well upon to win, so it's exciting racing. Turning to Live Nation, their top priority in the recent months has been strengthening the financial position announced an amendment to the credit agreement, which suspends their leverage covenant till the end of 2021 and provides increased flexibility. They recently reported results last week, still bullish on the future of live events even with the near-term of ticket is turbulent rather. They've already sold 19 million tickets over 4,000 concerts and festivals, which are scheduled for 2021. Management expects live events can return to scale in the summer of 2021. In a positive note, 86% of fans opted to keep their ticket for rescheduled shows even if they're offered refunds. Two-thirds of their fans keeping tickets for canceled festivals so they can go to next year's show. Virtual concerts are generating big demand with fans over 67 million fans used 18,000 virtual concerts globally in the second quarter. We had over 150 performances for a virtual Lollapalooza and we launched socially distanced shows in permitted locations, including New Zealand, France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Finland and select cities across the U.S. Now turning to Braves. Glad to see that Braves return to field and they're off to a strong start with 11, six records, including seven and two at home and they won all three series though its part. In series play, they are five in one, which is tied to the most such victories in the majors. And we're very sad our number one Mike Soroka end the season early with a torn Achilles and we do wish him a speedy recovery. But the Braves still have four former first round picks and starts and starting rotation with Max Fried, Sean Newcomb, Kyle Wright] and Touki Toussaint. Early in the year, Markakis opted out of the season but he since returned and he returned with a bang with a walk off homer last week in his debut. Thank you, Chase and thank you, Brian. Given the ongoing pandemic, we have decided that Liberty's Investor Day will be virtual and will happen over two days, because no one, as much as we love to, should have to be in the video call for that long. On Thursday, November 19th, we will cover Liberty Media and Liberty TripAdvisor and on Friday, November 20th, we'll include Qurate, GCI Liberty and Liberty Broadband. We'll run from 11.02 Eastern on both days. More details will be provided on our Web site, so please mark your calendars. As always, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and again, hope you all stay safe and healthy. And with that, operator, I'd love to open the floor for questions. And Ben, I'm happy to try and answer the other. We were blacked out for most of Q2 during the rights offering and we had our normal course blackouts prior to our earnings. The most of it is disclosed more details in the press release, so that I know we just dropped it on you but if you look in that, I think that's outlined. Yes, I'd like to just add on Chase's comments before I address, iHeart. I mean, obviously, one of the reasons we did the reattribution was to put bulletproof balance sheet in place at Formula One and that's uphold go I think we've done that. So I echo Chase's points, we're very much focused on getting through 2020 and set ourselves in place with no matter what happened in 2020 we're prepared to try and get back to normal course, which we'll reasonably comp down for 2021. Turning briefly to iHeart. There are some issues there that are worth thinking about for the long-term, which is Sirius a faster growing and iHeart, how much you want to consolidate that? How would you want to account for that? There are a lot of operating synergy potential there. But candidly given the opportunities we have at SiriusXM, we like iHeart but we don't feel any rush to do that. We've all noted the discount. We've all noted some of the things that SIRI wants to do about getting to AD. We've noted some of the things that SIRI wants to do about potentially in podcasts, those haven't been big and I don't expect they're going to be huge going forward. But the point being there are demands on the cash flow of SIRI and opportunity on the cash flow of SIRI that are interesting. And iHeart is a great management team, we like the business. But clearly, advertising is challenged in this environment and we want to watch and see what happens. I think you meant through Liberty Sirius or Sirius -- yes. I understand -- we've treated as one entity for that purpose. I'll go first, Chase. On iHeart, I think you point out that a minority stake would make some of the issues around synergies more difficult, but I don't necessarily think impossible in terms of how you share advertising sales, how you share digital build outs. They're clearly ways we could work together. They're probably ways we can work together even without an acquisition but they get easier to degree or common ownership and the easiest of all is if you're 100% certain that your point is fair. The one thing I've noticed John talked about valuations. Obviously, valuations have come down but the business is more challenged as well. We would weigh all that. And ultimately, the goal would be to get to full consolidation, whether that takes longer or -- and is not something we could do out of the box. So as I said, right now, we're pausing on all of it. Go ahead, Chase. I think it's an imperfect analogy. There are certainly elements that might be worth considering. You've seen the case where Spotify has gotten enormous benefit from the perceived moves they -- not the perceived moves but the value of the perceived moves. The perceived value rather than move they make in podcast. I guess, I'd note that, there's certain base level that is music that all players have. There's a certain amount of differentiated content. And if you look at the amount of differentiated content that Sirius [4D] has, it pretty much exceeds most, whether it being sports, from ESPN to things like Formula One, or whether it'd be the fact that you can listen to the NFL and MLB. You can listen to business, CNBC, you've get comedy. I would say there's already a breadth of differentiated content in SiriusXM, which is one of the reasons we've been able to charge a premium and continue to have growth and very low churn, enviable churn against those other services and position ourselves very well. Our view is, I think Jim Myers eloquently stated and I totally agree is podcasting is going to be an interesting part of the business. Ultimately, it will have some percentage of the listening it will still be fairly low. It's going to be important but it'll be a fairly low percentage. And we are in the early innings of that which is drawn to podcast. There are certainly some of the people that have been signed to exclusives that are -- have an audience but there is so much content that's high value content there hasn't yet come on to podcast that we believe will come on to podcast. And a lot of it'll be based on helping those people get on to the podcast, which is one of the reasons we went out and did Stitcher and did Simplecast. So we think the value is there in podcasting. I think the market may have overreacted in a positive fashion to the moves that others have made in podcasting, but we'll see. I don't think this is like the complete world of video where you're going to have guys with other -- don't have playing in a big way, people with other outside monetization schemes have not entered in force, because they can sell some other kind of service or product and monetize through podcast. That's not what Spotify is trying to do and that's not where the world has been. So far, it's been a much less differentiated business and we already have a lot of unique content, so we'll see. I'll answer the second part and let Brian speak to the first about where we're at the Battery. Look, I think we try and make a decision about uses of the capital and how it gets valued. And depending on where we stand, we might or might not and then kind of valuation we would get, we might or might not try and liquidate some of the Battery portfolio. Given what's going on in real estate, both office potential and retail potential, I'm not sure that is likely in the near-term. We do get a fully lease up office space, maybe that will be different. And we are obviously not in a downtown urban corridor, which seems to be the most challenged or where people have questions about the future. We may actually be a beneficiary at some de-densification. We'll see. So I think we'll look and see what kind of lease up we get, what kind of valuation we get and make a decision on what are alternative use of the capital. Brian, could you address where we are in some of the runs?"

            "content": "While we wait for Greg to return, I will continue on and then hand it over to Chase. Good morning, everyone. At the end of June, we amended the term loan and revolving credit facility at Formula One. The net leverage covenant will not apply until our first testing day for the quarter ending March 31, 2022, providing the business additional flexibility to operate during this uncertain time. Brave Holdings is expected to be out of compliance with certain debt covenants at the end of the quarter. We continue to work with the lenders to obtain waivers and covenant modifications. These discussions are going well and we're optimistic that we will have a favorable resolution by the end of the month. Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, restricted cash and liquid investments of $154 million, excluding $1.8 billion of cash and restricted cash all with SiriusXM. We have $870 million of undrawn margin on capacity at the parent level. The value of the SiriusXM common stock and Live Nation stock held at Liberty SiriusXM as of Friday's close was $22 billion, which excludes the value of the Live Nation call spread, which is held at Formula One Group valued at $210 million at quarter end. We have $2.1 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings.  Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principle amount of debt is $12.6 billion, which includes $9.4 billion of debt at Liberty SiriusXM. Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $1.4 billion, which excludes $324 million of cash at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.6 billion, which includes the $2.9 billion of debt held directly by Formula One, leaving $733 million at the corporate level. And lastly to the Braves, we had attributed cash, liquid investments and restricted cash of $329 million and attributed debt was $718 million. With that, I'll turn it over to Chase to talk more about Formula One. So with the Battery, as Georgia started to open up, the Battery started to open up. They started with take out at a limited number of venues. They're almost fully open now. There's in person dining, it's quite a few of the venues. They're following various safety protocols to make sure their patrons are safe and everything's clean. The Omni is booking up fairly well, especially those corner rooms that can see into the park, as you might expect and the Aloft just opened recently. So everything's going pretty well at the Battery."

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, today May 7. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Courtnee Chun Chief Portfolio Officer and Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nCourtnee Chun: Thank you. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties including those mentioned in our most recent forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call and Liberty Media expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is placed. On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media and SiriusXM Schedules one and two can be found at the end of the earnings press release issued today, which is available on our website. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you and good morning. Today speaking on the call, we will have Formula One's Chairman and CEO Chase Carey; and Liberty's Chief Accounting Officer, Brian Wendling. First let me say, I hope you all are healthy and safe. Second, I'd like to thank and salute our employees and management teams who have done an impressive job managing through this COVID crisis. Now on to Liberty Media. We completed the reattribution of our Live Nation stake and other assets and liabilities between the Formula One Group and Liberty SiriusXM on April 22. We've spoken to many of you since this announcement and obviously we had a conference call right after that. So, I won't go into detail, but I'd like to reiterate why this was a benefit to both equity shareholders. For the Formula One Group, first, creates a pure play; provided additional liquidity and reduced debt and for Liberty SiriusXM, acquiring Formula One Group's Live Nation interest with the complementary business with us at SiriusXM tracker at a compelling price resulting in ample liquidity. We are pleased with the stock market reaction since. All the stocks have outperformed the ads and fees since we made the announcement. Turning to Liberty SiriusXM, including the LSXM shares that we acquired as part of the reattribution, Liberty SiriusXM repurchased $98 million of stock from February 1 through April 30 and effectively bought the SiriusXM shares at a $3.73 look-through price over this period including the reattributed shares. Our ownership of SiriusXM as of April 24 stood at 72.2%. I'd note that we have stopped our repurchases prior the reattribution. But I expect, post close of the planned rights offering in early June, we will look to start repurchasing LSXM stock again. The nagging discount to NAV is an opportunity and one we will continue to take advantage of. As SiriusXM continue to repurchase stock and we approach 80% ownership of SiriusXM, I expect the opportunity may wane. Now looking at SiriusXM itself, it continues to operate very well during the COVID crisis. It has launched innovative new program including a 24/7 COVID-19-focused channel on Hotline, nine new limited run channels with iconic artists including the Prince Channel with music and exclusive content like a never-before-heard demo of a conceptual radio show Prince created for the SiriusXM channel back in 2005. Howard Stern has done great and innovative including a two-hour plus session with Tom Brady from Derek Jeter's House in Florida. The subscription-based business model we have at SiriusXM has proved resilient. Self-pay net adds grew 69,000 to nearly 34.8 million total subscribers. And the very strong liquidity and cash flow of SiriusXM has shown through. We still have $1.75 billion of available on our revolving credit facility which has not been drawn. Turning to Formula One Group. I'm sure you have all missed the Dubai F1 racing. Hopefully, you've gotten a little taste by watching or rewatching both seasons of Drive to Survive on Netflix. And we expect all of you watched the Virtual GP this past weekend. There was an epic battle between Alex Albon and Charles Leclerc. They passed and repassed each other several times with Albon finally taking the win. The final results highlighted the next-generation of F1 drivers, Albon, Russell and Leclerc exciting and going to be thrilling next for years to come. The F1 team has done a great job navigating the crisis and working on the 2020 calendar. They are planning an early July start in Austria and Chase will talk more about that. We continue to evaluate the needs of the business, but definitely want to be opportunistic and find synergistic assets that we can add. And we think we are well positioned to do so. Turning to Live Nation. It does not report until after the market today, so I obviously won't comment on results, but I want to say, we are pleased with the announced actions they have taken to build liquidity. And on to the Braves, we are working closely with Major League Baseball to see how we can put a season together. We appreciate how the commissioner teams and players are working together towards that solution. Everyone is eager to see baseball return. The Braves players are eager too. They've been doing Zoom sessions with the trainers', medical staff and manager Brian Snitker. They've also been in celebration of 25 years since the Braves' 1994 World Series title. The 95 players joined a Zoom reunion while watching the final Game six on FOX Sports Southeast. Fans were able to watch the Zoom live on YouTube as well. So with that I'm going to turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results.\nBrian Wendling: Thank you, Greg and good morning everyone. The earnings release has our cash and debt balances by tracker as of March 31. Since we completed the reattribution in April as Greg discussed and repaid the margin of the F1 revolver today, I'll walk through liquidity and debt of Libery SiriusXM and the Formula One Group as of March 31 on a pro forma basis for these two transactions. Liberty Media, SiriusXM, Formula One and the Braves are in compliance with all that covenants as of March 31. Given the uncertain impact of COVID-19, F1 and the Braves are monitoring their ability to comply with their debt covenants in future periods and we are in positive discussions with their respective lenders. On a pro forma basis, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, restricted cash and liquid investments of $139 million, excluding $52 million of cash and restricted cash held directly at SiriusXM. And we have $870 million of undrawn margin loan capacity at the corporate level. The value of the SiriusXM and Live Nation stock held at Liberty SiriusXM as of May 6 was $21 billion, which excludes the value of the Live Nation call spread held at Formula One Group which was valued at $165 million at the time of the reattribution and will be marked to market quarterly. We have $2.1 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM group debt is $11.1 billion, which includes $7.9 billion of debt at SiriusXM. This debt balance excludes the $750 million intergroup loan owed to the Formula One Group, which is expected to be repaid with proceeds from the rights offering which we intend to launch on May 18. Today, F1 will fully repay the balance under its revolving credit facility using cash on hand, restoring its full capacity of $500 million. Pro forma for this repayment, Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $1.4 billion at the corporate level. This excludes $536 million of cash held directly at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.6 billion, which includes $2.9 billion of debt at Formula One leaving $688 million at the parent level. F1's total net-debt-to-covenant-OIBDA ratio as defined in F1's credit facilities for covenant calculations was six times at the end of the quarter as compared to a maximum allowable leverage ratio of 8.25 times for both the term loan and the revolving credit facility. Please note these leverage ratios are for the Formula One operating business not the Formula One Group. The term loan financial covenant is in current space and not maintenance. We are having positive discussions with the RCF lenders under to temporarily move this covenant from an EBITDA based to a liquidity base. Payment of the RCF combined with the reattribution gives us more flexibility in renegotiating the maintenance covenant on the revolver. Lastly to the Braves. At quarter end the Braves group had attributed cash liquid investments and restricted cash of $343 million and attributed principal amount of debt of $698 million. With that, I'll turn it over to Chase to discuss Formula One.\nChase Carey: Thank you, Brian. We entered 2019 with great momentum and were ready for our biggest season yet with 22 races. We were ready to race at Australia, but it was necessary to cancel the event at the last minute for reasons related to COVID-19. This global pandemic has had a significant impact on Formula One and we're adjusting and responding in numerous ways that are in the best interests of our fans, employees, partners and constituents, while focusing on the Formula One business for the long term. Let's walk through all the actions we've taken. One of the first actions we took as a support was to move the team's summer break up to March and April as we wanted to have ultimate flexibility to race during the normal summer break in August. On Tuesday the 28th of March, the FIA's World Motor Sport Council approved a further extension of the shutdown period from 35 to 63 days to be taken during the months of March, April, May and/or June. During this break of the season, we were inspired to see several U.K.-based Formula One teams come together for Project Pitlane. This is part of a larger U.K. industry-wide focus to manufacture and deliver respiratory devices to support the national need. Formula One has the unique ability to rapidly respond to engineering and technological challenges and is focused on its core skills of rapid design, prototype manufacture test and skilled assembly. These efforts have proven fruitful and the go-ahead has been given for two of Project Pitlane's initiatives, including ventilators that are being produced by several teams, plus a breathing aid being manufactured by Mercedes. We're grateful for the team's efforts in supporting the national need. In further actions F1 the FIA and all 10 teams unanimously agreed to delay the introduction of the 2021 technical regulations until 2022 and to keep the majority of their existing 2020 cars into the 2021 season. This will reduce costs for all teams at this time, when they would usually be investing and working on the cars for the 2021 season. We have further been working with the FIA and teams to strengthen the long-term future of Formula One, with an array of new technical, sporting and financial regulations that will improve the competition and action on the track and make it a healthier business for all involved, particularly as we work through the issues created by COVID-19. One of the key areas of focus has been the cost cap on team expenses. We've previously implemented a cap of $175 million for 2021, but now expect to move forward with a significantly lower cap. Just like our teams Formula One has been evaluating our cost structure. We made some difficult decisions and furloughed over 50% of our workforce on April 1st, with senior executives taking a voluntary cut in pay. We froze all hiring and pay review plans and also deferred a number of initiatives we plan to pursue this year. We recognize we may lose a bit of time in implementing some of these plans. However, we felt the current uncertainties warranted the actions. As Brian mentioned, we're actively engaged with lenders of our revolving credit facility to address potential issues related to our quarterly leverage covenant. They've been very supportive as we work together to identify potential changes to the covenant to enable us to navigate through the possible scenarios, including the remote possibility of no racing in 2020, and we expect to agree to necessary changes in due course. We've been working tirelessly since Australia and we're actively engaged with our promoters in putting together a potential 2020 race calendar. We have two primary challenges. Identifying locations where we can hold the rice and determining how we transport all necessary parties and their equipment to that location for a race. We're in discussion with all of our promoters, as well as some tracks that are not currently on our 2020 calendar, to ensure we explore all options. Our goal is to launch the season on the weekend of July 4th and 5th in Austria. It is likely that we race the weekend of July 11th and 12th in Austria as well. We're in the advanced stages of putting together a schedule of additional European races through early September, including races during the traditional August break. We will then plan to race in Eurasia \u2013 in Asia and the Americas in September, October, and November before finishing in the Gulf in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December. We hope to have a calendar with 15 to 18 races. We expect the early part of the calendar to be races without fans, but we hope to be able to allow fans to attend in the latter part of the year. We are working with the FIA, local authorities and other experts to determine the steps and procedures necessary to safely transport everyone to each race location and to enable those individuals to operate and be housed in a safe and secure manner. We feel increasingly positive about the number of locations that would be able and want to hold the race this year. Our work in the travel and other logistical issues related to each country are a work in progress. The economics of races, particularly ones with fans will clearly vary from existing agreements and we're actively engaged on this front too. We've been working closely with the FIA with the consent of all the teams to change the calendar, without a formal vote amongst the teams and this was formally approved by the World Motor Sport Council and Formula One. This will allow for a stream process as we reshuffle the calendar and appreciate the team's support. With the postponement of the season, we are pleased that our teams quickly pivoted and launched a new Formula One Esports Virtual Grand Prix Series featuring a number of current Formula One drivers and celebrities. To date, Charles Leclerc, George Russell, Antonio Giovinazzi, Lando Norris, Alex Albon, Carlos Sainz Jr., Nicholas Latifi have all been on the grid along with former F1 drivers such as Jensen Button, Johnnie Abraham, and Nico H\u00fclkenberg. They've been joined by England's Cricket World Cup winner Ben Stokes; musician, Liam Payne; professional golfer, Ian Poulter; and six-time Olympic Gold Medalist, Sir Chris Hoy to name a few. These races have run in place of every postponed Grand Prix. The series utilizes the official Formula One 2019 PC video game developed by Codemasters and the visuals are impressive. The races have provided great racing and entertainment value with lively commentary. Charles Leclerc won his debut race after receiving the game just three weeks earlier. Then he won the next race as well and we're excited to see new rivalries emerge. The broadcast is available on the official Formula One YouTube, Twitch and Facebook channels as well as Marquee TV broadcasters such as Sky Sports in the U.K. and ESPN in the U.S., and we've experienced strong engagement. Through the first three races digital cumulative views reached 12.9 million, and total viewership including TV estimates reached 16.3 million. The Virtual Grand Prix even trended number one on YouTube U.K. We will continue with these virtual GPs until we return to racing. We were also pleased with the response to the second season of Drive to Survive, which debuted on Netflix at the end of February. The season provided unprecedented access to the teams and drivers. We saw the drama of the driver switch from Gasly to Albon mid-season at Red Bull behind the scenes action of the wet race in Germany and learned more about Williams' challenging season. We are in advanced discussions for season 3 and the team is ready to capture footage in 2020. In news that may have been overlooked due to COVID-19, we welcomed Aramco as a long-term global partner to Formula One. We announced this agreement on March 10 and Aramco as our sixth global partner alongside DHL, Emirates, Heineken, Pirelli and Rolex. We look forward to sharing our expertise to identify opportunities for the advancement of sustainable fuels, enhanced engine efficiencies and emerging mobility technology. This deal includes trackside branding at most races and title rights to three Grand Prixs in 2020 and exposure on our digital platforms. Further in this area, we welcome Bem Pincus as our new Director of Commercial Partnerships at the end of February. Ben joins us from Heineken, where he managed their worldwide sponsorship team and partnership with Formula One. On the distribution front, we announced a multiyear media rights deal extension in Canada with Bell Media's TSN and RDS, which goes through the end of the 2024 season. Our fan base continues to grow in Canada. The 2019 season audiences across TSN and RDS grew 19% year-over-year and coverage across the two networks reached nearly 5.3 million Canadian viewers. We've been in regular contact with our commercial partners, broadcasters, sponsors and other partners. These partners have almost all been very supportive. Our conversations with them regarding the 2020 season are not as advanced as those of promoters, as we need to determine our modified calendar to have more substantive conversations. A number of agreements have provisions related to the number of races, although, that number of races is well below our originally planned 22. These are all valued long-term partners, and we expect to resolve any potential contractual issues in a fair and straightforward manner. We had been in the final stages of completing the Concorde Agreement when the coronavirus crisis turned everything on its head. We decided to put the Concorde on the back burner for the short-term and prioritize addressing issues related to 2020 first. As we move forward with the 2020 calendar and finalize regulatory changes with the teams, we will once again return to completing the Concorde Agreement in the immediate future. Obviously, we are still dealing with a lot of uncertainty regarding the short-term and the coronavirus. We're increasingly confident although there are no guarantees that we will have a 2020 championship season. Fan support has been great and there seems to be an incredible pent-up enthusiasm for racing to begin. At the same time, we're also looking beyond this year to a 2021 season. The long-term contractual nature of Formula One helped provide long-term stability at a time of uncertainty. We continue discussions for potential new races or race renewals for 2021 and are going well. We also continue discussions with other new or existing commercial partners. We expect the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the broader world will extend into the future, but we feel we're well positioned to return to the growth curve we were on a few months ago and look forward to the better future for all of us. I recognize everyone would like revised projections for 2020. At this point, all we have are sensitivities with a range of potential results based on many variables. What is clear is that 2020 results will be significantly below original expectations, but we believe it is equally clear that we can manage through 2020 with or without racing and more importantly that our business can quickly return to our prior expectations in 2021 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Greg.\nGreg Maffei : Thank you, Chase and thank you Brian. And to the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and hope you all stay safe and healthy. And with that, operator, I'd like to open up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group.\nJeff Wlodarczak: Hi. Good morning guys. I had one for Greg and one for Chase. After -- you had a very strong result at Charter yet again and they're obviously aggressively -- continuing to aggressively retire the shares. I wanted to focus on your 25% ownership cap in Charter, which correct me if I'm wrong you're sort of bumping up against. When you hit that cap are you comfortable participating in Charter's share retirement, or do you feel like you can work with Charter management to potentially allow you to go over that cap? And then Chase, if you could provide more color broadly on racing without fans the effect on race promoter fees and sponsorship and advertising fees? And obviously, the race fees are going to decline materially, but are there benefits to racing on tracks to where the promoter fee is subsidized or paid by the government? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei : So I'll go first. Jeff, thanks for the question. First, there's -- since our holdings are really in two buckets, it's not clear that we're soon to be up against the cap. And it's not clear what the buckets are both how it's counted. Secondly, there is some time on that purchase until we come up against that. Third, we have had begun some discussions about how to adjust that, because it's not necessarily in the interest of the shareholders of Charter or Charter to have us selling. So we'll see how that goes. We are long-term holders of Charter. We like Charter. We certainly don't want to be in a position of being required to sell Charter stock.\nChase Carey: And I guess on my front, I think, clearly races without fans have a much more significant impact on the promoter side than the broadcasting and sponsorship side in many ways. I think racing without fans is first and foremost for the broadcast digital sponsorship side. The fans will all connect through various platforms and in many ways actually when you watch a race even at a live race. Many people watch it on television, television screens anyway. I think in terms of the rate of the promoter side, clearly, these are very different events without fans and that will be reflected. I mean, we've talked about these being week-long spectacles, multi-day events, the city involved, the track involved. Without fans at any of that, it's clearly a very different -- it's a very different opportunity. It's a very different event, and we recognize that. So, I think, these are unprecedented situations. And so I think with the promoters, there's a more significant change I think. With the broadcasters and sponsors, they do look at it as a season as a whole. As I said, there are contracts that have provisions tied to a number of races. It's below what we'd have. So, we have some room there. But we feel we can deliver a quality event for those. We think we can make a great event but live fans won't be there. And so again, the impact is going to be significant -- more significant on the promoter side.\nJeff Wlodarczak: Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to Bryan Goldberg with Bank of America.\nBryan Goldberg: Thanks. I had a couple for Chase. Just a follow-up on the promoter side of F1. I'm just curious given all the complexities involved for promoters either without fans or even when fans start to return, what are some of the measures that F1 could potentially undertake to work with promoters to ensure it's both a good spectacle a safe event? And do you expect any changes -- long-term changes to the race promoter revenue contract model as a result of this? And then secondly just on sponsorship I was wondering if you could give us some more color. I mean a lot of marketers have been in triage mode the last several weeks. But as the world starts to reopen in sports content it looks to be more in demand than ever. Just wondering if you could just update us or give us more color on the tone of the sponsorship market right now around events such as yours? Thanks.\nChase Carey: So, I mean first on the long-term impact, I mean whether it's promoters or sponsors we kind of look -- we're planning to be business as we planned it in 2021. So, that's our expectation. In terms of managing through these events, right now we expect the European events to largely be without fans. So, that's how we're planning it without fans. We're obviously dealing with different issues. We still have to deal with how do we get the teams there. How do we get the necessary personnel there and secure they're safe? We're working with the country host regulators. We're working with the appropriate authorities. We need testing procedures transportation and procedures. I actually had a fairly long conference call this morning with an array of parties putting that in place focusing first on Austria because it's the first race but talking through all our tentative European races. So, I think we feel we're making good headway on having races that can be secure and safe for everybody without fans which again is what we expect in Europe. I think as you get to events with fans that's probably -- we've probably made -- because it's a little further on the schedule we haven't made as much headway into some degree. It's tough to have those discussions because we can't -- you don't really get guidelines yet. I think this issue has so little visibility and it is so fluid. It's difficult to have discussions with authorities. I mean we can sort of start to work through what we think may be possible in terms of spacing and other ways to manage traffic flows if we had them. But you're really not going to -- if you're trying to talk to people about what you can do in September and October right now that's -- September, October, November, those are more difficult discussions because they're still -- they're trying to figure out what to do in June and July. So, I think the issues in terms of how we'd manage the fan part of it are probably ones we'll have in the -- as we get closer to that -- races where that would be a realistic possibility. But since they're not in the -- again they're not in sort of the July, August, I think we're planning races that are races without fans and making sure we can go forward with those. And to some degree nobody knows what the landscape is and you pick up -- you get different stories in different places. As you look at China today, they're opening up an array of places that have public gatherings. So, I think we'll this is a situation where in terms of dealing with larger crowds you clearly know more week-to-week as you go forward. And so it's very much managing up a real-time process. In terms of the sponsors they've been great. Look, I think in many ways sponsors we've been in touch with them all. Until we know what the calendar is, it's tough to have a substantive conversation about how do we modify their -- what races. They have title races that they all have components to their agreements. So, this is why we've sort of mostly been keeping them up to speed. Again, we could not feel better about the support we've got and the enthusiasm from them. I think in many ways like we're dealing with global companies but I think -- well clearly our big sponsors are -- they're not -- when you think first and foremost where is the real impact everybody talks about in the coronavirus? It's small business. Reality, we don't -- that's not our core sponsorship. Our relationship are big brands, entities that know they have a future and just looking to figure out how do they get back to business as it was. So, our sponsors are quite enthusiastic quite supportive. And again we look forward to advancing discussions with them as we know more about the specifics of our 2020 calendar.\nBryan Goldberg: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Kraft: Hi. I have two questions for Greg. I guess first is there a scenario where you consider an RMT of your Live Nation stake, particularly now that the value you have to make up to get to 50% pro forma ownership is smaller than it's been in a few years, or is that strategically critical to keep inside of the -- or underneath the Liberty Media umbrella? And then the second question is on Liberty Sirius. You mentioned that you suspect the NAV discount to narrow once you get to 80%. Is that because of tax consolidation or relative trading liquidity between the shares or that there might be a change in capital allocation at SiriusXM once you get to that 80% threshold?\nGreg Maffei: So, on the first one Brian, thank you for the questions. To do an RMT, our shareholders would need to end up with 51% ownership of the spun company. And I don't think we would use -- our priority right now for the capital we would use at LSXM is to capture the discount go after that. I don't think we would want to use that to RMT the stock. And I think over the long-term one of the reasons why we did this reattribution is we think it's strategic and there are things and ways that Live Nation and Sirius will be able to work together with the benefit of both. So, I don't think -- while an RMT is not you're right mathematically easier it's still a reach and would require to put up capital that we have other ideas for what we want to do with it. On why the 80%? Yes, I think you'll see a lot of potential for all of the things you mentioned to drive the factor including free flow of capital up to the LSXM will probably on the margin make us more willing to consider dividends and push for dividends at Sirius, particularly if the gap sits where it is today and you can look at the relative value of which stock is more attractive to purchase SXM or LSXM.\nBryan Kraft: Great. And maybe just one follow-up. Can you quantify what the tax rate would be on the dividends today, once the dividends received the exclusion that you're getting?\nGreg Maffei: Albert are you on the line?\nAlbert Rosenthaler: I am. So it's roughly 7% to 8%. So it's pretty low.\nGreg Maffei: I was going to say that, but I want to get the authority to verify. Thank you, Albert.\nBryan Kraft: You always want Albert to bless it.\nGreg Maffei: Yes. Albert blesses everything. Thank goodness.\nBryan Kraft: Thanks, Greg, thanks, Albert.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Vijay Jayant with Evercore.\nVijay Jayant: Thanks. So Chase couple of questions. So obviously, you're targeting to get a schedule for 2020, but is December 31 sort of the end of the race calendar, or could you move to January? I know the new season typically starts in March. So are we sort of looking at basically December 31 to try and meet all your requirements on contractual commitments also? And second, obviously there's been a lot more liquidity at Formula One, post the reattribution. And at the same time some of your teams, probably with no prize fund or working capital may be in trouble. Have you been approached on subsidizing these teams or sort of bankrolling them until the season starts? And is that something that Formula One would do?\nChase Carey: So on the first, I think we -- right now our current targeted plan has us finishing in December -- later in December than the original plan so sort of more like the 13th, 14th of December. But we are evaluating and will consider. So certainly finishing in January is an option. We could do that. We can do that. I think if we can, we'd like to finish in December. We'd obviously have to take a fairly long break through the holidays. You're not going to race in the holiday weeks. But it is an option available to us that we'd again have to work through with our promoters and work through an array of parties to get there. But it is something we've considered and talked about. But I'd say at this point our goal is again to finish a couple of weeks later than our original date, but to finish in sort of mid-December ahead of the holidays. I think in terms of the teams obviously as I said ,2020 for us and the teams is not going to be what we're not going to have the results, we're going to have when we started the year or expected to have when we started the year. And I think everybody is doing what they can to shore it up. And I talked about the cost-cutting initiatives, as we move forward and can solidify what we are doing. Right now there are too many moving parts. So we're not -- you got to -- there's so many what ifs. I don't think you can -- it's constructive to try to address parts of it. I think we need to get far enough along in these plans to know where we're at. We expect the teams to be taking the right initiatives to get them through it. I think all of us recognize many ways -- priority one in many ways is to -- when we get to 2021 is to have just more -- get back on the track it was on at the beginning of the year for 2021. And that's our goal and that's what we're committed to get to and certainly manage through this year as best as possible. What we need -- there's been speculation at this point on to what degree do we need to help support select teams. We care about the teams, but those are discussions we've not had to date. I think we'll see where things are as we go along. But I think there are too many moving parts right now to really engage with any specificity on that.\nVijay Jayant: Thank you.\nOperator: Now we'll take a question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Hi, good morning. Chase just continuing this discussion. Can you give us any sense for what the sponsorship revenues will look like this year with a 15 to 18 race calendar, at least relative to your original expectations? I assume it's lower, but I'm just wondering if there's any way to dimensionalize that. And on the race promotion, if you have races with fans later this year as you mentioned is your goal, would there be any impact on race promotion fees for Liberty? It would seem like that's pretty close to what we used to consider normal. And then I just wanted to ask Greg. Greg you made a comment on the call a couple of weeks ago about the cash at Liberty Formula One. I think you used the word potentially at the opco sort of benefits liquidity at the holdco and potentially the opco? I don't know if there's any restrictions on cash moving back and forth that we should be thinking about? Thanks.\nChase Carey: So on promotion, the promotion is probably more tied to sort of obligations whether it's signage time on screen titles. So -- and certainly we have excess -- we've said before we have excess capacity, material excess capacity at the 22 race level. We're raising it. Obviously, as the number of races goes down. it puts some pressure on that capacity. Clearly they're at the margins. There's some issues we've got to manage through whether it's without races their hospitality that won't exist at some. But I think at its core, we feel we can go a long way towards -- I think our plans are to go a long way towards meeting what our sponsors would want to be gaining through the sport this year. So I think we are working to achieve what we think would meet the expectations of our sponsors. But at the end of the day -- I mean these are relationships. And these are long-term relationships. Most of our sponsors are long-term. We'll sit down as partners and find a fair path forward. We want them to feel good about what we do. But equally, we have an obligation to deliver certain value. If we deliver it, we expect to receive fair value for it. But we will approach it as partners. I think as you get to promoters with fans, certainly that does get much closer to the business at norm. There are different cases. Is it a race that was going to be held in the spring and has moved to the fall? That obviously has implications in terms of selling tickets and the like. Right now probably most of our promoters even the ones on the schedule aren't really selling tickets given the uncertainties and probably nobody is buying a lot of tickets given the uncertainties. So it's not -- with everything that exists out there it's not sort of -- it's not business as usual. But I think to the degree we have races with fans. And I guess, you also get the question is it a race with fans as you know it, or is it race with fans with certain conditions around those fans? So I think all those things we have to engage on. But I think the way again we approach 2020 is, we -- yes we have agreements in place, but these are long-term partners. We expect the great -- indeed they've all been very supportive. We want to be fair in addressing this. We want to get fair value, but be fair to them. And first and foremost, make sure in 2021, we've got the business in 2020 looking like we expected it to look four months ago and have the same future we expected to have four months ago. And really what we're managing through is a short one-time event for us. We think the strength in this support, the interest and the support the support -- the support and the interest we've got, whether it's from fans or partners, can enable us to get back there. I think there won't be some lasting impacts, but I think the strength of events like ours, I think, fans will come back. I think events like ours will continue to rise in strength. And, I think, the type of partners we have seem to be more supportive than ever, even if you have a degree of a shakeout in the economy. So, we will certainly expect to get fair value this year. But, again, we're not going to play hardball. We're going to deal with things as partners, but with a priority to making sure, so in kind of giveaways, whether it's the teams or promoters or sponsors, we're not going to be handing out candy to everybody. We're going to be expected to be treated fairly. But we're going to deal with it as adults and with the expectation that 2021 is going to, again, look like the business we all knew four months ago.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Greg, anything on that language?\nGreg Maffei: I'm not sure what language your -- just about the up and down, sorry. Because [Indiscernible] language part. There are no restrictions on one holdco pushing money down to the opco. There are or can be restrictions under certain circumstances for the opco pushing money up to the holdco.\nBen Swinburne: Got it. Thank you \nOperator: All right. Next question comes from Zack Silver with B. Riley.\nZack Silver: All right. Great. Thanks for taking the question. The first one for Chase, you talked about 2021 potentially being a big year for broadcast renewals. And certainly, the global pay TV ecosystem is not immune to COVID. So I guess what I'm curious about is whether you can give us a health -- a sense of the health of some of those pay TV partners and their ability to renew deals with you guys at attractive terms for both parties.\nChase Carey: Yes. I mean, we're -- obviously, a lot of discussions, as people are navigating through the short term, has sort of gotten put a bit in the back burner or everything sort of become very short term. Look, I think, the pay TV universe will come through this. I mean, in many ways, if you talk about pay TV, which is really part of a wider digital universe, one of the few winners in this period seems to be digital platforms and -- that are -- the increased importance, increased value on great content on these array of platforms. So we're continuing to have discussions with them. I think we feel good about that space. But I think everybody is I think in the very short term, which really means the last month, whatever it is, six weeks since this really occurred. Clearly, everybody would like to have a little more visibility towards what things are going to look like in three months, six months, what have you. But I think discussions and interest, the themes we've had about the value of unique sports content, unique event content, sports content like ours of a global nature seems to be realistically as strong as ever. What is the impact to the platforms we deal with varies a bit around the world, but they're mostly big entities. We're not dealing with again small businesses. We expect them to come through this. I think the subscriber side, certainly the advertising world seems to be more impacted by the subscriber side, sports generally has sort of leaned to -- the businesses that buy sports are probably leaning more heavily on the subscriber subscriptions to be supporting it, then the ads. The ads matter. But I think advertising and sports will come back, because I think again the type of entities that advertise in sports, I think, are ones that are looking if anything anxious to come back and support their product.\nZack Silver: Got it. That's helpful. And then, for Chase, Greg or for Brian, in the release and apologies if you missed this, with the reattribution announcement a couple of weeks ago, but you guys disclosed that you were paying down the remaining revolver balance today. Is there anything that we should read into that regarding your confidence in managing cash burn when valuations are going on? And also, any implications for talks you're having with the lenders?\nGreg Maffei: Yes. I'm happy to comment. And then we have Laurel Baldi [ph] here as well for that. Look, we have obviously a lot of confidence in our cash position at the Formula One Group. And we certainly in the interim didn't need the extra money that we had drawn on the revolver prior to the reattribution. We don't need that money today. We'd drawn it in a surfeit of caution and now we're not in that need. So rather than run a negative spread on the borrowings, we've paid that money down. We are in fruitful discussions with the lenders, likely to have covenants which are less -- or at least for some period of time based not on EBITDA, but on liquidity. And I think it's a measure of our confidence that we'll be successful to pay down the revolver. Laurel, would you add anything?\nChase Carey: No. You've covered it.\nZack Silver: Got it. Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: All right. Next question comes from John Tinker with Gabelli.\nJohn Tinker: HI. Could you just talk about baseball? I think they've actually started playing games already in Korea and Taiwan. And how you see that might go and the impact of not having spectators? And secondly, development revenue was up and the battery because of retail. Could you talk a little bit about how that's going now given that everything is closed down? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: Yes. On baseball, I guess, there are people now following the Korean leagues with new interest and there are primers on who to watch and how to watch the Korean League. I have not embraced it yet fully. And I'm still waiting for our domestic lead to come forward at LMC. I think they're looking, as I said, at a range of opportunities, but most likely -- while nothing is resolved, it appears most likely there will be not the bubble concepts which have their own things, but some late June start spring training, early July without the fans. There are still issues to be resolved about what the payments will be to the players. There were agreements about paying them $170 million and then sort of looking at pro rata with a creditor for the $170 million. But some of these things were based on the idea that fans would be attending. If fans are not attending and there are reduced revenue streams there still need to be some negotiations about what the splits are. I obviously can't comment on, any of that.\nChase Carey: It's, Chase. My line went dead. Sorry. I just called back in.\nGreg Maffei: Great, talking about baseball for one sec. And then, so I think, that's to be determined John and worked through. But I think there's a positive attitude on all parties to try and get some positive resolution. But that will obviously impact profitability, even on a pro rata basis, if we are -- if we're not able to have fans present which is certainly the expectation in the early games will not have fans. We have obviously had a major drop in activity at the battery. I don't know Brian, if there's any commentary, you want to make in addition to that.\nBrian Wendling: No. I would just say we're trying to work with our tenants there. And we can't comment on specifics but we're trying to work with them where appropriate. To the extent we're having gains. But we don't have fans there could be some impacts to their businesses and therefore how that translates through to us. And also, we have parking revenue in there which obviously would go down to the extent we don't have fans showing up. But none of these are overly material to Liberty Media as a whole and not really material to the brands either.\nJohn Tinker: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thanks for taking my question. Just first for Chase on, the Concorde Agreement, is there something that has to be completed prior to the 2021 season? Could Formula One move to instead maybe extend the existing agreement even for a short period? And then for Greg, I think, in your prepared remarks you mentioned, looking at synergistic assets I think for Formula One Group, just wondering if you could expand a little bit on this. Would this be focused mainly on motor sport, or could it extend into some other sports, or live event categories? Thanks.\nChase Carey: I guess, on the Concorde agreement, the reality is once you get to 2020 \u2013 2021. I mean, I'm sorry. We can with -- actually on the Concorde we can just unilaterally just sign these with them. These are the rules of the road where this is the structure that exists. So we don't have to extend anything. We can essentially implement and say that's -- if you're racing that's the terms on which you're racing. Obviously, that's not -- we're looking to conclude it with the teams. But the Concorde Agreement, when we put it forth, will be the Concorde Agreement that goes into effect in 2021. And we are able to unilaterally do that.\nGreg Maffei: Wait a minute. We lost a question there. Can you repeat, just to make sure, we got it?\nDavid Karnovsky: Yeah. No. The question was just -- can you hear me? Am I still on the line?\nGreg Maffei: Yeah. Yeah, we got you on the line. I am sorry. Go ahead.\nDavid Karnovsky: Yeah. The question was just on, your prepared remarks I think you mentioned, looking at synergistic assets...\nGreg Maffei: Synergistic or -- I'm sorry. Just making sure of what I heard\u2026\nDavid Karnovsky: Yeah, just wanted to know, if this would -- yeah, go ahead.\nGreg Maffei: Yeah. Look, there have been assets in the motor sports space that have traded that we've looked at. We'll continue to look at ones that are around that. I don't want us -- our goal is to create a focused F1, and if we saw some unbelievable opportunity that was synergistic outside of motor sports when we look at sure. But our goal is to try and create things that are towards the Formula One, operating business the Formula One ecosystem for things we have around Formula One where we can provide synergistic value. So that would be our first priority.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Next, we'll go to Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners.\nBrandon Ross: Thanks. Good morning. For Greg, one of the rationales for putting Live Nation in the LSXM tracker is it opens up opportunities, for Sirius and Live Nations to work more closely together. Can you just explain what you could do now that they're under the same umbrella that, you couldn't do before and why the tracker structure influences, what you can do operationally? And then just for Chase, is it reasonable now to assume that you could be at 22 races in 2021? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: Well, Brandon I think you know the answer to that question that, there's nothing structurally that was prohibited before that is now permitted. But I do think, that putting them together and doing things like bringing Michael Rapino on to the SiriusXM Board continued interactions continued alignment potential for further working together is enhanced by being on the same tracker.\nChase Carey: And simple answer to 2021, I mean, we don't have a magic number. But the answer is yes. I mean realistically again, we expect 2020 -- our goal is to have 2021 look like, the 2021 we planned back in January. And we have \u2013 ultimately, we have renewals put in place and we have some ongoing discussions with a couple of potential new races that we think would be a positive enhancement to the business for fans and our shareholders. But yes, we expect 2020 -- as I've said, we expect 2021 to look like the 2021. We were looking at in January. And so certainly, if we plan on 2020, 2022 races then again we don't have the magic number but we'd be planning on 2022 -- we'd still be planning on 22 races.\nBrandon Ross: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: All right and we'll take our last question from Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs.\nDrew Borst: Thank you. I had a couple of questions, for Chase. Firstly, I wanted to ask about, the prize fund for this year. I think in normal course it's usually variable to PTS EBITDA. Is the intention to keep it variable, or are you intending to maybe have a deal a little bit higher at some sort of fixed component because it would seem like PTS EBITDA is likely to be a lot lower? That's the first question.\nChase Carey: So, again, the price point is a contractual formula. So the prize fund is what it is. We realistically -- we can't -- we couldn't unilaterally change it if we chose. So I think, the question which I guess was a part of the question earlier is would we do something? And I guess to expand to that since it's a percentage of profits and profits will be down it means the prize fund will be down. The question is would we do something to support certain teams? Again, we're not in the business of handouts, but we want to -- but that being said, we -- I think we'll engage with all our partners and figure out how do we go forward in a way that makes sense for everybody. But the prize in itself is defined by a contract that is a percentage of EBITDA. And as we know what that is, I don't we really move to the next level until we know what that EBITDA is, obviously, we still have a lot of moving parts. As I talked before, we haven't settled the calendar. We don't know how many fans have races. So at this point, we'd have a wide range of potential outcomes on the ultimate prize fund. I think when we have a better handle on that, we'll see where we are and see if it's appropriate or right for us to do anything whether it's again with them or with the team or with any of our other partners. But we expect to be dealt with fairly and expect them to deal with us fairly.\nDrew Borst: And then you mentioned earlier about the budget cap probably coming down a little bit more beyond the $175 million. Is the idea that that's just a one-time reduction, or is that something you think will be the new permanent on a go-forward basis? And if it is permanent, is that creating some new tension between the big and the small teams?\nChase Carey: I mean, certainly what we're putting in place is a cost cap, I'd call it is a long-term construct. So it's not to bring it down and have to go right back up. It's a construct that is for the long-term. And I don't think it creates tension. It creates, I think, respect the fact that there are a number of teams that spend significantly more and respect that they will obviously have to manage through challenges to get to the cap. I think we -- all 10 teams have agreed the intent of the cap was to improve -- the goals that were driven that drove the cap, which were improved competition, better action and a healthier business for everybody in it. The cap helps achieve that. They've been different. As I said all along, there have been different thoughts about the specifics. It's a much more complicated sport to put a cap into than the team sports in the U.S. well, where you just add up salaries. You've got all -- here you've got all the moving parts that come out of the technology of the sport and the engineering of the sport. And so how you implement that cap is probably more the discussion than does the cap makes sense. And again, I'm sure there will be pressures on teams that have to make significant changes to get to the cap. But I think there's been unanimous agreement that the goal of the cap and those broad-based goals are goals we all share and that we have -- that it will help make the sport better for fans and everybody in it.\nDrew Borst: Thank you very much.\nGreg Maffei: So operator I think we're done with our questions today. Thank you to the listening audience and for your continued interest in Liberty Media. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter if not sooner. Thanks very much.\nChase Carey: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

            "name": "Chase Carey",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian. We entered 2019 with great momentum and were ready for our biggest season yet with 22 races. We were ready to race at Australia, but it was necessary to cancel the event at the last minute for reasons related to COVID-19. This global pandemic has had a significant impact on Formula One and we're adjusting and responding in numerous ways that are in the best interests of our fans, employees, partners and constituents, while focusing on the Formula One business for the long term. Let's walk through all the actions we've taken. One of the first actions we took as a support was to move the team's summer break up to March and April as we wanted to have ultimate flexibility to race during the normal summer break in August. On Tuesday the 28th of March, the FIA's World Motor Sport Council approved a further extension of the shutdown period from 35 to 63 days to be taken during the months of March, April, May and/or June. During this break of the season, we were inspired to see several U.K.-based Formula One teams come together for Project Pitlane. This is part of a larger U.K. industry-wide focus to manufacture and deliver respiratory devices to support the national need. Formula One has the unique ability to rapidly respond to engineering and technological challenges and is focused on its core skills of rapid design, prototype manufacture test and skilled assembly. These efforts have proven fruitful and the go-ahead has been given for two of Project Pitlane's initiatives, including ventilators that are being produced by several teams, plus a breathing aid being manufactured by Mercedes. We're grateful for the team's efforts in supporting the national need. In further actions F1 the FIA and all 10 teams unanimously agreed to delay the introduction of the 2021 technical regulations until 2022 and to keep the majority of their existing 2020 cars into the 2021 season. This will reduce costs for all teams at this time, when they would usually be investing and working on the cars for the 2021 season. We have further been working with the FIA and teams to strengthen the long-term future of Formula One, with an array of new technical, sporting and financial regulations that will improve the competition and action on the track and make it a healthier business for all involved, particularly as we work through the issues created by COVID-19. One of the key areas of focus has been the cost cap on team expenses. We've previously implemented a cap of $175 million for 2021, but now expect to move forward with a significantly lower cap. Just like our teams Formula One has been evaluating our cost structure. We made some difficult decisions and furloughed over 50% of our workforce on April 1st, with senior executives taking a voluntary cut in pay. We froze all hiring and pay review plans and also deferred a number of initiatives we plan to pursue this year. We recognize we may lose a bit of time in implementing some of these plans. However, we felt the current uncertainties warranted the actions. As Brian mentioned, we're actively engaged with lenders of our revolving credit facility to address potential issues related to our quarterly leverage covenant. They've been very supportive as we work together to identify potential changes to the covenant to enable us to navigate through the possible scenarios, including the remote possibility of no racing in 2020, and we expect to agree to necessary changes in due course. We've been working tirelessly since Australia and we're actively engaged with our promoters in putting together a potential 2020 race calendar. We have two primary challenges. Identifying locations where we can hold the rice and determining how we transport all necessary parties and their equipment to that location for a race. We're in discussion with all of our promoters, as well as some tracks that are not currently on our 2020 calendar, to ensure we explore all options. Our goal is to launch the season on the weekend of July 4th and 5th in Austria. It is likely that we race the weekend of July 11th and 12th in Austria as well. We're in the advanced stages of putting together a schedule of additional European races through early September, including races during the traditional August break. We will then plan to race in Eurasia \u2013 in Asia and the Americas in September, October, and November before finishing in the Gulf in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December. We hope to have a calendar with 15 to 18 races. We expect the early part of the calendar to be races without fans, but we hope to be able to allow fans to attend in the latter part of the year. We are working with the FIA, local authorities and other experts to determine the steps and procedures necessary to safely transport everyone to each race location and to enable those individuals to operate and be housed in a safe and secure manner. We feel increasingly positive about the number of locations that would be able and want to hold the race this year. Our work in the travel and other logistical issues related to each country are a work in progress. The economics of races, particularly ones with fans will clearly vary from existing agreements and we're actively engaged on this front too. We've been working closely with the FIA with the consent of all the teams to change the calendar, without a formal vote amongst the teams and this was formally approved by the World Motor Sport Council and Formula One. This will allow for a stream process as we reshuffle the calendar and appreciate the team's support. With the postponement of the season, we are pleased that our teams quickly pivoted and launched a new Formula One Esports Virtual Grand Prix Series featuring a number of current Formula One drivers and celebrities. To date, Charles Leclerc, George Russell, Antonio Giovinazzi, Lando Norris, Alex Albon, Carlos Sainz Jr., Nicholas Latifi have all been on the grid along with former F1 drivers such as Jensen Button, Johnnie Abraham, and Nico Hu\u0308lkenberg. They've been joined by England's Cricket World Cup winner Ben Stokes; musician, Liam Payne; professional golfer, Ian Poulter; and six-time Olympic Gold Medalist, Sir Chris Hoy to name a few. These races have run in place of every postponed Grand Prix. The series utilizes the official Formula One 2019 PC video game developed by Codemasters and the visuals are impressive. The races have provided great racing and entertainment value with lively commentary. Charles Leclerc won his debut race after receiving the game just three weeks earlier. Then he won the next race as well and we're excited to see new rivalries emerge. The broadcast is available on the official Formula One YouTube, Twitch and Facebook channels as well as Marquee TV broadcasters such as Sky Sports in the U.K. and ESPN in the U.S., and we've experienced strong engagement. Through the first three races digital cumulative views reached 12.9 million, and total viewership including TV estimates reached 16.3 million. The Virtual Grand Prix even trended number one on YouTube U.K. We will continue with these virtual GPs until we return to racing. We were also pleased with the response to the second season of Drive to Survive, which debuted on Netflix at the end of February. The season provided unprecedented access to the teams and drivers. We saw the drama of the driver switch from Gasly to Albon mid-season at Red Bull behind the scenes action of the wet race in Germany and learned more about Williams' challenging season. We are in advanced discussions for season 3 and the team is ready to capture footage in 2020. In news that may have been overlooked due to COVID-19, we welcomed Aramco as a long-term global partner to Formula One. We announced this agreement on March 10 and Aramco as our sixth global partner alongside DHL, Emirates, Heineken, Pirelli and Rolex. We look forward to sharing our expertise to identify opportunities for the advancement of sustainable fuels, enhanced engine efficiencies and emerging mobility technology. This deal includes trackside branding at most races and title rights to three Grand Prixs in 2020 and exposure on our digital platforms. Further in this area, we welcome Bem Pincus as our new Director of Commercial Partnerships at the end of February. Ben joins us from Heineken, where he managed their worldwide sponsorship team and partnership with Formula One. On the distribution front, we announced a multiyear media rights deal extension in Canada with Bell Media's TSN and RDS, which goes through the end of the 2024 season. Our fan base continues to grow in Canada. The 2019 season audiences across TSN and RDS grew 19% year-over-year and coverage across the two networks reached nearly 5.3 million Canadian viewers. We've been in regular contact with our commercial partners, broadcasters, sponsors and other partners. These partners have almost all been very supportive. Our conversations with them regarding the 2020 season are not as advanced as those of promoters, as we need to determine our modified calendar to have more substantive conversations. A number of agreements have provisions related to the number of races, although, that number of races is well below our originally planned 22. These are all valued long-term partners, and we expect to resolve any potential contractual issues in a fair and straightforward manner. We had been in the final stages of completing the Concorde Agreement when the coronavirus crisis turned everything on its head. We decided to put the Concorde on the back burner for the short-term and prioritize addressing issues related to 2020 first. As we move forward with the 2020 calendar and finalize regulatory changes with the teams, we will once again return to completing the Concorde Agreement in the immediate future. Obviously, we are still dealing with a lot of uncertainty regarding the short-term and the coronavirus. We're increasingly confident although there are no guarantees that we will have a 2020 championship season. Fan support has been great and there seems to be an incredible pent-up enthusiasm for racing to begin. At the same time, we're also looking beyond this year to a 2021 season. The long-term contractual nature of Formula One helped provide long-term stability at a time of uncertainty. We continue discussions for potential new races or race renewals for 2021 and are going well. We also continue discussions with other new or existing commercial partners. We expect the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the broader world will extend into the future, but we feel we're well positioned to return to the growth curve we were on a few months ago and look forward to the better future for all of us. I recognize everyone would like revised projections for 2020. At this point, all we have are sensitivities with a range of potential results based on many variables. What is clear is that 2020 results will be significantly below original expectations, but we believe it is equally clear that we can manage through 2020 with or without racing and more importantly that our business can quickly return to our prior expectations in 2021 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Greg. And I guess on my front, I think, clearly races without fans have a much more significant impact on the promoter side than the broadcasting and sponsorship side in many ways. I think racing without fans is first and foremost for the broadcast digital sponsorship side. The fans will all connect through various platforms and in many ways actually when you watch a race even at a live race. Many people watch it on television, television screens anyway. I think in terms of the rate of the promoter side, clearly, these are very different events without fans and that will be reflected. I mean, we've talked about these being week-long spectacles, multi-day events, the city involved, the track involved. Without fans at any of that, it's clearly a very different -- it's a very different opportunity. It's a very different event, and we recognize that. So, I think, these are unprecedented situations. And so I think with the promoters, there's a more significant change I think. With the broadcasters and sponsors, they do look at it as a season as a whole. As I said, there are contracts that have provisions tied to a number of races. It's below what we'd have. So, we have some room there. But we feel we can deliver a quality event for those. We think we can make a great event but live fans won't be there. And so again, the impact is going to be significant -- more significant on the promoter side. So, I mean first on the long-term impact, I mean whether it's promoters or sponsors we kind of look -- we're planning to be business as we planned it in 2021. So, that's our expectation. In terms of managing through these events, right now we expect the European events to largely be without fans. So, that's how we're planning it without fans. We're obviously dealing with different issues. We still have to deal with how do we get the teams there. How do we get the necessary personnel there and secure they're safe? We're working with the country host regulators. We're working with the appropriate authorities. We need testing procedures transportation and procedures. I actually had a fairly long conference call this morning with an array of parties putting that in place focusing first on Austria because it's the first race but talking through all our tentative European races. So, I think we feel we're making good headway on having races that can be secure and safe for everybody without fans which again is what we expect in Europe. I think as you get to events with fans that's probably -- we've probably made -- because it's a little further on the schedule we haven't made as much headway into some degree. It's tough to have those discussions because we can't -- you don't really get guidelines yet. I think this issue has so little visibility and it is so fluid. It's difficult to have discussions with authorities. I mean we can sort of start to work through what we think may be possible in terms of spacing and other ways to manage traffic flows if we had them. But you're really not going to -- if you're trying to talk to people about what you can do in September and October right now that's -- September, October, November, those are more difficult discussions because they're still -- they're trying to figure out what to do in June and July. So, I think the issues in terms of how we'd manage the fan part of it are probably ones we'll have in the -- as we get closer to that -- races where that would be a realistic possibility. But since they're not in the -- again they're not in sort of the July, August, I think we're planning races that are races without fans and making sure we can go forward with those. And to some degree nobody knows what the landscape is and you pick up -- you get different stories in different places. As you look at China today, they're opening up an array of places that have public gatherings. So, I think we'll this is a situation where in terms of dealing with larger crowds you clearly know more week-to-week as you go forward. And so it's very much managing up a real-time process. In terms of the sponsors they've been great. Look, I think in many ways sponsors we've been in touch with them all. Until we know what the calendar is, it's tough to have a substantive conversation about how do we modify their -- what races. They have title races that they all have components to their agreements. So, this is why we've sort of mostly been keeping them up to speed. Again, we could not feel better about the support we've got and the enthusiasm from them. I think in many ways like we're dealing with global companies but I think -- well clearly our big sponsors are -- they're not -- when you think first and foremost where is the real impact everybody talks about in the coronavirus? It's small business. Reality, we don't -- that's not our core sponsorship. Our relationship are big brands, entities that know they have a future and just looking to figure out how do they get back to business as it was. So, our sponsors are quite enthusiastic quite supportive. And again we look forward to advancing discussions with them as we know more about the specifics of our 2020 calendar. So on the first, I think we -- right now our current targeted plan has us finishing in December -- later in December than the original plan so sort of more like the 13th, 14th of December. But we are evaluating and will consider. So certainly finishing in January is an option. We could do that. We can do that. I think if we can, we'd like to finish in December. We'd obviously have to take a fairly long break through the holidays. You're not going to race in the holiday weeks. But it is an option available to us that we'd again have to work through with our promoters and work through an array of parties to get there. But it is something we've considered and talked about. But I'd say at this point our goal is again to finish a couple of weeks later than our original date, but to finish in sort of mid-December ahead of the holidays. I think in terms of the teams obviously as I said ,2020 for us and the teams is not going to be what we're not going to have the results, we're going to have when we started the year or expected to have when we started the year. And I think everybody is doing what they can to shore it up. And I talked about the cost-cutting initiatives, as we move forward and can solidify what we are doing. Right now there are too many moving parts. So we're not -- you got to -- there's so many what ifs. I don't think you can -- it's constructive to try to address parts of it. I think we need to get far enough along in these plans to know where we're at. We expect the teams to be taking the right initiatives to get them through it. I think all of us recognize many ways -- priority one in many ways is to -- when we get to 2021 is to have just more -- get back on the track it was on at the beginning of the year for 2021. And that's our goal and that's what we're committed to get to and certainly manage through this year as best as possible. What we need -- there's been speculation at this point on to what degree do we need to help support select teams. We care about the teams, but those are discussions we've not had to date. I think we'll see where things are as we go along. But I think there are too many moving parts right now to really engage with any specificity on that. So on promotion, the promotion is probably more tied to sort of obligations whether it's signage time on screen titles. So -- and certainly we have excess -- we've said before we have excess capacity, material excess capacity at the 22 race level. We're raising it. Obviously, as the number of races goes down. it puts some pressure on that capacity. Clearly they're at the margins. There's some issues we've got to manage through whether it's without races their hospitality that won't exist at some. But I think at its core, we feel we can go a long way towards -- I think our plans are to go a long way towards meeting what our sponsors would want to be gaining through the sport this year. So I think we are working to achieve what we think would meet the expectations of our sponsors. But at the end of the day -- I mean these are relationships. And these are long-term relationships. Most of our sponsors are long-term. We'll sit down as partners and find a fair path forward. We want them to feel good about what we do. But equally, we have an obligation to deliver certain value. If we deliver it, we expect to receive fair value for it. But we will approach it as partners. I think as you get to promoters with fans, certainly that does get much closer to the business at norm. There are different cases. Is it a race that was going to be held in the spring and has moved to the fall? That obviously has implications in terms of selling tickets and the like. Right now probably most of our promoters even the ones on the schedule aren't really selling tickets given the uncertainties and probably nobody is buying a lot of tickets given the uncertainties. So it's not -- with everything that exists out there it's not sort of -- it's not business as usual. But I think to the degree we have races with fans. And I guess, you also get the question is it a race with fans as you know it, or is it race with fans with certain conditions around those fans? So I think all those things we have to engage on. But I think the way again we approach 2020 is, we -- yes we have agreements in place, but these are long-term partners. We expect the great -- indeed they've all been very supportive. We want to be fair in addressing this. We want to get fair value, but be fair to them. And first and foremost, make sure in 2021, we've got the business in 2020 looking like we expected it to look four months ago and have the same future we expected to have four months ago. And really what we're managing through is a short one-time event for us. We think the strength in this support, the interest and the support the support -- the support and the interest we've got, whether it's from fans or partners, can enable us to get back there. I think there won't be some lasting impacts, but I think the strength of events like ours, I think, fans will come back. I think events like ours will continue to rise in strength. And, I think, the type of partners we have seem to be more supportive than ever, even if you have a degree of a shakeout in the economy. So, we will certainly expect to get fair value this year. But, again, we're not going to play hardball. We're going to deal with things as partners, but with a priority to making sure, so in kind of giveaways, whether it's the teams or promoters or sponsors, we're not going to be handing out candy to everybody. We're going to be expected to be treated fairly. But we're going to deal with it as adults and with the expectation that 2021 is going to, again, look like the business we all knew four months ago. Yes. I mean, we're -- obviously, a lot of discussions, as people are navigating through the short term, has sort of gotten put a bit in the back burner or everything sort of become very short term. Look, I think, the pay TV universe will come through this. I mean, in many ways, if you talk about pay TV, which is really part of a wider digital universe, one of the few winners in this period seems to be digital platforms and -- that are -- the increased importance, increased value on great content on these array of platforms. So we're continuing to have discussions with them. I think we feel good about that space. But I think everybody is I think in the very short term, which really means the last month, whatever it is, six weeks since this really occurred. Clearly, everybody would like to have a little more visibility towards what things are going to look like in three months, six months, what have you. But I think discussions and interest, the themes we've had about the value of unique sports content, unique event content, sports content like ours of a global nature seems to be realistically as strong as ever. What is the impact to the platforms we deal with varies a bit around the world, but they're mostly big entities. We're not dealing with again small businesses. We expect them to come through this. I think the subscriber side, certainly the advertising world seems to be more impacted by the subscriber side, sports generally has sort of leaned to -- the businesses that buy sports are probably leaning more heavily on the subscriber subscriptions to be supporting it, then the ads. The ads matter. But I think advertising and sports will come back, because I think again the type of entities that advertise in sports, I think, are ones that are looking if anything anxious to come back and support their product. No. You've covered it. It's, Chase. My line went dead. Sorry. I just called back in. I guess, on the Concorde agreement, the reality is once you get to 2020 \u2013 2021. I mean, I'm sorry. We can with -- actually on the Concorde we can just unilaterally just sign these with them. These are the rules of the road where this is the structure that exists. So we don't have to extend anything. We can essentially implement and say that's -- if you're racing that's the terms on which you're racing. Obviously, that's not -- we're looking to conclude it with the teams. But the Concorde Agreement, when we put it forth, will be the Concorde Agreement that goes into effect in 2021. And we are able to unilaterally do that. And simple answer to 2021, I mean, we don't have a magic number. But the answer is yes. I mean realistically again, we expect 2020 -- our goal is to have 2021 look like, the 2021 we planned back in January. And we have \u2013 ultimately, we have renewals put in place and we have some ongoing discussions with a couple of potential new races that we think would be a positive enhancement to the business for fans and our shareholders. But yes, we expect 2020 -- as I've said, we expect 2021 to look like the 2021. We were looking at in January. And so certainly, if we plan on 2020, 2022 races then again we don't have the magic number but we'd be planning on 2022 -- we'd still be planning on 22 races. So, again, the price point is a contractual formula. So the prize fund is what it is. We realistically -- we can't -- we couldn't unilaterally change it if we chose. So I think, the question which I guess was a part of the question earlier is would we do something? And I guess to expand to that since it's a percentage of profits and profits will be down it means the prize fund will be down. The question is would we do something to support certain teams? Again, we're not in the business of handouts, but we want to -- but that being said, we -- I think we'll engage with all our partners and figure out how do we go forward in a way that makes sense for everybody. But the prize in itself is defined by a contract that is a percentage of EBITDA. And as we know what that is, I don't we really move to the next level until we know what that EBITDA is, obviously, we still have a lot of moving parts. As I talked before, we haven't settled the calendar. We don't know how many fans have races. So at this point, we'd have a wide range of potential outcomes on the ultimate prize fund. I think when we have a better handle on that, we'll see where we are and see if it's appropriate or right for us to do anything whether it's again with them or with the team or with any of our other partners. But we expect to be dealt with fairly and expect them to deal with us fairly. I mean, certainly what we're putting in place is a cost cap, I'd call it is a long-term construct. So it's not to bring it down and have to go right back up. It's a construct that is for the long-term. And I don't think it creates tension. It creates, I think, respect the fact that there are a number of teams that spend significantly more and respect that they will obviously have to manage through challenges to get to the cap. I think we -- all 10 teams have agreed the intent of the cap was to improve -- the goals that were driven that drove the cap, which were improved competition, better action and a healthier business for everybody in it. The cap helps achieve that. They've been different. As I said all along, there have been different thoughts about the specifics. It's a much more complicated sport to put a cap into than the team sports in the U.S. well, where you just add up salaries. You've got all -- here you've got all the moving parts that come out of the technology of the sport and the engineering of the sport. And so how you implement that cap is probably more the discussion than does the cap makes sense. And again, I'm sure there will be pressures on teams that have to make significant changes to get to the cap. But I think there's been unanimous agreement that the goal of the cap and those broad-based goals are goals we all share and that we have -- that it will help make the sport better for fans and everybody in it. Thanks a lot."

            "name": "Greg Maffei",
            "content": "Thank you and good morning. Today speaking on the call, we will have Formula One's Chairman and CEO Chase Carey; and Liberty's Chief Accounting Officer, Brian Wendling. First let me say, I hope you all are healthy and safe. Second, I'd like to thank and salute our employees and management teams who have done an impressive job managing through this COVID crisis. Now on to Liberty Media. We completed the reattribution of our Live Nation stake and other assets and liabilities between the Formula One Group and Liberty SiriusXM on April 22. We've spoken to many of you since this announcement and obviously we had a conference call right after that. So, I won't go into detail, but I'd like to reiterate why this was a benefit to both equity shareholders. For the Formula One Group, first, creates a pure play; provided additional liquidity and reduced debt and for Liberty SiriusXM, acquiring Formula One Group's Live Nation interest with the complementary business with us at SiriusXM tracker at a compelling price resulting in ample liquidity. We are pleased with the stock market reaction since. All the stocks have outperformed the ads and fees since we made the announcement. Turning to Liberty SiriusXM, including the LSXM shares that we acquired as part of the reattribution, Liberty SiriusXM repurchased $98 million of stock from February 1 through April 30 and effectively bought the SiriusXM shares at a $3.73 look-through price over this period including the reattributed shares. Our ownership of SiriusXM as of April 24 stood at 72.2%. I'd note that we have stopped our repurchases prior the reattribution. But I expect, post close of the planned rights offering in early June, we will look to start repurchasing LSXM stock again. The nagging discount to NAV is an opportunity and one we will continue to take advantage of. As SiriusXM continue to repurchase stock and we approach 80% ownership of SiriusXM, I expect the opportunity may wane. Now looking at SiriusXM itself, it continues to operate very well during the COVID crisis. It has launched innovative new program including a 24/7 COVID-19-focused channel on Hotline, nine new limited run channels with iconic artists including the Prince Channel with music and exclusive content like a never-before-heard demo of a conceptual radio show Prince created for the SiriusXM channel back in 2005. Howard Stern has done great and innovative including a two-hour plus session with Tom Brady from Derek Jeter's House in Florida. The subscription-based business model we have at SiriusXM has proved resilient. Self-pay net adds grew 69,000 to nearly 34.8 million total subscribers. And the very strong liquidity and cash flow of SiriusXM has shown through. We still have $1.75 billion of available on our revolving credit facility which has not been drawn. Turning to Formula One Group. I'm sure you have all missed the Dubai F1 racing. Hopefully, you've gotten a little taste by watching or rewatching both seasons of Drive to Survive on Netflix. And we expect all of you watched the Virtual GP this past weekend. There was an epic battle between Alex Albon and Charles Leclerc. They passed and repassed each other several times with Albon finally taking the win. The final results highlighted the next-generation of F1 drivers, Albon, Russell and Leclerc exciting and going to be thrilling next for years to come. The F1 team has done a great job navigating the crisis and working on the 2020 calendar. They are planning an early July start in Austria and Chase will talk more about that. We continue to evaluate the needs of the business, but definitely want to be opportunistic and find synergistic assets that we can add. And we think we are well positioned to do so. Turning to Live Nation. It does not report until after the market today, so I obviously won't comment on results, but I want to say, we are pleased with the announced actions they have taken to build liquidity. And on to the Braves, we are working closely with Major League Baseball to see how we can put a season together. We appreciate how the commissioner teams and players are working together towards that solution. Everyone is eager to see baseball return. The Braves players are eager too. They've been doing Zoom sessions with the trainers', medical staff and manager Brian Snitker. They've also been in celebration of 25 years since the Braves' 1994 World Series title. The 95 players joined a Zoom reunion while watching the final Game six on FOX Sports Southeast. Fans were able to watch the Zoom live on YouTube as well. So with that I'm going to turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results. Thank you, Chase and thank you Brian. And to the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and hope you all stay safe and healthy. And with that, operator, I'd like to open up for questions. So I'll go first. Jeff, thanks for the question. First, there's -- since our holdings are really in two buckets, it's not clear that we're soon to be up against the cap. And it's not clear what the buckets are both how it's counted. Secondly, there is some time on that purchase until we come up against that. Third, we have had begun some discussions about how to adjust that, because it's not necessarily in the interest of the shareholders of Charter or Charter to have us selling. So we'll see how that goes. We are long-term holders of Charter. We like Charter. We certainly don't want to be in a position of being required to sell Charter stock. So, on the first one Brian, thank you for the questions. To do an RMT, our shareholders would need to end up with 51% ownership of the spun company. And I don't think we would use -- our priority right now for the capital we would use at LSXM is to capture the discount go after that. I don't think we would want to use that to RMT the stock. And I think over the long-term one of the reasons why we did this reattribution is we think it's strategic and there are things and ways that Live Nation and Sirius will be able to work together with the benefit of both. So, I don't think -- while an RMT is not you're right mathematically easier it's still a reach and would require to put up capital that we have other ideas for what we want to do with it. On why the 80%? Yes, I think you'll see a lot of potential for all of the things you mentioned to drive the factor including free flow of capital up to the LSXM will probably on the margin make us more willing to consider dividends and push for dividends at Sirius, particularly if the gap sits where it is today and you can look at the relative value of which stock is more attractive to purchase SXM or LSXM. Albert are you on the line? I was going to say that, but I want to get the authority to verify. Thank you, Albert. Yes. Albert blesses everything. Thank goodness. I'm not sure what language your -- just about the up and down, sorry. Because [Indiscernible] language part. There are no restrictions on one holdco pushing money down to the opco. There are or can be restrictions under certain circumstances for the opco pushing money up to the holdco. Yes. I'm happy to comment. And then we have Laurel Baldi [ph] here as well for that. Look, we have obviously a lot of confidence in our cash position at the Formula One Group. And we certainly in the interim didn't need the extra money that we had drawn on the revolver prior to the reattribution. We don't need that money today. We'd drawn it in a surfeit of caution and now we're not in that need. So rather than run a negative spread on the borrowings, we've paid that money down. We are in fruitful discussions with the lenders, likely to have covenants which are less -- or at least for some period of time based not on EBITDA, but on liquidity. And I think it's a measure of our confidence that we'll be successful to pay down the revolver. Laurel, would you add anything? Yes. On baseball, I guess, there are people now following the Korean leagues with new interest and there are primers on who to watch and how to watch the Korean League. I have not embraced it yet fully. And I'm still waiting for our domestic lead to come forward at LMC. I think they're looking, as I said, at a range of opportunities, but most likely -- while nothing is resolved, it appears most likely there will be not the bubble concepts which have their own things, but some late June start spring training, early July without the fans. There are still issues to be resolved about what the payments will be to the players. There were agreements about paying them $170 million and then sort of looking at pro rata with a creditor for the $170 million. But some of these things were based on the idea that fans would be attending. If fans are not attending and there are reduced revenue streams there still need to be some negotiations about what the splits are. I obviously can't comment on, any of that. Great, talking about baseball for one sec. And then, so I think, that's to be determined John and worked through. But I think there's a positive attitude on all parties to try and get some positive resolution. But that will obviously impact profitability, even on a pro rata basis, if we are -- if we're not able to have fans present which is certainly the expectation in the early games will not have fans. We have obviously had a major drop in activity at the battery. I don't know Brian, if there's any commentary, you want to make in addition to that. Wait a minute. We lost a question there. Can you repeat, just to make sure, we got it? Yeah. Yeah, we got you on the line. I am sorry. Go ahead. Synergistic or -- I'm sorry. Just making sure of what I heard... Yeah. Look, there have been assets in the motor sports space that have traded that we've looked at. We'll continue to look at ones that are around that. I don't want us -- our goal is to create a focused F1, and if we saw some unbelievable opportunity that was synergistic outside of motor sports when we look at sure. But our goal is to try and create things that are towards the Formula One, operating business the Formula One ecosystem for things we have around Formula One where we can provide synergistic value. So that would be our first priority. Well, Brandon I think you know the answer to that question that, there's nothing structurally that was prohibited before that is now permitted. But I do think, that putting them together and doing things like bringing Michael Rapino on to the SiriusXM Board continued interactions continued alignment potential for further working together is enhanced by being on the same tracker. So operator I think we're done with our questions today. Thank you to the listening audience and for your continued interest in Liberty Media. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter if not sooner. Thanks very much."

            "content": "Thank you, Greg and good morning everyone. The earnings release has our cash and debt balances by tracker as of March 31. Since we completed the reattribution in April as Greg discussed and repaid the margin of the F1 revolver today, I'll walk through liquidity and debt of Libery SiriusXM and the Formula One Group as of March 31 on a pro forma basis for these two transactions. Liberty Media, SiriusXM, Formula One and the Braves are in compliance with all that covenants as of March 31. Given the uncertain impact of COVID-19, F1 and the Braves are monitoring their ability to comply with their debt covenants in future periods and we are in positive discussions with their respective lenders. On a pro forma basis, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, restricted cash and liquid investments of $139 million, excluding $52 million of cash and restricted cash held directly at SiriusXM. And we have $870 million of undrawn margin loan capacity at the corporate level. The value of the SiriusXM and Live Nation stock held at Liberty SiriusXM as of May 6 was $21 billion, which excludes the value of the Live Nation call spread held at Formula One Group which was valued at $165 million at the time of the reattribution and will be marked to market quarterly. We have $2.1 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM group debt is $11.1 billion, which includes $7.9 billion of debt at SiriusXM. This debt balance excludes the $750 million intergroup loan owed to the Formula One Group, which is expected to be repaid with proceeds from the rights offering which we intend to launch on May 18. Today, F1 will fully repay the balance under its revolving credit facility using cash on hand, restoring its full capacity of $500 million. Pro forma for this repayment, Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $1.4 billion at the corporate level. This excludes $536 million of cash held directly at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.6 billion, which includes $2.9 billion of debt at Formula One leaving $688 million at the parent level. F1's total net-debt-to-covenant-OIBDA ratio as defined in F1's credit facilities for covenant calculations was six times at the end of the quarter as compared to a maximum allowable leverage ratio of 8.25 times for both the term loan and the revolving credit facility. Please note these leverage ratios are for the Formula One operating business not the Formula One Group. The term loan financial covenant is in current space and not maintenance. We are having positive discussions with the RCF lenders under to temporarily move this covenant from an EBITDA based to a liquidity base. Payment of the RCF combined with the reattribution gives us more flexibility in renegotiating the maintenance covenant on the revolver. Lastly to the Braves. At quarter end the Braves group had attributed cash liquid investments and restricted cash of $343 million and attributed principal amount of debt of $698 million. With that, I'll turn it over to Chase to discuss Formula One. No. I would just say we're trying to work with our tenants there. And we can't comment on specifics but we're trying to work with them where appropriate. To the extent we're having gains. But we don't have fans there could be some impacts to their businesses and therefore how that translates through to us. And also, we have parking revenue in there which obviously would go down to the extent we don't have fans showing up. But none of these are overly material to Liberty Media as a whole and not really material to the brands either."

During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded February 25. I would now like to turn the conference over to Courtnee Chun, Chief Portfolio Officer. Please go ahead. \nCourtnee Chun: Good morning. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in Liberty Media's most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q or Liberty Media acquisitions form S-1 registration statement filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call and Liberty Media and Liberty Media Acquisition expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media or Liberty Media Acquisition's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Media and SiriusXM, including adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media and SiriusXM Schedules 1 and 2 can be found at the end of the earnings press release issued today, which is available on Liberty Media's website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO. \nGreg Maffei : Thank you Courtnee, and good morning to all of you. Today speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali; and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. So, beginning with Liberty [Audio Gap] special dividend. We expect our share though to be about $770 million net of a pass-through to bondholders. We did continue during the quarter repurchasing shares, buying back $189 million across LSXMA and LSXMK shares from November through January. As you know, the discount remains and we therefore were able to repurchase our shares at a look-through price of -- on SIRI of just over $4. We will continue to take advantage of the discount opportunity. We also settled the exchange of our 2.25% Live Nation exchangeable in January for a consideration of $664 million using cash and some margin loan draws. Looking at the underlying business SiriusXM, they recorded record results for the year record high subs revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And also experienced the fifth straight year of improving churn. New car penetration is up to 82% from 78% in the prior year. And we launched 360L in more than 30 new vehicle models across various OEMs in 2021. Now more than 25% of SiriusXM-equipped vehicles sold in the fourth quarter incorporated our new 360L opportunity. We also teamed up with Apple and Discovery during the quarter adding 12-month subscriptions Apple Music and Discovery Plus for new and existing Platinum VIP plan subscribers. We introduced AudioID powered by AdsWizz a listener identity solution enabling marketers to reach and connect with consumers at scale. Stitcher went live with distribution and monetization of popular Crime Junkie podcast in January. We launched new exclusive artist channels including Alicia Keys, David Bowie and Neil Young and we had Small Stage Series of intimate live performances which featured premier artist spanning music generations, including Ed Sheeran, The Go-Go's, H.E.R., J. Cole and John Mayer and more. So a busy quarter. At Live Nation, a great quarter as well. Fan attendance at outdoor events in the U.S. and U.K. in the last five months of 2021 was up 25% versus the same period in 2019. On-site spend the per cap continues to grow at a double-digit rate versus 2019 and ticket sales in October, November and December were the top three months ever in terms of GDP. We have expanded our venue portfolio as well adding 31 new venues in 2021 half through the OCESA acquisition. Every leading indicator in the business reports -- points to a record 2022. Confirmed show count through February is up 30% versus 2019. We sold 45 million tickets for shows this year already and no-show rates are back down to their 2019 levels. Live Nation is entering its strongest multiyear growth chapter in a concert history. Looking at the Formula One Group. On the corporate side, we effectively repurchased 2.2 million FWONA and FWONK shares at an average per share price of $58.59. That included both FWONA share repurchases and an effective share repurchase of FWONK shares due to the purchase of the underlying $64 million of FWONK cash convert that we bought. And now let me turn to F1 and first address the circumstances in Russia. I'm sure you saw our statement this morning. As we said, we are watching the situation with sadness and shock and it's impossible to hold the Russian GP in the current circumstances. Turning back now to 2021. What a cliffhanger ending to a thrilling season. And since then we've had a month of announcements coming out of F1 with more to come. Fans are attending and tuning in. Even with COVID affecting a good chunk of the season we saw very strong attendance, and tuning across many platforms 1.55 billion of cumulative TV viewers with the highest race viewership being 109 million in Abu Dhabi, which rivals that of the Super Bowl. Average attendance was up 14% on like-for-like races. And once again we saw great growth in social media followers, making F1 once again the fastest-growing major sport on social media. We signed numerous race renewals at desirable locations, showing continued strength in our contracted revenue and we continue to further our sustainability initiatives. F1 came in at number two of 102 Global Motor Sports championships evaluated by the FIA on a Sustainable Championship Index, ahead of many such as Extreme E, MotoGP and NASCAR. We are ready to kick off our record-breaking 23-race 2022 Season and we hope to see you at some if not all of the races this year. Turning now to the Braves. We capped off an incredible 2021 with our World Series title. But in addition to that, we had 239 home runs, which ranked second in the National League. We had a 3.88 ERA, which was second best in the annual leagues and there are too many player accolades to even name. The World Series trophy tour will visit 151 stops, celebrating the 151 Seasons of Braves baseball. And we will start 2022 with the highest number of season ticket holders in 22 seasons since 2000. We are sold out of our premium seats for the first time in Truist Park history including all the suites -- the premium seats including all the suites. And Truist Park will hold five stadium concerts in 2022, its highest ever. TK Tower and Innovation Center grand opening took place on February 9th. And in 2021, the Battery had close to nine million visitors including 330,000 during the three World Series games. We also did close on the sale of the Minor League teams in January. The geographic alignment of the teams is important and the Major League reorg of Minor League last year ensured that this will continue. The teams do remain affiliates for future player development. Let me just address the CBA for one moment. We are certainly aware of the latest developments in our discussions with Braves management but are obviously prohibited from commenting any further. We continue to review opportunities for LMAC and SPAC. As I've said before, we do believe the turbulence in the SPAC market has made deals more difficult but actually will benefit Liberty and our strength. And with that let me turn it over to Brian for more financial results.\nBrian Wendling: Thank you Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg mentioned in January, we settled exchanges on the 2.25% Live Nation exchangeable bonds for a total consideration of $664 million. This was funded with cash and margin loan draws including drawing in part on our newly amended Live Nation margin loan, which had upsized in Q4 reflecting appreciation in the underlying Live Nation share price. Pro forma for the exchanges, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and liquid public debt and equity securities of approximately $143 million, which excludes $191 million of cash held at SiriusXM. We also had $925 million of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level. As of yesterday's close, the value of the SiriusXM stock held at Liberty SiriusXM Group was $19.4 billion. And the value of the Live Nation stock held was $8.7 billion. We have $3.1 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings pro forma for the exchanges of the Live Nation exchangeable bonds.  Total pro forma Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.1 billion, which includes $8.9 billion of debt held directly at SiriusXM. Formula One Group had attributed cash liquid investments and liquid public debt and equity securities of $1.6 billion at quarter end which excludes $709 million of cash held at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.4 billion, which includes $2.9 billion of debt at F1 leaving $455 million at the corporate level. As Greg mentioned in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $64 million face value of 1% FWONK converts effectively retiring 1.7 million of underlying FWONK shares. Formula One's $500 million revolver remains undrawn. And Formula One's leverage at the end of the quarter was 4.4 time and we are revising our target leverage range down to be less than 5 times on a go-forward basis. Note, we are still in a period of covenant waiver until March of this year. As previously disclosed beginning in January of 2021, F1 began reclassifying certain components previously reported in other F1 revenue into primary F1 revenue to better align with the way it currently evaluates the business. Components reclassified in the primary F1 revenue include F1 TV subscriptions, F2 and F3 related fees, broadcast origination and support fees, as well as digital advertising, amongst other items. Additional detail including the impact of the revenue reclassification for the years ended 12/31/19 and 2020 can be found in Schedule four of our earnings release posted on our website. At quarter end the Braves Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $142 million, which excludes $102 million of restricted cash that's on their balance sheet. Braves Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $700 million. At the end of the year, Liberty and all of our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants. With that I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One. \nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Brian. The 2021 season will be discussed for decades to come as one of the greatest. It came down to not just the final race, but to the final match for Max Verstappen to edge pass Lewis Hamilton and win his first World Championship. We look forward to this continued rivalry in 2022, between Max and Lewis, who will be returning to pursue his eighth World Championship and we hope to see new drivers moving up the field to challenge for poses more regularly. The action on and off the track brought in fans in-person and across all platforms. We sold 2.6 million stands in Grandstand around the globe even sold we were limited in our capacity due to COVID. This includes three events with attendance of over 350,000 in US, Great Britain and Mexico. 11 events attracted crowds of over 100,000 people. Our total Cumulative TV audience over the season was 1.55 billion, an increase of 4% over 2020. The average audience per race was 70.3 million with our biggest audiences of 108.7 million tuning in for the season finale in Abu Dhabi. Markets that saw significant growth in cumulative audiences were the Netherlands, Italy, the UK, Spain and the US. Our Sprint events proved to be a draw with a TV average audience uplift of 70% for the weekend. Looking only at markets where like-for-like broadcasting arrangement well maintained across 2020 and 2021, the average audiences was 60.3 million up to plus 13% year-on-year and the best since 2013. Please note that in 2021, despite our broadcasting arrangement in Germany and Brazil changing significantly, we saw positive developments. In Brazil, we are now enjoying far more in-depth coverage and more hours of F1 being broadcasted than 2020. In Germany, Sky's cumulative audiences in 2021 have seen significant growth of plus 55% year-on-year. Our digital reach was very strong. In 2021, social media followers grew 40% to 49.1 million once again making Formula One their fastest-growing major sport league in follower growth. We tallied 1.5 billion engagements with the seven billion video views. F1 web and app unique users video views and page views were all up double digit. The digital share of video minutes consumed increased from 10% in 2020 to 16% in 2021. We look forward to the start of the season of March 2020 in Bahrain. We have a record 23-race Season plan and are scheduled to return to many tracks we could not visit in 2020 and 2021. We are extremely excited to welcome the Miami Grand Prix to the calendar in May and again reached a unanimous agreement with the teams and the FIA to again have the Sprint at three venues this year; Imola, Austria and Brazil. On the driver front, we look forward to the new pairing of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell that have turn over Alex Albon and we welcome a new driver from the grid with Guanyu Zhou joining Alfa Romeo who would provide excitement opportunity to engage and grow our fan base in China. Speaking of the 2022 season, there are many changes to the cars and regulation, all aimed at improving racing and increasing relevance to road car technology. The most visible change will be the switch from 13 inches to 18 inches tires with covers. This along with the other changes to the regulation have the goal of reducing their dynamic way coming off the cars with the aim of allowing for closer racing and more overtaking. Safety is also a focus and the new 2022 cars will be able to absorb more impact at the front and laterally. Additionally, more components of the car are now standardized, which should help keep cost down and promote closer racing. In addition changes will also include the implementation of E10 fuel in the F1 cars comprising 10% ethanol which will reduce CO2 emission and a free zone performance development for the Power Unit from March 1st. We have recently made many exciting announcements driving future growth for our sport. On the racing front, we extended race agreements in China through 2025; Singapore until 2028; Abu Dhabi until 2030; Spain through 2026; Bahrain until 2036; and Circuit of America through 2026. Each of these locations brings something unique to the calendar and we appreciate this long-term partnership in which our sustainability goals will feature prominently. On the sponsorship front, it is a busy time with robust interest and a very strong pipeline of discussion ongoing. We expect to announce further details soon on a number of opportunities that have been progressing in the past few weeks. On media rights, due to the closure of business Fox Sports channels in October 2021, we successfully concluded nine new partnerships across Southeast Asia, securing new broadcaster in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Myanmar. We also extended our existing partnership with Disney Japan and India. In addition to this we will also have a new partnership in the Netherlands for the start of 2022 Championship Season with the Viaplay, NENT's new streaming platform. The 2021 F1 Esports Series Pro Championship presented by Aramco also had a thrilling season. Mercedes' Jarno Opmeer clinched a second consecutive title and secured the Team Championship for Mercedes. The 2021 F1 season audience and the attendance figures broke viewership and engagement records, building upon the huge momentum gathered in 2020. The full series which went through out 2021, achieved over 23 million views across digital platforms, a 103% year-on-year increase. We are already on to the second step of qualifying for 2022 Esports Series and look forward to another fantastic season ahead. We continue to invest in our ESG initiatives to address the biggest issue facing our sports and global communities. Sustainability is a major focus for Formula One and many of our promoters' partners targeting areas where we can have greatest environmental and social impact. Our initiatives can take many forms including 100% sustainable fuels in the 2026 hybrid engine, renewable energy sources, targets around net-zero carbon emission, reducing the capital footprint, increasing recycling efforts, significant savings on overall energy costs and a large initiative working with our promoters partners on event sustainability. A comprehensive ESG briefing note is posted to our website. I encourage you to read it. We recently announced our extended funding commitment to the Formula One Engineering Scholarship Program for underrepresented group through 2025 part of our drive to increase diversity within the sport. This program was launched in 2021 with the selection of 10 scholars in the UK and Italy. And their scholarship covers the full cost of a student's tuition and living expenses for the full duration of their degrees. As part of a wider program of diversity and inclusion initiatives Formula One has also committed to creating apprenticeships and internship across our business. In advance of the Miami Grand Prix, we launched the F1 in School STEM Programme in Miami Gardens. F1 in School is the largest STEM program in the world, operating in over 50 countries and providing hands-on interactive experience to develop key engineering and social skills. We were proud to announce that the W Series will continue to join us at eight Formula One races in 2022. The series will visit five new venues in 2022 including making a step in Asia. We believe in the importance of providing everyone the opportunity to reach the highest level of sport and our partnership with the W Series demonstrates our result to build greater diversity across Formula One. It seems like we just concluded our thrilling 2021 season, but we are ready for the 2022. We believe in the new regulation and the changes to the cars. Combined with old rivalries and new drivers will provide more drama on and off the track. Get ready by watching Season four of Drive to Survive, which airs on Netflix on March 11. I wanted to tell full speed ahead. And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Bye-bye. \nGreg Maffei: Thanks, Stefano and Brian. And to the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and look forward to a productive 2022. And with that operator I'd like to open the line for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Vijay Jayant. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nVijay Jayant: Thanks. Good morning. Couple of questions on sort of buybacks. First on Formula One. Obviously, you have new leverage targets that you talked about today, but you have $2 billion of cash lot of free cash flow generation and obviously EBITDA growth at least that's what we think 2022 onwards. Can you just talk about how we should think about buybacks at Formula One going forward? Conceptually, we do sort of run to your new leverage target which is way below that right now. So that's my first one. And then sort of on SiriusXM, obviously, they announced a special dividend. Curious to understand why special dividend versus sort of a buyback philosophically and you guys selling into the buyback. There's some leakage as you called out on a dividend. Is that really have to do with the Live Nation exchangeable payments this time. And maybe you revert back to another strategy there on return of capital? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Vijay. Lots of questions. Okay, we'll try. On the buybacks on FWON you'd note I'm sure that we did execute on buybacks on FWON effectively. And we're doing both liability management and buyback there when we repurchase those in the money converts. That's effectively both debt reduction and an equity buyback. You've seen that we have quite a lot of cash and free cash flow generation. And we do have an open to buy in terms of a board authorization on repurchase. I don't think we've ever said we're going to buy X in a quarter or we buy -- plan to buy X. But you can look at our history you can look at what we've done what we have for free cash flow and available cash and assume that we will act as we usually do in history. We are also looking to be fair at opportunities that FWON may help the LMAC to SPAC. So far those have been difficult but we do keep in mind that there may be opportunities that arise outside just the share repurchase. But as you noted we have quite a lot of cash and a lot of free cash flow. So I hope that's a round enough answer around our intentions and what other things might come and arise. On SIRI. SIRI I believe has stated that they still intend to do buyback. Obviously that's not entirely in our control. We are on the board but there is an independent group of directors who also have opine on where cash flow should go. They do have some -- their own constraints around how much they want to shrink their available float and there are triggers at things like 90% that they probably are fearful of crossing in a hurry. So they have their own issues around share repurchase. We have our issues around selling into the buyback because it is not actually not taxable to us unless we have a relationship directly with the company. That's complicated given some of the ongoing litigation. So, if we were just to sell and maintain our equity position that has the effect of looking like from a tax perspective a dividend. So the special dividend was not taxable to us and we found it attractive both to help address some of the liability management issues that you pointed out. And to allow us to continue to share repurchase. Hope that helps answer some of your questions. \nVijay Jayant: Thanks for that.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Ben Swinburne. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nBen Swinburne: Hey good morning. Maybe a couple on F1 and then if I could ask a Braves one as well. Stefano what's the pipeline look like for race promotion or new host cities? Obviously there's been a lot of news about Las Vegas. There seems like there's a ton of demand. Something you guys are replacing Russia with something else. Can you just talk about the outlook there? And can you expand the count beyond 23 races realistically? Are the teams on board with that? That's my first one. And maybe for you or Greg on the US Media Rights deal that's coming up you've had this great success with ESPN. How are you thinking about reach versus monetization? You've seen deals like the UFC on a fairly limited platform like ESPN Plus but a big fat check what's your priority as you look forward? And then I'll ask my Braves one after that. \nGreg Maffei: Stefano do you want to comment on races first. Yes. Stefano go ahead. \nStefano Domenicali: It's okay for you Greg? I will go ahead on that. So good morning from London there. Thanks Ben for the question I mean. I just can reiterate one point that is related to the fact that now due to great success that F1 platform is having. The possibility to have new races in the future is still very, very big. I mean if you are talking specifically about the situation this year because of the Russian situation, I just can confirm to you that we have already proven last year. in the last couple of years to be very flexible than not to have any problem in finding possible solution to that. So I can just confirm that could be an option for this year with no problem at all. With regard to other voices around possible venues for the future, yes I mean we can just say that there are a lot of discussion going on. We need to make the right choices for the strategic market that we believe and the right one for Formula 1. But for sure I mean we can expand the calendar because technically speaking as you know we can go up to 25 that is written in our regulation and COVID agreement. And the team would follow our vision on that. I would say that it's already something that we don't have to forget that this year will be the 23 calendar races is the highest number of races in the history of Formula 1. So I think that we can watch that in the right way taking the right decision. We are not in a rush for that. It's just a matter of tuning in on the different possibility that we have in front of us. \nGreg Maffei: Yes. I'll add on that just to say I think Stefano and team and the FIAs and the teams themselves have done a great job managing both through the flexibility of COVID but also increasing number of races. We understand there are constituents who are less enthused about that and we have to do it -- add the races in a way that is logical and doesn't strain the resources of all involved. So, we'll see how 23 goes and as Stefano rightly noted contractually we can go to 25 but we're going to do it in conjunction with our partners. On the media rights, I think you probably know and credit Chase and I'll -- obviously Stefano you can add any comments, that we took a perspective on taking a shorter broader deal, meaning broader coverage over the money on the last deal. And I think that's paid off. We will weigh what's available to us. And I don't think as you know it's a complete trade-off. There will be degrees of access degrees of coverage and there'll be degrees of money. And obviously having the benefit of more US races and more potential US sponsorship or more global sponsorship which wants a US presence, weighs into our thinking about that breadth as well and how long a deal we want to cut. We are very confident that our product will be more desirable in the coming years in the US than it even is today. We continue to build enthusiasm and audience, et cetera. So, it's not just breadth and money, it's also duration. And we'll weigh all those factors. Stefano, you want to add anything on that.\nBen Swinburne: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful.\nStefano Domenicali: No. That was absolutely, spot on Greg. That's exactly the point. We need measure between or the ratio between awareness growth and the return on that is a key point. And also, I have to say, the content that are developing in new market talking about Formula 1 it's something that we are really focused on, because we are having now the possibility of engaging with new fans that needs to understand Formula one with a different cut. So, it's up to us to provide the right quality and the right typology that will be different from the added fans approach. So that's the beauty of this challenge that we have in front of us, but it's all great news I have to say.\nBen Swinburne: Yeah. And then, Greg, I'm sure you know there's a lot in the news also about direct-to-consumer Sports Networks and Diamond Sports and Bally. Can you just remind us, what are your rights at the Braves level in terms of either enabling or not enabling a valid sports service in the Southeast? And then, do you -- obviously you know the cable business well through Charter, et cetera. Do you think the market can bear a direct-to-consumer RSN without putting the full distribution benefits of Pay TV in the region at-risk? Obviously, that's a pretty tricky balancing act. But what's your perspective from a Braves point of view?\nGreg Maffei: There are certain out-of-market rights that could get triggered. But frankly the way it's structured, I don't think it's attractive for most teams to do that. So I don't think that will happen. And you've seen Rob Manfred's comments. I'm sure you have about that those are not owned by Diamond Sinclair Bally whatever we want to call it. And there's not really an incentive the way it's structured to trigger those. How a DTC offering will play over-the-top offering against the RSN seems pretty self-evident. If you can get it on DTC you're going to put more pressure on the negotiation between the MVPDs, traditional MVPDs and any suppliers of an RSN type product. So again, it's a little like that discussion around reach breadth and money and time, there's probably not an absolute relationship with any of those but obviously competitive offerings makes the bundled product that much harder to push.\nBen Swinburne: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from David Karnovsky. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you. Question for Greg or Stefano. With Drive to Survive set to release in a few weeks on Netflix, would be interested to get your thoughts on how you view the importance of the series the Formula One and its growth. Obviously, it's been a notable success especially here in the United States in terms of widening the fan base. Do you see F1 continuing this for the long-term? And is that something where you think there's buy in from the teams?\nGreg Maffei: Stefano, I'll let you go first.\nStefano Domenicali: Okay. Thanks, Greg. I will. It's no doubt David that Drive to Survive, has an incredible effect mainly on the new audiences and also in other new markets like US for sure. And this will continue and I can anticipate to you that you have to stay tuned to the new series, because I've just had the possibility to see and it would be fantastic. And with the right tone and as you can imagine with what has happened last year is there will be a lot of action on. So that's good. But I think that what we have shown as Formula One has been always to be in front of the step change that everything has to happen. So I think that it's important for us to be -- with Drive to Survive with our Netflix friends, up to the moment where we believe that will make show that it's a differentiating factor. It is becoming just a different way to not to speak about Formula one without having or given to Formula One platform maybe added value, maybe, I think it's better to renegotiate and see with Netflix or with the other partners what could be a possibility to do something different in the future. But for sure, this is -- this platform has been a vital point on the growth of awareness, mainly with a young generation and with new comers of Formula 1. And for that we need to thank that vision and the product and the quality of that that has been really very, very good.\nGreg Maffei: I agree with Stefano's comments. Let me -- if I could just add a couple more. I think it's a great partnership. While it clearly has helped us and you've seen growth in our TV audience for example in the U.S. across, we noted 58% this year and our average age over the last few years has come down four years in terms of our who are our fan base. That contrasts dramatically with how other sports -- many other sports have both aging fan bases and declining TV viewership. That having been said, it's a win product for Netflix's too. It was the number one at some point during the year in 27 countries. It is relatively cost-effective programming for them. So I think it's an absolute win. As much as Netflix has done for us, I'd like to think we've done well for Netflix. And when I've talked to Reed and Ted I know they're very enthused about the product. We've clearly seen a change in the mentally the teams. I love to tease Toto about how he hated Drive to Survive in the first season, wouldn't participate, had his -- had a host of reasons. And now I would describe him as a pretty enthusiastic fan. And I think he's represented of what the way most of the teams feel. So it's been a win all the way around. Clearly, grown our sport, not only in the U.S. but around the world, but it is a great thing for Netflix as well. So I hope the marriage continues for a long time.\nDavid Karnovsky: And then, maybe just one more for Stefano would be, interested to get your thoughts on the Kindred Concepts partnership. What's the opportunity in terms of broadening the fan reach here? And can you say what F1's long-term financial commitment is? Thanks.\nStefano Domenicali: So David, can you repeat the question, because I had a cut off of the line, sorry.\nDavid Karnovsky: Sure. Just want to get your high-level view on the Kindred Concept's partnership you guys announced a few weeks ago, what's the opportunity to broaden the fan reach and if it's possible to frame the financial commitment on their side.\nStefano Domenicali: Hello. David. Sorry for that, but I couldn't hear the -- \nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Yes. No, I hope I'm coming through? We just wanted to get your high-level thoughts on Kindred Concepts.\nGreg Maffei: Talking about podcasting -- \nDavid Karnovsky: The opportunity to broaden the fan reach. Any way to frame the financial commitment. \nGreg Maffei: It's about the podcasting, Stefano.\nStefano Domenicali: Okay. Sorry because the line is not very clear to us. And, I mean, this is something for sure that is an opportunity to increase, as I said, the possibility of -- for our fans to be connected in a different way of talking about Formula 1. So potential is great. And I think that together we can do really good stuff, because at the end of the day, its something that is going to be very important to increase, once again, the level of what we see in Formula One, because I know that the podcasting is getting -- and having the bigger uses for the future.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Jason Bazinet. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJason Bazinet: I have sort of a dumb question. Perhaps erroneously I was operating under the assumption that if Siri did a buyback and you participated in that buyback that those proceeds were tax-free to you, because of the tax sharing agreement. But I think at the beginning of the call, in response to Vijay's question, you hinted at some potential complexities related to that. So do you mind just circling back to that and elaborating a bit Mr. Maffei.\nGreg Maffei: Happy to do that, Jason. So if you look at the deal, for example, where Liberty Broadband sells in an agreement, we have directly with Charter back to Charter, that is one kind of a relationship. We do not have that current tax deal with SiriusXM. We have a tax-sharing arrangement related to the fact that we now are an 80% owner but we do not have a deal to sell a certain percentage of our stock or commensurate percentage or holdout percentage with SiriusXM. If we sell into the marketplace that is taxable. If we sell back to the company being over 80% that would not be taxable but we do not currently have that agreement with SiriusXM.\nJason Bazinet: That makes sense. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from David Joyce. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Joyce: Thank you. Two questions, please. First on sponsorship for Formula One. A lot of investors have been wondering why there possibly hasn't been more sponsorship generation since you acquired Formula One, given that there looks like there will still be room in some categories for some global sponsorship deals. And also in light of the large Oracle deal for one of the F1 teams. So what does the sponsorship success at the F1 teams do to your efforts for potentially growing that revenue line some more. And then secondly, just a technicality on LMAC. Do you have to have an acquisition deal announced or fully closed by the end of the two years \u2013 the two-year period early next year. Thank you.\nStefano Domenicali: Well, David with regard to the sponsorship in Formula One, as I stated before in my speech, there are very important negotiations that are in place. So we cannot anticipate the outcome of it yet. Otherwise, we would have done it. What is clear that the world of Formula One is really capable of attracting new sponsorship both for the commercial holder and also for the teams. That means that we are really doing a good job and there is a lot of interest around that platform. With regard to us as I said, I think that in the coming weeks we're going to see some good news that we can share together.\nGreg Maffei: Great. And on LMAC, the SPAC, the base agreement is to get a deal done in two years but there is an opportunity for us to pay a little more money and extend for another year. So I think we have. And there's three months past that \u2013 and then we could extend for another year by paying for some more money. So I think we have a fair amount of runway left if we found something attractive.\nDavid Joyce: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Stephen Laszczyk. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you. A question on F1 ticket prices. We've seen some pretty strong demand tailwinds in the live events space coming out of the pandemic. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about how you work with promoters on the ticket pricing strategy. Maybe the opportunity you see over the next couple of years to benefit alongside these partners on ticket pricing perhaps as those deals renew.\nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Stephen for the question. With regard to ticket pricing, the promoters has the right to \u2013 not the right even more he knows the market by anyone else. So he is able to prepare the different offer that we can offer to the different customer and clients. And of course we know that and we are informed about the strategy because we \u2013 it's important that we give our position on that. But the structure we have so far with our promoter is that this is the business in which we want to give our input because we believe that we can add some value. But they know better that anyone else within the local market, the local interest and of course, if you just look what has happened in the last couple of events and because of the success, there was a new way of dynamic pricing I would say that we saw growing and this is something that could be interesting for the future. But so far with regard to the model this is \u2013 as I mentioned, that belongs to the promoter. If you're talking about the Paddock Club experience of course that's a different story. This is something that we manage. And this is something related to the fact that, we know the market and we believe to present to our customers the right pricing versus the level of and the quality of the service that we want to provide to them. And as always, this is something that we are working on the other way around with the promoters, because they know that market. But on that, it's a business that depending from place to place is managed by us.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thanks for that. And then one for Greg. Not to belabor the Series buyback question too much here. But I think you alluded to a potential legal complication for why you might not have that arrangement with SIRI you might not be able to have that arrangement? Did I hear that correctly? And if so, is there a possibility you could elaborate on that? \nGreg Maffei: Sure. We would have to go \u2013 to get a tax-free deal, we would have to go and negotiate an arrangement with SiriusXM for that buyback. And you might do something where a typical arrangement might be something where you bought back at the average weighted price that, they bought back during the quarter something like that. But to have that kind of relationship would probably put pressure on the independent directors of Sirius at a time, when we've seen other litigation, it's probably a bridge too far at the moment. Perhaps down the road, we'll have something like that, but we have no deals signed and really have done no negotiation about trying to negotiate have an arrangement like that with SiriusXM independence.\nStephen Laszczyk: Got it. Thanks for that.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Doug Mitchelson. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Greg, I actually would love to belabor the SIRI buyback question. So my question Greg is and \u2013 \nGreg Maffei: Doug we should \u2013 got to do this. Keep going. \nDoug Mitchelson: The \u2013 well the question is to the extent special dividends continue, I know that's uncertain. But to the extent, they did is the Liberty bias to use that cash sort of dollar for dollar for share repurchases at Liberty SIRI. Or with the increased cash on hand give you the comfort to lever up those SIRI shares amplifying your ability to repurchase stock, but also sort of increasing the beta of that position. And I do have a second one, I'll just ask right away on Formula One not to look too long term but \u2013 \nGreg Maffei: Okay. We'll come back to that one, Doug. I don't understand that question, because are you saying okay we get the special dividend we can repurchase our own shares. What was your second alternative?\nDoug Mitchelson: Well, second alternative is you have enough cash on hand now that you should have some comfort to be able to pay interest expense for a long period of time. So you could issue it exchangeable or \u2013 have margin loan and with interest rates is still as low as they are you could have a substantial amount of capital.\nGreg Maffei: Yeah. Look I \u2013 first of all, there are probably some constraints on how many more exchangeables, we can do just given liquidity in the market. That's the \u2013 it's a little bit of the same problem that SIRI has on the share repurchase. How much you want to have availability. But it would seem easier Doug just to use the cash we are getting, if there are special dividends to buyback with stock directly. So that would probably be our first inclination rather than double down with another exchangeable and use that cash, we're getting to buy to pay the interest on the exchangeable.\nDoug Mitchelson: And, I think you've sort of suggested this with your comments on this call, but I'll still ask directly Greg, are there any other options for Liberty to close the discount versus SIRI that investors should be thinking about at this point?\nGreg Maffei: Well, there are a lot of choices out there about closing that. If they continue to repurchase stock, we continue to repurchase stock maybe we close out and eventually become the 100% owner. That seems like at some point that's the natural situation. How we get there remains to be seen. But I think all of those will move forward. The degree that we have special dividends and that capital moves up to LSXM, I think that allows us to go attack that discount with more vigor and that's been our hope.\nDoug Mitchelson: All right. Understood. And on Formula One given our Disney coverage not to look too long term, but is there a pathway to take experience in Formula One from a 2D experience to a 3D experience? And is that practical given the races cover so much geography? And the reason, I'm sort of going there is you touched on this a bit in the comments, but I wanted to ask this more directly as well. How much does technology innovation matter with regard to choosing your broadcast partners when you're going through these distribution renewal processes.\nGreg Maffei: I'll take, and let Stefano answer as well. I can imagine few kind of live experiences few kind of sporting events that are better suited to the idea of the Metaverse and for example choosing your camera angle which driver you wish to watch the race through, what angle you want to see, are you looking at the driver, from the driver, across, sideways, around the whole track. I think the opportunities are limitless. And your point about thinking how technology innovation will enter into that, and you can imagine as we have the potential for new digital partners who have expressed an interest in getting into sports programming who have capabilities there all of that opens up a host of new interesting ideas. So I think we're well situated and well suited to have that going forward. Frankly, even the fact that we've had somebody, buy like Electronic Arts by our distribution partner or a video game partner. Electronics obviously having more depth and strength probably than Codemasters did on a stand-alone basis all those lead up to I think more opportunities for us in the future in that idea.\nDoug Mitchelson: Yeah\u2026\nStefano Domenicali: Absolutely. No, no absolutely Greg. What I can say is that the value of our content is the differentiation factor of what we can offer to our customers. No matter, are avid or new or whoever they are. And in that respect, I think that, the mix between, technologies, graphic, music, language is what we are looking for the future. Because we are already studying some new technology that we can use already in the short-term, because I see the interest we see the interest of that -- and we see the request the ability from our fans to see something new. And this is something that we're going to do because that is a topic that is related to who we are. That's been always very important for Formula One. And what I can say with proudness that F1 has been always the leading edge of how we can sell the experience through different channels to our customers. And this is really what we're going to do even stronger in the future.\nDoug Mitchelson: All right. Thank you, folks.\nOperator: We will take our final question\u2026\nStefano Domenicali: Is that a last question?\nOperator: Yes, we will take our final question from Matthew Harrigan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Harrigan: Thank you. I'll self-identify this is a potentially stupid question like Jason just did, because that's an admirable approach. But we've had a number of busted TMT, SPACs. You may have had pretty good prospects but some of it's been in sectors like space that are fairly meme-ish. Is there any way to take advantage of that, through your own SPAC or through some other financial engineering angles, because you're probably better at sorting through the -- get through this if that's a word than some other people out there. Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Matthew. Well, I think, while TMT has had a bunch as you rightly described about busted SPACs. They're probably not alone. When we looked recently couple of weeks back of the last 20 SPACs that have been done, 18 were trading below the $10 price. Now to be fair, most of those SPACs this is probably looking at the results in November December. Most of the SPACs have probably been -- the deals have been cut back in the summer. And I think there -- to your point about finding looking in detritus, I think when you see the wreck and the deals if you try and cut deals that are being done now effectively six to eight months later there may be more opportunities out there. We'd also like to think that we have tried to be clever with some of our investment banking partners and the like to think about, ways to look at things which are just different than the traditional ways SPACs have been utilized. So hopefully, between the somewhat tech wreck, the challenges that have gone on in the SPAC market and some cleverness around structuring and the fact that we have really have an unparalleled group of investors in our SPAC who hopefully would be interested. And I think the reason they came in was to back us with pipe money we can find something. But it is a difficult market. It's one that is challenging for everybody including us. But hopefully there's an opportunity that resides in that challenge.\nMatthew Harrigan: Yeah. Thanks, Greg. Now I know how to pronounce detritus correctly.\nA - Greg Maffei: Happy to help. With that operator, I think, we're done for the day. Thank you everyone for your interest in Liberty Media. And we hope to see you next quarter, if not sooner.\nOperator: This concludes today's call.

            "name": "Greg Maffei",
            "content": "Thank you Courtnee, and good morning to all of you. Today speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali; and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. So, beginning with Liberty [Audio Gap] special dividend. We expect our share though to be about $770 million net of a pass-through to bondholders. We did continue during the quarter repurchasing shares, buying back $189 million across LSXMA and LSXMK shares from November through January. As you know, the discount remains and we therefore were able to repurchase our shares at a look-through price of -- on SIRI of just over $4. We will continue to take advantage of the discount opportunity. We also settled the exchange of our 2.25% Live Nation exchangeable in January for a consideration of $664 million using cash and some margin loan draws. Looking at the underlying business SiriusXM, they recorded record results for the year record high subs revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And also experienced the fifth straight year of improving churn. New car penetration is up to 82% from 78% in the prior year. And we launched 360L in more than 30 new vehicle models across various OEMs in 2021. Now more than 25% of SiriusXM-equipped vehicles sold in the fourth quarter incorporated our new 360L opportunity. We also teamed up with Apple and Discovery during the quarter adding 12-month subscriptions Apple Music and Discovery Plus for new and existing Platinum VIP plan subscribers. We introduced AudioID powered by AdsWizz a listener identity solution enabling marketers to reach and connect with consumers at scale. Stitcher went live with distribution and monetization of popular Crime Junkie podcast in January. We launched new exclusive artist channels including Alicia Keys, David Bowie and Neil Young and we had Small Stage Series of intimate live performances which featured premier artist spanning music generations, including Ed Sheeran, The Go-Go's, H.E.R., J. Cole and John Mayer and more. So a busy quarter. At Live Nation, a great quarter as well. Fan attendance at outdoor events in the U.S. and U.K. in the last five months of 2021 was up 25% versus the same period in 2019. On-site spend the per cap continues to grow at a double-digit rate versus 2019 and ticket sales in October, November and December were the top three months ever in terms of GDP. We have expanded our venue portfolio as well adding 31 new venues in 2021 half through the OCESA acquisition. Every leading indicator in the business reports -- points to a record 2022. Confirmed show count through February is up 30% versus 2019. We sold 45 million tickets for shows this year already and no-show rates are back down to their 2019 levels. Live Nation is entering its strongest multiyear growth chapter in a concert history. Looking at the Formula One Group. On the corporate side, we effectively repurchased 2.2 million FWONA and FWONK shares at an average per share price of $58.59. That included both FWONA share repurchases and an effective share repurchase of FWONK shares due to the purchase of the underlying $64 million of FWONK cash convert that we bought. And now let me turn to F1 and first address the circumstances in Russia. I'm sure you saw our statement this morning. As we said, we are watching the situation with sadness and shock and it's impossible to hold the Russian GP in the current circumstances. Turning back now to 2021. What a cliffhanger ending to a thrilling season. And since then we've had a month of announcements coming out of F1 with more to come. Fans are attending and tuning in. Even with COVID affecting a good chunk of the season we saw very strong attendance, and tuning across many platforms 1.55 billion of cumulative TV viewers with the highest race viewership being 109 million in Abu Dhabi, which rivals that of the Super Bowl. Average attendance was up 14% on like-for-like races. And once again we saw great growth in social media followers, making F1 once again the fastest-growing major sport on social media. We signed numerous race renewals at desirable locations, showing continued strength in our contracted revenue and we continue to further our sustainability initiatives. F1 came in at number two of 102 Global Motor Sports championships evaluated by the FIA on a Sustainable Championship Index, ahead of many such as Extreme E, MotoGP and NASCAR. We are ready to kick off our record-breaking 23-race 2022 Season and we hope to see you at some if not all of the races this year. Turning now to the Braves. We capped off an incredible 2021 with our World Series title. But in addition to that, we had 239 home runs, which ranked second in the National League. We had a 3.88 ERA, which was second best in the annual leagues and there are too many player accolades to even name. The World Series trophy tour will visit 151 stops, celebrating the 151 Seasons of Braves baseball. And we will start 2022 with the highest number of season ticket holders in 22 seasons since 2000. We are sold out of our premium seats for the first time in Truist Park history including all the suites -- the premium seats including all the suites. And Truist Park will hold five stadium concerts in 2022, its highest ever. TK Tower and Innovation Center grand opening took place on February 9th. And in 2021, the Battery had close to nine million visitors including 330,000 during the three World Series games. We also did close on the sale of the Minor League teams in January. The geographic alignment of the teams is important and the Major League reorg of Minor League last year ensured that this will continue. The teams do remain affiliates for future player development. Let me just address the CBA for one moment. We are certainly aware of the latest developments in our discussions with Braves management but are obviously prohibited from commenting any further. We continue to review opportunities for LMAC and SPAC. As I've said before, we do believe the turbulence in the SPAC market has made deals more difficult but actually will benefit Liberty and our strength. And with that let me turn it over to Brian for more financial results. Thanks, Stefano and Brian. And to the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and look forward to a productive 2022. And with that operator I'd like to open the line for questions. Thank you, Vijay. Lots of questions. Okay, we'll try. On the buybacks on FWON you'd note I'm sure that we did execute on buybacks on FWON effectively. And we're doing both liability management and buyback there when we repurchase those in the money converts. That's effectively both debt reduction and an equity buyback. You've seen that we have quite a lot of cash and free cash flow generation. And we do have an open to buy in terms of a board authorization on repurchase. I don't think we've ever said we're going to buy X in a quarter or we buy -- plan to buy X. But you can look at our history you can look at what we've done what we have for free cash flow and available cash and assume that we will act as we usually do in history. We are also looking to be fair at opportunities that FWON may help the LMAC to SPAC. So far those have been difficult but we do keep in mind that there may be opportunities that arise outside just the share repurchase. But as you noted we have quite a lot of cash and a lot of free cash flow. So I hope that's a round enough answer around our intentions and what other things might come and arise. On SIRI. SIRI I believe has stated that they still intend to do buyback. Obviously that's not entirely in our control. We are on the board but there is an independent group of directors who also have opine on where cash flow should go. They do have some -- their own constraints around how much they want to shrink their available float and there are triggers at things like 90% that they probably are fearful of crossing in a hurry. So they have their own issues around share repurchase. We have our issues around selling into the buyback because it is not actually not taxable to us unless we have a relationship directly with the company. That's complicated given some of the ongoing litigation. So, if we were just to sell and maintain our equity position that has the effect of looking like from a tax perspective a dividend. So the special dividend was not taxable to us and we found it attractive both to help address some of the liability management issues that you pointed out. And to allow us to continue to share repurchase. Hope that helps answer some of your questions. Stefano do you want to comment on races first. Yes. Stefano go ahead. Yes. I'll add on that just to say I think Stefano and team and the FIAs and the teams themselves have done a great job managing both through the flexibility of COVID but also increasing number of races. We understand there are constituents who are less enthused about that and we have to do it -- add the races in a way that is logical and doesn't strain the resources of all involved. So, we'll see how 23 goes and as Stefano rightly noted contractually we can go to 25 but we're going to do it in conjunction with our partners. On the media rights, I think you probably know and credit Chase and I'll -- obviously Stefano you can add any comments, that we took a perspective on taking a shorter broader deal, meaning broader coverage over the money on the last deal. And I think that's paid off. We will weigh what's available to us. And I don't think as you know it's a complete trade-off. There will be degrees of access degrees of coverage and there'll be degrees of money. And obviously having the benefit of more US races and more potential US sponsorship or more global sponsorship which wants a US presence, weighs into our thinking about that breadth as well and how long a deal we want to cut. We are very confident that our product will be more desirable in the coming years in the US than it even is today. We continue to build enthusiasm and audience, et cetera. So, it's not just breadth and money, it's also duration. And we'll weigh all those factors. Stefano, you want to add anything on that. There are certain out-of-market rights that could get triggered. But frankly the way it's structured, I don't think it's attractive for most teams to do that. So I don't think that will happen. And you've seen Rob Manfred's comments. I'm sure you have about that those are not owned by Diamond Sinclair Bally whatever we want to call it. And there's not really an incentive the way it's structured to trigger those. How a DTC offering will play over-the-top offering against the RSN seems pretty self-evident. If you can get it on DTC you're going to put more pressure on the negotiation between the MVPDs, traditional MVPDs and any suppliers of an RSN type product. So again, it's a little like that discussion around reach breadth and money and time, there's probably not an absolute relationship with any of those but obviously competitive offerings makes the bundled product that much harder to push. Stefano, I'll let you go first. I agree with Stefano's comments. Let me -- if I could just add a couple more. I think it's a great partnership. While it clearly has helped us and you've seen growth in our TV audience for example in the U.S. across, we noted 58% this year and our average age over the last few years has come down four years in terms of our who are our fan base. That contrasts dramatically with how other sports -- many other sports have both aging fan bases and declining TV viewership. That having been said, it's a win product for Netflix's too. It was the number one at some point during the year in 27 countries. It is relatively cost-effective programming for them. So I think it's an absolute win. As much as Netflix has done for us, I'd like to think we've done well for Netflix. And when I've talked to Reed and Ted I know they're very enthused about the product. We've clearly seen a change in the mentally the teams. I love to tease Toto about how he hated Drive to Survive in the first season, wouldn't participate, had his -- had a host of reasons. And now I would describe him as a pretty enthusiastic fan. And I think he's represented of what the way most of the teams feel. So it's been a win all the way around. Clearly, grown our sport, not only in the U.S. but around the world, but it is a great thing for Netflix as well. So I hope the marriage continues for a long time. Talking about podcasting -- It's about the podcasting, Stefano. Happy to do that, Jason. So if you look at the deal, for example, where Liberty Broadband sells in an agreement, we have directly with Charter back to Charter, that is one kind of a relationship. We do not have that current tax deal with SiriusXM. We have a tax-sharing arrangement related to the fact that we now are an 80% owner but we do not have a deal to sell a certain percentage of our stock or commensurate percentage or holdout percentage with SiriusXM. If we sell into the marketplace that is taxable. If we sell back to the company being over 80% that would not be taxable but we do not currently have that agreement with SiriusXM. Great. And on LMAC, the SPAC, the base agreement is to get a deal done in two years but there is an opportunity for us to pay a little more money and extend for another year. So I think we have. And there's three months past that \u2013 and then we could extend for another year by paying for some more money. So I think we have a fair amount of runway left if we found something attractive. Sure. We would have to go \u2013 to get a tax-free deal, we would have to go and negotiate an arrangement with SiriusXM for that buyback. And you might do something where a typical arrangement might be something where you bought back at the average weighted price that, they bought back during the quarter something like that. But to have that kind of relationship would probably put pressure on the independent directors of Sirius at a time, when we've seen other litigation, it's probably a bridge too far at the moment. Perhaps down the road, we'll have something like that, but we have no deals signed and really have done no negotiation about trying to negotiate have an arrangement like that with SiriusXM independence. Doug we should \u2013 got to do this. Keep going. Okay. We'll come back to that one, Doug. I don't understand that question, because are you saying okay we get the special dividend we can repurchase our own shares. What was your second alternative? Yeah. Look I \u2013 first of all, there are probably some constraints on how many more exchangeables, we can do just given liquidity in the market. That's the \u2013 it's a little bit of the same problem that SIRI has on the share repurchase. How much you want to have availability. But it would seem easier Doug just to use the cash we are getting, if there are special dividends to buyback with stock directly. So that would probably be our first inclination rather than double down with another exchangeable and use that cash, we're getting to buy to pay the interest on the exchangeable. Well, there are a lot of choices out there about closing that. If they continue to repurchase stock, we continue to repurchase stock maybe we close out and eventually become the 100% owner. That seems like at some point that's the natural situation. How we get there remains to be seen. But I think all of those will move forward. The degree that we have special dividends and that capital moves up to LSXM, I think that allows us to go attack that discount with more vigor and that's been our hope. I'll take, and let Stefano answer as well. I can imagine few kind of live experiences few kind of sporting events that are better suited to the idea of the Metaverse and for example choosing your camera angle which driver you wish to watch the race through, what angle you want to see, are you looking at the driver, from the driver, across, sideways, around the whole track. I think the opportunities are limitless. And your point about thinking how technology innovation will enter into that, and you can imagine as we have the potential for new digital partners who have expressed an interest in getting into sports programming who have capabilities there all of that opens up a host of new interesting ideas. So I think we're well situated and well suited to have that going forward. Frankly, even the fact that we've had somebody, buy like Electronic Arts by our distribution partner or a video game partner. Electronics obviously having more depth and strength probably than Codemasters did on a stand-alone basis all those lead up to I think more opportunities for us in the future in that idea. Thank you, Matthew. Well, I think, while TMT has had a bunch as you rightly described about busted SPACs. They're probably not alone. When we looked recently couple of weeks back of the last 20 SPACs that have been done, 18 were trading below the $10 price. Now to be fair, most of those SPACs this is probably looking at the results in November December. Most of the SPACs have probably been -- the deals have been cut back in the summer. And I think there -- to your point about finding looking in detritus, I think when you see the wreck and the deals if you try and cut deals that are being done now effectively six to eight months later there may be more opportunities out there. We'd also like to think that we have tried to be clever with some of our investment banking partners and the like to think about, ways to look at things which are just different than the traditional ways SPACs have been utilized. So hopefully, between the somewhat tech wreck, the challenges that have gone on in the SPAC market and some cleverness around structuring and the fact that we have really have an unparalleled group of investors in our SPAC who hopefully would be interested. And I think the reason they came in was to back us with pipe money we can find something. But it is a difficult market. It's one that is challenging for everybody including us. But hopefully there's an opportunity that resides in that challenge."

            "content": "Thank you Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg mentioned in January, we settled exchanges on the 2.25% Live Nation exchangeable bonds for a total consideration of $664 million. This was funded with cash and margin loan draws including drawing in part on our newly amended Live Nation margin loan, which had upsized in Q4 reflecting appreciation in the underlying Live Nation share price. Pro forma for the exchanges, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and liquid public debt and equity securities of approximately $143 million, which excludes $191 million of cash held at SiriusXM. We also had $925 million of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level. As of yesterday's close, the value of the SiriusXM stock held at Liberty SiriusXM Group was $19.4 billion. And the value of the Live Nation stock held was $8.7 billion. We have $3.1 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings pro forma for the exchanges of the Live Nation exchangeable bonds.  Total pro forma Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.1 billion, which includes $8.9 billion of debt held directly at SiriusXM. Formula One Group had attributed cash liquid investments and liquid public debt and equity securities of $1.6 billion at quarter end which excludes $709 million of cash held at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.4 billion, which includes $2.9 billion of debt at F1 leaving $455 million at the corporate level. As Greg mentioned in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $64 million face value of 1% FWONK converts effectively retiring 1.7 million of underlying FWONK shares. Formula One's $500 million revolver remains undrawn. And Formula One's leverage at the end of the quarter was 4.4 time and we are revising our target leverage range down to be less than 5 times on a go-forward basis. Note, we are still in a period of covenant waiver until March of this year. As previously disclosed beginning in January of 2021, F1 began reclassifying certain components previously reported in other F1 revenue into primary F1 revenue to better align with the way it currently evaluates the business. Components reclassified in the primary F1 revenue include F1 TV subscriptions, F2 and F3 related fees, broadcast origination and support fees, as well as digital advertising, amongst other items. Additional detail including the impact of the revenue reclassification for the years ended 12/31/19 and 2020 can be found in Schedule four of our earnings release posted on our website. At quarter end the Braves Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $142 million, which excludes $102 million of restricted cash that's on their balance sheet. Braves Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $700 million. At the end of the year, Liberty and all of our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants. With that I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. The 2021 season will be discussed for decades to come as one of the greatest. It came down to not just the final race, but to the final match for Max Verstappen to edge pass Lewis Hamilton and win his first World Championship. We look forward to this continued rivalry in 2022, between Max and Lewis, who will be returning to pursue his eighth World Championship and we hope to see new drivers moving up the field to challenge for poses more regularly. The action on and off the track brought in fans in-person and across all platforms. We sold 2.6 million stands in Grandstand around the globe even sold we were limited in our capacity due to COVID. This includes three events with attendance of over 350,000 in US, Great Britain and Mexico. 11 events attracted crowds of over 100,000 people. Our total Cumulative TV audience over the season was 1.55 billion, an increase of 4% over 2020. The average audience per race was 70.3 million with our biggest audiences of 108.7 million tuning in for the season finale in Abu Dhabi. Markets that saw significant growth in cumulative audiences were the Netherlands, Italy, the UK, Spain and the US. Our Sprint events proved to be a draw with a TV average audience uplift of 70% for the weekend. Looking only at markets where like-for-like broadcasting arrangement well maintained across 2020 and 2021, the average audiences was 60.3 million up to plus 13% year-on-year and the best since 2013. Please note that in 2021, despite our broadcasting arrangement in Germany and Brazil changing significantly, we saw positive developments. In Brazil, we are now enjoying far more in-depth coverage and more hours of F1 being broadcasted than 2020. In Germany, Sky's cumulative audiences in 2021 have seen significant growth of plus 55% year-on-year. Our digital reach was very strong. In 2021, social media followers grew 40% to 49.1 million once again making Formula One their fastest-growing major sport league in follower growth. We tallied 1.5 billion engagements with the seven billion video views. F1 web and app unique users video views and page views were all up double digit. The digital share of video minutes consumed increased from 10% in 2020 to 16% in 2021. We look forward to the start of the season of March 2020 in Bahrain. We have a record 23-race Season plan and are scheduled to return to many tracks we could not visit in 2020 and 2021. We are extremely excited to welcome the Miami Grand Prix to the calendar in May and again reached a unanimous agreement with the teams and the FIA to again have the Sprint at three venues this year; Imola, Austria and Brazil. On the driver front, we look forward to the new pairing of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell that have turn over Alex Albon and we welcome a new driver from the grid with Guanyu Zhou joining Alfa Romeo who would provide excitement opportunity to engage and grow our fan base in China. Speaking of the 2022 season, there are many changes to the cars and regulation, all aimed at improving racing and increasing relevance to road car technology. The most visible change will be the switch from 13 inches to 18 inches tires with covers. This along with the other changes to the regulation have the goal of reducing their dynamic way coming off the cars with the aim of allowing for closer racing and more overtaking. Safety is also a focus and the new 2022 cars will be able to absorb more impact at the front and laterally. Additionally, more components of the car are now standardized, which should help keep cost down and promote closer racing. In addition changes will also include the implementation of E10 fuel in the F1 cars comprising 10% ethanol which will reduce CO2 emission and a free zone performance development for the Power Unit from March 1st. We have recently made many exciting announcements driving future growth for our sport. On the racing front, we extended race agreements in China through 2025; Singapore until 2028; Abu Dhabi until 2030; Spain through 2026; Bahrain until 2036; and Circuit of America through 2026. Each of these locations brings something unique to the calendar and we appreciate this long-term partnership in which our sustainability goals will feature prominently. On the sponsorship front, it is a busy time with robust interest and a very strong pipeline of discussion ongoing. We expect to announce further details soon on a number of opportunities that have been progressing in the past few weeks. On media rights, due to the closure of business Fox Sports channels in October 2021, we successfully concluded nine new partnerships across Southeast Asia, securing new broadcaster in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Myanmar. We also extended our existing partnership with Disney Japan and India. In addition to this we will also have a new partnership in the Netherlands for the start of 2022 Championship Season with the Viaplay, NENT's new streaming platform. The 2021 F1 Esports Series Pro Championship presented by Aramco also had a thrilling season. Mercedes' Jarno Opmeer clinched a second consecutive title and secured the Team Championship for Mercedes. The 2021 F1 season audience and the attendance figures broke viewership and engagement records, building upon the huge momentum gathered in 2020. The full series which went through out 2021, achieved over 23 million views across digital platforms, a 103% year-on-year increase. We are already on to the second step of qualifying for 2022 Esports Series and look forward to another fantastic season ahead. We continue to invest in our ESG initiatives to address the biggest issue facing our sports and global communities. Sustainability is a major focus for Formula One and many of our promoters' partners targeting areas where we can have greatest environmental and social impact. Our initiatives can take many forms including 100% sustainable fuels in the 2026 hybrid engine, renewable energy sources, targets around net-zero carbon emission, reducing the capital footprint, increasing recycling efforts, significant savings on overall energy costs and a large initiative working with our promoters partners on event sustainability. A comprehensive ESG briefing note is posted to our website. I encourage you to read it. We recently announced our extended funding commitment to the Formula One Engineering Scholarship Program for underrepresented group through 2025 part of our drive to increase diversity within the sport. This program was launched in 2021 with the selection of 10 scholars in the UK and Italy. And their scholarship covers the full cost of a student's tuition and living expenses for the full duration of their degrees. As part of a wider program of diversity and inclusion initiatives Formula One has also committed to creating apprenticeships and internship across our business. In advance of the Miami Grand Prix, we launched the F1 in School STEM Programme in Miami Gardens. F1 in School is the largest STEM program in the world, operating in over 50 countries and providing hands-on interactive experience to develop key engineering and social skills. We were proud to announce that the W Series will continue to join us at eight Formula One races in 2022. The series will visit five new venues in 2022 including making a step in Asia. We believe in the importance of providing everyone the opportunity to reach the highest level of sport and our partnership with the W Series demonstrates our result to build greater diversity across Formula One. It seems like we just concluded our thrilling 2021 season, but we are ready for the 2022. We believe in the new regulation and the changes to the cars. Combined with old rivalries and new drivers will provide more drama on and off the track. Get ready by watching Season four of Drive to Survive, which airs on Netflix on March 11. I wanted to tell full speed ahead. And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Bye-bye. It's okay for you Greg? I will go ahead on that. So good morning from London there. Thanks Ben for the question I mean. I just can reiterate one point that is related to the fact that now due to great success that F1 platform is having. The possibility to have new races in the future is still very, very big. I mean if you are talking specifically about the situation this year because of the Russian situation, I just can confirm to you that we have already proven last year. in the last couple of years to be very flexible than not to have any problem in finding possible solution to that. So I can just confirm that could be an option for this year with no problem at all. With regard to other voices around possible venues for the future, yes I mean we can just say that there are a lot of discussion going on. We need to make the right choices for the strategic market that we believe and the right one for Formula 1. But for sure I mean we can expand the calendar because technically speaking as you know we can go up to 25 that is written in our regulation and COVID agreement. And the team would follow our vision on that. I would say that it's already something that we don't have to forget that this year will be the 23 calendar races is the highest number of races in the history of Formula 1. So I think that we can watch that in the right way taking the right decision. We are not in a rush for that. It's just a matter of tuning in on the different possibility that we have in front of us. No. That was absolutely, spot on Greg. That's exactly the point. We need measure between or the ratio between awareness growth and the return on that is a key point. And also, I have to say, the content that are developing in new market talking about Formula 1 it's something that we are really focused on, because we are having now the possibility of engaging with new fans that needs to understand Formula one with a different cut. So, it's up to us to provide the right quality and the right typology that will be different from the added fans approach. So that's the beauty of this challenge that we have in front of us, but it's all great news I have to say. Okay. Thanks, Greg. I will. It's no doubt David that Drive to Survive, has an incredible effect mainly on the new audiences and also in other new markets like US for sure. And this will continue and I can anticipate to you that you have to stay tuned to the new series, because I've just had the possibility to see and it would be fantastic. And with the right tone and as you can imagine with what has happened last year is there will be a lot of action on. So that's good. But I think that what we have shown as Formula One has been always to be in front of the step change that everything has to happen. So I think that it's important for us to be -- with Drive to Survive with our Netflix friends, up to the moment where we believe that will make show that it's a differentiating factor. It is becoming just a different way to not to speak about Formula one without having or given to Formula One platform maybe added value, maybe, I think it's better to renegotiate and see with Netflix or with the other partners what could be a possibility to do something different in the future. But for sure, this is -- this platform has been a vital point on the growth of awareness, mainly with a young generation and with new comers of Formula 1. And for that we need to thank that vision and the product and the quality of that that has been really very, very good. So David, can you repeat the question, because I had a cut off of the line, sorry. Hello. David. Sorry for that, but I couldn't hear the -- Okay. Sorry because the line is not very clear to us. And, I mean, this is something for sure that is an opportunity to increase, as I said, the possibility of -- for our fans to be connected in a different way of talking about Formula 1. So potential is great. And I think that together we can do really good stuff, because at the end of the day, its something that is going to be very important to increase, once again, the level of what we see in Formula One, because I know that the podcasting is getting -- and having the bigger uses for the future. Well, David with regard to the sponsorship in Formula One, as I stated before in my speech, there are very important negotiations that are in place. So we cannot anticipate the outcome of it yet. Otherwise, we would have done it. What is clear that the world of Formula One is really capable of attracting new sponsorship both for the commercial holder and also for the teams. That means that we are really doing a good job and there is a lot of interest around that platform. With regard to us as I said, I think that in the coming weeks we're going to see some good news that we can share together. Thanks, Stephen for the question. With regard to ticket pricing, the promoters has the right to \u2013 not the right even more he knows the market by anyone else. So he is able to prepare the different offer that we can offer to the different customer and clients. And of course we know that and we are informed about the strategy because we \u2013 it's important that we give our position on that. But the structure we have so far with our promoter is that this is the business in which we want to give our input because we believe that we can add some value. But they know better that anyone else within the local market, the local interest and of course, if you just look what has happened in the last couple of events and because of the success, there was a new way of dynamic pricing I would say that we saw growing and this is something that could be interesting for the future. But so far with regard to the model this is \u2013 as I mentioned, that belongs to the promoter. If you're talking about the Paddock Club experience of course that's a different story. This is something that we manage. And this is something related to the fact that, we know the market and we believe to present to our customers the right pricing versus the level of and the quality of the service that we want to provide to them. And as always, this is something that we are working on the other way around with the promoters, because they know that market. But on that, it's a business that depending from place to place is managed by us. Absolutely. No, no absolutely Greg. What I can say is that the value of our content is the differentiation factor of what we can offer to our customers. No matter, are avid or new or whoever they are. And in that respect, I think that, the mix between, technologies, graphic, music, language is what we are looking for the future. Because we are already studying some new technology that we can use already in the short-term, because I see the interest we see the interest of that -- and we see the request the ability from our fans to see something new. And this is something that we're going to do because that is a topic that is related to who we are. That's been always very important for Formula One. And what I can say with proudness that F1 has been always the leading edge of how we can sell the experience through different channels to our customers. And this is really what we're going to do even stronger in the future. Is that a last question?"

During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, November 4, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference over to Courtnee Chun, Chief Portfolio Officer. Please, go ahead.\nCourtnee Chun: Thank you. Good morning. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in Liberty Media's most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q or Liberty Media Acquisition's Form S-1 registration statement filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call and Liberty Media and Liberty Media Acquisition expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media or Liberty Media Acquisition Corporation's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Media and SiriusXM, including adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media and SiriusXM Schedules 1 and 2 can be found at the end of the earnings press release issued today, which is available on Liberty Media's website. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Courtnee, and good morning to all of you. Today speaking on the call we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali; and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. This quarter, no surprise, we're going to start with the Braves. World Champions for the first time since 1995. As Hank Aaron said, \u201cIn playing ball, and in life, a person occasionally gets the opportunity to do something great. When that time comes, only two things matter: being prepared to seize the moment and having the courage to take your best swing.\u201d Clearly the Brave did that and I want to thank Ted Turner for reminding us of that quote. So congrats to our tremendous players for their performance to Braves' lifer, Smith whom all the players have such a well-deserved admiration; to Alex Anthopoulos with its excellent mid-season trades; and to the rest of our top-quality Brave's management team, Terry, Mike and Derek and to all the Braves' country most of all. This was an excellent team effort particularly in Game 6 in Houston starting with Soler's ginormous 500-ish 3-run homer in the third that cleared the train tracks and Max Fried pitching the lights out despite getting his let spiked in the first inning. It was an amazing comeback since the All-Star break when we were 44 and 45 and the team wisely invested in talent of that trade deadline, which helped turn the season around and also generated a great financial performance. As I said, the financial performance of the team was as impressive as the on-field performance. The season-to-date baseball revenue per home game is up 11% compared to 2019 and retail per caps are up 33% versus 2019. The Braves ended the season number two in Major League Baseball and regular attendance at 2.3 million. This is close to our historical average of 2.4 million despite only reaching 100% capacity in May. With our on-field success, we've already sold thousands of new season ticket plans for the 2022 season. The battery was booming throughout the playoffs and we estimate crowds were well in excess of 100,000 for each of our World Series Games. Very exciting. So let me turn now to Liberty SiriusXM. This morning we also had some good news going over 80% at SiriusXM through a tax-free exchange and we now expect it to be an 80B. Accordingly all future distributions from Siri will be tax-free. We did continue our share repurchases, repurchasing $98 million across the As and the Ks from August through September -- excuse me, through October. The discount remains and we were purchased at a look-through price on Siri of just over $4. We continue to take advantage of that discount. We also sold our entire iHeart stake at an average price of $25.31 per share for after-tax proceeds of $175 million, the majority of which we sold after quarter end in October. This was well timed and we sold the stock for a 40% pre-tax gain. This investment was intended to take an option in adjacent business. But we like the hand we have at Siri and now have additional cash to fuel incremental buybacks. Looking at Siri itself, strong results for the quarter $616,000 in self-paying net adds, the highest quarterly figure ever recorded. We obtained our full year guidance in nine months. We also reported for the quarter the highest revenue and EBITDA ever. We have a continued focus on growing engagement outside the vehicle, perhaps you saw our very entertaining SiriusXM House ad campaign. And we have been driving impressive growth on the advertising platform with revenue up 31%. We are back to producing live content and experiences with our small stage series and we hosted Dave Matthews, Brandi Carlile, Coldplay and John Mulaney. Further on content, we completed an investment in a content agreement with Audio Up, which will create new original scripted podcast for the Siri platforms. Turning briefly to Live Nation. I noted reports later today, so I really can't comment on the results, other than to say demand is endured and is now being met with supply and we are pleased with the equity performance up 43% year-to-date. Turning to Formula One Group. Thrilling season continues. The lead for the Drivers' Championship has gone back and forth between Max and Lewis. Among the rest of the drivers there are tight competition across the grid. And in the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes and Red Bull are fighting for first, with McLaren and Ferrari in a tight battle for third. Fans are attending and tuning in. We have never seen such a crowd in Austin, for example, which set an F1 attendance record over the race weekend. Of the 400000 people that showed up in Austin, almost 70% were attending their first Grand Prix. Usually this figure is more like in the mid-30s. As Stefano will discuss in a moment, recently results -- released results of F1 fan survey and survey in our demographic is skewing younger, something fewer the sports can claim. We are already looking towards 2022 and have announced a 2023 race calendar. We are excited to have our second race in the U.S. and welcome the Miami GP in May. Demand is high. 275,000 people pre-registered to purchase tickets, as compared to a planned capacity of around 80,000. 1800 people have placed a $5000 deposit for luxury hospitality, Paddock Club and suite sold throughout -- they sold out the available inventory in the first day. We've also sold through the available Grandstand Tickets in the first day. Turning briefly to Almac, we continue to review opportunities. We believe the changes in the SPAC market will ultimately be to Liberty's benefit. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Brian, for more on our financial results.\nBrian Wendling: Thank you, Greg. Hard to follow that, but we'll give it our best try. Good morning everyone. Liberty SiriusXM Group has attributed cash and liquid investments of approximately $165 million, plus $50 million in public debt and equity securities at the corporate level. This excludes, $164 million of cash held directly at SiriusXM. We also have $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level. Note that a portion of our cash will be used in early 2022 to repay our 2.25% Live Nation exchangeable bonds. We issued the redemption notice on these bonds, just after the quarter. Based on the fair value of the liability at quarter end, the amount of cash used would be $532 million. As of November 3rd, the value of our SiriusXM stocks held at Liberty SiriusXM Group, pro forma for the exchange and announced today was almost $20.8 billion and the value of Live Nation stock held was $7.3 billion. We have $3.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.1 billion, which includes $8.9 billion of debt at SiriusXM. As you saw in our earnings release, the Liberty SiriusXM Group outstanding share count as of 10/31 pro forma for the exchange would have been 336 million shares. Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $1.6 billion at quarter end which excludes $585 million of cash at F1. F1 Group also had $194 million of public debt and equity securities. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.4 billion, which includes $2.9 billion of debt at F1, leaving $546 million at the corporate level. F1's $500 million revolvers undrawn and Formula One leverage at the end of the quarter was 5.6 times very near our target range of five times to 5.5 times. Note that we are still in a period of covenant waiver until March of 2022. Please also note, that beginning January 1 2021, F1 began reclassifying certain components, previously reported in other F1 revenue into primary F1 revenue, to better align with the way it currently evaluates the business. Bonus reclassified in the primary F1 revenue include F1 TV subscriptions, F2- and F3-related fees, broadcast origination and support fees and digital advertising among others. Additional detail including the impact of the revenue reclassification for the years ended December 31 2019 and 2020 can be found in Schedule three of our earnings press release posted to our website. At quarter end, Braves Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $134 million which excludes $83 million of restricted cash. Braves Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $721 million. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One.\nStefano Domenicali: Thanks Brian. The 2021 season continues to underline F1 position, as the undisputed pinnacle of Motorsport. Hamilton and Verstappen are still battling for the championship with the lead going back and the fourth almost every race. This continues to produce breathtaking moments such as, in Monza, where they're coming together. So, Max' car end-up on the top of Lewis, and in Austin, where we witnessed a spirited race to emerge ahead, after Towa. Fierce battle extends further down the field. We continue to see varied phases on the podium, including our one and two for McLaren and Monte. Checo finally has tried Red Bull and Ferrari's return to the podium as such. In the Constructors' Championship Mercedes is managing to retain slightly [Indiscernible] with the fight for the third between McLaren and Ferrari even close. We held our second sprint event in Monza which was again well received and certainly impacted the Sunday race outcome. We will hold our third and final sprint event in Brazil and are actively collecting feedback to make the sprint events even better in 2022. As restrictions have started to be easier, we have seen the return of large crowd to our races many ad capacity and the public clap is operating fully once again. We were thrilled as Formula One returned to Zandvoort for the first time since 1985. The Orange Army came out in full force to see Max win and the promoter over delivered in every aspect. In Austin, we welcomed 140,000 fans on Sunday and set a new attendance record with 400,000 over the weekend. We finalized the 2021 calendar with Qatar, still in the weekend of November 19 2021 thereby creating a three-race run in the Middle East to the end of 2021 season. This agreement is part of a longer 10-year deal starting in 2023 after Qatar hosts the FIFA World Cup in 2022. The draw and popularity of Formula One has never been greater. This is reinforced by a recently published Nielsen and Motorsport survey covering 187 countries. Participants identified that exciting is Formula One number one brand attribute with competitive and entertaining also making the top five for the first time. The sample of response was the largest and more diverse ever with female participation doubling and the average age decreasing 4 years to 32. We know we are moving in the right direction and engagement remains strong across all platforms. On the digital front unique users across the F1 website and app this year are up 56% compared to 2020. Social engagement continues to grow reaching nearly 35 million social interaction for the US GP, 52% higher than last U.S. GP n 2019. An 80 million social interaction for the Italian GP a record number for Formula One. The total number of those following F1 on social media now stands at over 45 million. The TV audience are tuning in and we have seen strong growth over 2020 and 2019 in many markets notably France, the Netherlands, Greece, Spain, Hungary and the United States. F1 TV remains a great way for us to catch all the action of the race weekends. The concurrent view for race days have consistently been more than 2.7x higher than 2020 season average. We were excited to announce our 23 race calendar for 2022. It is a great mix of historic and newer venues and we will welcome Miami which will be our second race in the United States. We look forward to this calendar which when paired with the new regulation and car design to create closer racing should produce another framing season. We do hope that 2022 feels more normal than the last two years, but we can draw on the skills we have owned to deal with any challenges we continue to face. Due to the ongoing pandemic condition China will not be included on the 2022 calendar, but will be restored to the calendar as soon as conditions allow and we look forward to our long-term partnership. We remain in the enviable position of demand of races continue to exceed the available supply of weekends. In the area of media rights, we made two announcements. Following the news that the FOX Sport channels in Asia would close. We have reached agreement with multiple broadcaster partners across the region through the end of 2022 season. This ensures that our fans in Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar and the Chinese administrative region of Hong Kong can watch the conclusion of the 2021 season and every race in 2022. We also extended agreements with the Disney in Japan and India's Star India. On the other side of the world, we extended our successful broadcast partnership with Canal Plus in France until 2024 which includes their dedicated F1 channel. Session from four Grand Prix weekends will be broadcasted live and free-to-air along with event highlights throughout the third. We continue to work with our commercial partners and announced the Crypto.com overtake award in addition to their title's sponsorship of our sprint events. It will be awarded to the driver who has completed the most overtakes throughout the entirety of the 2021 season which concurrently is a battle between two veteran drivers battle and a loss. The 2021 F1 Esports Series Pro Championship presented by Aramco is now two events in following our highest ever number of fans attempted to qualify. Drivers continue to race remotely, but they're hugely popular. The competition is broadcasted from the Gfinity Esport terrain in London along with the live shows that include Natalie Pinkham, Tom Deacon and Nick Hamilton. The action in the Pro Championship is middle in the action of the track with multiple podium finishes across the first six races. This year qualification now opened through a challenging official F1 2021 video game developed by Codemasters. In line with our goal of being net zero carbon by 2030, we are aiming to help develop a 100% sustainable fuel for our new generation of Formula One hybrid engines. The focus is on a drop in fuel that can be used as a standard internal combustion engines without any modification to the engine with a target to achieve greenhouse gas emission savings of at least 65% relative to fossil derated petrol. The impact of this development could be enormous with 1.8 billion cars estimated to be on the road by 2030 with only 8% of those being pure battery electric vehicles. Internal combustion engine and hybrid will continue to be essential to air and sea travel, as well as the holy industry. Our partners are all focused on ESG initiatives. William set an ambitious target to be climate positive by 2030. They have launched a comprehensive sustainability strategy that encompasses the climate, biodiversity stewardships, sustainable innovation industry access for all the purpose-driven leadership. On the promoter side, the Grand Prix of the France became the first Grand Prix organizer to receive the highest level of certification by the FIA. Their commitment to a sustainable development approach includes the elimination of single-use plastics. Our mobility plan does significantly reduce the carbon footprint of spectator travel and a strong commitment to social responsibility. With 17 races completed and well on our way to delivering a championship record of 20 to the season despite the ongoing pandemic I'm so incredibly proud of the F1 team and all our partners. The flexibility and the perseverance display all year is truly impressive and it has been so rewarding to see a huge number of fans backup races celebrating our sport. We all see the enormous opportunity in front of us and we are committed to our vision and strategy to grow and continue to evolve our sport. Avanti tutta full speed ahead. And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thank you all. \nGreg Maffei: Thanks Stefano and Brian and to our listening audience. We look forward to seeing you on Thursday, November 18 at our Annual Investor Meeting. The full experience will be offered in person at the New York Times Center and virtually. The link to register can be found on our home page. Please note all in-person attendees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. We appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media, and hope you all stay safe and healthy. And with that, operator, I'd like to open up for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. We take our first question from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBryan Kraft: Thank you. Good morning, and congrats on the Braves' win in the World Series. I had two questions one on iHeart and one on Formula One. On Formula One you seem optimistic that 2022 will mark a return to full operating performance. Assuming that happens, do you think 2022 could be the year where we see for the first time all the benefits of the last four and half years' initiatives coming together wants to drive financial performance that is really a step change higher than 2019 pre-COVID? And then my other question is just curious, Greg, what made you decide to sell your iHeart stock? Is that no longer a strategic interest for SiriusXM? So just what changed there? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: Well, I think \u2013 and I'll let Stefano comment on the Formula One, as well. Look, I think 2022 we're going to see a return of many elements of the business. But will everything come to pass and will we be on a new hire plateau? I think it's just the beginning and we'll see continued success from that level and above. Will everything come together? Always hard to predict, not only because of some of the issues around, what contracts get executed and what sponsorship opportunities. But obviously, could there be the risk of attendance issues into 2022 with COVID to be determined. But I do think we will perform better in 2022 than 2021 and better than we did in 2019 substantially better. And I think the trend continues to be up. Stefano, I don't know what you would add?\nStefano Domenicali: I would say, Greg you synthesize perfectly, what I believe will happen. And of course, you said, one thing that is really important. The success we were able to leave this year despite the pandemic was due to the fact that, we were flexible and with our teams with the partners with the promoters to make sure that we would done this championship. I think that, there is still this thing to put into perspective, because we don't know exactly how the situation will develop of course, with the way that we can see in any case the situation is improving. And I would say that, all the elements and all the initiatives that we put in place in the last couple of years for sure is going to pay back starting from next year.\nGreg Maffei: And as far as iHeart, we took a stake, because we thought it was attractive and it creates a potential optionality. It's not something we're looking to pursue. So it seemed to make sense to recognize the gain, we had and utilize the proceeds to go after our own discount and our own opportunities.\nBryan Kraft: Okay. Thanks to you both. Appreciate it.\nGreg Maffei: Thanks for the question. And thanks for the call out on the Braves.\nOperator: Thank you. We take our next question from Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nVijay Jayant: Good morning. So Greg, did an interesting transaction at least we saw it announced last night. Just curious on, why that was a structure of the stock swap with a shareholder to increase your ownership? It looks like you're past 80% on Sirius now. Does that sort of suggest that Sirius could be qualified as an ATB? If that is the case now you probably have three ATBs with January I think Formula One becomes an ATB. So what does that mean? Are we sort of undoing the whole tracking stock structure? What are the flexibility does that get you? Thoughts on that. Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: Yeah. Well, I think you rightly noted. We undertook a transaction, where we did a tax-free exchange to make an ATB out of this. Our famous line around here is no planner intent and that's one we \u2013 if you ever visit my office, you'll see I have some pillows which say that thank you for courtesy of Courtney. But look our whole idea is to create optionality, we have nothing to announce today about that. We would have gone over 80% probably with Sirius' continued buyback. But the way we transacted with the tax-free exchange, allowed to become an ATB, or something we expect will be in ATB, and great optionality and flexibility. So no plans, but we always like having ATBs. You can't have enough of them.\nVijay Jayant: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And we take our next question from Jeffrey Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Wlodarczak: Good morning. I also congratulate you guys on the Braves' win in World Series. I think that was kind of out of left field for a lot of folks. So congratulations and crossing 80% barrier in SIRI. I guess, I'll follow up on the SIRI question, with the obligatory now that you're at 80% should we expect something like what you're doing with Charter? Will you'll maintain your stake around 80% and then participate in their buyback? And then also on SIRI post their call the US Steel's CEO made some comments that multiple auto manufacturers are ramping their steel deliveries implying the chip shortages have bottomed out beginning in the fourth quarter first quarter. Are you seeing the same thing from your auto partners?\nGreg Maffei: On the \u2013 what we'll do, we obviously have no as I said no plan or intent. We try to keep our options open. We would not be able to sell directly back to \u2013 or sell our stock in the marketplace in a hold at 80%, above 80% unless we had an agreement to sell right to the company, which we do not have at this time. So probably dividends are the tax-free most attractive thing and we can make a determination about whether we want to sell stock into the marketplace and be above 80%. We'll make that determination over time. But I would note that, just \u2013 that would not be tax-free unless we had an ability to sell directly to the company, which we do not have at this moment. On the SAAR and where it's going, I think things will get better. That's our expectation. But clearly, the fact that we had a lower SAAR for many months in the second half of 2021 means the top of the funnel is not as full. We do expect it to recover and refill, but it will mean we'll have a less opportunity for net new net adds \u2013 self-pay net adds, into 2022. So we'll see what it comes. But we are optimistic that our partners will get on track but we'll have a \u2013 we had a great self-pay net-add quarter. It will be a little tougher in 2022 as we head in unless that SAAR refills quickly.\nJeffrey Wlodarczak: Thank you.\nOperator: And we take our next question from Doug Mitchelson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Congratulations on the Braves as well Greg. Now we also to say that. The \u2013 a couple of questions. Was it the 253 letter agreement between Liberty and SIRI required for the ATB consideration? I think you were implying that at comments. I just wanted to be sure.\nGreg Maffei: We constructed a transaction where we had a tax-free exchange of our stock which \u2013 that is what was required until we believe to make this an ATB rather than the alternative which looked like it would might naturally occur which was to have SIRI buy us over \u2013 excuse me buy back their own stock and push us over 80%. So the actions we took, the positive action of doing a tax-free exchange we believe allows us to be an ATB.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks for that. And then maybe I'm missing something simple but what was the purpose of the 253 letter agreement between Liberty and SIRI then? \nGreg Maffei: I'll let Renee [ph] talk about that.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Sure. So the 253 letter agreement was actually the result of a negotiation between us and the Special Committee of SiriusXM. There were some additional materials that needed to be delivered in connection with our tax-free exchange. So we did need to engage in a negotiation with the Special Committee and this was an app that they made and we agreed to.\nDoug Mitchelson: Okay. And then Greg I think it will be hard to get you to talk too much about the relationship between Liberty SIRI and SIRI until the Analyst Day. But let me try this way. Is it more appealing to create long-term value by taking advantage of a persistent discount over a long period as capital becomes available to do so say using SIRI dividends to buy back Liberty SIRI shares, or would you rather close the discount as rapidly as possible? What's the better path to the greatest long-term value creation? \nGreg Maffei: This is a debate since the beginning of time. And you could think about buybacks. Are buybacks to be done to buy your own stock at a discount or to try and get your stock up? We generally favor the long-term path and like a in that alternative. But clearly there is an advantage here to seeing the discount close as well. So I think it's a win-win Doug. \nDoug Mitchelson: Okay. We'll wait for the Analyst Day for more on that one. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We take our next question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBen Swinburne: Great. Thank you. Good morning, I'm not going to say anything about the Braves. It's been covered. On Formula One I guess two questions. I mean all of the sort of qualitative data and quantitative but certainly qualitative datas the sports having an unbelievable year and I'm wondering if you could talk about sort of two opportunities. One in race promotion are you \u2013 do you think you're strengthening kind of your pricing power with your host partners as you move into renewals over the next few years given all the attendance trends? And I realize we just came out of COVID where things were incredibly dicey on that front. But it seems like that part of your business may have more pricing than we've seen in the past. So that's the first one. And then secondly, next year you've got a new car the budget cap, I think steps down again. You guys wanted to make the sport more attractive for new teams in new capital to come into the sport new engine manufacturers. I guess the question is there's a lot of rumors out there. But I'm curious if you are bullish you're going to see that start to really show up in the business in 2022 and beyond? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: So I'll take the first shot and I'll let Stefano obviously add. Look I think we \u2013 the strength of the sport in terms of the demand and the audience helps us in many ways. We've seen new cities want to enter like cutter. We've seen increased performance and increased success of existing promoters for example, Austin adding extra seating. All of those allow us frankly \u2013 both sides of that allow us to get a better deal and to do better both with the new partners and with the existing partners. So all to the good on the promotion side. Stefano, would you add anything on promotion? \nStefano Domenicali: No, I think that you're totally right. And I think that it is not only a matter of but it's also something related to the quality of the show that we are bringing in. What we are also keen on is offering to the people that are attending the race is a unique experience. A physical experience whether it's Formula One or with all the things related to the content partners and sponsored together and leaving us something that is really gimmick. So these were \u2013 the situation these really positive days will help also that dimension of the sport. Then if I may jump in on the second part of the question Greg, if it's okay for you I think that we are talking about new regulation. We are talking about the fact that in the discussion that is coming out you see that the value of each team is getting higher to do the investment that we are doing on the control of the cost. And the fact that the sporting is a very good health despite the COVID situation. And therefore, the fact that we want to have a more attractive sport, doesn't mean that we need to have more things. I mean if \u2013 as we really are focusing on sorry that the new regulation will enable the cost to be more and more easy to be overtaken by the \u2013 one to the other. We have an incredible number of drivers that we can allow that sport. So it's been a matter of finding the right balance with the fact that will be for sure new ones that want to come in. That's the fact we want to give the value that are already into the sport. And then in the discussion that we are all hearing on the public domain about what is the future technological choices that we have taken for the future powertrain, the fact that the new manufacturer are discussing with the FIA. It's a very, very encouraging situation because that means that F1 has taken the right technical decisions for its future. So once again we are in an incredible moment of great opportunity in order to consolidate the sport that is really in a great shape today.\nGreg Maffei: Yes. And I would just echo some of the thoughts I have that Stefano said. Look, one of the important things was to help the ecosystem. And you've really seen the strength of the teams do so much better. And I appreciate all the kind words they now say about Liberty and about Formula One's management. And I think that's because guess what the value of the teams has gone up dramatically and we knew that was necessary. And the actions we took with the budget cap and the like and changing some of the payouts, all were designed to create health of the ecosystem and that's happened. So in many ways, the teams have gotten that success, because it was necessary to make them healthy for us to get -- to build to the next level. And the interest you're seeing of new entrants to come in and buy teams is only an echo of that success. So I think there's a lot of things that are setting up well for us. All those pieces about demand, all those pieces about the strength of the system all set up well for future success. And when I mentioned, the 2022 is going to be a step-upm but certainly not the last one. I think we have a long trajectory of success in front of us, I'm very optimistic.\nBen Swinburne: Yes. That's great. And maybe just if I could do one quick follow-up on the Braves not to sound like Debbie Downer or after the World Series, but there's obviously a lot going on with your RSN partner to say the least. Is that something that concerns you Greg given the revenue contribution that the Braves get from local media rights, as we look into sort of what's happening with Diamond Sports and Dash and, et cetera? \nGreg Maffei: Yes. Of course, it concerns me, but let me give you a few facts. We have a good deal, not an amazing deal. It's not a Dodger like deal at our RSN partner. It is probably one of the two or three most profitable RSNs out there right now. And our territory 12-plus million cable households is the largest territory that baseball has. So when you think about a digital conversion, we're as well set up. And when you think about what the alternatives are to the traditional RSN model if it really does evolve, which I suspect it will over time. We're as well set up and positioned as anybody in baseball, so lots of reasons to think that our RSN partners are doing pretty well. They can continue to do well. The deal is not done until 2028. And we have as I said, alternatives and opportunities, I think in the digital footprint, which are unparalleled in baseball.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We take our next question from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead sir. Your line is open.\nDavid Karnovsky: All right. Thank you. Greg maybe just to follow on your prior comments. Just given the value F1 is creating for the teams and some of the team principles, I think spoke about achieving $1 billion valuations this week, how do you kind of think about what the right economic split should be between F1 and the teams maybe a little longer on? And then just on the FWONA repurchase, do you expect to buy back more shares from here, or was that kind of more about capturing the discount between the A and the K shares as they widen out a lot over the summer?\nGreg Maffei: So I'm very happy to see the teams do well. As I think as I said that was necessary for the success of F1. The new Concorde Agreement has some incentives that is revenue and profits increase. We take back some of that which have been given over the last several deals. I already warned the teams expect more demand from us based on how much success they've had and they smile, so we'll see how those negotiations go. But I'm optimistic that we can continue to have success with the teams, as we've had over the last couple of years and will both benefit. On the FWONA, I think we like both the valuation and we'd obviously try to take advantage of the discount. We'd like to winning twice in that transaction. And as we generate free cash flow at FWON, as we will, you'll see us take actions to try and take advantage of pricing and other things that we think are attractive in the market. But as I said earlier no plan or intent announced today. \nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We take our next question from David Joyce with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Joyce: Thank you. I appreciate the great numbers on the Austin Grand Prix. Could you also provide color on the per cap spending increases during the third quarter, the average attendance both overall at the races as well as with the Paddock Club, just when comparing it to 2019? And then into the fourth quarter for the remaining races, what does the capacity look like? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: Yes. I think that's a hard comparison, because in 2019 we had different timing of different races and shifted around. So it's not a per -- it's not an equivalent thing, because the calendar has shifted. So we're not prepared to dissect that or announce that forecast for 2020 or the fourth quarter yet.\nDavid Joyce: Any further color that we can learn about the per cap spending, if you can compare race to race?\nGreg Maffei: I'll let either Stefano or \u2013 Stefano, do you want to comment? But I think it's coming out.\nStefano Domenicali : Yes. I mean, what I can see is that for sure the last events were people back attending, we see -- we saw the increase, of course, all the products of licensing we have growing up, because there is really the possibility to share experience and have the right product to buy. So that's I can say -- I can see that it's happening. And what I can add on top of what you said, Greg is for sure now we are heading two races where we have capacity, full capacity in grandstands and also Paddock Club. So that is something that we are looking forward to see people back again.\nDavid Joyce: Okay. Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Take the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We take our next question from Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Harrigan : Thank you. Pat Symonds, Formula One's CTO as you know was on CNBC very early this morning, talking about the improvement in the aerodynamics next year, closer following, better passing more excited racing. And then you also elaborated on the developments in the Saudi Aramco JV, I think you formed in March of last year. And he really -- as Stefano alluded to, he really talked about the applications for road vehicles as well as on track. And I almost have the impression that even though, there are some nuances smaller engines and all that, that it might even be bad or compatible for existing vehicles on the road, which I don't know how reasonable that is, but I didn't think that Stefano completely excluded that either or maybe you didn't bother mentioning it. And this is kind of a wild question. But would there be any possibility for your staff to get involved in that? I think it's a mandate. It's just limited to TMT. But clearly this is something that -- I know it's a moonshot, but it sounds like it's pretty interesting given some of the principles involved like Formula One and Saudi Aramco? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: I'll let Stefano comment on some of the technical capabilities and then I'll get on to the SPAC.\nStefano Domenicali: Okay. So, I'll start from the technical. Like first of all, we don't have to forget that F1 has always standing for innovative technologies which can be and has been always the case transfer from the race track to the production vehicle. And this will be the case also in our future development income on new technology in having an engine of a powertrain that will be for sure combined hybrid engine with a sustainable fuel part of this equation. And this will be very beneficial because at the end of the day what we want to claim as a sport platform there are ways to keep the motorsport at the center of the technological research not only for the big OEM, but also for the small teams that can offer that technology into a bigger equation. So, I think that is really we are taking the lead on something that we have been always delivering in this way of treating technology versus motorsport. One thing that I want to underline is we are talking about not sport. We are talking about the motion. So, the balance between the high level of self-development and something that the customer and the fans wants to see on the track is a very important balance to respect. Otherwise, we can see other situation where this has not been the case and the platform will be proven not to be the best one. So, this will be always the future approach of the technological development of Formula One.\nGreg Maffei: And while well our SPAC has a pretty broad mandate and we have nothing to announce today. We certainly do look at the advancement in synthetic fuels and have looked around them as whether there's an investment opportunity whether it's the SPAC or some other part of Liberty. Haven't found one yet but certainly are not adverse to the idea and recognize we're in a unique position to try and see opportunities there and actually promote them as well.\nMatthew Harrigan: But just to push my question and I apologize I almost got the inference from Pat this morning that this could actually be backward compatible for vehicles that are already on the road. I mean am I -- I totally misunderstand that or is that within the scope of what you're trying to do? \nGreg Maffei: Stefano do you want to add on?\nStefano Domenicali: I confirm that. Yes. No, I think that is absolutely yes because that is something that we don't have to forget that all around the world there are billions of car that needs to be considered in the future. So, our answer is with the sustainable fuel the approach that we are working on, of course, with Aramco, but all the oil suppliers that are in the business of Formula One or with the teams are working very hard on that. we give the chance to make sure that this path will be sustainable also for these diesel car will be around the world in the future. \nMatthew Harrigan: Great. Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We take our next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJason Bazinet: I have sort of maybe a strange question. Do you guys have an estimate in terms of how much capital you think Liberty would need to close the NAV discount on Liberty Series if you chose to do that to zero?\nGreg Maffei: No, we don't have an estimation Jason, I'm sorry.\nJason Bazinet: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We take our next question from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nStephen Laszczyk: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. On Formula One it sounds like there was a lot of demand on the promoter side to host Sprint releases for next year. Maybe going off Ben's earlier question could you discuss the extent which we should expect to see Formula One monetize the Sprint races on your calendar next year? And then maybe more broadly I was curious how much more room you think there is for Formula One to expand the Sprint circuit beyond the six or so races over time?\nGreg Maffei: I'll let you handle it Stefano. Stefano did you lose you?\nOperator: It appears so, yes sir. \nGreg Maffei: Okay. I'll take a cut even though I will not be as eloquent as Stefano. Look there is a tension. We like it the fans like it. The teams and the drivers don't necessarily love it partly because they know this system and partly because it incurs potential incremental expense for them against the cost cap. There are revenue opportunities around it, both in terms of greater attendance at events including qualifying, but also in terms of potentially sponsorship of the Sprint race and the like. So, clearly there is an economic reason but there's a tension which we're not dismissive of that it puts more stress on the teams and more stress on the drivers. So, we'll see how we can manage through those two counterpoint elements.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thanks for that. And maybe just one more if I could. On the Asian broadcast deals that you announced, is there any more detail you can provide on these deals maybe in terms of how they compare to FOX Sports? And then maybe the likelihood that they get renewed past 2022?\nGreg Maffei: We're not I think disclosing that. We are somewhat optimistic we can share it from go forward but we're not at this moment can disclose how they compare. Thank you.\nStephen Laszczyk: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And that will conclude our Q&A session today. I would now like to turn the call back over to your host for any additional or closing remarks.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you for your interest in Liberty Media. We do hope to see you on November 18th in person or virtually at our Investor Day. Until then, have a good one.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Greg Maffei",
            "content": "Thank you, Courtnee, and good morning to all of you. Today speaking on the call we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali; and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. This quarter, no surprise, we're going to start with the Braves. World Champions for the first time since 1995. As Hank Aaron said, \u201cIn playing ball, and in life, a person occasionally gets the opportunity to do something great. When that time comes, only two things matter: being prepared to seize the moment and having the courage to take your best swing.\u201d Clearly the Brave did that and I want to thank Ted Turner for reminding us of that quote. So congrats to our tremendous players for their performance to Braves' lifer, Smith whom all the players have such a well-deserved admiration; to Alex Anthopoulos with its excellent mid-season trades; and to the rest of our top-quality Brave's management team, Terry, Mike and Derek and to all the Braves' country most of all. This was an excellent team effort particularly in Game 6 in Houston starting with Soler's ginormous 500-ish 3-run homer in the third that cleared the train tracks and Max Fried pitching the lights out despite getting his let spiked in the first inning. It was an amazing comeback since the All-Star break when we were 44 and 45 and the team wisely invested in talent of that trade deadline, which helped turn the season around and also generated a great financial performance. As I said, the financial performance of the team was as impressive as the on-field performance. The season-to-date baseball revenue per home game is up 11% compared to 2019 and retail per caps are up 33% versus 2019. The Braves ended the season number two in Major League Baseball and regular attendance at 2.3 million. This is close to our historical average of 2.4 million despite only reaching 100% capacity in May. With our on-field success, we've already sold thousands of new season ticket plans for the 2022 season. The battery was booming throughout the playoffs and we estimate crowds were well in excess of 100,000 for each of our World Series Games. Very exciting. So let me turn now to Liberty SiriusXM. This morning we also had some good news going over 80% at SiriusXM through a tax-free exchange and we now expect it to be an 80B. Accordingly all future distributions from Siri will be tax-free. We did continue our share repurchases, repurchasing $98 million across the As and the Ks from August through September -- excuse me, through October. The discount remains and we were purchased at a look-through price on Siri of just over $4. We continue to take advantage of that discount. We also sold our entire iHeart stake at an average price of $25.31 per share for after-tax proceeds of $175 million, the majority of which we sold after quarter end in October. This was well timed and we sold the stock for a 40% pre-tax gain. This investment was intended to take an option in adjacent business. But we like the hand we have at Siri and now have additional cash to fuel incremental buybacks. Looking at Siri itself, strong results for the quarter $616,000 in self-paying net adds, the highest quarterly figure ever recorded. We obtained our full year guidance in nine months. We also reported for the quarter the highest revenue and EBITDA ever. We have a continued focus on growing engagement outside the vehicle, perhaps you saw our very entertaining SiriusXM House ad campaign. And we have been driving impressive growth on the advertising platform with revenue up 31%. We are back to producing live content and experiences with our small stage series and we hosted Dave Matthews, Brandi Carlile, Coldplay and John Mulaney. Further on content, we completed an investment in a content agreement with Audio Up, which will create new original scripted podcast for the Siri platforms. Turning briefly to Live Nation. I noted reports later today, so I really can't comment on the results, other than to say demand is endured and is now being met with supply and we are pleased with the equity performance up 43% year-to-date. Turning to Formula One Group. Thrilling season continues. The lead for the Drivers' Championship has gone back and forth between Max and Lewis. Among the rest of the drivers there are tight competition across the grid. And in the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes and Red Bull are fighting for first, with McLaren and Ferrari in a tight battle for third. Fans are attending and tuning in. We have never seen such a crowd in Austin, for example, which set an F1 attendance record over the race weekend. Of the 400000 people that showed up in Austin, almost 70% were attending their first Grand Prix. Usually this figure is more like in the mid-30s. As Stefano will discuss in a moment, recently results -- released results of F1 fan survey and survey in our demographic is skewing younger, something fewer the sports can claim. We are already looking towards 2022 and have announced a 2023 race calendar. We are excited to have our second race in the U.S. and welcome the Miami GP in May. Demand is high. 275,000 people pre-registered to purchase tickets, as compared to a planned capacity of around 80,000. 1800 people have placed a $5000 deposit for luxury hospitality, Paddock Club and suite sold throughout -- they sold out the available inventory in the first day. We've also sold through the available Grandstand Tickets in the first day. Turning briefly to Almac, we continue to review opportunities. We believe the changes in the SPAC market will ultimately be to Liberty's benefit. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Brian, for more on our financial results. Thanks Stefano and Brian and to our listening audience. We look forward to seeing you on Thursday, November 18 at our Annual Investor Meeting. The full experience will be offered in person at the New York Times Center and virtually. The link to register can be found on our home page. Please note all in-person attendees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. We appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media, and hope you all stay safe and healthy. And with that, operator, I'd like to open up for questions. Well, I think \u2013 and I'll let Stefano comment on the Formula One, as well. Look, I think 2022 we're going to see a return of many elements of the business. But will everything come to pass and will we be on a new hire plateau? I think it's just the beginning and we'll see continued success from that level and above. Will everything come together? Always hard to predict, not only because of some of the issues around, what contracts get executed and what sponsorship opportunities. But obviously, could there be the risk of attendance issues into 2022 with COVID to be determined. But I do think we will perform better in 2022 than 2021 and better than we did in 2019 substantially better. And I think the trend continues to be up. Stefano, I don't know what you would add? And as far as iHeart, we took a stake, because we thought it was attractive and it creates a potential optionality. It's not something we're looking to pursue. So it seemed to make sense to recognize the gain, we had and utilize the proceeds to go after our own discount and our own opportunities. Thanks for the question. And thanks for the call out on the Braves. Yeah. Well, I think you rightly noted. We undertook a transaction, where we did a tax-free exchange to make an ATB out of this. Our famous line around here is no planner intent and that's one we \u2013 if you ever visit my office, you'll see I have some pillows which say that thank you for courtesy of Courtney. But look our whole idea is to create optionality, we have nothing to announce today about that. We would have gone over 80% probably with Sirius' continued buyback. But the way we transacted with the tax-free exchange, allowed to become an ATB, or something we expect will be in ATB, and great optionality and flexibility. So no plans, but we always like having ATBs. You can't have enough of them. On the \u2013 what we'll do, we obviously have no as I said no plan or intent. We try to keep our options open. We would not be able to sell directly back to \u2013 or sell our stock in the marketplace in a hold at 80%, above 80% unless we had an agreement to sell right to the company, which we do not have at this time. So probably dividends are the tax-free most attractive thing and we can make a determination about whether we want to sell stock into the marketplace and be above 80%. We'll make that determination over time. But I would note that, just \u2013 that would not be tax-free unless we had an ability to sell directly to the company, which we do not have at this moment. On the SAAR and where it's going, I think things will get better. That's our expectation. But clearly, the fact that we had a lower SAAR for many months in the second half of 2021 means the top of the funnel is not as full. We do expect it to recover and refill, but it will mean we'll have a less opportunity for net new net adds \u2013 self-pay net adds, into 2022. So we'll see what it comes. But we are optimistic that our partners will get on track but we'll have a \u2013 we had a great self-pay net-add quarter. It will be a little tougher in 2022 as we head in unless that SAAR refills quickly. We constructed a transaction where we had a tax-free exchange of our stock which \u2013 that is what was required until we believe to make this an ATB rather than the alternative which looked like it would might naturally occur which was to have SIRI buy us over \u2013 excuse me buy back their own stock and push us over 80%. So the actions we took, the positive action of doing a tax-free exchange we believe allows us to be an ATB. I'll let Renee [ph] talk about that. This is a debate since the beginning of time. And you could think about buybacks. Are buybacks to be done to buy your own stock at a discount or to try and get your stock up? We generally favor the long-term path and like a in that alternative. But clearly there is an advantage here to seeing the discount close as well. So I think it's a win-win Doug. So I'll take the first shot and I'll let Stefano obviously add. Look I think we \u2013 the strength of the sport in terms of the demand and the audience helps us in many ways. We've seen new cities want to enter like cutter. We've seen increased performance and increased success of existing promoters for example, Austin adding extra seating. All of those allow us frankly \u2013 both sides of that allow us to get a better deal and to do better both with the new partners and with the existing partners. So all to the good on the promotion side. Stefano, would you add anything on promotion? Yes. And I would just echo some of the thoughts I have that Stefano said. Look, one of the important things was to help the ecosystem. And you've really seen the strength of the teams do so much better. And I appreciate all the kind words they now say about Liberty and about Formula One's management. And I think that's because guess what the value of the teams has gone up dramatically and we knew that was necessary. And the actions we took with the budget cap and the like and changing some of the payouts, all were designed to create health of the ecosystem and that's happened. So in many ways, the teams have gotten that success, because it was necessary to make them healthy for us to get -- to build to the next level. And the interest you're seeing of new entrants to come in and buy teams is only an echo of that success. So I think there's a lot of things that are setting up well for us. All those pieces about demand, all those pieces about the strength of the system all set up well for future success. And when I mentioned, the 2022 is going to be a step-upm but certainly not the last one. I think we have a long trajectory of success in front of us, I'm very optimistic. Yes. Of course, it concerns me, but let me give you a few facts. We have a good deal, not an amazing deal. It's not a Dodger like deal at our RSN partner. It is probably one of the two or three most profitable RSNs out there right now. And our territory 12-plus million cable households is the largest territory that baseball has. So when you think about a digital conversion, we're as well set up. And when you think about what the alternatives are to the traditional RSN model if it really does evolve, which I suspect it will over time. We're as well set up and positioned as anybody in baseball, so lots of reasons to think that our RSN partners are doing pretty well. They can continue to do well. The deal is not done until 2028. And we have as I said, alternatives and opportunities, I think in the digital footprint, which are unparalleled in baseball. So I'm very happy to see the teams do well. As I think as I said that was necessary for the success of F1. The new Concorde Agreement has some incentives that is revenue and profits increase. We take back some of that which have been given over the last several deals. I already warned the teams expect more demand from us based on how much success they've had and they smile, so we'll see how those negotiations go. But I'm optimistic that we can continue to have success with the teams, as we've had over the last couple of years and will both benefit. On the FWONA, I think we like both the valuation and we'd obviously try to take advantage of the discount. We'd like to winning twice in that transaction. And as we generate free cash flow at FWON, as we will, you'll see us take actions to try and take advantage of pricing and other things that we think are attractive in the market. But as I said earlier no plan or intent announced today. Yes. I think that's a hard comparison, because in 2019 we had different timing of different races and shifted around. So it's not a per -- it's not an equivalent thing, because the calendar has shifted. So we're not prepared to dissect that or announce that forecast for 2020 or the fourth quarter yet. I'll let either Stefano or \u2013 Stefano, do you want to comment? But I think it's coming out. Take the next question. I'll let Stefano comment on some of the technical capabilities and then I'll get on to the SPAC. And while well our SPAC has a pretty broad mandate and we have nothing to announce today. We certainly do look at the advancement in synthetic fuels and have looked around them as whether there's an investment opportunity whether it's the SPAC or some other part of Liberty. Haven't found one yet but certainly are not adverse to the idea and recognize we're in a unique position to try and see opportunities there and actually promote them as well. Stefano do you want to add on? Thank you. No, we don't have an estimation Jason, I'm sorry. I'll let you handle it Stefano. Stefano did you lose you? Okay. I'll take a cut even though I will not be as eloquent as Stefano. Look there is a tension. We like it the fans like it.

            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Hard to follow that, but we'll give it our best try. Good morning everyone. Liberty SiriusXM Group has attributed cash and liquid investments of approximately $165 million, plus $50 million in public debt and equity securities at the corporate level. This excludes, $164 million of cash held directly at SiriusXM. We also have $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level. Note that a portion of our cash will be used in early 2022 to repay our 2.25% Live Nation exchangeable bonds. We issued the redemption notice on these bonds, just after the quarter. Based on the fair value of the liability at quarter end, the amount of cash used would be $532 million. As of November 3rd, the value of our SiriusXM stocks held at Liberty SiriusXM Group, pro forma for the exchange and announced today was almost $20.8 billion and the value of Live Nation stock held was $7.3 billion. We have $3.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.1 billion, which includes $8.9 billion of debt at SiriusXM. As you saw in our earnings release, the Liberty SiriusXM Group outstanding share count as of 10/31 pro forma for the exchange would have been 336 million shares. Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $1.6 billion at quarter end which excludes $585 million of cash at F1. F1 Group also had $194 million of public debt and equity securities. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.4 billion, which includes $2.9 billion of debt at F1, leaving $546 million at the corporate level. F1's $500 million revolvers undrawn and Formula One leverage at the end of the quarter was 5.6 times very near our target range of five times to 5.5 times. Note that we are still in a period of covenant waiver until March of 2022. Please also note, that beginning January 1 2021, F1 began reclassifying certain components, previously reported in other F1 revenue into primary F1 revenue, to better align with the way it currently evaluates the business. Bonus reclassified in the primary F1 revenue include F1 TV subscriptions, F2- and F3-related fees, broadcast origination and support fees and digital advertising among others. Additional detail including the impact of the revenue reclassification for the years ended December 31 2019 and 2020 can be found in Schedule three of our earnings press release posted to our website. At quarter end, Braves Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $134 million which excludes $83 million of restricted cash. Braves Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $721 million. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One."

            "name": "Stefano Domenicali",
            "content": "Thanks Brian. The 2021 season continues to underline F1 position, as the undisputed pinnacle of Motorsport. Hamilton and Verstappen are still battling for the championship with the lead going back and the fourth almost every race. This continues to produce breathtaking moments such as, in Monza, where they're coming together. So, Max' car end-up on the top of Lewis, and in Austin, where we witnessed a spirited race to emerge ahead, after Towa. Fierce battle extends further down the field. We continue to see varied phases on the podium, including our one and two for McLaren and Monte. Checo finally has tried Red Bull and Ferrari's return to the podium as such. In the Constructors' Championship Mercedes is managing to retain slightly [Indiscernible] with the fight for the third between McLaren and Ferrari even close. We held our second sprint event in Monza which was again well received and certainly impacted the Sunday race outcome. We will hold our third and final sprint event in Brazil and are actively collecting feedback to make the sprint events even better in 2022. As restrictions have started to be easier, we have seen the return of large crowd to our races many ad capacity and the public clap is operating fully once again. We were thrilled as Formula One returned to Zandvoort for the first time since 1985. The Orange Army came out in full force to see Max win and the promoter over delivered in every aspect. In Austin, we welcomed 140,000 fans on Sunday and set a new attendance record with 400,000 over the weekend. We finalized the 2021 calendar with Qatar, still in the weekend of November 19 2021 thereby creating a three-race run in the Middle East to the end of 2021 season. This agreement is part of a longer 10-year deal starting in 2023 after Qatar hosts the FIFA World Cup in 2022. The draw and popularity of Formula One has never been greater. This is reinforced by a recently published Nielsen and Motorsport survey covering 187 countries. Participants identified that exciting is Formula One number one brand attribute with competitive and entertaining also making the top five for the first time. The sample of response was the largest and more diverse ever with female participation doubling and the average age decreasing 4 years to 32. We know we are moving in the right direction and engagement remains strong across all platforms. On the digital front unique users across the F1 website and app this year are up 56% compared to 2020. Social engagement continues to grow reaching nearly 35 million social interaction for the US GP, 52% higher than last U.S. GP n 2019. An 80 million social interaction for the Italian GP a record number for Formula One. The total number of those following F1 on social media now stands at over 45 million. The TV audience are tuning in and we have seen strong growth over 2020 and 2019 in many markets notably France, the Netherlands, Greece, Spain, Hungary and the United States. F1 TV remains a great way for us to catch all the action of the race weekends. The concurrent view for race days have consistently been more than 2.7x higher than 2020 season average. We were excited to announce our 23 race calendar for 2022. It is a great mix of historic and newer venues and we will welcome Miami which will be our second race in the United States. We look forward to this calendar which when paired with the new regulation and car design to create closer racing should produce another framing season. We do hope that 2022 feels more normal than the last two years, but we can draw on the skills we have owned to deal with any challenges we continue to face. Due to the ongoing pandemic condition China will not be included on the 2022 calendar, but will be restored to the calendar as soon as conditions allow and we look forward to our long-term partnership. We remain in the enviable position of demand of races continue to exceed the available supply of weekends. In the area of media rights, we made two announcements. Following the news that the FOX Sport channels in Asia would close. We have reached agreement with multiple broadcaster partners across the region through the end of 2022 season. This ensures that our fans in Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar and the Chinese administrative region of Hong Kong can watch the conclusion of the 2021 season and every race in 2022. We also extended agreements with the Disney in Japan and India's Star India. On the other side of the world, we extended our successful broadcast partnership with Canal Plus in France until 2024 which includes their dedicated F1 channel. Session from four Grand Prix weekends will be broadcasted live and free-to-air along with event highlights throughout the third. We continue to work with our commercial partners and announced the Crypto.com overtake award in addition to their title's sponsorship of our sprint events. It will be awarded to the driver who has completed the most overtakes throughout the entirety of the 2021 season which concurrently is a battle between two veteran drivers battle and a loss. The 2021 F1 Esports Series Pro Championship presented by Aramco is now two events in following our highest ever number of fans attempted to qualify. Drivers continue to race remotely, but they're hugely popular. The competition is broadcasted from the Gfinity Esport terrain in London along with the live shows that include Natalie Pinkham, Tom Deacon and Nick Hamilton. The action in the Pro Championship is middle in the action of the track with multiple podium finishes across the first six races. This year qualification now opened through a challenging official F1 2021 video game developed by Codemasters. In line with our goal of being net zero carbon by 2030, we are aiming to help develop a 100% sustainable fuel for our new generation of Formula One hybrid engines. The focus is on a drop in fuel that can be used as a standard internal combustion engines without any modification to the engine with a target to achieve greenhouse gas emission savings of at least 65% relative to fossil derated petrol. The impact of this development could be enormous with 1.8 billion cars estimated to be on the road by 2030 with only 8% of those being pure battery electric vehicles. Internal combustion engine and hybrid will continue to be essential to air and sea travel, as well as the holy industry. Our partners are all focused on ESG initiatives. William set an ambitious target to be climate positive by 2030. They have launched a comprehensive sustainability strategy that encompasses the climate, biodiversity stewardships, sustainable innovation industry access for all the purpose-driven leadership. On the promoter side, the Grand Prix of the France became the first Grand Prix organizer to receive the highest level of certification by the FIA. Their commitment to a sustainable development approach includes the elimination of single-use plastics. Our mobility plan does significantly reduce the carbon footprint of spectator travel and a strong commitment to social responsibility. With 17 races completed and well on our way to delivering a championship record of 20 to the season despite the ongoing pandemic I'm so incredibly proud of the F1 team and all our partners. The flexibility and the perseverance display all year is truly impressive and it has been so rewarding to see a huge number of fans backup races celebrating our sport. We all see the enormous opportunity in front of us and we are committed to our vision and strategy to grow and continue to evolve our sport. Avanti tutta full speed ahead. And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thank you all. I would say, Greg you synthesize perfectly, what I believe will happen. And of course, you said, one thing that is really important. The success we were able to leave this year despite the pandemic was due to the fact that, we were flexible and with our teams with the partners with the promoters to make sure that we would done this championship. I think that, there is still this thing to put into perspective, because we don't know exactly how the situation will develop of course, with the way that we can see in any case the situation is improving. And I would say that, all the elements and all the initiatives that we put in place in the last couple of years for sure is going to pay back starting from next year. No, I think that you're totally right. And I think that it is not only a matter of but it's also something related to the quality of the show that we are bringing in. What we are also keen on is offering to the people that are attending the race is a unique experience. A physical experience whether it's Formula One or with all the things related to the content partners and sponsored together and leaving us something that is really gimmick. So these were \u2013 the situation these really positive days will help also that dimension of the sport. Then if I may jump in on the second part of the question Greg, if it's okay for you I think that we are talking about new regulation. We are talking about the fact that in the discussion that is coming out you see that the value of each team is getting higher to do the investment that we are doing on the control of the cost. And the fact that the sporting is a very good health despite the COVID situation. And therefore, the fact that we want to have a more attractive sport, doesn't mean that we need to have more things. I mean if \u2013 as we really are focusing on sorry that the new regulation will enable the cost to be more and more easy to be overtaken by the \u2013 one to the other. We have an incredible number of drivers that we can allow that sport. So it's been a matter of finding the right balance with the fact that will be for sure new ones that want to come in. That's the fact we want to give the value that are already into the sport. And then in the discussion that we are all hearing on the public domain about what is the future technological choices that we have taken for the future powertrain, the fact that the new manufacturer are discussing with the FIA. It's a very, very encouraging situation because that means that F1 has taken the right technical decisions for its future. So once again we are in an incredible moment of great opportunity in order to consolidate the sport that is really in a great shape today. Yes. I mean, what I can see is that for sure the last events were people back attending, we see -- we saw the increase, of course, all the products of licensing we have growing up, because there is really the possibility to share experience and have the right product to buy. So that's I can say -- I can see that it's happening. And what I can add on top of what you said, Greg is for sure now we are heading two races where we have capacity, full capacity in grandstands and also Paddock Club. So that is something that we are looking forward to see people back again. Okay. So, I'll start from the technical. Like first of all, we don't have to forget that F1 has always standing for innovative technologies which can be and has been always the case transfer from the race track to the production vehicle. And this will be the case also in our future development income on new technology in having an engine of a powertrain that will be for sure combined hybrid engine with a sustainable fuel part of this equation. And this will be very beneficial because at the end of the day what we want to claim as a sport platform there are ways to keep the motorsport at the center of the technological research not only for the big OEM, but also for the small teams that can offer that technology into a bigger equation. So, I think that is really we are taking the lead on something that we have been always delivering in this way of treating technology versus motorsport. One thing that I want to underline is we are talking about not sport. We are talking about the motion. So, the balance between the high level of self-development and something that the customer and the fans wants to see on the track is a very important balance to respect. Otherwise, we can see other situation where this has not been the case and the platform will be proven not to be the best one. So, this will be always the future approach of the technological development of Formula One. I confirm that. Yes. No, I think that is absolutely yes because that is something that we don't have to forget that all around the world there are billions of car that needs to be considered in the future. So, our answer is with the sustainable fuel the approach that we are working on, of course, with Aramco, but all the oil suppliers that are in the business of Formula One or with the teams are working very hard on that. we give the chance to make sure that this path will be sustainable also for these diesel car will be around the world in the future."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, May 7. I would now like to turn the conference over to Courtnee Chun, Chief Portfolio Officer.

The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media and SiriusXM Schedules 1-3 can be found at the end of the earnings press release issued today, which is available on Liberty Media's website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Courtnee, and good morning to all of you out there. Today, speaking on the call besides myself, will have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali; and Liberty's Chief Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. Beginning with Liberty SiriusXM, we continued our share repurchases, purchasing $114 million across LSXMA and LSXMK shares from February through April. The discount stubbornly remains, and we repurchased at a look-through price of - an series of just over $4 per share. We do expect to continue to take advantage of that stubborn discount opportunity. Our ownership of SiriusXM as of April 26 stood at 77.3%. And looking at SiriusXM itself, they are off to a fast start this year with self-pay sub growth of 83%. Trial starts in the first quarter were the highest in the company's history, and they recorded record low first quarter churn. We're also experiencing rapid growth in off-platform advertising revenue. 360L, the next-generation platform is now in 2 million vehicles, providing valuable data and offering engaging features. We expect it will be about 25% of this year's installs. We are now the largest digital ad platform in North America, reaching almost 2/3 of online audio listeners. We're also continuing at SiriusXM, our extension in the podcast segment with our acquisition of 99% invisible, furthering our content creation capabilities. Turning to Live Nation. You may have seen in today's earnings release from them, concerts are back and a high demand for dates in 2021. In fact, we have booked twice as many shows in '21 as we did in '19. Luke Bryan, the 2021 ACM Entertainer of the Year is going on tour and the Railbird Festival with headliner David Matthews Band is another notable addition. Following up on acquiring the majority stake in Veeps, we've begun our [indiscernible] platform and started equipping 60-plus contract venues to offer turnkey live streaming events. We continue to help artists expand revenue and creative opportunities, connecting them with more fans via Veep and other means. Looking at the Formula One Group, we've had phenomenal racing this season, as Stefano will outline a little bit more in a minute. It's exciting to see the battle between Lewis and Max. It's going to be a very competitive year also for third place and the constructor championships lots of exciting racing. The teams continue to execute well given the ongoing challenges from the pandemic. Turkey will replace Canada in June, showing the sustained demand to expand GPs. We've also extended our agreements with Canada and Japan. Looking forward to the first - we are looking forward to the first spread qualifying race in July at Silverstone and there'll be two more of those during the rest of the season. Drive to survive, our programming on Netflix, continued to grow in popularity in its third season, and it's also getting recognized on the award circuits, both in the U.S. and Canada. And finally, we look forward to seeing all of you in Miami in 2022. Turning to Braves. After a slow start to the season, our record is just under 500, and we are close third in the NL East. A game and half out of first place. We were helped by sweeping the Nets over the last three games. Braves are number-one in home runs this season and also number-one in average attendance almost 16,000 per game. That is if you exclude Texas, which we'd be third, including Texas. Ron Acuna was named National Player of the month for April. Pablo Sentiva had three pinch at home runs in April, the most by any Braves player in a calendar month for - in its franchise history. And as of today, we expect to expand capacity to 100% of fans after opening the season at 33%. Notably, in partnership with Emory Healthcare that Braves are offering vaccine shots before and during games against Philly. Fans who get vaccinated at those games will receive two free tickets to future Braves games as well. And finally, the Braves looking at the battery kits and crop is expected to occupy their office space in July and Papa John's later in the summer. Demand for remaining office space remains very strong. And the Aloft and Omni Hotels had high occupancy on Friday night and Saturday games or nights in March with several sellouts on game nights. We continue to make good progress on Almac to SPAC. The SPAC market has changed in the way we believe is to our benefit as some of the euphoria of January and February has deflated. We believe recent weakness in the pipe market plays well for Liberty, given our strong balance sheet, our capabilities with investors and the support that we have. Finally, we wanted to share with you that we have recently published our SASB disclosure on our website as a part of our ongoing ESG efforts. So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Brian discuss our financial results in a little more detail.\nBrian Wendling: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, restricted cash and liquid investments of approximately $1 billion, excluding $67 million of cash and restricted cash held at SiriusXM. This balance is prior to paying the Formula One Group, $384 million to settle the Live Nation call spread in April. The settlement of the Live Nation call spread was a nontaxable transaction among the tracking stock groups. We also have $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level. Note that a portion of our cash will be used in 2021 to repay our 2.25% Live Nation exchangeable bonds. Based on the fair value of the bonds at quarter end, the amount of cash used would be $514 million. As of May 6, the value of the SiriusXM stock held by Liberty SiriusXM Group was nearly $19 billion, and the value of the Live Nation stock held was $5 billion. We have $3.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.2 billion, which includes $9 billion of debt held directly at SiriusXM. Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $1.4 billion at quarter end. This excludes the $429 million of cash that's held directly at the F1 opco. Post quarter end, Formula One Group received the additional $384 million that we just discussed and proceeds related to the Live Nation call spread. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.6 billion, which include the $2.9 billion of debt held directly down at F1, leaving $724 million at the corporate level. And F1's $500 million revolver remains undrawn. Please note that during the three months ended March 31, '21, F1 began reclassifying certain components previously reported and other revenue into primary F1 revenue to better align with the way management currently evaluates the business. Components reclassified in the primary F1 revenue generally related to F1 TV subscriptions, certain F2 and F3-related fees, broadcast origination and support fees and digital advertising among others. Additional detail on this reclass, including the impact to the years ended 12/31/'19 and '20 can be found in Schedule 3 to our earnings release, which will be posted on website. At quarter end, the Braves Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and restricted cash of $218 million and attributed principal amount of debt of $676 million. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One.\nStefano Domenicali: Thank you, Brian, and good morning also from my side. So 2021 has begun with huge energy and momentum. In the past few weeks, we announced our segment rate in the U.S. in Miami Gardens with a huge and positive reaction from our fans, the teams and all our partners. I think the second wave in the U.S. starting in 2022, provides a great opportunity for our sport and we'll ensure we continue to increase our strong progress and fund growth there. Last week, we announced that we will have Saturday 100-kilometer sprint qualifying formats, our three races in 2021, following unanimous support from all the teams. The events will be exciting for all our fans, provide more on track action over a race weekend, and give our partners and the team's greater commercial opportunities. Silverton, one of the venues for the new format already reported a surge in ticket sale following news that they would be hosting one of this event. We have announced the three years extension of the Japanese Grand Prix. This has always been an important race for Formula One, and we cannot wait for the fans to cheer on their own new pit [Sonoda]. We have extended our partnership with the Canadian Grand Prix by two years. And welcomed the new announced last week by Data Bell Media has entered into agreement to acquire the Montreal-based Canadian race promoter Octane Racing Group which is a great news for the long-term future and development of the race in Canada. While the global situation is still fluid due to COVID-19 pandemic, Formula One has shown it is has the ability to overcome the issue thrown us and continue to race safely. Just last week, we provided this to be the case. While we are not able to race in Canada this year, we have secured the replacement race in Turkey at short notice, meaning we have not reduced the number of races in the calendar for 2021. It is very exciting to see the level of interest from both the new and historic locations to host the Grand Prix, and this gives us a possible option if required for 2021, but also good opportunities for the future. We have had very good conversation with all our promoters. And all of whom expect the races this season to go ahead as planned. And just this week we have had the confirmation that 1,000 fans will attend here in Barcelona, the Spanish Grand Prix. And that molecule will work on approximately 40% of the capacity to the Grand Star for the race in two weeks' time. Alongside the busy start of the year off the track, the racing on the track has been equally exciting and dramatic. We kicked off our 23 racing season in Bahrain and have had three races to-date, which, with close battles, overtaking and the pack closer together than in the recent years. As Ron has mentioned, with this battle for the Championship playing out this could be a golden year for Formula One. This season operating in Bahrain did not disappoint with Verstappen security proposition. It was a trailing race between Max and Lewis that was only decided in the final laps. There were also strong showings by Norris and Perez and the Japanese Yuki Tsunoda scored points in his first F1 race for AlphaTauri. And it looks like, yes, a promising career ahead. The battle for first continuing to McLaren where Max had an amazing start of the line in the rain and carried through for the win. Impressive given his start in third, behind his new teammate, Sergio Perez, Lando Norris made up for a mistake in qualifying and secured a spot on the program, showing the continuous strength of McLaren. Last week and in Portugal, Mercedes standard offers turned challenge the Red Bull as Lewis Hamilton clinched heartfelt victory [indiscernible] with both the starting of Paul and Lewis ahead of the Max Verstappen second the start of the race showed the Red Bull get passed the Mercedes of Hamilton before seven time champions pulled it off brilliant overtakes on both his teammate both his members started to clinch victory. It once, again shows, that there is a real battle underway for this year title, and we are on the - only the three races in. The competition for the third is also fierce in the constructor standing. McLaren is making the early pace. But many teams in the midfield have something to prove. And it is great to see Ferrari hitting tried again. The spectrum of Formula One is resonated with fans and engagement is very high. To date, we have data for the first races across the 24 principal markets we monitor, and this showed TV viewership growth over both 2020 and 2019, with particular strength in Italy, the Netherlands, France, the U.K., the U.S. and Spain. On the digital front, unique users for F1 web and app have been up 77% on the equivalent rates in 2020 and social engagement and also increased with over 30 million interaction in both of the first 2 race suite. We continue to grow our social needs following reached 36.5 million after Emilio GP, up from 35 million for the prior year-end. F1 TV, our OTT product, has also started the second strongly with the record viewing. Big concurrent view at each race weekend at around 3 times higher than the 2020 season average. And engagement measured by the minutes viewed over the course of the weekend is up more than 60% on the last year. We launched an update version of the app for the season that provides many additional features, including high bidder quality and allows us to control the viewing experience. This new version also makes it easier to find content in other collection which includes over 2,000 hours of footage and coverage of Air Grand Prix in the last 50 years, along with our latest series, F2, Chasing the Dream. F1 TV is now available in 188 territories with the premium F1 TV available in 85.Season 3 of Drive to Survive, the boot of March 19 and continues to build mass global popularity for the sport reaching number 1 on Netflix in 27 different countries and also globally. And on all utmost daily basis, we hear an ad about how the show was brought into new non-typical plans. It was great to revisit the 2020 season and see the back story of the virality of many drivers changes. I do highly recommend Episode 9, which is a terrifying exhilarating and expiring. The show was nominated for a sport Emmy for outstanding series sport documentary and made the short list of the documentary category for the U.K. broadcast awards. Heading into the season, we have had numerous sponsorship announcement, we were pleased to renew our global partnership with the DHL, a relationship, which now spans across several decades. This extended partnership will include enhanced involvement in F1 e-sports sites and a present of F1 digital channels. As official partner, we work in June, let's say, as the mark as a Citi card provider and Ferrari train to the official toast of Formula One. In addition, we announced advisers [indiscernible] and as official supplier and welcome global citizen as charity partner for our We Race as One initiative. We continue to engage fans through e-sports and have the very successful series of visual Grand Prix during the off-season. Current drivers, along with home stars and future prospects competed to win a share of the $100,000 price fronting their charities. As part of the continued effort to improve diversity and inclusion in Formula One, as part of our We Race as One initiatives, we announced optimal only qualification route for the F1 e-sports series pro championship. This is our first female only competition, and we hope it will encourage more drivers from the passionate and the talented feminine rating community with the goal of becoming the first ever female driver to be signed by an official F1 e-sports series. In closing, Formula one is off to a strong start in 2021. Building off the foundation put in place the last few years. The ecosystem is absolutely strong, and the competition on the track is trading. I want to thank all the dedicated employees of Formula One for their continuous diligence and hard work, and I hope you will watch the Spanish Grand Prix this weekend. Now I'll turn the call back over to you, Greg. Thank you very much.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Stefano, and thank you, Brian. To the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media. Hope you all stay healthy and safe. And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Jeff at Pivotal Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeff Wlodarczak: I have one on SiriusXM and one on Formula One. Greg, at 77.3% ownership stake in SiriusXM, all else being equal, you're probably going to cross over to 80-plus in the third quarter, your dividends go tax-free. Just wanted to get your latest thoughts on whether SiriusXM is going to raise their dividend materially? Are you happy with the status quo and letting your buyback sort of continue to ride higher? And then on F1, just was wondering about the color on how the $145 million cost cap is going relative to your expectations?\nGreg Maffei: Well, I'll take the SiriusXM, and then I'll let Stefano speak to the cost cap. On SiriusXM, look, we -- I think that your pace may be just slightly aggressive, Jeff. I think it might be, depends on the stock price and where SiriusXM buying, but it might be in Q4. But somewhere, where in one of those two quarters we're likely to pass 80%. Obviously, any dividend policies that are put aside and will be decided by the full Board there. But we have lots of alternatives in which we could either take advantage of those dividends to continue to go after the discount at Siri, at LSXM rather, Siri to increase the dividend or potentially sell into that buyback, hold ourselves above 80% and use the capital to buy back our own stock. So there are really multiple ways to get the same result, which is we are going after the discount. And whether it's -- through their dividend increasing or selling of the buyback, we will be attacking the discount. Stefano, let me turn it to you about the cost cap.\nStefano Domenicali: I mean, Jeff, as you know, cost cap has been one of the most important and significant things that Formula One introduced this year. This has had an effect not only because of the savings that the teams will make in the future, but also in the change of mentality that the major team has to apply with the organization to make sure that they can really be effective with a different line of expenditure. And this is just the first step into a new way of managing sport in Formula One. And I think that if -- if I say -- if I see what is happening around the world that everyone is focused just on the revenue side, I think the Formula One has just started the path with these on the other way around. Of course, revenue is crucial. But now we have just taken the first step into the cost cap. We're going to take all the cost cap in other areas that are not closed in this moment as we hedge for the future. But we are pretty sure that these are also the comments of the team. This has been a huge step in making sure that the Formula One is sustainable for its future.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Dan at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Greg, just on the cash balance at Liberty Formula One, I think it's $1.8 billion and all signs point to a strong year ahead. I'm just wondering, at what point does that become excess cash in the eyes of Liberty? And then Stefano, I have a couple of questions around drivers, which I'm wondering if you could humor me a bit. I have gotten questions from investors around the retirement of Lewis Hamilton and [Button]. What that might mean to the sport and sort of the business? I know they're coming back for next year at least. But as you think about that and sort of the outsized impact they have on the sport, how do you -- how would you see as we think about it if it matters and how you manage that? And then I was curious, moving to Miami, obviously, a huge opportunity in the whole U.S. market as well. Is an American driver important in F1 in terms of driving popularity here in the U.S.? And do you have any expectations that we might see one anytime soon?\nGreg Maffei: So on the cash at Formula One, really at the holdco level, F1 level. I think a couple of things to note. First of all, we put that cash in place to ensure the health of the whole ecosystem, not only the Formula One business that we own, but really the teams and to ensure that we had liquidity, and we did use some of that liquidity for some teams during the pandemic. We still have uncertainty about exactly what our revenues will be in 2021. You've heard already, we've had to cancel, for example, Canada and input Turkey in. We are getting paid for that, but those are at way reduced levels compared to what we would get if we had full fans. So we have a fairly large contingency in our own budgeting for the potential that we will not get the kind of revenues that we hope. And therefore, that cash is useful. You may also know that we committed in the forward purchase agreement with Almac with SPAC that at least $250 million would go towards the pipe in any transaction if we were to complete one. So I think we're going to see potential for opportunities in that market that could be attractive to us as the SPAC market gets more turbulent, that plays to way, as I mentioned earlier, our strengths, and we may want to put some of the cash in that. But as the year progresses and we get more certainty about promoter revenue, we will look at what we do with that cash and how to utilize it and what is the most efficacious way to deliver value to our shareholders.\nStefano Domenicali: If I may now, Greg, to then to the question related to the drivers with regard to the Lewis Hamilton. Surely, Lewis Hamilton is a great asset. He is doing an incredible job on the sporting side and in terms of image, he was able to broad the Formula One in other areas that were not really specifically related to Formula One. But Formula One itself is strong, strong and -- drivers changes are always in a place where one day they may retire. I don't know what Lewis was doing. We are talking with him, but of course, now he's focused on his actual season. He's fully boosted to make sure that he'll be the only driver that is going to win the eight titles in the history of Formula 1. But Formula 1 is solid, robust. And for sure, whatever will be decision of Lewis, Formula 1 will react and we'll move forward. The good news is that it Lewis, as we all hope, will stay, will have an incredible season in front of him with the new cars, with the new challenge. And for sure, this will may be very interesting of him. If he will decide a different way around, I mean, the good news is that in Formula One, we have so many good drivers today, but at least the challenge will be even stronger. Therefore, of course, whatever will be the decision of Lewis, we will respect, but Formula 1 is really solid and strong. With regard to Miami with the American drivers, it is important, the answer for me is very clearly yes. We have -- we are working with teams try to understand what is really the possibility for American driver to come to the attention of Formula 1 team in the short term. This could come. I don't see that being very pragmatic and realistic coming in the next two, three years, but maybe after, yes. I know that our team is watching the good drivers, that if they'll ready will be a big boost for the American fans, because as we know, faces drivers, they put the enthusiasm passion that people want to see these guys. And therefore, the hope that we have is that very, very soon, we have American drivers competing again, so the others in the Formula One channel.\nOperator: So we will now take our next question from Bryan from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Kraft: Would you be willing to size the onetime settlement impact on the first quarter Formula 1 revenue for us? And then separately, it's great to see Miami on the calendar next year. I know it's something you've been working on for three or four years. What can you tell us about your plans for the event, maybe contrasted to Austin? And how significant do you think it will be for growing the sport in the U.S.?And related to that, your broadcast contract with ESPN is up for renewal, I believe, after next season. So how are you thinking about the opportunity with ESPN given their focus on ESPN+ with now Miami in the calendar and also just the general progress you've made so far in growing in the U.S.\nGreg Maffei: So I'll let Brian talk about onetime events in the first quarter revenue. And then I want to weigh a little on ESPN, and I'll let Stefano as well. But Brian start.\nBrian Wendling: Yes. As it relates to the settlement, we can't comment on the specific details, but it did impact our results. But obviously, when you look at the year-over-year results, the fact that we had the one race versus zero last year and the proportion of revenue recognition was the material driver of that, but we can't comment on the specific settlement.\nGreg Maffei: On the issue of the U.S. and ESPN, look, when we put that up among the various broadcasters and alternatives a little over a year ago, Chase, and it was in total agreement, had the belief that we were going to grow in popularity in the U.S. and our hand would be strengthened. So due to both now doing Miami and doing Drive to Survive and all the other things that we have going on from fan festivals to digital engagement, all of those are building our interest in the U.S. And as Stefano noted, in many groups that heretofore have not been interested. I have people coming up to me who are say I'm obsessed with Formula 1 because of the Drive to Survive who were not our typical audience, women, teenagers, many different kinds of audiences that are expanding, which is great. When we did that, we took a shorter deal with ESPN that had a broader set of exposure for us in terms of their eyeballs, but it was not the highest current deal we can get. And it was not the longest deal we could get. And in fact, it was the opposite. It was the least amount of money. The most amount of eyeballs and the shortest period of time because our belief was that we would have a much stronger hand as we went forward among the various bidders. I think that is a good bet. It's one that we are winning. And all the reasons we -- I outlined before, I think we will be much strengthened when we go to renew against that ESPN and other alternatives. Stefano, what might you add?\nStefano Domenicali: Yes, absolutely. Again, I think that the good news is that we are talking about another race in U.S. Miami with different culture, with different scenario, with different way that we're going to structure the shore of it. And incredible news that in just couple of weeks after our announcement, the attention with regard to this event is really massive. And the expectation of getting at the level that we want. And this is the reason why we are building a good series of communication, good series of program in terms of communication with the American community because we want to maximize everything out of it. And I cannot anticipate, for example, one thing that it would be fantastic. We're going to share with the state of Miami Gardens and with Miami Dolphins, the races in Monaco because they want to start leaving the atmosphere. And this will provide us the right platform in order to be ready, to make sure that the value that we're going to generate from U.S. will be even higher. And that's really the fundamental strategical thinking BI and the fact that we're going to have to raise in the United States.\nOperator: So we will now take our next question from Vijay of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nVijay Jayant: I have a couple of questions on Formula One, primarily probably for Stefano. So when we see -- think about rate promotions this year, obviously, you have 23 races, but without fans and different proportions of fans. How should we think about that? Are you getting full promoter revenues? Are you splitting some of it based on fans? Or getting none and hosting the race? Any sort of thought, because that's sort of the segment that has the most variability? And then we've been seeing a lot more press releases coming out on sponsorship on Formula One with your new sponsorship head. Is there a resurgence on that? Or is this that sort of more like a formalized process of letting us know on what's going on because that seems to be probably one of the biggest growth drivers for the business long term. And finally, one for Greg. Maybe it's a little premature, but Formula One becomes an ATB in January next year. And you'll have Brave with an ATB. Any thoughts on what structurally you could do or would we like to do if you can share?\nStefano Domenicali: Thank you, Vijay. I mean the first question related to the fact that, of course, we have a situation that is evolving with regard to the attendances of the people on track. Greg has already mentioned, the things that we need to monitor race by race, case by case. Of course, the more we going ahead and the more it's likely that the opening up to the fans will not have a direct effect on the revenues. But we have also content that we cannot get into details where we don't expect that the attendance of the people has no influence on what would be the effect on our earnings. So this is really a mixed situation, but we need to evolve and manage it. I didn't get the question with regard to the sponsorship, Vijay, can you repeat that for me, please?\nVijay Jayant: Yes, Stefano, I mean there's been a lot of announcements, Zoom and bunch of other sponsors you've announced more recently. I'm just trying to understand, is there sort of a resurgence in sponsorship in Formula One more recently? Or is it sort of just better disclosure for us on -- \nStefano Domenicali: No. It's just to show. Yes, it is just to show the fact that the interest to Formula One is getting back again at the level that we really believed is the right one. So the fact that despite the pandemic situation, there are big companies that are willing to engage and be our partner is a great sign of trust of what we are billing as the future. And we need to expect this approach even stronger in the future.\nGreg Maffei: And as far as structural changes, we have no plan or intent today. Obviously, having a second ATB today, the only ATB we have at Liberty Media is the Braves. Having a second ATB gives us flexibility if we want to create other spins, but we have no plans today.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from David at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDavid Karnovsky: On F1, we've seen Disney move to shut down it Star Sports channels in parts of Asia. Just kind of interested to know how this impacts you first directly as they believe to carry the series, but at a higher level, how you think this pivot to streaming will impact demand for sports content in some of those regions? And then maybe just separately, Stefano, as you noted, viewership seems to be a nice uptick through the races so far. Would be interested to get your thoughts on how much you attribute this to the Red Bull, Mercedes dynamic versus kind of the actions that you've taken off the track like Drive to Survive, the social media outreach?\nStefano Domenicali: Well, if I may start on the second, David, it's clear that a better show has better engagement and better entertainment for the people, there's no doubt. But I think is -- that is one element. The other element is the fact that we really are engaging with more people that loved Formula One. Therefore, the fact that we are able to attract other people through different way of languages that we're not used to use before, I think it's also helping the fact that the viewership and the engagement in any case. We're talking about not only the TV, we are talking about social media platform and other element of OTT is showing that there is a lot of attention, there's a lot of interest for sure. What is happening on the track is very, very important. There's no doubt about it. And this is for sure a good sign for us.\nGreg Maffei: I would totally agree. But Stefano, why don't you comment on the rest of it and then I'll add, first part?\nStefano Domenicali: Sorry, Greg, the line went dead on my side.\nGreg Maffei: David, you want to repeat your question, because I don't think we covered it.\nDavid Karnovsky: Sure. Yes. Sure. The question was about Disney and their move to shut down Star Sports, I think, in parts of Asia, just wondering how that impacts you directly and then just your higher level thoughts on pivot to streaming and kind of what that means for demand?\nGreg Maffei: So Stefano, why don't you start commenting, and then I'll give you -- I may have some views.\nStefano Domenicali: Yes, absolutely. I mean, David, we have, of course, as you know, agreement in place. So we are expecting for that to be totally enforced. So we don't see that as a problem. We see actually a big opportunity to the growth of the TV and the engagement figure in that part of the world to find other solution that we are working on, of course. But on this year financially, we don't expect anything that would happen.\nGreg Maffei: So I think more broadly, if you think about it, more platforms is a positive for us. And yes, the -- some of the legacy platforms may decline or even be eliminated. But in general, we're seeing new platforms created, that's an opportunity. It's just the way that here in the United States, when satellite came eventually when Fios and other fiber alternatives came that created upwards pressure on content costs because of the bidding. I think we'll see the same opportunity in what we do worldwide at Formula One. As usual, we'll have a trade-off on exposure, which free TV offers against, in many cases, higher short-term rates for either over-the-top platforms or even more streaming platforms over -- excuse me, platforms like satellite or streaming. And we'll weigh our total dollars available against the exposure that we get for things like generally promoter value and advertising and sponsorship. So I'm not so worried about these sort of slower growth platforms being cut out by people like Disney. I'm much more excited about the opportunity from the digital platforms, particularly as they gain scale.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from David Beckel at Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nDavid Beckel: I've got two on F1. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the Sprint race format, maybe get a little bit of the thinking behind that. It obviously adds incremental value to your partners, but more specifically as it relates to future economics. Do you expect this to add to the value you receive from your partners? Or is it more a part of just adding value to existing agreements? And then secondarily, going back to the U.S. market and with the TV deal in play in a few years, I'm sure you paid attention to what WWE did with Peacock. I'm wondering if there's potential to sort of leverage the F1 TV over-the-top platform in a way that can sort of augment the broader value of your U.S. broadcast and overall TV distribution rights.\nStefano Domenicali: Thank you, David. I mean, with regard to the Sprint format, I think it will be beneficial to everyone. And if I have to answer straight away to the last part of the question, of course, we expect to have more value out of it. First of all, there is action that will be very, very positive in terms of effect to the organizer. Because from Friday to Saturday to Sunday there is something to talk about, a lot of action, a lot of intensity. That is something that, of course, this will have a direct effect on the people that will attend to the race. And this has been welcomed by all the organizer in a very positive way. On top of it, of course, that's something that we are offering to our media partners because we can create a new content. We can generate other form of entertainment in adding a new format that has been never deployed before. And also to the partners that have the chance to -- and the previous to be in the grid for two times also on Saturday, even if the Formula will be different, of course, because the center of the weekend will be the race on Sunday. But this is something that we believe that will have also an impact on the financial point of view on top of adding the excitement of what these rates is all about. With regard to the market, the TV deal and the leverage related to all our tools, I -- we believe that this will enable us to discuss in the future even a different way of integrating our TV OTT platform that is going very, very well, in the future. And therefore, that will allow us to benefit from the fact that the market will be interested in our sport and the commitment will be very, very big on our side to make sure that this will happen.\nGreg Maffei: Yes. If I could add to what Stefano said on that, I think we certainly watch what WWE did with Peacock, and I think it's somewhat indicative with a longer-term trend. Very few sports, I believe, have enough content to run their own over-the-top service as their primary vehicle. There's just not enough content. If you look at WWE, they have tonnage certainly compared to us. And so F1 TV is a great asset for our connectivity with fans and for connectivity, in particular, with our most hardcore fans. But I don't believe it supplants our traditional broadcasters or other over-the-top broadcasters who are looking for a broader set of content and relationships. So I think we certainly watch that, and it's consistent with our view. And I do believe we'll see that kind of opportunity with larger digital platforms and F1 TV can be a part of the solution with them, as you know.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from David Joyce at Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Joyce: Two topics. One is just another clarification on the promotion. When you say it was on time, does that mean it was just one promoter or are there any others lingering out there? And was it within the range of a typical promotion fee? And then secondly on sponsorship, how should we think about the range of sponsorship types of contracts? Like how many are based solely on particular races versus the proportion of revenue that is really allocated across the season? And are there any other types of sponsorship structures?\nGreg Maffei: I can do the promoter piece. It was one race, and that's disclosed in our earnings release. As it relates to the typical range of promoter agreement, we have a wide range. So it falls within that range, yes.\nStefano Domenicali: So David, with regard to the sponsorship, the range, of course, depends on what is the package that we have. We have official partner, and we have other kind of relationship and all are related to really the race that they're going to have. And so we have different packages that are all consistent with the season with old and top championship and not related to the single event itself.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from John at Gabelli. Please go ahead.\nJohn Tinker: Switching gears, sports gambling is hot. Probably saw, I think, draft kings, slings and so on. What are the benefits you might see from your RSM with [Jim Claire or Bowley] as it is now. Is there anything that could actually help you?\nGreg Maffei: John, I'll take a shot at that. I think that those benefits are going to be secondary, not primary. They'll have increased fan engagement. There may be -- Georgia is soon to open. It appears, gambling will become legal in the near term in Georgia, it's not today. But it has been on the ballot and it looks fairly favorably inclined in the next -- in the coming cycles. I think that will provide us some marginal revenue opportunities there, but I don't view it as a huge revenue line for us directly. I view it secondarily of the interest. And if we and baseball, MLB can capitalize on that more broadly, I think it just continues to draw the fans, not clear that -- no revenue line on the P&L directly.\nJohn Tinker: And just as a second broader question on sports. You've probably seen some of the disruption in England, where the fans became engaged in -- \nGreg Maffei: Around the Super League you're saying?\nJohn Tinker: Yes. Just generally, a fair amount of disruption there, a lot of talk of PE companies buying into Serie A, nothing happening. Is that an area where you might see some opportunities? Or is the fact that the soccer team can be relegated just makes it too risky.\nGreg Maffei: No. John, we have looked at as many of those opportunities we can possibly find. We do think it's interesting. We can debate what's going on at each of the various leagues and where they stand in terms of their cycles on likely broadcast revenue and other kinds of opportunities. We do look to our experience both at Formula One and the Braves And what we'd like to think we have done positively with the league at Formula One and what we'd like to think we've done positively around things like Truist and the battery and think about how we can apply the skill sets that are inside Liberty at various opportunities. And we tried to sell that we have been a good and long-term strong owner, perhaps different than some of the other Americans have been perceived or how PE has been perceived. We haven't yet found the intersection of where somebody wants us and we want them, but we continue to look. And I do think that disruption over there does create opportunity. We have gone through -- we watch with Super League with interest because before we were involved with Formula One, there was certainly the talk of a breakaway at Formula One, which did not come to pass. And we feel very confident we understand breakaway very well, and I think we pretty much eliminated that opportunity or potential at Formula One as a side note.\nOperator: So we will now take our final question for today's conference from Matthew at Benchmark. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Even apart from Max Verstappen literally banging wheels with Lewis Hamilton, they seemed relatively course off track. You probably had the most competitive season since I think 2012, your Ferrari is coming back, McLaren, Lando Norris, et cetera. And I was just curious, you've got a broad suite of changes coming next year on -- to make the competition on the track more competitive. Does it give you any pause that you're making a lot of revisions next year even if this year seemingly is proceeding so strong right out of the gates? And do you have any ability to reassess any of this, or just continue to roll along?\nStefano Domenicali: Matthew, the changes has been already discussed. The teams are already working on new cars and new regulation. And the train has already left the station. So we are very pleased because we are convinced that this year is already a great season, but next year with the changes that has been planned will be another great opportunity to showcase what is Formula One in terms of the ability of always keeping the attention at the center. And therefore, there's no other things about checking everything in terms of all the states to make sure that the changes that will be massive, because next year will highlight the possibility to have a bigger fight, not only two or three drivers, but even more, and that's the objective.\nGreg Maffei: Yes, if I could add just -- look, we're lucky this season is great. The work that was done in the concrete agreement by Chase, Ross Brawn and others, we hope to only increase the competitive next year. And we're very excited as Stefano noted about what's going on now and even more excited about what we can do in the coming years. I think with that, operator, we are done for the day. Thank you very much to all of you listening out there for your interest in Liberty, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, if not sooner.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Greg Maffei",
            "content": "Thank you, Courtnee, and good morning to all of you out there. Today, speaking on the call besides myself, will have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali; and Liberty's Chief Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. Beginning with Liberty SiriusXM, we continued our share repurchases, purchasing $114 million across LSXMA and LSXMK shares from February through April. The discount stubbornly remains, and we repurchased at a look-through price of - an series of just over $4 per share. We do expect to continue to take advantage of that stubborn discount opportunity. Our ownership of SiriusXM as of April 26 stood at 77.3%. And looking at SiriusXM itself, they are off to a fast start this year with self-pay sub growth of 83%. Trial starts in the first quarter were the highest in the company's history, and they recorded record low first quarter churn. We're also experiencing rapid growth in off-platform advertising revenue. 360L, the next-generation platform is now in 2 million vehicles, providing valuable data and offering engaging features. We expect it will be about 25% of this year's installs. We are now the largest digital ad platform in North America, reaching almost 2/3 of online audio listeners. We're also continuing at SiriusXM, our extension in the podcast segment with our acquisition of 99% invisible, furthering our content creation capabilities. Turning to Live Nation. You may have seen in today's earnings release from them, concerts are back and a high demand for dates in 2021. In fact, we have booked twice as many shows in '21 as we did in '19. Luke Bryan, the 2021 ACM Entertainer of the Year is going on tour and the Railbird Festival with headliner David Matthews Band is another notable addition. Following up on acquiring the majority stake in Veeps, we've begun our [indiscernible] platform and started equipping 60-plus contract venues to offer turnkey live streaming events. We continue to help artists expand revenue and creative opportunities, connecting them with more fans via Veep and other means. Looking at the Formula One Group, we've had phenomenal racing this season, as Stefano will outline a little bit more in a minute. It's exciting to see the battle between Lewis and Max. It's going to be a very competitive year also for third place and the constructor championships lots of exciting racing. The teams continue to execute well given the ongoing challenges from the pandemic. Turkey will replace Canada in June, showing the sustained demand to expand GPs. We've also extended our agreements with Canada and Japan. Looking forward to the first - we are looking forward to the first spread qualifying race in July at Silverstone and there'll be two more of those during the rest of the season. Drive to survive, our programming on Netflix, continued to grow in popularity in its third season, and it's also getting recognized on the award circuits, both in the U.S. and Canada. And finally, we look forward to seeing all of you in Miami in 2022. Turning to Braves. After a slow start to the season, our record is just under 500, and we are close third in the NL East. A game and half out of first place. We were helped by sweeping the Nets over the last three games. Braves are number-one in home runs this season and also number-one in average attendance almost 16,000 per game. That is if you exclude Texas, which we'd be third, including Texas. Ron Acuna was named National Player of the month for April. Pablo Sentiva had three pinch at home runs in April, the most by any Braves player in a calendar month for - in its franchise history. And as of today, we expect to expand capacity to 100% of fans after opening the season at 33%. Notably, in partnership with Emory Healthcare that Braves are offering vaccine shots before and during games against Philly. Fans who get vaccinated at those games will receive two free tickets to future Braves games as well. And finally, the Braves looking at the battery kits and crop is expected to occupy their office space in July and Papa John's later in the summer. Demand for remaining office space remains very strong. And the Aloft and Omni Hotels had high occupancy on Friday night and Saturday games or nights in March with several sellouts on game nights. We continue to make good progress on Almac to SPAC. The SPAC market has changed in the way we believe is to our benefit as some of the euphoria of January and February has deflated. We believe recent weakness in the pipe market plays well for Liberty, given our strong balance sheet, our capabilities with investors and the support that we have. Finally, we wanted to share with you that we have recently published our SASB disclosure on our website as a part of our ongoing ESG efforts. So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Brian discuss our financial results in a little more detail. Thank you, Stefano, and thank you, Brian. To the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media. Hope you all stay healthy and safe. And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions. Well, I'll take the SiriusXM, and then I'll let Stefano speak to the cost cap. On SiriusXM, look, we -- I think that your pace may be just slightly aggressive, Jeff. I think it might be, depends on the stock price and where SiriusXM buying, but it might be in Q4. But somewhere, where in one of those two quarters we're likely to pass 80%. Obviously, any dividend policies that are put aside and will be decided by the full Board there. But we have lots of alternatives in which we could either take advantage of those dividends to continue to go after the discount at Siri, at LSXM rather, Siri to increase the dividend or potentially sell into that buyback, hold ourselves above 80% and use the capital to buy back our own stock. So there are really multiple ways to get the same result, which is we are going after the discount. And whether it's -- through their dividend increasing or selling of the buyback, we will be attacking the discount. Stefano, let me turn it to you about the cost cap. So on the cash at Formula One, really at the holdco level, F1 level. I think a couple of things to note. First of all, we put that cash in place to ensure the health of the whole ecosystem, not only the Formula One business that we own, but really the teams and to ensure that we had liquidity, and we did use some of that liquidity for some teams during the pandemic. We still have uncertainty about exactly what our revenues will be in 2021. You've heard already, we've had to cancel, for example, Canada and input Turkey in. We are getting paid for that, but those are at way reduced levels compared to what we would get if we had full fans. So we have a fairly large contingency in our own budgeting for the potential that we will not get the kind of revenues that we hope. And therefore, that cash is useful. You may also know that we committed in the forward purchase agreement with Almac with SPAC that at least $250 million would go towards the pipe in any transaction if we were to complete one. So I think we're going to see potential for opportunities in that market that could be attractive to us as the SPAC market gets more turbulent, that plays to way, as I mentioned earlier, our strengths, and we may want to put some of the cash in that. But as the year progresses and we get more certainty about promoter revenue, we will look at what we do with that cash and how to utilize it and what is the most efficacious way to deliver value to our shareholders. So I'll let Brian talk about onetime events in the first quarter revenue. And then I want to weigh a little on ESPN, and I'll let Stefano as well. But Brian start. On the issue of the U.S. and ESPN, look, when we put that up among the various broadcasters and alternatives a little over a year ago, Chase, and it was in total agreement, had the belief that we were going to grow in popularity in the U.S. and our hand would be strengthened. So due to both now doing Miami and doing Drive to Survive and all the other things that we have going on from fan festivals to digital engagement, all of those are building our interest in the U.S. And as Stefano noted, in many groups that heretofore have not been interested. I have people coming up to me who are say I'm obsessed with Formula 1 because of the Drive to Survive who were not our typical audience, women, teenagers, many different kinds of audiences that are expanding, which is great. When we did that, we took a shorter deal with ESPN that had a broader set of exposure for us in terms of their eyeballs, but it was not the highest current deal we can get. And it was not the longest deal we could get. And in fact, it was the opposite. It was the least amount of money. The most amount of eyeballs and the shortest period of time because our belief was that we would have a much stronger hand as we went forward among the various bidders. I think that is a good bet. It's one that we are winning. And all the reasons we -- I outlined before, I think we will be much strengthened when we go to renew against that ESPN and other alternatives. Stefano, what might you add? And as far as structural changes, we have no plan or intent today. Obviously, having a second ATB today, the only ATB we have at Liberty Media is the Braves. Having a second ATB gives us flexibility if we want to create other spins, but we have no plans today. I would totally agree. But Stefano, why don't you comment on the rest of it and then I'll add, first part? David, you want to repeat your question, because I don't think we covered it. So Stefano, why don't you start commenting, and then I'll give you -- I may have some views. So I think more broadly, if you think about it, more platforms is a positive for us. And yes, the -- some of the legacy platforms may decline or even be eliminated. But in general, we're seeing new platforms created, that's an opportunity. It's just the way that here in the United States, when satellite came eventually when Fios and other fiber alternatives came that created upwards pressure on content costs because of the bidding. I think we'll see the same opportunity in what we do worldwide at Formula One. As usual, we'll have a trade-off on exposure, which free TV offers against, in many cases, higher short-term rates for either over-the-top platforms or even more streaming platforms over -- excuse me, platforms like satellite or streaming.

            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, restricted cash and liquid investments of approximately $1 billion, excluding $67 million of cash and restricted cash held at SiriusXM. This balance is prior to paying the Formula One Group, $384 million to settle the Live Nation call spread in April. The settlement of the Live Nation call spread was a nontaxable transaction among the tracking stock groups. We also have $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level. Note that a portion of our cash will be used in 2021 to repay our 2.25% Live Nation exchangeable bonds. Based on the fair value of the bonds at quarter end, the amount of cash used would be $514 million. As of May 6, the value of the SiriusXM stock held by Liberty SiriusXM Group was nearly $19 billion, and the value of the Live Nation stock held was $5 billion. We have $3.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.2 billion, which includes $9 billion of debt held directly at SiriusXM. Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $1.4 billion at quarter end. This excludes the $429 million of cash that's held directly at the F1 opco. Post quarter end, Formula One Group received the additional $384 million that we just discussed and proceeds related to the Live Nation call spread. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.6 billion, which include the $2.9 billion of debt held directly down at F1, leaving $724 million at the corporate level. And F1's $500 million revolver remains undrawn. Please note that during the three months ended March 31, '21, F1 began reclassifying certain components previously reported and other revenue into primary F1 revenue to better align with the way management currently evaluates the business. Components reclassified in the primary F1 revenue generally related to F1 TV subscriptions, certain F2 and F3-related fees, broadcast origination and support fees and digital advertising among others. Additional detail on this reclass, including the impact to the years ended 12/31/'19 and '20 can be found in Schedule 3 to our earnings release, which will be posted on website. At quarter end, the Braves Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and restricted cash of $218 million and attributed principal amount of debt of $676 million. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One. Yes. As it relates to the settlement, we can't comment on the specific details, but it did impact our results. But obviously, when you look at the year-over-year results, the fact that we had the one race versus zero last year and the proportion of revenue recognition was the material driver of that, but we can't comment on the specific settlement."

            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning also from my side. So 2021 has begun with huge energy and momentum. In the past few weeks, we announced our segment rate in the U.S. in Miami Gardens with a huge and positive reaction from our fans, the teams and all our partners. I think the second wave in the U.S. starting in 2022, provides a great opportunity for our sport and we'll ensure we continue to increase our strong progress and fund growth there. Last week, we announced that we will have Saturday 100-kilometer sprint qualifying formats, our three races in 2021, following unanimous support from all the teams. The events will be exciting for all our fans, provide more on track action over a race weekend, and give our partners and the team's greater commercial opportunities. Silverton, one of the venues for the new format already reported a surge in ticket sale following news that they would be hosting one of this event. We have announced the three years extension of the Japanese Grand Prix. This has always been an important race for Formula One, and we cannot wait for the fans to cheer on their own new pit [Sonoda]. We have extended our partnership with the Canadian Grand Prix by two years. And welcomed the new announced last week by Data Bell Media has entered into agreement to acquire the Montreal-based Canadian race promoter Octane Racing Group which is a great news for the long-term future and development of the race in Canada. While the global situation is still fluid due to COVID-19 pandemic, Formula One has shown it is has the ability to overcome the issue thrown us and continue to race safely. Just last week, we provided this to be the case. While we are not able to race in Canada this year, we have secured the replacement race in Turkey at short notice, meaning we have not reduced the number of races in the calendar for 2021. It is very exciting to see the level of interest from both the new and historic locations to host the Grand Prix, and this gives us a possible option if required for 2021, but also good opportunities for the future. We have had very good conversation with all our promoters. And all of whom expect the races this season to go ahead as planned. And just this week we have had the confirmation that 1,000 fans will attend here in Barcelona, the Spanish Grand Prix. And that molecule will work on approximately 40% of the capacity to the Grand Star for the race in two weeks' time. Alongside the busy start of the year off the track, the racing on the track has been equally exciting and dramatic. We kicked off our 23 racing season in Bahrain and have had three races to-date, which, with close battles, overtaking and the pack closer together than in the recent years. As Ron has mentioned, with this battle for the Championship playing out this could be a golden year for Formula One. This season operating in Bahrain did not disappoint with Verstappen security proposition. It was a trailing race between Max and Lewis that was only decided in the final laps. There were also strong showings by Norris and Perez and the Japanese Yuki Tsunoda scored points in his first F1 race for AlphaTauri. And it looks like, yes, a promising career ahead. The battle for first continuing to McLaren where Max had an amazing start of the line in the rain and carried through for the win. Impressive given his start in third, behind his new teammate, Sergio Perez, Lando Norris made up for a mistake in qualifying and secured a spot on the program, showing the continuous strength of McLaren. Last week and in Portugal, Mercedes standard offers turned challenge the Red Bull as Lewis Hamilton clinched heartfelt victory [indiscernible] with both the starting of Paul and Lewis ahead of the Max Verstappen second the start of the race showed the Red Bull get passed the Mercedes of Hamilton before seven time champions pulled it off brilliant overtakes on both his teammate both his members started to clinch victory. It once, again shows, that there is a real battle underway for this year title, and we are on the - only the three races in. The competition for the third is also fierce in the constructor standing. McLaren is making the early pace. But many teams in the midfield have something to prove. And it is great to see Ferrari hitting tried again. The spectrum of Formula One is resonated with fans and engagement is very high. To date, we have data for the first races across the 24 principal markets we monitor, and this showed TV viewership growth over both 2020 and 2019, with particular strength in Italy, the Netherlands, France, the U.K., the U.S. and Spain. On the digital front, unique users for F1 web and app have been up 77% on the equivalent rates in 2020 and social engagement and also increased with over 30 million interaction in both of the first 2 race suite. We continue to grow our social needs following reached 36.5 million after Emilio GP, up from 35 million for the prior year-end. F1 TV, our OTT product, has also started the second strongly with the record viewing. Big concurrent view at each race weekend at around 3 times higher than the 2020 season average. And engagement measured by the minutes viewed over the course of the weekend is up more than 60% on the last year. We launched an update version of the app for the season that provides many additional features, including high bidder quality and allows us to control the viewing experience. This new version also makes it easier to find content in other collection which includes over 2,000 hours of footage and coverage of Air Grand Prix in the last 50 years, along with our latest series, F2, Chasing the Dream. F1 TV is now available in 188 territories with the premium F1 TV available in 85.Season 3 of Drive to Survive, the boot of March 19 and continues to build mass global popularity for the sport reaching number 1 on Netflix in 27 different countries and also globally. And on all utmost daily basis, we hear an ad about how the show was brought into new non-typical plans. It was great to revisit the 2020 season and see the back story of the virality of many drivers changes. I do highly recommend Episode 9, which is a terrifying exhilarating and expiring. The show was nominated for a sport Emmy for outstanding series sport documentary and made the short list of the documentary category for the U.K. broadcast awards. Heading into the season, we have had numerous sponsorship announcement, we were pleased to renew our global partnership with the DHL, a relationship, which now spans across several decades. This extended partnership will include enhanced involvement in F1 e-sports sites and a present of F1 digital channels. As official partner, we work in June, let's say, as the mark as a Citi card provider and Ferrari train to the official toast of Formula One. In addition, we announced advisers [indiscernible] and as official supplier and welcome global citizen as charity partner for our We Race as One initiative. We continue to engage fans through e-sports and have the very successful series of visual Grand Prix during the off-season. Current drivers, along with home stars and future prospects competed to win a share of the $100,000 price fronting their charities. As part of the continued effort to improve diversity and inclusion in Formula One, as part of our We Race as One initiatives, we announced optimal only qualification route for the F1 e-sports series pro championship. This is our first female only competition, and we hope it will encourage more drivers from the passionate and the talented feminine rating community with the goal of becoming the first ever female driver to be signed by an official F1 e-sports series. In closing, Formula one is off to a strong start in 2021. Building off the foundation put in place the last few years. The ecosystem is absolutely strong, and the competition on the track is trading. I want to thank all the dedicated employees of Formula One for their continuous diligence and hard work, and I hope you will watch the Spanish Grand Prix this weekend. Now I'll turn the call back over to you, Greg. Thank you very much. I mean, Jeff, as you know, cost cap has been one of the most important and significant things that Formula One introduced this year. This has had an effect not only because of the savings that the teams will make in the future, but also in the change of mentality that the major team has to apply with the organization to make sure that they can really be effective with a different line of expenditure. And this is just the first step into a new way of managing sport in Formula One. And I think that if -- if I say -- if I see what is happening around the world that everyone is focused just on the revenue side, I think the Formula One has just started the path with these on the other way around. Of course, revenue is crucial. But now we have just taken the first step into the cost cap. We're going to take all the cost cap in other areas that are not closed in this moment as we hedge for the future. But we are pretty sure that these are also the comments of the team. This has been a huge step in making sure that the Formula One is sustainable for its future. If I may now, Greg, to then to the question related to the drivers with regard to the Lewis Hamilton. Surely, Lewis Hamilton is a great asset. He is doing an incredible job on the sporting side and in terms of image, he was able to broad the Formula One in other areas that were not really specifically related to Formula One. But Formula One itself is strong, strong and -- drivers changes are always in a place where one day they may retire. I don't know what Lewis was doing. We are talking with him, but of course, now he's focused on his actual season. He's fully boosted to make sure that he'll be the only driver that is going to win the eight titles in the history of Formula 1. But Formula 1 is solid, robust. And for sure, whatever will be decision of Lewis, Formula 1 will react and we'll move forward. The good news is that it Lewis, as we all hope, will stay, will have an incredible season in front of him with the new cars, with the new challenge. And for sure, this will may be very interesting of him. If he will decide a different way around, I mean, the good news is that in Formula One, we have so many good drivers today, but at least the challenge will be even stronger. Therefore, of course, whatever will be the decision of Lewis, we will respect, but Formula 1 is really solid and strong. With regard to Miami with the American drivers, it is important, the answer for me is very clearly yes. We have -- we are working with teams try to understand what is really the possibility for American driver to come to the attention of Formula 1 team in the short term. This could come. I don't see that being very pragmatic and realistic coming in the next two, three years, but maybe after, yes. I know that our team is watching the good drivers, that if they'll ready will be a big boost for the American fans, because as we know, faces drivers, they put the enthusiasm passion that people want to see these guys. And therefore, the hope that we have is that very, very soon, we have American drivers competing again, so the others in the Formula One channel. Yes, absolutely. Again, I think that the good news is that we are talking about another race in U.S. Miami with different culture, with different scenario, with different way that we're going to structure the shore of it. And incredible news that in just couple of weeks after our announcement, the attention with regard to this event is really massive. And the expectation of getting at the level that we want. And this is the reason why we are building a good series of communication, good series of program in terms of communication with the American community because we want to maximize everything out of it. And I cannot anticipate, for example, one thing that it would be fantastic. We're going to share with the state of Miami Gardens and with Miami Dolphins, the races in Monaco because they want to start leaving the atmosphere. And this will provide us the right platform in order to be ready, to make sure that the value that we're going to generate from U.S. will be even higher. And that's really the fundamental strategical thinking BI and the fact that we're going to have to raise in the United States. Thank you, Vijay. I mean the first question related to the fact that, of course, we have a situation that is evolving with regard to the attendances of the people on track. Greg has already mentioned, the things that we need to monitor race by race, case by case. Of course, the more we going ahead and the more it's likely that the opening up to the fans will not have a direct effect on the revenues. But we have also content that we cannot get into details where we don't expect that the attendance of the people has no influence on what would be the effect on our earnings. So this is really a mixed situation, but we need to evolve and manage it. I didn't get the question with regard to the sponsorship, Vijay, can you repeat that for me, please? No. It's just to show. Yes, it is just to show the fact that the interest to Formula One is getting back again at the level that we really believed is the right one. So the fact that despite the pandemic situation, there are big companies that are willing to engage and be our partner is a great sign of trust of what we are billing as the future. And we need to expect this approach even stronger in the future. Well, if I may start on the second, David, it's clear that a better show has better engagement and better entertainment for the people, there's no doubt. But I think is -- that is one element. The other element is the fact that we really are engaging with more people that loved Formula One. Therefore, the fact that we are able to attract other people through different way of languages that we're not used to use before, I think it's also helping the fact that the viewership and the engagement in any case. We're talking about not only the TV, we are talking about social media platform and other element of OTT is showing that there is a lot of attention, there's a lot of interest for sure. What is happening on the track is very, very important. There's no doubt about it. And this is for sure a good sign for us. Sorry, Greg, the line went dead on my side. Yes, absolutely. I mean, David, we have, of course, as you know, agreement in place. So we are expecting for that to be totally enforced. So we don't see that as a problem. We see actually a big opportunity to the growth of the TV and the engagement figure in that part of the world to find other solution that we are working on, of course. But on this year financially, we don't expect anything that would happen. Thank you, David. I mean, with regard to the Sprint format, I think it will be beneficial to everyone. And if I have to answer straight away to the last part of the question, of course, we expect to have more value out of it. First of all, there is action that will be very, very positive in terms of effect to the organizer. Because from Friday to Saturday to Sunday there is something to talk about, a lot of action, a lot of intensity. That is something that, of course, this will have a direct effect on the people that will attend to the race. And this has been welcomed by all the organizer in a very positive way. On top of it, of course, that's something that we are offering to our media partners because we can create a new content. We can generate other form of entertainment in adding a new format that has been never deployed before. And also to the partners that have the chance to -- and the previous to be in the grid for two times also on Saturday, even if the Formula will be different, of course, because the center of the weekend will be the race on Sunday. But this is something that we believe that will have also an impact on the financial point of view on top of adding the excitement of what these rates is all about. With regard to the market, the TV deal and the leverage related to all our tools, I -- we believe that this will enable us to discuss in the future even a different way of integrating our TV OTT platform that is going very, very well, in the future. And therefore, that will allow us to benefit from the fact that the market will be interested in our sport and the commitment will be very, very big on our side to make sure that this will happen. So David, with regard to the sponsorship, the range, of course, depends on what is the package that we have. We have official partner, and we have other kind of relationship and all are related to really the race that they're going to have. And so we have different packages that are all consistent with the season with old and top championship and not related to the single event itself. Matthew, the changes has been already discussed. The teams are already working on new cars and new regulation. And the train has already left the station. So we are very pleased because we are convinced that this year is already a great season, but next year with the changes that has been planned will be another great opportunity to showcase what is Formula One in terms of the ability of always keeping the attention at the center. And therefore, there's no other things about checking everything in terms of all the states to make sure that the changes that will be massive, because next year will highlight the possibility to have a bigger fight, not only two or three drivers, but even more, and that's the objective."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Liberty Media 2022 Year-end Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference will be recorded today, March 1. \n I would now like to turn the call over to Shane Kleinstein, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nShane Kleinstein: Thank you. Good morning. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in Liberty Media's most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. \n These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call  and Liberty Media expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. \n On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Media and SiriusXM including adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media and SiriusXM scheduled 1 through 3 can be found at the end of the earnings press release issued today, which is available on Liberty's website. \n Now I'd like to introduce Greg Maffei, Liberty President and CEO. \nGregory Maffei: Thank you, Shane, and good morning to all of you. Today speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. \n First, let me start with an update on the split off of the Braves and the creation of Liberty Live tracker. We filed the amended S-4 and we still expect completion in the second quarter. \n Let me turn to Liberty SiriusXM. We expect we will have a simplified structure following the recapitalization of LSXM and the creation of Liberty Live tracker, and we are focused on rationalizing this structure in the near term. Looking at SiriusXM, the underlying asset, reported strong fourth quarter results with record high ARPU and EBITDA and record low churn. \n Management did give more cautious forward-looking commentary given multiple headwinds we're experiencing here in the early part of 2023. The top of the funnel in terms of new subscribers is still pressured as the SAAR has dropped from about $17 million in 2019 to something like $13.5 million last year. The ad market remains soft, especially in the first half of 2023, and we are seeing moderating marketing spend ahead of the fourth quarter app revamp. \n Plus we've had some cash impacts. We expect peak satellite CapEx in 2023, and we are now a taxpayer, something which previously we had not been. We do expect these incremental satellite CapEx will moderate in 2024 with nearly no incremental satellite CapEx by 2027 by the end of the year. We are also stepping up some tech investments for long-term success. We are building improvements around commerce and identity to reduce friction, and the new app will have more personalization as it has within 360L. We do expect these negative trends in the ad market and the SAAR will turn, and we have a resilient business model with meaningful free cash flow, so we still remain optimistic about our longer-term prospects. \n Turning to Live Nation. We continue to see incredible demand. 2022 attendance was up 24% over 2019. We are at an all-time high for concert attendance despite many markets still being closed during part of the year. We've seen especially strong international markets with 70% of net new tickets sold in 2022 were to international clients and we expect another record year of demand in 2023. Ticket sales in 2023 are up 20% versus the same time last year. And last year, also benefited from 20 million of tickets that were rescheduled from prior periods due to COVID. \n Formula One Group. Right into the 2022 year. Attendance records were set, we were up 36% over 2019. Our fan base is increasingly diverse with new fans being younger, and the share of females within the fan base 40% larger than the share in the established fan base. That's been the new fan base. The U.S. is especially strong. One in 3 fans globally started following F1 in the last 4 years. In the U.S., it's even higher at 1 in 2. This is a result of many efforts and most of them related to our efforts to drive the access to our drivers across all channels, not only Drive to Survive, but the driver preference on social pages, coverage in larger years publications, late-night comedy appearances on people like Jimmy Kimmel. \n And it's interesting to note, for example, look at our Instagram followers and comparing GOAT, Lewis Hamilton has 31.5 million versus Tom Brady at 13.6 million. F1 is clearly getting into the mentality of America. And looking at the younger talent, Leclerc has almost 10 million and Luka Doncic is at 8 million. Again, we're doing pretty well. \n We will have 3 U.S. races in 2023, the second year of Miami, capitalizing on the first year success with several improvements around hospitality and security. We expect the sporting world to be super excited as we are for the inaugural Las Vegas GP. F1 Las Vegas social media garnered over 170 million impressions and over 5 million engagements since September of 2022. And we launched LVGP TikTok last weekend. The first post had over 500 -- 35,000 views in the first 24 hours. \n Let me turn to the Braves. We reiterate that we believe the split-off will better highlight the value of the Braves. We grew baseball revenue in 2022 even though we had experienced less post-season gains, capitalizing on the tailwinds from our 2021 World Series win. We had year-over-year growth across ticket sales, sponsorship, concessions and retail. We sold 3.1 million tickets and led Major League Baseball with 94% of our inventory being sold. \n Demand for the season and single-ticket games, ticket remains high for the 2023 season. Bleacher Report called the Braves front office, the #1 in Major League Baseball for the 2023 season, and we tend to agree. We were happy to extend manager, Brian Snitker through 2025. And GM, Alex Anthopoulos invested smartly in the off-season, adding to the already core talent we have by locking them up in multiyear deals. This team is built on young talent and is positioned for long-term success and we very much look forward to the opener on March 30. \n And with that, let me turn it over to Brian to talk a little bit more about our financial results. \nBrian Wendling: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of approximately $305 million, which excludes $57 million of cash held at SiriusXM. There's also a $1.3 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM and Live Nation margin loans. \n As of February 28, the value of our SiriusXM stock held at Liberty SiriusXM Group was $14.1 billion, and the value of the Live Nation interest was $5 billion. We have $2.8 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.1 billion which includes $9.5 billion of debt that's down at the SiriusXM level. \n Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $1.8 billion at quarter end, which includes $752 million of cash at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3 billion, and this includes $2.4 billion of debt down at the Formula 1 level, leaving $565 million at the corporate level. During the quarter, F1 refinanced its term loan and revolver at attractive rates and an extended maturity. F1 repaid $477 million of its term loan B in connection with this refinancing, using cash on hand. And at year-end, Formula One's $500 million revolver is undrawn. Formula One's leverage at the end of the year was 2.7x. \n On the F1 operating business, given quarterly variability in the year-over-year race calendar, a reminder that this business is best analyzed on an annual basis. Total revenue grew 20% in 2022 with growth across all primary revenue streams. Other F1 revenue grew 63% or $180 million with approximately $110 million of the revenue growth coming from hospitality and experiences and approximately $55 million coming from increased freight. \n Team payments as a percent of the pre-team OIBDA as reported, was 66% in 2022, down from 68% in the prior year, benefiting from the team -- the terms of the 2021 Concorde Agreement. As a reminder, other costs of Formula One revenue are largely variable in nature and relate to both primary and other F1 revenue opportunities. Other costs increased from 20% of total revenue in 2021 to 23% of total revenue in 2022. \n Primarily driven by compression in freight margins with significant air charter cost inflation during the year as well as increased cost of servicing our additional hospitality offerings. SG&A as a percent of total revenue was basically in line with historical averages in 2022. \n As mentioned in Q3, we did have some modest increases in personnel costs due to the change in the company's LTIP from a stock to a cash-based long-term bonus program and increased headcount to support growth. Also included in SG&A in 2022 was $19 million of costs from the Las Vegas Grand Prix, mostly related to personnel and marketing initiatives. \n Looking at 2023, we look forward to a record '23 race calendar. The calendar will consist of 14 flyaway races compared to 12 flyaway races in 2022. As we've discussed before, flyaway races typically pay higher fees than the European races. And on Las Vegas, as previously communicated, we expect total revenue approaching $500 million. Looking at total race specific economics, Vegas is projected to be in the top 5 of all races in year 1 in terms of total profit to the company. \n The Paddock building is progressing on schedule, and the concrete structure will be completed by the end of March. CapEx related to the Paddock building will be incurred at the formula and corporate level and track-related CapEx is expected to be incurred at the F1 OpCo level. The majority of our CapEx spend will be incurred at the corporate level, primarily because year-round activations of Paddock building will be separate from Formula 1. We will not be providing a forward-looking allocation between F1 OpCo and Formula One corporate CapEx, but you'll be able to see it in our historical numbers as they get reported. \n LVGP will pay rent and other fees out of Formula 1 OpCo to the Formula One corporate for use of the building during the raise period, which will show up in our financial statements as revenue at the corporate level but will eliminate in consolidation. We also expect the receipt of advanced payments primarily related to ticket sales to impact year-over-year comparability and working capital flows in the first year of the Vegas race. \n Nearly all LVGP revenue will be recognized in the fourth quarter when the race takes place. We'd expect grandstand and GA tickets as well as sponsorship revenue to be recognized in primary F1 revenue as race promotion and sponsorship revenue, respectively. We expect hospitality tickets will be recognized within other Formula One revenue. \n On cost recognition, we expect the vast majority of the race-related costs to also be recognized when the race takes place as cost of F1 revenue. So there will be some SG&A incurred throughout the first few quarters of 2023. \n Finally, at the Braves Group at quarter end, they had attributed cash and liquid investments of $151 million, which excludes $22 million of restricted cash. Braves Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $546 million at the end of the year. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One. \nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Brian. 2022 was a fantastic season on track, commercially with our partners and financially in our results. Max Verstappen 15 wins broke records with the most wins in a single season. The Red Bull team won their first constructors championship since 2013. And the [indiscernible] competition battle down to the last race with Alpine and McLaren both fighting for fourth place. The feedback from the drivers made it clear. The new regulation meant that cars could race more closely, and we saw some great results on the truck. This action during the season fueled our growing fan engagement. \n 2022 show record attendance of Grand Prix events. We welcomed more than 5.7 million fans to race weekend, up 36% compared to 2019. Demand is continuing in 2023 with sellout crowd expected at a number of races this season. \n Formal One was once again the fastest-growing major sports league on the planet in 2022 in terms of social media followers. We have 60.6 million total followers, up 23% from 2021 and saw significant growth in markets like the U.S. where social followers were up 42% versus 2021 to 4.5 million. \n Additionally, across f1.com and the F1 app, unique users were up 11% versus 2021 to 125 million. On viewership cumulative TV audiences for the 2022 season was 1.54 billion, and average viewership raise was 70 million. U.S. viewership was up 36% compared to 2021 with an average of 1.2 million viewers tuning in on race days. \n Looking at some other markets. Italy viewership grew 22%. Australia was up to 20% and Germany viewership grew 9%. With our newer younger demographic, the digital share of F1 video minutes consumed grew from 16% in 2021 to 24% in 2022. As an endorsement of F1 growing global popularity, technological relevance and sustainability efforts, Ford announced the return to F1 from 2026 in a new partnership with Red Bull. Ford is a celebrated name in Motor Sport with a storied F1 history dating back into the '60s, and they are the third most successful engine manufacture in F1 history. We expect Ford's involvement as a technical engine provider will bring value not only to Red Bull, but to the sport. \n The growing fan engagement has benefited both new and renewed commercial agreements. F1 grew revenue across all primary sources: promotion, media right and advertising and sponsorship. In addition, our Paddock Club hospitality product performed especially well in 2022, its first full season of operations since the onset of the pandemic. We welcomed 50,000 guests over the season with sellout up 12 out of 19 events. In 2023, we are focused on optimizing the value of our Paddock Club by expanding the premium services we offer, continuing to enhance the guest experience and adjusting pricing. \n Turning to recent updates on our commercial agreements. On race promotion, we extended our race in Zandvoort from 2024 and 2025, and the '23 Dutch Grand Prix is already sold out. The promoter has focused on sustainability from travel with 99% of general admission ticket holders in 2022 arriving by public transportation, bike or on foot. \n We signed a number of large broadcast agreements throughout 2022, including renewing our partnership with Sky, in major European markets and with ESPN in U.S. More recently, we entered into a multi-year media rights agreement with BeIN Sport to exclusively broadcast F1 in 10 territories across Asia. Our FOX Sport agreement in Mexico was extended through 2025. We also renewed our partnership with Play Sport in Belgium for 2023 and 2024.  And our agreement with DAZN in Japan through 2025. F1 TV continues to grow in popularity among new and heritage fans. The product is now available in 120 countries. \n On sponsorship, just last week, we announced the addition of Qatar Airways as a global airline partner under multiyear agreement. They will also be the tattoo sponsor at 3 races. Looking forward, there are a number of areas we continue to explore for additional sponsorship opportunity, including travel, financial services, food and beverage, telecommunication and more. \n Our team is continuously building fund engagement opportunities to capitalize on our momentum. The fifth season of Drive to Survive aired on February 24. The 2023 F1 is for [ qualify ] round is being held through May 25 and we hope to build on the strong engagement from last year when 1.3 million players attempted to qualify. The new license program, F1RK launched its first location in London in December, hosting over 600 F1 guests and celebrities at the official launch party, who experienced the excitement on F1 with 60 full motion racing simulator. \n The second venue will open in Birmingham in the U.K. in the fourth quarter 2023, with additional locations planned to follow. A new F1 exhibition will also launch in Madrid later this month and remain there before moving to Milan in time for the Italian Grand Prix. This is a 90 minutes immersive experience guiding visitors through the past, present and the future of the sport. And it's planned to visit 25 cities around the world over the next decade. We are counting down to the start of 2023 season. [ Bahrain ] testing finished last week and with another year of improvements to the track, we are expecting even fiercest competition on the track. \n Ferrari and Mercedes are certainly eager for their come back. There will be new phases on the grid with Nyck de Vries, Oscar Piastri and a promising young and American driver Logan Sargeant as well as the return of Nico Hulkenberg. The '23 race calendar is a record for Formal One. We made the decision not to replace China on the calendar at the most economic benefit of a replacement race was not worth the logistical and sustainability consideration for F1 and our teams. There will be 6 Prix events held in Azerbaijan, Austria, Spa, Qatar, Austin and Brazil. The Sprint series have been successful in driving attendance and engagement across the entire weekend for our promoters and broadcast partners. \n The 2023 calendar will feature 3 races in the U.S. including taking to the street of Las Vegas for a night race in November. We announced Heineken Silver as the type of sponsor and T-Mobile as the exclusive wireless provider. The plan to deploy an advanced 5G public network and race we can that will power our customer app and enhance the efficiency of the fan experience. \n Our second wave of public ticket sales will launch soon. And in spring, the world begins on resurfacing the track roads with digital plans in place to minimize disruption to the Las Vegas flow of traffic in the process. We have made a long-term investment in Las Vegas, which we expect to set us up to the race for decades to come. \n And finally, we made several announcements furthering our efforts in sustainability, diversity and inclusion. F1 recently announced a global charity partnership with UNICEF to help bring quality education to the world's most vulnerable children, building on F1long history of promoting STEM education worldwide. \n We also look forward to [ debut ] F1 Academy in 2023. The series intend to maximize the potential of young female drivers to reach the highest level in motorsport, providing those currently in go-carting or other junior categories with access to the fundamental experience needed before racing an F3 and working up to Formula One. The series will be consist of 5 teams run by current F2 and F3 teams, each entry 3 cash to make up our 15 cars grids. The first season will comprise 21 total races ending as a support event at the Austin Grand Prix in October. \n I'm delighted that today we have announced Susie Wolff as the Managing Director of the F1 Academy. She has a wealth of experience as a driver and team principal and will provide huge value to the project. \n Wrapping 2022 and looking to 2023, I think F1 is the strongest position it has ever been. This year, we launched a new brand campaign demonstrating F1 place in the sporting and entertainment world, giving new fans a reason to actively engage with the 2023 season and keep coming back for more. F1 is an admissible and extraordinary spectacle and adrenaline field and intoxicating world of action, innovation and entertainment, both on and off the track. \n We have the extraordinary potential of technology until work comes together to make the difference between winning and being forgotten. This is not ordinary sport. This is Formula One. [Foreign Language] so full speed ahead. \n And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. \nGregory Maffei: Thank you, Stefano, and thank you, Brian. And to our listening audience, we appreciate your continued support of and interest in Liberty Media. And with that, operator, I'd like to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vijay Jayant with Evercore. \nVijay Jayant: Greg, with the Braves, hot spin about to get done and the recapitalization, the reattribution of Liberty Live. And you sort of talked about the rationalizing the structure of Liberty Sirius, I think. Can you sort of talk about the prospect of doing a hot spin of Liberty Sirius post the reattribution? Is there any limitations on that? When you did Liberty entertainment many years ago, even before you talked about a combination with DIRECTV, you did a hot spin and then -- all the time. Is that something that's something potentially possible structurally and from a tax efficiency perspective? \n And then for Stefano, you have, I think, 10 global sponsors. Is that -- you talked about a lot more opportunities in different verticals. Is there more opportunity to have more global sponsors? Or are we sort of tapped out at that? And if I could, 1 final, it looks like the logistic costs that is sort of paid by the teams, but the team sort of elevated. And I'm trying to understand is some of the inflation impact of that being passed on to the teams. Is that something we should expect to continue? Or was that sort of a one-off factor? \nGregory Maffei: Okay. I'll start, Vijay. That was so long ago. [indiscernible] questions I almost got lost, but thank you. So look, we have lots of things we could do, including a spin of [ Sirius ]. But I think there are probably discussions to be had with the SiriusXM independent Board members about the best structure moving forward if we were to do something. But all elements are on the table. All options are on the table. And as we said, we look -- we're looking at those with renewed vigor, and we believe we're much better to execute on any of those post the Liberty Live reattribution and the brave spin. \nStefano Domenicali: Yes. Thanks, Vijay, for the question. I'll start for the second. This logistic cost is true last year it was a combined factor that we had to pay for that and included the team. But I would say the first signal that we see already this year is going in the right direction of these logistics cost to be reduced. \n And in that respect, there is also the other element that we are trying to be even more efficient in order to make sure that the things are done in the proper way. And this is very, very important to share that. And on the other side, with regard to the partners, of course, we want to keep the exclusivity as a main value and we don't want to put on the other side, the final number of that. It's importable -- it's important that we give the right value to the global partner but also to the other verticals that are coming into the equation because we never had such a strong pipeline. So it's up to us really to make sure that everyone is the right visibility and value for what is the investor related with us. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Two Formula 1 question. I guess, first for Greg or Stefano, whoever wants to take it or certainly both.  It's pretty clear, and I think Stefano made this point last year that the value of the teams has significantly increased, especially from where you bought the business years ago. But I don't know if I have a clear idea of sort of how that benefits F1, the company and ultimately, shareholders. I think it does, but I'd love to get your perspective. And in particular, given the award of asking the first conquered agreement question for 2026. But does this allow or enable or support your ability to sort of continue on this path of operating leverage into the new agreement because of the amount of value creation at the team level. So that's, I guess, the maybe more interesting question. \n And then I'm going to try, I know, Brian, you guys don't like to give guidance, but I just wanted to take another -- take a stab at the G&A commentary because we're getting a lot of questions on that this morning, $80 million OpCo in Q4. Is there a way for us to think about how sort of recurring that level of G&A is as you move into '23. I know you mentioned marketing. And I guess when you guys talk about a top 5 economic race for Vegas, are you including these incremental G&A costs that are happening outside of the quarter? That's it. \nGregory Maffei: So Stefano, I'm happy to take a cut and then -- or let you lead the other way. One of the things we are -- to credit Chase and credit Stefano, so it's easier for me to go first to let and give them the credit. One of the things that we at Formula One and with Liberty's help they have been trying to do is build a mentality that I'll credit the NFL for, which is 1 league that we benefit when everybody benefits. And yes, the teams compete very hard on Sunday, but on Monday, we need to think about growing the entire ecosystem. And it was critical that we have healthy teams so that we could have a healthy league. And it was critical that they had a prospect of making money even the teams towards the back of the grid so that we could have a prospect of also making money. \n And they've seen radical increases in their value. We've seen pretty good increases in our value, but we are here to play the long game. And doesn't mean we won't have disagreements with the teams about how much of the pie is ours and how much the pie is theirs. But trying to build the mentality that as you gain, we gain and vice versa and that we're playing the long game here is really part of our goal. And so I think we will have a strength in hand in the next conquered agreement, not a whipped but a hand saying, hey, look, we're here to grow the value and you're going to be benefit from it, and we want to see your team value grow dramatically. \n Stefano, please correct me. \nStefano Domenicali: No, I totally Greg, if I may add just 2 considerations. Something financially means also the strength of the entire system to invest with also the strategy to engage more with fans and partners that will have a direct effect to the growth and the strength of the business itself. And we don't have to forget that not many years ago, the teams were suffering and we, as F1, were there, to support them financially. And this is something that we don't have to forget. That's why we really believe that the more value we give to the team, the more value will go back to the system and to the entire business. \nBrian Wendling: And Ben, on the SG&A piece, I'll talk about it from the full year basis first. But you've seen an increase, obviously related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix that's $19 million. That was elevated in the fourth quarter because we had our launch event and marketing activities around initial ticket sales. We also talked about the LTIP moving from stock compensation expense to a more like a personnel expense, that's in there now. You won't see that increase, so it's in the base. \n And then there's other onetime items in there. There's higher legal and professional fees associated with a couple of different matters in an ERP implementation and a few other onetime items that are affecting SG&A. So on your question about whether SG&A is included in our statement on top 5 race, it most definitely is. \nOperator: Next question is from Barton Crockett with Rosenblat Securities. \nBarton Crockett: To switch gears to sports teams and -- just wanted your kind of views, Greg, on what's behind the kind of vibrant activity we're seeing right now in acquisitions of sports teams in many sports at premium prices. I'm thinking of the talk around Manchester United, Milwaukee Bucks, Phoenix Sons, maybe Washington Commander, certainly Denver Broncos. There seems to be a lot of prices coming in that are way above what were kind of the values that these teams are carried at and things like Forbes or [ Sporteco ].\n And I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts about why and if this could be applicable to baseball in your view? And  is there any potential for this to be disrupted by all of the noise around local TV rights and the risk that carries to an important revenue stream. \nGregory Maffei: A couple of thoughts. I mean I don't have any probably unique thoughts on the value of sports teams. You've seen a lot of commentary about these are trophy assets. There's a limited number. They've been good source of value that increasing global popularity only means that they have more interest globally and more potential investor interest globally. I think those are all true isolating which of those factors hard for me to say. I think that's certainly going to be true of the Atlanta Braves is true of them as a -- on their trading value, the longest continuously operating franchise in the United States.  Story and history of winning a storied history of economic success, hard to think of a more perfect franchise in many ways. \n Obviously, there are changes coming in the ecosystem. I feel pretty good about those changes for a bunch of reasons. I do think you will see net revenue declines across all of baseball with the decline of the RSNs. There -- I think that's in the short term, at least, that's almost inevitable as some of these contracts are done. And there may be operations, which prevent that, but it seems more likely than not. But about our relative position, I feel very good. Having the largest cable household or a broadband household territory having a very large dedicated fan base, having a relatively modest RSN fee given the scale of those, that territory all anecdotal evidence, we know suggests that we have the most profitable RSN for the RSN owner and distributors. So there's plenty of confidence that there are reasons why they would want to stay engaged. \n And there are a lot of other broadcast outlets, which would want to be involved with the Braves given the strength of all the things I started with. So the disruption is certainly there, the potential, but I feel very good about our -- of how we're positioned. And frankly, the financial health of the Braves gives me more confidence in that, too. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. \nStephen Laszczyk: Maybe for Greg on F1. I think you said that roughly 1/3 of the fan started following F1 over the last few years, and that certainly makes sense with looking at the attendance increases. But maybe looking ahead, could you talk a little bit more about your confidence in converting the fans that have come into this sport, maybe because of Drive to Survive or social media over the last few years into lifelong fans in the sport. And maybe more broadly, what do you see is the next most important levers to driving fan growth from here? \nGregory Maffei: Well, I'll comment, but I also want Stefano to add. Look, we are very focused on sustaining the growth and interest in F1 in many, many ways. That's with new innovations on the track, ensuring more competitive racing with new innovations on -- around the weekend like the Sprint races. Lots of ways to grow fan interest on the track. Lots of ways to grow fan interest in some of the things we do off the track and exposing the drivers. Drive to Survive was obviously a key part, but not the only one. I think we're helping and the teams are helping create what will be a very exciting movie next year with Brad Pitt and the directors of TopGun: Maverick and producers of TopGun: Maverick, all of which we think will be another thing to sustain growth. \n The Las Vegas race is going to be a massive noise maker for our sport. And it'll open up our sport to many people who previously were not aware. While there are 16 and 17 year olds who are crazed and get up every Sunday morning to watch, there are many people who really do not follow Formula One. It will be hard to miss Formula One after Las Vegas. It will be loud, and we will get a lot of attention. So we're not only thinking about things which are current, but we're thinking about things for the long term to try and sustain that interest, convert that interest into long-term fans. And I think we have a lot on the plate and many more in front of us that we're working on to do that. \n Stefano, what would you add, please? \nStefano Domenicali: Yes. I would say that Greg -- the main sporting pillar for sure  covered. We talked about raising on the sporting side, on the technical side, on the financial side, these are elements of which we really are focused because we have shown in the short term that we've find the ideas to improve the respect of the race in itself. But if we have to add another dimension related to the fact that we are an entertainment platform that is growing, we are working on a new form of fan engagement with different social content, with a new way of connecting with media, but also we don't have to forget one thing that I would say is getting more and more relevant. \n The way that we are doing our sport in a context where we are talking about very important values when we are talking about the diversity in our project, when we are talking about our social responsibility, when we are talking about our ideas to develop on the sustainability side of it, I think that all these new elements of discussion are elements that are tracking new people, new fans of Formula One. And also, we have the opportunity to talk about these things with a different voice. And the tone of voice, of course, is different depending on who we want to engage with. But we are a platform of connectivity. So broader connectivity means that all the elements that are able to attract interest has to be discussed and operated in the way that hopefully we have shown to be very serious. \nStephen Laszczyk: And then just 1 more quick one. Brian mentioned that prepayments came down as a percentage of pre-team share adjusted EBITDA or OIBDA in 2023. We know those are variable. I was wondering if you'd be willing to speak to at what point we started to see some of that operating leverage come through in 2022? And maybe what investors could expect to see on this front in 2023. \nBrian Wendling: Yes. So as you rightly point out, team payments were a source of margin expansion in 2022. That was offset by the freight compression that we've talked about.  Higher hospitality costs, although we still have very attractive margins in the Paddock Club. But as we've talked about before, with the '21 concord agreement as our profitability grows, we have increased leverage on those team payment counts. And as we pointed out before, there's some onetime items in SG&A. So we would expect some... \nOperator: Our next question is from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. \nPeter Supino: Pleasure to be on Liberty call. A question on F1 operating expenses, in particular, I wondered if you would discuss puts and takes for OpEx as we move beyond 2023, given that 2023 OpEx includes some onetime costs for the O&O event in Vegas. \n And then the second question is on your global popularity. It's obviously on the rise, and we all agree that the U.S. is going to see a wonderful benefit from Vegas. And as that happens, I wonder as you look at other professional sports leagues in the way they leverage their brands, what best practices outside of the core events are you looking at that you think you might be able to replicate at F1? \nBrian Wendling: So I'll take the OpEx 1 first. But as we pointed out, freight margins have been one of the biggest pressures on our other cost of revenue. And we basically absorbed that in 2022. So you wouldn't expect to see that continue in -- as we go forward. And hopefully, you'd see some leverage there. Hospitality costs, as we just said, there's good margins. So Vegas will play in. We haven't given the OpEx number. We've just given the revenue number and overall profitability, but you'll see OpEx increase associated with Vegas, as you would expect. But yes, we would expect leverage as we move forward. \n Stefano, I'll let you handle the second. \nStefano Domenicali: Yes. Can you hear me, Peter? \nPeter Supino: Yes. Thanks, Stefano. \nStefano Domenicali: Okay. Sorry. I was losing the line. No, I think that the global popularity as you said, is growing, and this is a fact. And I would say what we are bringing home is the fact that all the other sport league business are really interested in understanding how our growth was so fast and dramatic. And -- but of course, we are quite humble in that approach because we want to learn from everyone around the world, what we can capture in order to increase let's say, our way of growing. \n I think that is one key that is very important is the way that we engage with our drivers with the fans. And they are really the voice, the authentic voice of the business we are in. We feel that sharing with them the responsibility of that fan engagement is giving us an incredible attraction because then that attractive approach will turn into business, if you think about gaming. If you think about the fact of the drive, then the fans wants to attend to the race. If you see that fans wants to follow, the count on our social media. So I think this is really one of the key elements that is quite unique. And I think on that, we will work even hard to make sure that this voice is even stronger. \nGregory Maffei: Next question. \nOperator: Our last question is from Jason Bazinet with Citi. \nJason Bazinet: I just had a quick question on Formula One. Can you just -- if Vegas is as successful as you expect it will be, can you just talk about gaining factors or constraints that are ahead of you in terms of expanding that into other cities? \nGregory Maffei: I'll take a cut, and I'll let Stefano add. Vegas is unique for many reasons. One, the economic opportunity is large. We're not -- we're operating in a country that -- which Liberty is reasonably familiar. It's pretty close to us. The ability to go negotiate and make something happen on a street circuit rather than an own circuit, made it easier in many ways, there wasn't a promoter, natural promoter. It was a role that was good for us to fill in and it was good for us to test some of the theories we had about promotion. So it was a unique opportunity and great -- it's a great test lab. \n Could there be other cities. I think there are many countries where it's obvious we would be less effective as a promoter than the U.S. There may be some where we could operate reasonably effectively or maybe have some form of co-promotion and that could be interesting. But I do not -- I think Vegas is relatively unique in terms of being the kind of place where we would go all out and do what we have done and what we are doing here in 2023 in Vegas. \n Stefano, what might you add? \nStefano Domenicali: Yes. I couldn't agree more. I think that is absolutely, totally right. And we don't have to forget that in such a short time, we moved in a new dimension that has been the promoter in a way that no one was thinking before possible. So first step for us is to make sure that we need to make sure that Vegas is right first at the first attempt. So total focus on that. And then, of course, I'm sure that this will -- an incredible push for all the promoter to see what is really -- what can be done better. \n So I think that already by doing that will be an incredible push for everyone to push for a better qualitative result for -- from everyone. We have a huge demand around the world to host Grand Prix, not only in the U.S. but also in Paris. So this could be experience that can be used to better organize Grand Prix in the future. But so far, let's make sure that we are totally focused on making Vegas super special there. \nGregory Maffei: So operator, I think we are done. So to our listening audience, thank you for your interest in and for our support for Liberty Media. We hope to speak with you next quarter, if not sooner. And I think operator, we can end the line there. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your time. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gregory Maffei",
            "content": "Thank you, Shane, and good morning to all of you. Today speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. \n First, let me start with an update on the split off of the Braves and the creation of Liberty Live tracker. We filed the amended S-4 and we still expect completion in the second quarter. \n Let me turn to Liberty SiriusXM. We expect we will have a simplified structure following the recapitalization of LSXM and the creation of Liberty Live tracker, and we are focused on rationalizing this structure in the near term. Looking at SiriusXM, the underlying asset, reported strong fourth quarter results with record high ARPU and EBITDA and record low churn. \n Management did give more cautious forward-looking commentary given multiple headwinds we're experiencing here in the early part of 2023. The top of the funnel in terms of new subscribers is still pressured as the SAAR has dropped from about $17 million in 2019 to something like $13.5 million last year. The ad market remains soft, especially in the first half of 2023, and we are seeing moderating marketing spend ahead of the fourth quarter app revamp. \n Plus we've had some cash impacts. We expect peak satellite CapEx in 2023, and we are now a taxpayer, something which previously we had not been. We do expect these incremental satellite CapEx will moderate in 2024 with nearly no incremental satellite CapEx by 2027 by the end of the year. We are also stepping up some tech investments for long-term success. We are building improvements around commerce and identity to reduce friction, and the new app will have more personalization as it has within 360L. We do expect these negative trends in the ad market and the SAAR will turn, and we have a resilient business model with meaningful free cash flow, so we still remain optimistic about our longer-term prospects. \n Turning to Live Nation. We continue to see incredible demand. 2022 attendance was up 24% over 2019. We are at an all-time high for concert attendance despite many markets still being closed during part of the year. We've seen especially strong international markets with 70% of net new tickets sold in 2022 were to international clients and we expect another record year of demand in 2023. Ticket sales in 2023 are up 20% versus the same time last year. And last year, also benefited from 20 million of tickets that were rescheduled from prior periods due to COVID. \n Formula One Group. Right into the 2022 year. Attendance records were set, we were up 36% over 2019. Our fan base is increasingly diverse with new fans being younger, and the share of females within the fan base 40% larger than the share in the established fan base. That's been the new fan base. The U.S. is especially strong. One in 3 fans globally started following F1 in the last 4 years. In the U.S., it's even higher at 1 in 2. This is a result of many efforts and most of them related to our efforts to drive the access to our drivers across all channels, not only Drive to Survive, but the driver preference on social pages, coverage in larger years publications, late-night comedy appearances on people like Jimmy Kimmel. \n And it's interesting to note, for example, look at our Instagram followers and comparing GOAT, Lewis Hamilton has 31.5 million versus Tom Brady at 13.6 million. F1 is clearly getting into the mentality of America. And looking at the younger talent, Leclerc has almost 10 million and Luka Doncic is at 8 million. Again, we're doing pretty well. \n We will have 3 U.S. races in 2023, the second year of Miami, capitalizing on the first year success with several improvements around hospitality and security. We expect the sporting world to be super excited as we are for the inaugural Las Vegas GP. F1 Las Vegas social media garnered over 170 million impressions and over 5 million engagements since September of 2022. And we launched LVGP TikTok last weekend. The first post had over 500 -- 35,000 views in the first 24 hours. \n Let me turn to the Braves. We reiterate that we believe the split-off will better highlight the value of the Braves. We grew baseball revenue in 2022 even though we had experienced less post-season gains, capitalizing on the tailwinds from our 2021 World Series win. We had year-over-year growth across ticket sales, sponsorship, concessions and retail. We sold 3.1 million tickets and led Major League Baseball with 94% of our inventory being sold. \n Demand for the season and single-ticket games, ticket remains high for the 2023 season. Bleacher Report called the Braves front office, the #1 in Major League Baseball for the 2023 season, and we tend to agree. We were happy to extend manager, Brian Snitker through 2025. And GM, Alex Anthopoulos invested smartly in the off-season, adding to the already core talent we have by locking them up in multiyear deals. This team is built on young talent and is positioned for long-term success and we very much look forward to the opener on March 30. \n And with that, let me turn it over to Brian to talk a little bit more about our financial results. Thank you, Stefano, and thank you, Brian. And to our listening audience, we appreciate your continued support of and interest in Liberty Media. And with that, operator, I'd like to open the line for questions. Okay. I'll start, Vijay. That was so long ago. [indiscernible] questions I almost got lost, but thank you. So look, we have lots of things we could do, including a spin of [ Sirius ]. But I think there are probably discussions to be had with the SiriusXM independent Board members about the best structure moving forward if we were to do something. But all elements are on the table. All options are on the table. And as we said, we look -- we're looking at those with renewed vigor, and we believe we're much better to execute on any of those post the Liberty Live reattribution and the brave spin. So Stefano, I'm happy to take a cut and then -- or let you lead the other way.

But trying to build the mentality that as you gain, we gain and vice versa and that we're playing the long game here is really part of our goal. And so I think we will have a strength in hand in the next conquered agreement, not a whipped but a hand saying, hey, look, we're here to grow the value and you're going to be benefit from it, and we want to see your team value grow dramatically. \n Stefano, please correct me. A couple of thoughts. I mean I don't have any probably unique thoughts on the value of sports teams. You've seen a lot of commentary about these are trophy assets. There's a limited number. They've been good source of value that increasing global popularity only means that they have more interest globally and more potential investor interest globally. I think those are all true isolating which of those factors hard for me to say. I think that's certainly going to be true of the Atlanta Braves is true of them as a -- on their trading value, the longest continuously operating franchise in the United States.  Story and history of winning a storied history of economic success, hard to think of a more perfect franchise in many ways. \n Obviously, there are changes coming in the ecosystem. I feel pretty good about those changes for a bunch of reasons. I do think you will see net revenue declines across all of baseball with the decline of the RSNs.

Having the largest cable household or a broadband household territory having a very large dedicated fan base, having a relatively modest RSN fee given the scale of those, that territory all anecdotal evidence, we know suggests that we have the most profitable RSN for the RSN owner and distributors. So there's plenty of confidence that there are reasons why they would want to stay engaged. \n And there are a lot of other broadcast outlets, which would want to be involved with the Braves given the strength of all the things I started with. So the disruption is certainly there, the potential, but I feel very good about our -- of how we're positioned. And frankly, the financial health of the Braves gives me more confidence in that, too. Well, I'll comment, but I also want Stefano to add. Look, we are very focused on sustaining the growth and interest in F1 in many, many ways. That's with new innovations on the track, ensuring more competitive racing with new innovations on -- around the weekend like the Sprint races. Lots of ways to grow fan interest on the track. Lots of ways to grow fan interest in some of the things we do off the track and exposing the drivers. Drive to Survive was obviously a key part, but not the only one. I think we're helping and the teams are helping create what will be a very exciting movie next year with Brad Pitt and the directors of TopGun: Maverick and producers of TopGun: Maverick, all of which we think will be another thing to sustain growth. \n The Las Vegas race is going to be a massive noise maker for our sport. And it'll open up our sport to many people who previously were not aware. While there are 16 and 17 year olds who are crazed and get up every Sunday morning to watch, there are many people who really do not follow Formula One. It will be hard to miss Formula One after Las Vegas. It will be loud, and we will get a lot of attention. So we're not only thinking about things which are current, but we're thinking about things for the long term to try and sustain that interest, convert that interest into long-term fans. And I think we have a lot on the plate and many more in front of us that we're working on to do that. \n Stefano, what would you add, please? Next question. I'll take a cut, and I'll let Stefano add. Vegas is unique for many reasons. One, the economic opportunity is large. We're not -- we're operating in a country that -- which Liberty is reasonably familiar. It's pretty close to us. The ability to go negotiate and make something happen on a street circuit rather than an own circuit, made it easier in many ways, there wasn't a promoter, natural promoter. It was a role that was good for us to fill in and it was good for us to test some of the theories we had about promotion. So it was a unique opportunity and great -- it's a great test lab. \n Could there be other cities. I think there are many countries where it's obvious we would be less effective as a promoter than the U.S. There may be some where we could operate reasonably effectively or maybe have some form of co-promotion and that could be interesting. But I do not -- I think Vegas is relatively unique in terms of being the kind of place where we would go all out and do what we have done and what we are doing here in 2023 in Vegas. \n Stefano, what might you add? So operator, I think we are done. So to our listening audience, thank you for your interest in and for our support for Liberty Media. We hope to speak with you next quarter, if not sooner. And I think operator, we can end the line there."

            "name": "Brian Wendling",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of approximately $305 million, which excludes $57 million of cash held at SiriusXM. There's also a $1.3 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM and Live Nation margin loans. \n As of February 28, the value of our SiriusXM stock held at Liberty SiriusXM Group was $14.1 billion, and the value of the Live Nation interest was $5 billion. We have $2.8 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.1 billion which includes $9.5 billion of debt that's down at the SiriusXM level. \n Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $1.8 billion at quarter end, which includes $752 million of cash at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3 billion, and this includes $2.4 billion of debt down at the Formula 1 level, leaving $565 million at the corporate level. During the quarter, F1 refinanced its term loan and revolver at attractive rates and an extended maturity. F1 repaid $477 million of its term loan B in connection with this refinancing, using cash on hand. And at year-end, Formula One's $500 million revolver is undrawn. Formula One's leverage at the end of the year was 2.7x. \n On the F1 operating business, given quarterly variability in the year-over-year race calendar, a reminder that this business is best analyzed on an annual basis. Total revenue grew 20% in 2022 with growth across all primary revenue streams. Other F1 revenue grew 63% or $180 million with approximately $110 million of the revenue growth coming from hospitality and experiences and approximately $55 million coming from increased freight. \n Team payments as a percent of the pre-team OIBDA as reported, was 66% in 2022, down from 68% in the prior year, benefiting from the team -- the terms of the 2021 Concorde Agreement. As a reminder, other costs of Formula One revenue are largely variable in nature and relate to both primary and other F1 revenue opportunities. Other costs increased from 20% of total revenue in 2021 to 23% of total revenue in 2022. \n Primarily driven by compression in freight margins with significant air charter cost inflation during the year as well as increased cost of servicing our additional hospitality offerings. SG&A as a percent of total revenue was basically in line with historical averages in 2022. \n As mentioned in Q3, we did have some modest increases in personnel costs due to the change in the company's LTIP from a stock to a cash-based long-term bonus program and increased headcount to support growth. Also included in SG&A in 2022 was $19 million of costs from the Las Vegas Grand Prix, mostly related to personnel and marketing initiatives. \n Looking at 2023, we look forward to a record '23 race calendar. The calendar will consist of 14 flyaway races compared to 12 flyaway races in 2022. As we've discussed before, flyaway races typically pay higher fees than the European races. And on Las Vegas, as previously communicated, we expect total revenue approaching $500 million. Looking at total race specific economics, Vegas is projected to be in the top 5 of all races in year 1 in terms of total profit to the company. \n The Paddock building is progressing on schedule, and the concrete structure will be completed by the end of March. CapEx related to the Paddock building will be incurred at the formula and corporate level and track-related CapEx is expected to be incurred at the F1 OpCo level. The majority of our CapEx spend will be incurred at the corporate level, primarily because year-round activations of Paddock building will be separate from Formula 1. We will not be providing a forward-looking allocation between F1 OpCo and Formula One corporate CapEx, but you'll be able to see it in our historical numbers as they get reported. \n LVGP will pay rent and other fees out of Formula 1 OpCo to the Formula One corporate for use of the building during the raise period, which will show up in our financial statements as revenue at the corporate level but will eliminate in consolidation. We also expect the receipt of advanced payments primarily related to ticket sales to impact year-over-year comparability and working capital flows in the first year of the Vegas race. \n Nearly all LVGP revenue will be recognized in the fourth quarter when the race takes place. We'd expect grandstand and GA tickets as well as sponsorship revenue to be recognized in primary F1 revenue as race promotion and sponsorship revenue, respectively. We expect hospitality tickets will be recognized within other Formula One revenue. \n On cost recognition, we expect the vast majority of the race-related costs to also be recognized when the race takes place as cost of F1 revenue. So there will be some SG&A incurred throughout the first few quarters of 2023. \n Finally, at the Braves Group at quarter end, they had attributed cash and liquid investments of $151 million, which excludes $22 million of restricted cash. Braves Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $546 million at the end of the year. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One. And Ben, on the SG&A piece, I'll talk about it from the full year basis first. But you've seen an increase, obviously related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix that's $19 million. That was elevated in the fourth quarter because we had our launch event and marketing activities around initial ticket sales. We also talked about the LTIP moving from stock compensation expense to a more like a personnel expense, that's in there now. You won't see that increase, so it's in the base. \n And then there's other onetime items in there. There's higher legal and professional fees associated with a couple of different matters in an ERP implementation and a few other onetime items that are affecting SG&A. So on your question about whether SG&A is included in our statement on top 5 race, it most definitely is. Yes. So as you rightly point out, team payments were a source of margin expansion in 2022. That was offset by the freight compression that we've talked about.  Higher hospitality costs, although we still have very attractive margins in the Paddock Club. But as we've talked about before, with the '21 concord agreement as our profitability grows, we have increased leverage on those team payment counts. And as we pointed out before, there's some onetime items in SG&A. So we would expect some... So I'll take the OpEx 1 first. But as we pointed out, freight margins have been one of the biggest pressures on our other cost of revenue. And we basically absorbed that in 2022. So you wouldn't expect to see that continue in -- as we go forward. And hopefully, you'd see some leverage there. Hospitality costs, as we just said, there's good margins. So Vegas will play in. We haven't given the OpEx number. We've just given the revenue number and overall profitability, but you'll see OpEx increase associated with Vegas, as you would expect. But yes, we would expect leverage as we move forward. \n Stefano, I'll let you handle the second."

            "name": "Stefano Domenicali",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. 2022 was a fantastic season on track, commercially with our partners and financially in our results. Max Verstappen 15 wins broke records with the most wins in a single season. The Red Bull team won their first constructors championship since 2013. And the [indiscernible] competition battle down to the last race with Alpine and McLaren both fighting for fourth place. The feedback from the drivers made it clear. The new regulation meant that cars could race more closely, and we saw some great results on the truck. This action during the season fueled our growing fan engagement. \n 2022 show record attendance of Grand Prix events. We welcomed more than 5.7 million fans to race weekend, up 36% compared to 2019. Demand is continuing in 2023 with sellout crowd expected at a number of races this season. \n Formal One was once again the fastest-growing major sports league on the planet in 2022 in terms of social media followers. We have 60.6 million total followers, up 23% from 2021 and saw significant growth in markets like the U.S. where social followers were up 42% versus 2021 to 4.5 million. \n Additionally, across f1.com and the F1 app, unique users were up 11% versus 2021 to 125 million. On viewership cumulative TV audiences for the 2022 season was 1.54 billion, and average viewership raise was 70 million. U.S. viewership was up 36% compared to 2021 with an average of 1.2 million viewers tuning in on race days. \n Looking at some other markets. Italy viewership grew 22%. Australia was up to 20% and Germany viewership grew 9%. With our newer younger demographic, the digital share of F1 video minutes consumed grew from 16% in 2021 to 24% in 2022. As an endorsement of F1 growing global popularity, technological relevance and sustainability efforts, Ford announced the return to F1 from 2026 in a new partnership with Red Bull. Ford is a celebrated name in Motor Sport with a storied F1 history dating back into the '60s, and they are the third most successful engine manufacture in F1 history. We expect Ford's involvement as a technical engine provider will bring value not only to Red Bull, but to the sport. \n The growing fan engagement has benefited both new and renewed commercial agreements. F1 grew revenue across all primary sources: promotion, media right and advertising and sponsorship. In addition, our Paddock Club hospitality product performed especially well in 2022, its first full season of operations since the onset of the pandemic. We welcomed 50,000 guests over the season with sellout up 12 out of 19 events. In 2023, we are focused on optimizing the value of our Paddock Club by expanding the premium services we offer, continuing to enhance the guest experience and adjusting pricing. \n Turning to recent updates on our commercial agreements. On race promotion, we extended our race in Zandvoort from 2024 and 2025, and the '23 Dutch Grand Prix is already sold out. The promoter has focused on sustainability from travel with 99% of general admission ticket holders in 2022 arriving by public transportation, bike or on foot. \n We signed a number of large broadcast agreements throughout 2022, including renewing our partnership with Sky, in major European markets and with ESPN in U.S. More recently, we entered into a multi-year media rights agreement with BeIN Sport to exclusively broadcast F1 in 10 territories across Asia. Our FOX Sport agreement in Mexico was extended through 2025. We also renewed our partnership with Play Sport in Belgium for 2023 and 2024.  And our agreement with DAZN in Japan through 2025. F1 TV continues to grow in popularity among new and heritage fans. The product is now available in 120 countries. \n On sponsorship, just last week, we announced the addition of Qatar Airways as a global airline partner under multiyear agreement. They will also be the tattoo sponsor at 3 races. Looking forward, there are a number of areas we continue to explore for additional sponsorship opportunity, including travel, financial services, food and beverage, telecommunication and more. \n Our team is continuously building fund engagement opportunities to capitalize on our momentum. The fifth season of Drive to Survive aired on February 24. The 2023 F1 is for [ qualify ] round is being held through May 25 and we hope to build on the strong engagement from last year when 1.3 million players attempted to qualify. The new license program, F1RK launched its first location in London in December, hosting over 600 F1 guests and celebrities at the official launch party, who experienced the excitement on F1 with 60 full motion racing simulator. \n The second venue will open in Birmingham in the U.K. in the fourth quarter 2023, with additional locations planned to follow. A new F1 exhibition will also launch in Madrid later this month and remain there before moving to Milan in time for the Italian Grand Prix. This is a 90 minutes immersive experience guiding visitors through the past, present and the future of the sport. And it's planned to visit 25 cities around the world over the next decade. We are counting down to the start of 2023 season. [ Bahrain ] testing finished last week and with another year of improvements to the track, we are expecting even fiercest competition on the track. \n Ferrari and Mercedes are certainly eager for their come back. There will be new phases on the grid with Nyck de Vries, Oscar Piastri and a promising young and American driver Logan Sargeant as well as the return of Nico Hulkenberg. The '23 race calendar is a record for Formal One. We made the decision not to replace China on the calendar at the most economic benefit of a replacement race was not worth the logistical and sustainability consideration for F1 and our teams. There will be 6 Prix events held in Azerbaijan, Austria, Spa, Qatar, Austin and Brazil. The Sprint series have been successful in driving attendance and engagement across the entire weekend for our promoters and broadcast partners. \n The 2023 calendar will feature 3 races in the U.S. including taking to the street of Las Vegas for a night race in November. We announced Heineken Silver as the type of sponsor and T-Mobile as the exclusive wireless provider. The plan to deploy an advanced 5G public network and race we can that will power our customer app and enhance the efficiency of the fan experience. \n Our second wave of public ticket sales will launch soon. And in spring, the world begins on resurfacing the track roads with digital plans in place to minimize disruption to the Las Vegas flow of traffic in the process. We have made a long-term investment in Las Vegas, which we expect to set us up to the race for decades to come. \n And finally, we made several announcements furthering our efforts in sustainability, diversity and inclusion. F1 recently announced a global charity partnership with UNICEF to help bring quality education to the world's most vulnerable children, building on F1long history of promoting STEM education worldwide. \n We also look forward to [ debut ] F1 Academy in 2023. The series intend to maximize the potential of young female drivers to reach the highest level in motorsport, providing those currently in go-carting or other junior categories with access to the fundamental experience needed before racing an F3 and working up to Formula One. The series will be consist of 5 teams run by current F2 and F3 teams, each entry 3 cash to make up our 15 cars grids. The first season will comprise 21 total races ending as a support event at the Austin Grand Prix in October. \n I'm delighted that today we have announced Susie Wolff as the Managing Director of the F1 Academy. She has a wealth of experience as a driver and team principal and will provide huge value to the project. \n Wrapping 2022 and looking to 2023, I think F1 is the strongest position it has ever been. This year, we launched a new brand campaign demonstrating F1 place in the sporting and entertainment world, giving new fans a reason to actively engage with the 2023 season and keep coming back for more. F1 is an admissible and extraordinary spectacle and adrenaline field and intoxicating world of action, innovation and entertainment, both on and off the track. \n We have the extraordinary potential of technology until work comes together to make the difference between winning and being forgotten. This is not ordinary sport. This is Formula One. [Foreign Language] so full speed ahead. \n And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Vijay, for the question. I'll start for the second. This logistic cost is true last year it was a combined factor that we had to pay for that and included the team. But I would say the first signal that we see already this year is going in the right direction of these logistics cost to be reduced. \n And in that respect, there is also the other element that we are trying to be even more efficient in order to make sure that the things are done in the proper way. And this is very, very important to share that. And on the other side, with regard to the partners, of course, we want to keep the exclusivity as a main value and we don't want to put on the other side, the final number of that. It's importable -- it's important that we give the right value to the global partner but also to the other verticals that are coming into the equation because we never had such a strong pipeline. So it's up to us really to make sure that everyone is the right visibility and value for what is the investor related with us. No, I totally Greg, if I may add just 2 considerations. Something financially means also the strength of the entire system to invest with also the strategy to engage more with fans and partners that will have a direct effect to the growth and the strength of the business itself. And we don't have to forget that not many years ago, the teams were suffering and we, as F1, were there, to support them financially. And this is something that we don't have to forget. That's why we really believe that the more value we give to the team, the more value will go back to the system and to the entire business. Yes. I would say that Greg -- the main sporting pillar for sure  covered. We talked about raising on the sporting side, on the technical side, on the financial side, these are elements of which we really are focused because we have shown in the short term that we've find the ideas to improve the respect of the race in itself. But if we have to add another dimension related to the fact that we are an entertainment platform that is growing, we are working on a new form of fan engagement with different social content, with a new way of connecting with media, but also we don't have to forget one thing that I would say is getting more and more relevant. \n The way that we are doing our sport in a context where we are talking about very important values when we are talking about the diversity in our project, when we are talking about our social responsibility, when we are talking about our ideas to develop on the sustainability side of it, I think that all these new elements of discussion are elements that are tracking new people, new fans of Formula One. And also, we have the opportunity to talk about these things with a different voice. And the tone of voice, of course, is different depending on who we want to engage with. But we are a platform of connectivity. So broader connectivity means that all the elements that are able to attract interest has to be discussed and operated in the way that hopefully we have shown to be very serious. Yes. Can you hear me, Peter? Okay. Sorry. I was losing the line. No, I think that the global popularity as you said, is growing, and this is a fact. And I would say what we are bringing home is the fact that all the other sport league business are really interested in understanding how our growth was so fast and dramatic. And -- but of course, we are quite humble in that approach because we want to learn from everyone around the world, what we can capture in order to increase let's say, our way of growing. \n I think that is one key that is very important is the way that we engage with our drivers with the fans. And they are really the voice, the authentic voice of the business we are in. We feel that sharing with them the responsibility of that fan engagement is giving us an incredible attraction because then that attractive approach will turn into business, if you think about gaming. If you think about the fact of the drive, then the fans wants to attend to the race. If you see that fans wants to follow, the count on our social media. So I think this is really one of the key elements that is quite unique. And I think on that, we will work even hard to make sure that this voice is even stronger. Yes. I couldn't agree more. I think that is absolutely, totally right. And we don't have to forget that in such a short time, we moved in a new dimension that has been the promoter in a way that no one was thinking before possible. So first step for us is to make sure that we need to make sure that Vegas is right first at the first attempt. So total focus on that. And then, of course, I'm sure that this will -- an incredible push for all the promoter to see what is really -- what can be done better. \n So I think that already by doing that will be an incredible push for everyone to push for a better qualitative result for -- from everyone. We have a huge demand around the world to host Grand Prix, not only in the U.S. but also in Paris. So this could be experience that can be used to better organize Grand Prix in the future. But so far, let's make sure that we are totally focused on making Vegas super special there."

Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference will be recorded today, November 4th. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Courtnee Chun, Chief Portfolio Officer. Please go ahead.\nCourtnee Chun: Thank you, and good morning. Before we begin, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in Liberty Media\u2019s most recent 10-K and 10-Q or Liberty Media Acquisition\u2019s most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call and Liberty Media and Liberty Media Acquisition expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media or Liberty Media Acquisition\u2019s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. On today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Media and SiriusXM including adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA. The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media and SiriusXM Schedules 1 and 2 can be found at the end of the earnings press release issued today, which is available on Liberty Media\u2019s website. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty\u2019s President and CEO.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you. Good morning. Today speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One\u2019s President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali; and Liberty\u2019s Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. So, let me start with Liberty SiriusXM. Last quarter, we discussed our intention to reduce debt at LSXM and we took actions during the third quarter. We opportunistically repurchased about 21% of the 1.375% Basket convert combining prudent debt management and effective share buyback. FWON paid $64 million and BATR paid $14 million to LSXM to settle their respective intergroup interest. The remainder of the repurchase was funded with LSXM cash and $27 million from an unwind of a bond hedge and warrant. Effectively, this was a share repurchase across the LMC equities with $179 million effective cost to repurchase 4.5 million LSXMA shares and $1.1 million FWONA and $500,000 BATRA intergroup interest shares effectively repurchased. We are still hedged on the remaining exposure under that convert with our intergroup interest. Turning now to SiriusXM itself. They reported solid third quarter financial results despite the macro factors impacting the business. The resilient sub base experienced a record low churn of 1.5%, revenue was up 4% and EBITDA was flat as we continue to make investments, including end product development. Despite soft auto sales, we continue to achieve vehicle penetrations with an enabled fleet of approximately $150 million. SiriusXM also set out strong cash flow business and guidance for the year, full year guidance for 2022. We continue to monitor headwinds in advertising and the reduced SAR impact on the top of the funnel. Sirius is also making progress in the streaming business. September was one of the biggest streaming sub-acquisition months they\u2019ve experienced to date. And we continue to add exclusive and diverse content, both in and out of the car. For example, we extended the NFL agreement. Sports has proven obviously to be high appeal for new subs to both convert at a higher rate and higher retention, once they are obtained. Turning to Live Nation. Live Nation continued to see incredible demand with fans prioritizing spending on live events. Versus 2019, AOI was up 45% and free cash flow was up 88%. Live also beat last quarter\u2019s record for highest quarterly attendance with over 44 million fans across 11,000 events. Per fan spending was up 30% through September in U.S. amphitheaters, and Ticketmaster experienced all-time high GTV, which was up 62% versus 2019. Live is closing out a record year, but there is more growth to come with 115 million tickets already sold and sponsorship for 2023 up 30% over this point last year. Turning now to the Formula One Group. We continue to come up with new analogies, which are familiar and F1 continued to fire on all cylinders with incredible fan demand. There is significant growth in grandstand and Paddock Club attendance with many sellouts and records broken. Importantly, as we\u2019ve invested, there has been a continued growth also in the U.S. market with three races planned for next year, including our landmark Vegas race. We also announced the renewal of our ESPN contract at a value, which was many multiples of the prior contract. We also announced a record 24 race calendar for the coming year, including renewing in Monaco, where we have a 3-year agreement to keep that iconic race on schedule; renewing in Mexico City, where we have a 3-year deal, which highlights the value that F1 brings to all cities. For example, between 2015 and 2021, the Mexico City Grand Prix generated $2.4 billion of economic activity and created 57,000 jobs. We will continue to capitalize on the momentum of the business. An example recently is the film that Apple has planned, which we think will be epic. We had a star-studded cast, including Brad Pitt. It\u2019s directed by Joseph Kosinski, and it\u2019s produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, all stars in their own right, very exciting. At the corporate level, we refinanced the FWONK convertible on attractive terms with fewer shares underlying the instrument and a lower initial conversion price of $86.06. And now turning to the Braves. Braves finished an impressive season, securing their fifth straight NL East title. They finished 101 and 61. For the first time since 2003, they won over 100 games and it was an epic comeback for the second half of the season. As you may recall, beginning -- the start of June, we were 10.5 games behind the Mets. From there, we went on a Major League best, nearly 700 win rate from the start of that June until the end of the season. The fans had an incredible turnout with 52 games sellouts at Truist and more tickets sold at the stadium since we had done -- since last in 2000. Obviously, the finale was not what we had hoped. But I remind you, we did win the World Series last year. We are for a few more weeks the reigning World Series champions. And there are wonderful things that come from that, but it also can lead to increased costs. We think they ultimately create value for the franchise and fan engagement, which will drive revenue. But on the increased cost side, the largest component has been reinvesting in increased payroll. We think that sets us up well up -- well rather for future years. But other elevated costs from record attendance and 4 additional home -- we have other elevated costs rather from our record attendance and 4 additional home games at the Truist ballpark. There were also modest cost increases for post World Series activities, for example, a trophy tour and creating special merchandise. And let me finish by talking about LMAC. We recently sent out a press release announcing our vote for an early rewind. While the results have not been what we wanted in terms of finding the deal that we thought was attractive, I would tell you we evaluated over 140 targets, but the high valuations for 2021, the poor IPO market, plus overall market volatility led us to the conclusion that we could not find a solid target with attractive valuation and return characteristics. Finally, the recent tax law changes under the IRA created additional corporate liabilities if we were to extend the unwind into 2023. And therefore, we took action to unwind and return the capital to the investors in 2022. And with that, I\u2019m going to turn it to Brian to let him talk about our financial results in more detail.\nBrian Wendling: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group has attributed cash and liquid investments of approximately $225 million, which excludes $39 million of cash held directly at SiriusXM. There\u2019s also $1.3 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM and Live Nation margin loans. In September, Liberty SiriusXM Group paid approximately $284 million to repurchase $210 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.375% cash convertible notes. This was funded with $179 million of cash on hand as well as cash from the Formula One Group and Braves Group from the settlement of their intergroup interest held at Liberty SiriusXM, corresponding to the amount of notes repurchased. As a result, 1.1 million FWONA shares and $500,000 BATRA shares underlying the portion of their respective intergroup interest held by LSXM were canceled. Liberty SiriusXM Group also received $27 million of proceeds from the net settlement of the bond hedge and warrants related to the repurchase of the convertible notes. As of November 3rd, the value of the SiriusXM stock held at Liberty SiriusXM Group was $19.5 billion, and the value of the Live Nation stock held was $5.3 billion. We have $2.8 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total LSXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.4 billion, which includes $9.9 billion of debt that\u2019s directly at the SiriusXM level. Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $1.1 billion at quarter end, which excludes $1.1 billion of cash held at Formula 1. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.5 billion, which includes the $2.9 billion of debt directly held at Formula 1, leaving $567 million at the corporate level. During the quarter, we issued $475 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% FWONK convertible notes due 2027. A portion of the proceeds from the offering were used to repurchase $213 million aggregate principal amount of the 1% FWONK convertible notes due 2023, leaving just $27 million outstanding at the end of the quarter. F1\u2019s $500 million revolver is undrawn and Formula 1\u2019s leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.8 times. As Greg mentioned, LMAC filed a proxy statement to obtain stockholder approval to unwind before year-end. Formula One Group has incurred approximately $20 million in costs since LMAC\u2019s IPO in January of 2021 through the initial warrant investment and subsequent working capital loans. On unwind, these are material investments will not be recoverable, but the $250 million forward purchase agreement that Formula One Group had committed to LMAC will be terminated. On the Formula 1 operating business, we will remind you that F1 is best viewed on a full year basis, given some volatility in the quarters. F1 held 7 races during the third quarters of both 2021 and 2022. However, there wasn\u2019t one additional flyaway race during Q3 of \u201821 with Russia having taken place last year and France hosting a race this year. Race promotion revenue decreased accordingly for the quarter. The flyaway races typically pay higher fees than European races. As a reminder, we recognize team payments pro rata across the race calendar, though a quarter where we recognized less revenue due to the mix of races, the team payment percentage may appear disproportionately larger. F1 also recognized higher other cost of revenue, primarily due to one additional Paddock Club operating in Q3 2022 and from the cost of servicing significantly larger Paddock Club attendances compared to the prior year period. SG&A as a percent of total revenue was generally in line with historical averages for the third quarter. We did have modest increases in personnel costs due to a change in the company\u2019s LTIP from a stock to cash-based bonus program and increased headcount to support growth. Looking year-to-date, revenue increased 35% and our adjusted OIBDA grew 43% with 140 basis points of margin expansion. Finally, at the Braves Group, at quarter end, they had attributed cash and liquid investments of $159 million, which excludes $15 million of restricted cash and the Braves Group had attributed principal amount debt of $601 million. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with the debt covenants at quarter end. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Stefano [Technical Difficulty].\nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Brian. The 2022 season has continued to deliver very impressive racing for all our fans and once again shows how the new technical regulation have delivered closer racing on the track. The interest in Formula 1 is huge from fans, potential partners and those who want to host the race. We continue to believe that this is due to us taking the right strategic decisions to grow the sport in the correct way and to focus on the most important priorities. Formula 1 just finished a couple of amazing weekends in Mexico City and in Austin, and the 2022 season has delivered exciting action on the track. Max Verstappen has been an incredible this decision, setting a record for most wins in the season with 14 Grand Prix wins so far in 2022 with his win in Mexico City last weekend. He secured his second world championship in Suzuka and Red Bull won the Constructor\u2019s Championship, their first since 2013. The team dedicated the victory to Red Bull\u2019s Founder, Dietrich Mateschitz. He was a visionary who helped transform our sport and they will be missed. Even with this championship settled, there is still a battle among the drivers and constructor as where they finish can have a meaningful impact both financially and operationally. Excitement for our sport continues to grow. Certainly, we\u2019ve seen that in the race attendance and now had 10 races with crowds over 300,000 with three of those exceeding 400,000. Many of these events have been complete sellout. A great example of growing interest is Austin, where we welcomed 440,000 fans across the event, more than double the attendance in 2019. The promoter states that the ticket demand could have reached 500,000, but for this focus on maintaining a high-quality fan experience. We\u2019ve also seen more first-time and female attendees at our races. Across the 10 races where we gathered spectators data this year, first-time attendees were about 50% of the total crowd. And we\u2019ve seen surge in demand on the higher end, too, with record sale in Paddock Club and our hospitality products. This sort of demand means our races slots are highly coveted and we were pleased to confirm the 2023 calendar a few weeks ago. We were happy to renew our agreement with Monaco and will race there through 2025, with expanded rights for Formula 1 related to broadcast, Paddock Club and sponsorship. We also announced a one-year renewal for Belgium and a three-year renewal for Mexico City. As Greg mentioned, the economic benefit F1 has brought to Mexico City since 2015 has been incredible. This highlights the value of our sport can bring to cities globally. Additionally, we will increase the number of sprint events in 2023 to 6 from the current 3. These events are in high demand from our promoters and provide additional sponsorship opportunities and value to our broadcast partners. We will announce the venues for those events soon. We were thrilled to announce that Audi will join Formula 1 in 2026. They have selected Sauber as their strategic partner and plan to acquire a stake in the Sauber Group, who will compete as a now de facto team from 2026. Formula 1 presents a global stage for the Audi brand, and they see the high performance and competition in our sport as a driver of innovation and technology. Audi was further attracted to F1 given our efforts in sustainability and cost efficiency, which will aid in achieving their own sustainability goals. It also shows the increasing value of the teams in the current environment, driven by the stability provided under the new regulation and the growth of the sport, of which everyone in F1 continues to benefit. We are delighted to grow our partnership with AWS. As we announced yesterday the expansion of our partnership with them becoming a Global Partner of Formula 1. We both share a passion for technological innovation, and we work together to build the fun experience of the future. Viewers continue to tune in as well as we have seen substantial interest related to our media rights. We announced a partnership with Sky that extends right in Germany and Italy until 2027 and the U.K. and Ireland until 2029. Sky Sports F1 will continue to be the only dedicated channel to broadcast motor sport in each of these markets and their highly rated commentary will be available in over 80 markets. Sky has seen significant growth in the viewership so far this season with average viewership in the UK up to 60% since 2019; Italy up to 20% since 2021; and Germany up to 24 since 2021. They\u2019ve also seen attractive demographic shift with viewers becoming more diverse and younger. We also extended our U.S. agreement with ESPN through 2025. They have been a great partner to us. And with this new deal, at least 16 races per year will air on either ABC or ESPN with all broadcast commercial-free. Through 18 races in 2022, they\u2019ve seen an average audience of 1.2 million up from 994,000 [ph] in 2021. The Miami Grand Prix drew an average viewership of 2.6 million, the largest U.S. audience on record for a live GP. Additionally, we extended our agreement with ServusTV in Austria until 2026 and secured a partnership with Telcel and Telmex in Mexico to bring F1TV Pro to a subscriber who can easily add the service on to their existing contracts for mobile or internet services. The F1 Esports Series Pro championship presented by Aramco returned for 4 events, each spanning over 3 years. This includes more live show as the teams and the drivers battle for their $750,000 prize spot. Similar to F1, we have seen several high-profile drivers move across the grid. We look forward to building on the incredible engagement for 2021 when we saw 4.5 million fans tune in for the grand finale. This year, we had 1.3 million players attempt to qualify, almost 3 times the amount we had in 2021. We continue to expand the way we engage with fans and introduce the F1 Arcade in London. This is the first F1 licensed experiential venue. Patrons can be fully immersed with 60 motion simulators and experience the thrill of racing while enjoying premium food and beverage offerings in the heart of London. We plan to roll out this concept in additional cities. And finally, to further our progress to net zero, Formula 2 and Formula 3 announced a partnership with Aramco to pioneer sustainable fuel for 2023. This is an important step to reach a 100% sustainable fuel by 2026, which will be a requirement of all FIA championships. F2 and F3 have proven to be a great test bed for innovation as they were with the 18-inch tires now used in Formula 1. We continue to show the innovation and leadership in the technology space and believe that our sustainable fuel can have a huge real world benefit for the automotive sector and greenhouse gas emission. I want to thank the whole F1 family, our fans and our investors for all the support this year. Tomorrow, we are hosting a launch party in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace. We are bringing the best race in the world to the entertainment capital of the world, including a large caravan on Las Vegas Boulevard. We look forward to completing an amazing 2022 season as we travel to Brazil and Abu Dhabi. Avanti tutta, full speed ahead. And now, I will turn the call back over to Greg. Bye, bye. Ciao.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Stefano, and thank you, Brian. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Investor Day on Thursday, November 17th. Please visit the IR calendar on our website for registration details. John Malone and I will be hosting our annual Q&A session. If you\u2019d like to submit questions in advance, you can e-mail investor@libertymedia.com. We appreciate your continued support of and interest in Liberty Media. And with that, operator, I\u2019d like to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: Greg, I just wanted to focus on Liberty SiriusXM Group. Just curious if you have any updated thoughts on the discount to asset value and sort of options and timing of options to improve that? And I guess as part of that, specifically, just curious if you could talk about the strategy around the Live Nation stake at Liberty and whether there\u2019s ways for Liberty to create value with that stake beyond just being sort of an ongoing shareholder of Live Nation, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019re bullish on. But are there other ways for Liberty to create value with that ownership stake? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Well, Doug, I think -- thank you for the question. I think we\u2019ve gone through some of the options that are on the table and discussed them before, and I\u2019m probably unlikely to do that -- to go through them all again, but to say we are aware. We\u2019re paying attention. We\u2019re taking actions to prepare ourselves for different choices, set ourselves up. And when we have something to announce, obviously, we\u2019ll make the announcement. I just want to reiterate, we think Live is very attractive. We think that certainly the value is not fully recognized in LSXM. And we think there are things that -- businesses that are worthy to add on to Live that could be interesting, that are opportunities for us. So there\u2019s much we can do around that book, around the Live stake in particular. But I\u2019m less likely to go through every nuance on what we can do with LSXM because I think we\u2019ve covered those before.\nDoug Mitchelson: Maybe, Greg, as just a quick follow-up, you could help investors kind of shape time frames. Are there things that you can do that you think are material in the short term, next 12 months, or are these things that will take longer to play out? Anything thoughts around helping us with time tables?\nGreg Maffei: Doug, I give you full credit for persistence, but I think I said what I\u2019m going to say.\nOperator: Next question is from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Kraft: I\u2019ve got one for Stefano and one for Greg, that you may or may not answer, but I\u2019ll try. I think on past calls when asked about the ATB status of SiriusXM, you said that you believe it is an ATB. I was wondering if your conviction with respect to SiriusXM being an ATB has since increased. Can you say more definitively that it actually does have ATB status? And then Stefano, your comments on the attendance increases, I think, were really interesting. I think that the view on race promotion revenue historically has been that it\u2019s sort of a flattish type revenue outlook given the high pricing on those deals and some challenged promoter economics. But with the increases in ticket sales and attendance you talked about and that must deliver a lot of value to promoters, do you think that that means race promotion revenue could become actually a significant and consistent revenue growth driver going forward? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: I\u2019m going to let Stefano cover attendance first and then I\u2019ll touch on the things I\u2019m not going to answer with you, Bryan.\nStefano Domenicali: Okay. Thanks, Greg. Well, actually, you\u2019re totally right. The attendance increase is just magnificent in terms of what Formula 1, is bringing mainly to new audiences. And that is true that the business model we are having with certain promoter is more related to the fact that there is a fee that they have to pay, there is the high-end Paddock Club that is on our side. And there\u2019s -- not a challenge, but the big opportunity to move forward is how we can maximize the revenue and monetize the revenue that we can take from the fact that Formula 1 has become more and more attractive. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re going to do in the future. We have a different way to do it, and I\u2019m sure that we\u2019re going to capitalize this growth in the best way that we can in the next couple of years.\nGreg Maffei: Thanks, Stefano. So Bryan, I\u2019m going to give you confidence. I\u2019m going to restate, I still believe SiriusXM as an ATB, no change in our position. These things tend to get resolved and firmed up at the time something gets tested, but that -- we still have that position.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet: I know you guys have always talked in the past about the flexibility that the trackers give you because you can sort of move assets and liabilities across. Is there -- but when I step back and I think about sort of broader Liberty, it feels like there is sort of a slow march towards asset-backed securities, right, like eventually the terminal year, it seems to me everything is going to be asset backed. Is that wrong?\nGreg Maffei: Well, thank you for the question, Jason. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really seen a change in our procedure. We think the tracker has real value and gives us flexibility. But our history has also been that we created many, many asset-backed securities. Off the top of my head, I can think of the media, which was effectively DIRECTV, CommerceHub, Expedia, Liberty Expedia going to Expedia. The list goes on. And we\u2019ve obviously breaking curate off on its own, I mean I can -- many, many times. And that\u2019s going back in my 17 years. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve had a diminution in our interest in trackers or a change in our perspective that asset-backed securities certainly have their value at the right time and place.\nJason Bazinet: Okay. Does sort of unwinding or shuttering the SPAC sort of nudge you more in the direction of not needing flexibility, or is that sort of a false interpretation?\nGreg Maffei: Yes, I\u2019m not sure I would read that as the interpretation. I think it\u2019s a recognition of these things have a life, the market. At a moment in time, we thought there was an opportunity. We couldn\u2019t find the one we wanted. Unlike many sponsors of SPACs who were playing for the carry, we had committed real capital and we\u2019re concerned about and aligned with our shareholders in wanting to have a good return, not just a pop. I think SPACs are obviously challenged for many reasons, both because of the market reaction right now and also because of the regulatory profile towards them. So, that was a recognition of those factors, not any statement about lack of optionality or flexibility or desire for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Karnovsky with JP Morgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Stefano, I wanted to see if you could expand a bit on your media rights renewal with Sky. What drove the decision to do that deal early and across multiple territories? And then, Greg, just wanted to see if you could update on how you\u2019re thinking about using Formula 1\u2019s cash balance in light of your net leverage and decision on LMAC. Thanks.\nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, David. I think that when we talk about media rights is a landscape where we have to consider the evolution, mainly in the new market that is becoming attractive for Formula 1. In the more, let\u2019s say, traditional mature market, I think that\u2019s what we have taken as a decision to invest and to be stable with Sky means a lot, because in terms of the other opportunities in this market are not really the ones that can extend from the financial and also for the awareness point of view and the country point of view what we want to achieve. It is clear that the fact that we are growing give us potential for the future to see how in that kind of the dimension, not only pay TV, but also other means that could be interesting for us to be attractive for our business. Of course, we want to make sure that -- for the future decision, there is also the possibility for our F1 TV that is going tremendously well to be incorporated in the offer to our customers. So that\u2019s really the strategy that we have taken so far. And this is, I would say, if you go back to Sky, the recognition of the value of that investment for the value of our F1 content in the world.\nGreg Maffei: Yes. If I could just add on -- I mean, I reinforce the point. Sky is a great partner across 3 important geographies. But more than that, they\u2019re a great partner in terms of their production. Most of you here in the U.S. are watching the Sky broadcast. And I have to tell you, I\u2019m always very impressed with what they do and securing that and ensuring that good partnership for a longer period of time was attractive. As far as what our uses of cash are going to be, we have a high-quality problem that we have a great free cash flow generating entity in Formula 1 with, we believe, the potential to increase that over time. You\u2019ve seen us buy back stock at various times at Formula 1. But we also think there are potentially in this market opportunities for all the reasons that I talked about the difficulty in the market, a nonmarket tested or no need to do external financing, ability to do something on our own could create interesting opportunities. So, we will continue to weigh both the flexibility that we\u2019re provided by those free cash flows and the delevering against share repurchase, against other alternatives in the space like investing in our business at Las Vegas and outside opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: A few on F1 for -- I guess, for Greg or Stefano or both of you, on the ESPN deal, which is -- or Disney deal is now formally announced, at least from the press, you guys took less money -- it\u2019s a lot of money, but less money than you could have had. I think I know why. But could you just spend a couple of minutes talking about why? What is new in this ESP and ABC deal besides more money that you think is strategic and sort of the benefits of this agreement and the duration that you picked because obviously the U.S. market is a huge opportunity for you. And then, maybe this is for Brian, but just -- you didn\u2019t mention currency in the press release at F1. I didn\u2019t know if that was a material or not material impact in the quarter. And G&A and corporate costs were both up quite a bit year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, maybe Vegas related. Just any color there, if there\u2019s onetimers would be helpful.\nGreg Maffei: I\u2019ll touch on ESPN first and then I\u2019ll let Stefano add if it\u2019s okay. Look, we have had a belief in the strength of the business, which caused us to cut initially a shorter deal without getting the highest paid last time. And on this renewal, we did the same. We wanted the broadest exposure. ESPN has been a very good partner. We think the opportunity to continue to grow the sport in the United States caused us to cut a relatively short-term deal with them because we think we will get -- do better on the renewals. So far, betting on ourselves has been the right strategy, betting on growth, betting on breadth rather than a current pay has been the right strategy and I think you saw that exhibited. There were other things that ESPN has been a great partner about, and I think the opportunity to work with them on things like F1 TV was a part of why they were a good partner and go forward on that basis. So, I\u2019m -- we\u2019re very excited about F1 and ESPN being together for the next three years. But I have to tell you, we\u2019re also excited about the kind of opportunity we\u2019ll see in three years when we renew with somebody. Stefano, what would you add?\nStefano Domenicali: I couldn\u2019t agree more, Greg. I think that we need to recognize that because sometimes we have a very short memory. A couple of years ago, there were not so many media rights holder in U.S. that wanted to invest with us. And now we need to give the credit to ESPN that in terms of content, in terms of attention, in terms of how they are really following Formula 1, they did a phenomenal job, which will be even stronger in the next three years because we have agreed the positioning of the race in certain channels to have more attention to that. So, I think that we talked carefully about this step. And I think that the fact also that with this agreement, we keep as mentioning the F1 TV on our side means a lot. So I think that the best solution in three years\u2019 time, we see how the market will develop. We are pretty sure due to the growth in U.S. that there would be other players that will be around the table and interested to be with us in the future.\nBrian Wendling: Yes. Then, Ben, on your other twp questions, FX was pretty much de minimis for the quarter. We\u2019ll just remind you that about 80% of our revenue and costs are actually in U.S. dollars. So, we do have ups and downs on FX from time to time. It was not impactful in the third quarter. And then on the G&A question, again, I would just reiterate, always better to look at this on a full year basis, but we did have a mix shift in the number of races that were either European versus flyaway. We lost Russia in the current period. So that has a bit of a margin impact. There was higher G&A to support the overall revenue growth and margin expansion on a year-to-date basis. And then, as you pointed out, on Vegas, still not material, but obviously, there are some costs in there related to Vegas as they have their prepared for their launch event and ticket sales.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities.\nBarton Crockett: Okay. I guess two questions, if I could. The first is just the macro situation in Europe. It\u2019s really kind of at levels that we haven\u2019t seen in years, maybe in my lifetime, I don\u2019t know about others. And I\u2019m just wondering, at what point do you think that this could have an impact on the F1 business? It doesn\u2019t seem like it has to date and maybe the answer is it never will. But at what point do you think we\u2019d ever get to a point where this could have an impact on attendance at races and maybe an impact on race promotion fees because communities or promoters are economically challenged.\nStefano Domenicali: Thank you, Barton. I mean, let me figure out these things. First of all, being a world championship, we can spread around the world the risk of having this kind of situation to manage. On the other hand, the fact that we have long-term agreements will reduce the exposure to this risk. And what I can say and share with you is that we already see an incredible number of preregistration with regards to the ticketing of next year. So, this is a good sign in the context that you\u2019re seeing mainly Europe where I\u2019m living, it is clear that this recession is taking place. But I think that the way that we are structured, the way that we have done the deal will protect us -- will enable us to move forward in this direction. Therefore, I would say this kind of situation lets us think that we should be optimistic in this context that is, of course, we monitor. But this is what we see today.\nGreg Maffei: Yes. I think -- and then if I can just add we\u2019re seeing a case where look across our business, high-end consumers are still purchasing, whether that\u2019s at Formula 1 or at Live Nation or at the Atlanta Braves. Demand for all those services is very high. And I think that is reinforcing the point that Stefano made, we have many promoters who are doing very well, including those in Europe. And there is high demand, both among consumers and therefore, promoter confidence on the -- against those long-term contracts. We feel very good.\nBarton Crockett: Okay. And then, the other thing I was curious about is the fact that we\u2019ve got the race winner, the team winners pretty well sown up well before the season is over at Formula 1 versus last year, things were pretty competitive, right, until the very end, the last lap. What difference does that make in terms of the financial arc of your business over the balance of this year? I mean is that a headwind in any way? Anything you can speak to based on historical or any other kind of anecdotes?\nStefano Domenicali: Well, actually, we don\u2019t see any kind of risk at all. I mean, first of all, we have the last two races with sold down tickets and the number is really growing. The attention will be shift, of course, in other fight -- on the sporting -- from the sporting perspective. So that\u2019s part of racing. And I would like to add, if I may, another comment. We are totally positive on the impact that the change of regulation throughout this year. And we cannot comment on the fact that the team, but specifically in this case, Red Bull or Max Verstappen did an incredible job. Maybe -- team didn\u2019t take the right opportunities, but what we saw on the track is with real racing, that\u2019s what we wanted. And I\u2019m totally confident that next year, the fight on the track will arrive up to the end of the calendar. And -- yes. And as you have seen in the last races, on the sporting side, there is a lot of attention. There is a fight for places that also, for the team perspective, is related to the financial position and the financial rewarding, if they achieve a position better than the other team. So I think there will be a lot of interest in Brazil and Abu Dhabi, too, with no problem.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Joyce with Barclays.\nDavid Joyce: A couple on Formula 1. First, I was wondering if you could help us understand what\u2019s incremental in the new agreement with AWS. And then secondly, I was wondering if you could explain what the gating factors would be to adding another F1 team? Is it allowed in the current concrete agreement, or would that require a renewal? And is it the factor of maybe the buy-in to keep everybody equal just being kind of prohibitive? But if you could just walk us through the thought process and restrictions there would be helpful.\nStefano Domenicali: Thank you, David, for the question. As you can imagine, on the incremental value of AWS, we cannot go into the details. But it is a very strong relationship that it\u2019s starting from a very technical content point of view. We are working together with them on the preparation of the graphics. We are working together in order to give the right data to our customers and to our fans. So the fact that we have a new for -- so many years with an interesting increase in terms of financial contribution, it means that also AWS recognizes the power of our platform. With regard to the value or the process related to the possibility of F1 team to be into the championship, of course, there is the primary step that both us and FAA has to be an agreement for that. And I think that the first thing that we need to consider is this eventual possibility will bring an extra value to the championship. If so, of course, we\u2019re going to discuss it internally and we see if this has any kind of a real potential new entry can give the benefit for the value of the championship. On top of it, there is a value that has to be recognized to the teams that are already into the championship because, of course, they cannot allow any dilution of their financial partnership with the F1 championship. So, this is what is written in the concrete agreement. But mainly the point is does eventually a new entry will bring a better position in F1 championship? This is really into value and in terms of value from the financial point of view and in terms of value from the sporting point of view. And if I may on that, it\u2019s not a problem to having one more team to have a better racing. Therefore, we would see. We will monitor the situation. It will be a real incredible new entry team that we want to discuss with us, we are ready to discuss, but we are not in a best position today for that.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark.\nMatthew Harrigan: Thank you. With the big inflection in interest in F1, especially in the U.S., are you seeing a lot more activity on the EA game, Codemasters game that\u2019s been around forever, I guess, since 2000? And is there a potential with, I guess, the somewhat lean implementations of AR that are out there right now? Now that you\u2019ve got a movie, it feels like video games and such are another area where you could probably increase your ancillary potential a little bit. Thank you.\nStefano Domenicali: Matthew, I think that the fact that we are bringing in new customers that are getting younger and younger will allow us to see on the licensing point of view an incremental opportunity to increase the revenue stream for us. And this will happen. We are pretty sure about it. We already saw this year an incredible effect on this. On the other hand, I would say what we need to stay always focused is that we are a physical sport on the track. So any kind of growth that is happening on the -- i.e. gaming that has to be translated to the passion that we want to see the people go into the track. And this is really the things that we are focusing because that\u2019s an opportunity to stabilize the growth of our sport for the future.\nGreg Maffei: So, operator, I think we\u2019re done. Thank you all for your interest in the Liberty Media Group, and we look forward to seeing many of you in a couple of weeks in New York. And if not, until then the next call. Thank you very much, operator.\nOperator: You\u2019re very welcome. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Greg Maffei",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning. Today speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali; and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. So, let me start with Liberty SiriusXM. Last quarter, we discussed our intention to reduce debt at LSXM and we took actions during the third quarter. We opportunistically repurchased about 21% of the 1.375% Basket convert combining prudent debt management and effective share buyback. FWON paid $64 million and BATR paid $14 million to LSXM to settle their respective intergroup interest. The remainder of the repurchase was funded with LSXM cash and $27 million from an unwind of a bond hedge and warrant. Effectively, this was a share repurchase across the LMC equities with $179 million effective cost to repurchase 4.5 million LSXMA shares and $1.1 million FWONA and $500,000 BATRA intergroup interest shares effectively repurchased. We are still hedged on the remaining exposure under that convert with our intergroup interest. Turning now to SiriusXM itself. They reported solid third quarter financial results despite the macro factors impacting the business. The resilient sub base experienced a record low churn of 1.5%, revenue was up 4% and EBITDA was flat as we continue to make investments, including end product development. Despite soft auto sales, we continue to achieve vehicle penetrations with an enabled fleet of approximately $150 million. SiriusXM also set out strong cash flow business and guidance for the year, full year guidance for 2022. We continue to monitor headwinds in advertising and the reduced SAR impact on the top of the funnel. Sirius is also making progress in the streaming business. September was one of the biggest streaming sub-acquisition months they've experienced to date. And we continue to add exclusive and diverse content, both in and out of the car. For example, we extended the NFL agreement. Sports has proven obviously to be high appeal for new subs to both convert at a higher rate and higher retention, once they are obtained. Turning to Live Nation. Live Nation continued to see incredible demand with fans prioritizing spending on live events. Versus 2019, AOI was up 45% and free cash flow was up 88%. Live also beat last quarter's record for highest quarterly attendance with over 44 million fans across 11,000 events. Per fan spending was up 30% through September in U.S. amphitheaters, and Ticketmaster experienced all-time high GTV, which was up 62% versus 2019. Live is closing out a record year, but there is more growth to come with 115 million tickets already sold and sponsorship for 2023 up 30% over this point last year. Turning now to the Formula One Group. We continue to come up with new analogies, which are familiar and F1 continued to fire on all cylinders with incredible fan demand. There is significant growth in grandstand and Paddock Club attendance with many sellouts and records broken. Importantly, as we've invested, there has been a continued growth also in the U.S. market with three races planned for next year, including our landmark Vegas race. We also announced the renewal of our ESPN contract at a value, which was many multiples of the prior contract. We also announced a record 24 race calendar for the coming year, including renewing in Monaco, where we have a 3-year agreement to keep that iconic race on schedule; renewing in Mexico City, where we have a 3-year deal, which highlights the value that F1 brings to all cities. For example, between 2015 and 2021, the Mexico City Grand Prix generated $2.4 billion of economic activity and created 57,000 jobs. We will continue to capitalize on the momentum of the business. An example recently is the film that Apple has planned, which we think will be epic. We had a star-studded cast, including Brad Pitt. It's directed by Joseph Kosinski, and it's produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, all stars in their own right, very exciting. At the corporate level, we refinanced the FWONK convertible on attractive terms with fewer shares underlying the instrument and a lower initial conversion price of $86.06. And now turning to the Braves. Braves finished an impressive season, securing their fifth straight NL East title. They finished 101 and 61. For the first time since 2003, they won over 100 games and it was an epic comeback for the second half of the season. As you may recall, beginning -- the start of June, we were 10.5 games behind the Mets. From there, we went on a Major League best, nearly 700 win rate from the start of that June until the end of the season. The fans had an incredible turnout with 52 games sellouts at Truist and more tickets sold at the stadium since we had done -- since last in 2000. Obviously, the finale was not what we had hoped. But I remind you, we did win the World Series last year. We are for a few more weeks the reigning World Series champions. And there are wonderful things that come from that, but it also can lead to increased costs. We think they ultimately create value for the franchise and fan engagement, which will drive revenue. But on the increased cost side, the largest component has been reinvesting in increased payroll. We think that sets us up well up -- well rather for future years. But other elevated costs from record attendance and 4 additional home -- we have other elevated costs rather from our record attendance and 4 additional home games at the Truist ballpark. There were also modest cost increases for post World Series activities, for example, a trophy tour and creating special merchandise. And let me finish by talking about LMAC. We recently sent out a press release announcing our vote for an early rewind. While the results have not been what we wanted in terms of finding the deal that we thought was attractive, I would tell you we evaluated over 140 targets, but the high valuations for 2021, the poor IPO market, plus overall market volatility led us to the conclusion that we could not find a solid target with attractive valuation and return characteristics. Finally, the recent tax law changes under the IRA created additional corporate liabilities if we were to extend the unwind into 2023. And therefore, we took action to unwind and return the capital to the investors in 2022. And with that, I'm going to turn it to Brian to let him talk about our financial results in more detail. Thank you, Stefano, and thank you, Brian. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Investor Day on Thursday, November 17th. Please visit the IR calendar on our website for registration details. John Malone and I will be hosting our annual Q&A session. If you'd like to submit questions in advance, you can e-mail investor@libertymedia.com. We appreciate your continued support of and interest in Liberty Media. And with that, operator, I'd like to open the line for questions. Well, Doug, I think -- thank you for the question. I think we've gone through some of the options that are on the table and discussed them before, and I'm probably unlikely to do that -- to go through them all again, but to say we are aware. We're paying attention. We're taking actions to prepare ourselves for different choices, set ourselves up. And when we have something to announce, obviously, we'll make the announcement. I just want to reiterate, we think Live is very attractive. We think that certainly the value is not fully recognized in LSXM. And we think there are things that -- businesses that are worthy to add on to Live that could be interesting, that are opportunities for us. So there's much we can do around that book, around the Live stake in particular. But I'm less likely to go through every nuance on what we can do with LSXM because I think we've covered those before. Doug, I give you full credit for persistence, but I think I said what I'm going to say. I'm going to let Stefano cover attendance first and then I'll touch on the things I'm not going to answer with you, Bryan. Thanks, Stefano. So Bryan, I'm going to give you confidence. I'm going to restate, I still believe SiriusXM as an ATB, no change in our position. These things tend to get resolved and firmed up at the time something gets tested, but that -- we still have that position. Well, thank you for the question, Jason. I don't think we've really seen a change in our procedure. We think the tracker has real value and gives us flexibility. But our history has also been that we created many, many asset-backed securities. Off the top of my head, I can think of the media, which was effectively DIRECTV, CommerceHub, Expedia, Liberty Expedia going to Expedia. The list goes on. And we've obviously breaking curate off on its own, I mean I can -- many, many times. And that's going back in my 17 years. I'm not sure we've had a diminution in our interest in trackers or a change in our perspective that asset-backed securities certainly have their value at the right time and place. Yes, I'm not sure I would read that as the interpretation. I think it's a recognition of these things have a life, the market. At a moment in time, we thought there was an opportunity. We couldn't find the one we wanted. Unlike many sponsors of SPACs who were playing for the carry, we had committed real capital and we're concerned about and aligned with our shareholders in wanting to have a good return, not just a pop. I think SPACs are obviously challenged for many reasons, both because of the market reaction right now and also because of the regulatory profile towards them. So, that was a recognition of those factors, not any statement about lack of optionality or flexibility or desire for that. Yes. If I could just add on -- I mean, I reinforce the point. Sky is a great partner across 3 important geographies. But more than that, they're a great partner in terms of their production. Most of you here in the U.S. are watching the Sky broadcast. And I have to tell you, I'm always very impressed with what they do and securing that and ensuring that good partnership for a longer period of time was attractive. As far as what our uses of cash are going to be, we have a high-quality problem that we have a great free cash flow generating entity in Formula 1 with, we believe, the potential to increase that over time. You've seen us buy back stock at various times at Formula 1. But we also think there are potentially in this market opportunities for all the reasons that I talked about the difficulty in the market, a nonmarket tested or no need to do external financing, ability to do something on our own could create interesting opportunities. So, we will continue to weigh both the flexibility that we're provided by those free cash flows and the delevering against share repurchase, against other alternatives in the space like investing in our business at Las Vegas and outside opportunities. I'll touch on ESPN first and then I'll let Stefano add if it's okay. Look, we have had a belief in the strength of the business, which caused us to cut initially a shorter deal without getting the highest paid last time. And on this renewal, we did the same. We wanted the broadest exposure. ESPN has been a very good partner. We think the opportunity to continue to grow the sport in the United States caused us to cut a relatively short-term deal with them because we think we will get -- do better on the renewals. So far, betting on ourselves has been the right strategy, betting on growth, betting on breadth rather than a current pay has been the right strategy and I think you saw that exhibited. There were other things that ESPN has been a great partner about, and I think the opportunity to work with them on things like F1 TV was a part of why they were a good partner and go forward on that basis. So, I'm -- we're very excited about F1 and ESPN being together for the next three years. But I have to tell you, we're also excited about the kind of opportunity we'll see in three years when we renew with somebody. Stefano, what would you add? Yes. I think -- and then if I can just add we're seeing a case where look across our business, high-end consumers are still purchasing, whether that's at Formula 1 or at Live Nation or at the Atlanta Braves. Demand for all those services is very high. And I think that is reinforcing the point that Stefano made, we have many promoters who are doing very well, including those in Europe. And there is high demand, both among consumers and therefore, promoter confidence on the -- against those long-term contracts. We feel very good. So, operator, I think we're done. Thank you all for your interest in the Liberty Media Group, and we look forward to seeing many of you in a couple of weeks in New York. And if not, until then the next call. Thank you very much, operator."

            "name": "Brian Wendling",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group has attributed cash and liquid investments of approximately $225 million, which excludes $39 million of cash held directly at SiriusXM. There's also $1.3 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM and Live Nation margin loans. In September, Liberty SiriusXM Group paid approximately $284 million to repurchase $210 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.375% cash convertible notes. This was funded with $179 million of cash on hand as well as cash from the Formula One Group and Braves Group from the settlement of their intergroup interest held at Liberty SiriusXM, corresponding to the amount of notes repurchased. As a result, 1.1 million FWONA shares and $500,000 BATRA shares underlying the portion of their respective intergroup interest held by LSXM were canceled. Liberty SiriusXM Group also received $27 million of proceeds from the net settlement of the bond hedge and warrants related to the repurchase of the convertible notes. As of November 3rd, the value of the SiriusXM stock held at Liberty SiriusXM Group was $19.5 billion, and the value of the Live Nation stock held was $5.3 billion. We have $2.8 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total LSXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.4 billion, which includes $9.9 billion of debt that's directly at the SiriusXM level. Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $1.1 billion at quarter end, which excludes $1.1 billion of cash held at Formula 1. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.5 billion, which includes the $2.9 billion of debt directly held at Formula 1, leaving $567 million at the corporate level. During the quarter, we issued $475 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% FWONK convertible notes due 2027. A portion of the proceeds from the offering were used to repurchase $213 million aggregate principal amount of the 1% FWONK convertible notes due 2023, leaving just $27 million outstanding at the end of the quarter. F1's $500 million revolver is undrawn and Formula 1's leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.8 times. As Greg mentioned, LMAC filed a proxy statement to obtain stockholder approval to unwind before year-end. Formula One Group has incurred approximately $20 million in costs since LMAC's IPO in January of 2021 through the initial warrant investment and subsequent working capital loans. On unwind, these are material investments will not be recoverable, but the $250 million forward purchase agreement that Formula One Group had committed to LMAC will be terminated. On the Formula 1 operating business, we will remind you that F1 is best viewed on a full year basis, given some volatility in the quarters. F1 held 7 races during the third quarters of both 2021 and 2022. However, there wasn't one additional flyaway race during Q3 of \u201821 with Russia having taken place last year and France hosting a race this year. Race promotion revenue decreased accordingly for the quarter. The flyaway races typically pay higher fees than European races. As a reminder, we recognize team payments pro rata across the race calendar, though a quarter where we recognized less revenue due to the mix of races, the team payment percentage may appear disproportionately larger. F1 also recognized higher other cost of revenue, primarily due to one additional Paddock Club operating in Q3 2022 and from the cost of servicing significantly larger Paddock Club attendances compared to the prior year period. SG&A as a percent of total revenue was generally in line with historical averages for the third quarter. We did have modest increases in personnel costs due to a change in the company's LTIP from a stock to cash-based bonus program and increased headcount to support growth. Looking year-to-date, revenue increased 35% and our adjusted OIBDA grew 43% with 140 basis points of margin expansion. Finally, at the Braves Group, at quarter end, they had attributed cash and liquid investments of $159 million, which excludes $15 million of restricted cash and the Braves Group had attributed principal amount debt of $601 million. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with the debt covenants at quarter end. And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano [Technical Difficulty]. Yes. Then, Ben, on your other twp questions, FX was pretty much de minimis for the quarter. We'll just remind you that about 80% of our revenue and costs are actually in U.S. dollars. So, we do have ups and downs on FX from time to time. It was not impactful in the third quarter. And then on the G&A question, again, I would just reiterate, always better to look at this on a full year basis, but we did have a mix shift in the number of races that were either European versus flyaway. We lost Russia in the current period. So that has a bit of a margin impact. There was higher G&A to support the overall revenue growth and margin expansion on a year-to-date basis. And then, as you pointed out, on Vegas, still not material, but obviously, there are some costs in there related to Vegas as they have their prepared for their launch event and ticket sales."

            "name": "Stefano Domenicali",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. The 2022 season has continued to deliver very impressive racing for all our fans and once again shows how the new technical regulation have delivered closer racing on the track. The interest in Formula 1 is huge from fans, potential partners and those who want to host the race. We continue to believe that this is due to us taking the right strategic decisions to grow the sport in the correct way and to focus on the most important priorities. Formula 1 just finished a couple of amazing weekends in Mexico City and in Austin, and the 2022 season has delivered exciting action on the track. Max Verstappen has been an incredible this decision, setting a record for most wins in the season with 14 Grand Prix wins so far in 2022 with his win in Mexico City last weekend. He secured his second world championship in Suzuka and Red Bull won the Constructor's Championship, their first since 2013. The team dedicated the victory to Red Bull's Founder, Dietrich Mateschitz. He was a visionary who helped transform our sport and they will be missed. Even with this championship settled, there is still a battle among the drivers and constructor as where they finish can have a meaningful impact both financially and operationally. Excitement for our sport continues to grow. Certainly, we've seen that in the race attendance and now had 10 races with crowds over 300,000 with three of those exceeding 400,000. Many of these events have been complete sellout. A great example of growing interest is Austin, where we welcomed 440,000 fans across the event, more than double the attendance in 2019. The promoter states that the ticket demand could have reached 500,000, but for this focus on maintaining a high-quality fan experience. We've also seen more first-time and female attendees at our races. Across the 10 races where we gathered spectators data this year, first-time attendees were about 50% of the total crowd. And we've seen surge in demand on the higher end, too, with record sale in Paddock Club and our hospitality products. This sort of demand means our races slots are highly coveted and we were pleased to confirm the 2023 calendar a few weeks ago. We were happy to renew our agreement with Monaco and will race there through 2025, with expanded rights for Formula 1 related to broadcast, Paddock Club and sponsorship. We also announced a one-year renewal for Belgium and a three-year renewal for Mexico City. As Greg mentioned, the economic benefit F1 has brought to Mexico City since 2015 has been incredible. This highlights the value of our sport can bring to cities globally. Additionally, we will increase the number of sprint events in 2023 to 6 from the current 3. These events are in high demand from our promoters and provide additional sponsorship opportunities and value to our broadcast partners. We will announce the venues for those events soon. We were thrilled to announce that Audi will join Formula 1 in 2026. They have selected Sauber as their strategic partner and plan to acquire a stake in the Sauber Group, who will compete as a now de facto team from 2026. Formula 1 presents a global stage for the Audi brand, and they see the high performance and competition in our sport as a driver of innovation and technology. Audi was further attracted to F1 given our efforts in sustainability and cost efficiency, which will aid in achieving their own sustainability goals. It also shows the increasing value of the teams in the current environment, driven by the stability provided under the new regulation and the growth of the sport, of which everyone in F1 continues to benefit. We are delighted to grow our partnership with AWS. As we announced yesterday the expansion of our partnership with them becoming a Global Partner of Formula 1. We both share a passion for technological innovation, and we work together to build the fun experience of the future. Viewers continue to tune in as well as we have seen substantial interest related to our media rights. We announced a partnership with Sky that extends right in Germany and Italy until 2027 and the U.K. and Ireland until 2029. Sky Sports F1 will continue to be the only dedicated channel to broadcast motor sport in each of these markets and their highly rated commentary will be available in over 80 markets. Sky has seen significant growth in the viewership so far this season with average viewership in the UK up to 60% since 2019; Italy up to 20% since 2021; and Germany up to 24 since 2021. They've also seen attractive demographic shift with viewers becoming more diverse and younger. We also extended our U.S. agreement with ESPN through 2025. They have been a great partner to us. And with this new deal, at least 16 races per year will air on either ABC or ESPN with all broadcast commercial-free. Through 18 races in 2022, they've seen an average audience of 1.2 million up from 994,000 [ph] in 2021. The Miami Grand Prix drew an average viewership of 2.6 million, the largest U.S. audience on record for a live GP. Additionally, we extended our agreement with ServusTV in Austria until 2026 and secured a partnership with Telcel and Telmex in Mexico to bring F1TV Pro to a subscriber who can easily add the service on to their existing contracts for mobile or internet services. The F1 Esports Series Pro championship presented by Aramco returned for 4 events, each spanning over 3 years. This includes more live show as the teams and the drivers battle for their $750,000 prize spot. Similar to F1, we have seen several high-profile drivers move across the grid. We look forward to building on the incredible engagement for 2021 when we saw 4.5 million fans tune in for the grand finale. This year, we had 1.3 million players attempt to qualify, almost 3 times the amount we had in 2021. We continue to expand the way we engage with fans and introduce the F1 Arcade in London. This is the first F1 licensed experiential venue. Patrons can be fully immersed with 60 motion simulators and experience the thrill of racing while enjoying premium food and beverage offerings in the heart of London. We plan to roll out this concept in additional cities. And finally, to further our progress to net zero, Formula 2 and Formula 3 announced a partnership with Aramco to pioneer sustainable fuel for 2023. This is an important step to reach a 100% sustainable fuel by 2026, which will be a requirement of all FIA championships. F2 and F3 have proven to be a great test bed for innovation as they were with the 18-inch tires now used in Formula 1. We continue to show the innovation and leadership in the technology space and believe that our sustainable fuel can have a huge real world benefit for the automotive sector and greenhouse gas emission. I want to thank the whole F1 family, our fans and our investors for all the support this year. Tomorrow, we are hosting a launch party in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace. We are bringing the best race in the world to the entertainment capital of the world, including a large caravan on Las Vegas Boulevard. We look forward to completing an amazing 2022 season as we travel to Brazil and Abu Dhabi. Avanti tutta, full speed ahead. And now, I will turn the call back over to Greg. Bye, bye. Ciao. Okay. Thanks, Greg. Well, actually, you're totally right. The attendance increase is just magnificent in terms of what Formula 1, is bringing mainly to new audiences. And that is true that the business model we are having with certain promoter is more related to the fact that there is a fee that they have to pay, there is the high-end Paddock Club that is on our side. And there's -- not a challenge, but the big opportunity to move forward is how we can maximize the revenue and monetize the revenue that we can take from the fact that Formula 1 has become more and more attractive. That's really what we're going to do in the future. We have a different way to do it, and I'm sure that we're going to capitalize this growth in the best way that we can in the next couple of years. Thanks, David. I think that when we talk about media rights is a landscape where we have to consider the evolution, mainly in the new market that is becoming attractive for Formula 1. In the more, let's say, traditional mature market, I think that's what we have taken as a decision to invest and to be stable with Sky means a lot, because in terms of the other opportunities in this market are not really the ones that can extend from the financial and also for the awareness point of view and the country point of view what we want to achieve. It is clear that the fact that we are growing give us potential for the future to see how in that kind of the dimension, not only pay TV, but also other means that could be interesting for us to be attractive for our business. Of course, we want to make sure that -- for the future decision, there is also the possibility for our F1 TV that is going tremendously well to be incorporated in the offer to our customers. So that's really the strategy that we have taken so far. And this is, I would say, if you go back to Sky, the recognition of the value of that investment for the value of our F1 content in the world. I couldn't agree more, Greg. I think that we need to recognize that because sometimes we have a very short memory. A couple of years ago, there were not so many media rights holder in U.S. that wanted to invest with us. And now we need to give the credit to ESPN that in terms of content, in terms of attention, in terms of how they are really following Formula 1, they did a phenomenal job, which will be even stronger in the next three years because we have agreed the positioning of the race in certain channels to have more attention to that. So, I think that we talked carefully about this step. And I think that the fact also that with this agreement, we keep as mentioning the F1 TV on our side means a lot. So I think that the best solution in three years' time, we see how the market will develop. We are pretty sure due to the growth in U.S. that there would be other players that will be around the table and interested to be with us in the future. Thank you, Barton. I mean, let me figure out these things. First of all, being a world championship, we can spread around the world the risk of having this kind of situation to manage. On the other hand, the fact that we have long-term agreements will reduce the exposure to this risk. And what I can say and share with you is that we already see an incredible number of preregistration with regards to the ticketing of next year. So, this is a good sign in the context that you're seeing mainly Europe where I'm living, it is clear that this recession is taking place. But I think that the way that we are structured, the way that we have done the deal will protect us -- will enable us to move forward in this direction. Therefore, I would say this kind of situation lets us think that we should be optimistic in this context that is, of course, we monitor. But this is what we see today. Well, actually, we don't see any kind of risk at all. I mean, first of all, we have the last two races with sold down tickets and the number is really growing. The attention will be shift, of course, in other fight -- on the sporting -- from the sporting perspective. So that's part of racing. And I would like to add, if I may, another comment. We are totally positive on the impact that the change of regulation throughout this year. And we cannot comment on the fact that the team, but specifically in this case, Red Bull or Max Verstappen did an incredible job. Maybe -- team didn't take the right opportunities, but what we saw on the track is with real racing, that's what we wanted. And I'm totally confident that next year, the fight on the track will arrive up to the end of the calendar. And -- yes. And as you have seen in the last races, on the sporting side, there is a lot of attention. There is a fight for places that also, for the team perspective, is related to the financial position and the financial rewarding, if they achieve a position better than the other team. So I think there will be a lot of interest in Brazil and Abu Dhabi, too, with no problem. Thank you, David, for the question. As you can imagine, on the incremental value of AWS, we cannot go into the details. But it is a very strong relationship that it's starting from a very technical content point of view. We are working together with them on the preparation of the graphics. We are working together in order to give the right data to our customers and to our fans. So the fact that we have a new for -- so many years with an interesting increase in terms of financial contribution, it means that also AWS recognizes the power of our platform. With regard to the value or the process related to the possibility of F1 team to be into the championship, of course, there is the primary step that both us and FAA has to be an agreement for that. And I think that the first thing that we need to consider is this eventual possibility will bring an extra value to the championship. If so, of course, we're going to discuss it internally and we see if this has any kind of a real potential new entry can give the benefit for the value of the championship. On top of it, there is a value that has to be recognized to the teams that are already into the championship because, of course, they cannot allow any dilution of their financial partnership with the F1 championship. So, this is what is written in the concrete agreement. But mainly the point is does eventually a new entry will bring a better position in F1 championship? This is really into value and in terms of value from the financial point of view and in terms of value from the sporting point of view. And if I may on that, it's not a problem to having one more team to have a better racing. Therefore, we would see. We will monitor the situation. It will be a real incredible new entry team that we want to discuss with us, we are ready to discuss, but we are not in a best position today for that. Matthew, I think that the fact that we are bringing in new customers that are getting younger and younger will allow us to see on the licensing point of view an incremental opportunity to increase the revenue stream for us. And this will happen. We are pretty sure about it. We already saw this year an incredible effect on this. On the other hand, I would say what we need to stay always focused is that we are a physical sport on the track. So any kind of growth that is happening on the -- i.e. gaming that has to be translated to the passion that we want to see the people go into the track. And this is really the things that we are focusing because that's an opportunity to stabilize the growth of our sport for the future."

During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded August 5th. I would now like to turn the conference over to Courtnee Chun, Chief Portfolio Officer. Please go ahead.\nCourtnee Chun: Thank you. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in Liberty Media's most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q or Liberty Media Acquisitions most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call and Liberty Media and Liberty Media Acquisition expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media or Liberty Media Acquisitions expectations with regard there to or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Media and SiriusXM, including adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media and SiriusXM schedules one and two can be found at the end of the earnings press release issued today, which is available on Liberty Media's website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty\u2019s President and CEO. Greg.\nGregory B. Maffei: Sorry was on mute. Good morning. Today on the call besides myself we will also have Formula One\u2019s President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. So let's begin with Liberty\u2019s SiriusXM where we received a $70 million regular dividend from Sirius in the second quarter which was tax free. We also repurchased $93 million across the LSXMA and LSXMK shares from May to July and a look through price on Siri of $2.88 per share. We do understand the discount has widened and it is frustrating. And while the decline of LSXM is in line with the overall market, further widening of the discount has been very disappointing. We still believe repurchases are attractive means to capture that discount but it's becoming clear they are not enough to collapse on their own. We are focused on this.  While not a fulsome list, potential actions we might consider include reducing data LSXM to enable a combination and a not overly levered Siri LSXM, steps to better illuminate the value of our live stake, and other potential actions. I would remind you with Liberty Media and some of our various fun entities [ph] we have a long history of corporate action to capture discount and these include structuring the GCI acquisition in such a way it was a mid-lane ATB, the Direct TV RMT and subsequent sale to AT&T, and the subsequent -- the separation of Liberty Expedia and subsequent merger with Expedia.  In summary we have options and actions we have taken, we have a history of doing so. So let me turn to Siri itself which I believe is handling the market challenges well and maintaining their financial guidance despite a reduced sub guidance due to a weak SAR, which has been well documented for reasons like chip supply issues. They had robust financial results for the second quarter, including revenue up 4%, churn steady at 1.5%, and new and used car penetrations up to 84% and 51%, respectively. We also announced extensions with important automaker partners, including Mazda and Mitsubishi. We made continued progress on our connected TV platforms like Amazon Fire, Android TV, LG, and Roku. We signed a new agreement to fully integrate and launched SiriusXM audio experience on XFINITY with Comcast with video to come. And on demand music listening in the SiriusXM app is up 41% year-over-year, and that's partly driven by the addition of new, unique, and diverse content. Overall sports listening as up in the app. Our agreement to make Siri exclusive third party platform for NFL games is helpful. And keeping the family we also announced an extension with F1 to cover every race on the World Championship calendar.  Lastly, we're very excited about our continuing work in podcasting. Americans listen to audio of 9% last year podcast audio of 9% last year and our podcasting and off platform business revenues were up 50%. We also expanded our agreement with Comscore to release AI powered podcast audience targeting capabilities. So, we turn to Live Nation which announced very strong results. It is clear live events are back on a global scale with yet another quarter of record results. Versus 2019 AOI is up 50%, free cash flow was up 72%, and that rose to $379 million. At Ticketmaster itself AOI was up 86% and the transacted GTV was up 76% again over 2019. Sponsorship AOI was up 81% over 2019 and important new clients included Google, AWS, and Hulu. We had the highest quarterly attendance ever over 33 million fans and our onsite fan spend growth continues across all venues. We have an outlook for a record of 2022 with 100 million concert tickets already sold, fan attendance up 13% in operated venues and almost 30 new venues in the pipeline. And the 2023 August pipeline is the largest we've ever had at this point in the year. So exciting stuff.  Turning to Formula One Group, F1 continued to see record attendance and viewership in the second quarter. The Austrian Grand Prix was our second sprint event and viewership was up 39% versus the 2021 Austrian Qualifying. We also are benefiting from the return of coverage on CCTV boosting our audience in China. Suddenly, we've had record in person attendance, four races this year have had over 300,000 attendance with incredible demand for the Paddock Club. The Hungarian weekend attendance for example with 290,000 was the largest ticketed sporting event in history in Hungary. So we've seen strong ticket sales and sell out demand for the rest of the year and to the rest of the calendar as well. The new regulations that were part of the Concorde Agreement are succeeding and enabling closer racing and demonstrably more overtaking. We are continuing to pursue trail with brazen work around sustainable drop in fuel and regenerative engine development. And we think these will have implications across the entire transportation industry.  Turning to our most recent work in Las Vegas, we completed the land purchase at the foreign corporate level. We're excited about the potential for this property. We do expect to have year round activations on this site. The main Paddock building, which is estimated to be 900 feet long, was the length of three football fields will be exciting, and we're actively working with potential commercial partners to expand our opportunities there. We are building out the F1 team in Vegas across sales, marketing, race operations, and more. We are leveraging local expertise and talent as well, including the LVCVA and our partners at Live Nation. We're still working through the specifics on capacity but I'd note that our founding partners in Vegas; Caesars, Wynn, and MGM are seeing incredible demand and we haven't even announced the formal date. We will obviously share more details on Vegas over time. While some of you are excited, you don't have to wake up early for time. While some of you are excited, you don't have to wake up early for races over the summer break, we here at Liberty look forward to restarting Formula One at Spa on August 28th.  Turning to the Braves. They've been playing excellent baseball over the cap last past couple of months. As of today, we're just under 600 record for the season and since June 1st we have the best record in baseball despite a sad loss to the Mets last night. It's an exciting team and the world's Halo is still driving fans to Truist Park. Braves attendance is up 23% compared to an already strong 2019 season. We've had 24 sellouts to the All Star Break and trending to roughly 50% sellouts for the year. Tickets, parking, concessions, and concert, the Roxy are all performing well. We've had six All Stars named this year, most of the team since 2011 and double the amount from last year.  We just signed an extension with Austin Riley, a 10-year deal, a $212 million, the largest in franchise history after outstanding performance by Austin this season including a historic July. Alex Anthopoulos, once again deserves credit for the moves he took to strengthen the team before the trade deadline. We do remember how well this worked out last year, acquiring Grossman in left field and Odorizzi a pitcher, both insurance to our lineup, adding also bullpen capacity. We want to congratulate Snit on his 500th career win after defeating the Phillies last week. And again, we encourage you to tune in to the Mets tonight. We have nothing to report today on LMAC but we do continue to review opportunities and look at the environment, it was difficult for specs as an opportunity for us. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results.\nBrian J. Wendling: Thanks, Greg and good morning, everyone. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, liquid investments, and liquid public debt and equity securities of approximately $368 million, which excludes $126 million of cash held directly at SiriusXM. There's also $1.3 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM and Live Nation margin loans. As of August 4th, the value of our SiriusXM stock held at Liberty SiriusXM Group was $21.5 billion, and the value of the Live Nation stock was $6.8 billion. We have $2.8 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.7 billion, which includes $10 billion of debt at SiriusXM. Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments, and monetizable public holdings of $1.1 billion at quarter end, which excludes $935 million of cash held directly at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.2 billion, which includes the $2.9 billion of debt at Formula One, leaving $306 million at the corporate level.  During the quarter, we repurchased $146 million face value of 1% FWONK cash convertible notes due in 2023 for approximately $240 million, effectively retiring 3.95 million underlying FWONK shares at an average price of $59.88. F1\u2019s $500 million revolver is undrawn and Formula One leverage at the end of the quarter was 3 times. As we discussed last quarter, under the current Concorde Agreement team payments now take the form of an entirely variable price fund, which is calculated with reference to a measure of F1's adjusted EBIT rather than the adjusted EBITDA measure used in previous agreements. Such that the calculation now takes into account CAPEX incurred by including depreciation cost. There is an immaterial difference today between Formula One's adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA for purposes of this calculation. Note that our reported F1 depreciation and amortization includes purchase accounting amortization related to the acquisition that is excluded for purposes of the price on calculations. We've quantified this purchase accounting amortization in our earnings release to assist in calculations.  Also at Formula One, other F1 revenue was running materially higher than the prior year, up about $80 million in the second quarter and $130 million year-to-date compared to 2021. Increased freight and hospitality income accounts for 98% of the quarter-over-quarter increase. Note that the Paddock Club didn't run until July of last year, while year-to-date through the second quarter, F1 has welcomed over 35,000 guests at the 7 events where we've ran our Paddock Club. Other costs of F1 revenue is higher primarily due to the same factors. These costs were up $76 million in the second quarter, approximately 75% of which is due to freight and hospitality cost variances. Finally, at F1, at last year's Investor Day, we included an appendix slide detailing F1's foreign exchange exposure. These percentages are still accurate with approximately 80% of F1's revenue and cost denominated in U.S. dollars. Finally, the Braves Group at quarter end, they had attributed cash and liquid investments of $207 million, which excludes $66 million of restricted cash. Braves Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $602 million. The Atlanta Braves also announced several new construction projects for 2022, a new office building will be constructed known as 5 Ballpark Center that will house the national headquarters for Truist Securities under a 15-year lease. Construction is expected to begin in the second half of 2022. The Braves estimate their cash contribution will be approximately $20 million. The Braves were also working on a new project with Goldenrod Development Company called the Henry, a luxury apartment building. If completed, the Braves would have a minority equity stake in exchange for two acres of contributed land with no additional cash contribution from the Braves. Additionally, the Braves are evaluating a Phase 2 project with Goldenrod to build an adjacent hotel and condominium complex. This is still in the evaluation phase, but would be another minority investment with a modest cash investment. Our real estate projects have individually and collectively performed ahead of our expectations. The Battery is generating healthy cash flow, which is partially used to support the operations of and future investments in the Battery and partially to support Braves Baseball. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with the debt covenants at quarter end. With that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One.\nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Brian. For the last earning calls, we were in Miami for the inaugural Miami Grand Prix. It was an incredible weekend as Formula One was welcomed to the city with open arms. The celebrities came out in full force and much of the coverage and helped in the establishment of Formula One in the U.S. It was wonderful to see so many of you in person. We are now over halfway through the 2022 race season, and we have seen unpredictable outcomes and a lot of wheel to wheel racing, especially in the mid field. It is a testament to the new regulation that everything [indiscernible] this season. Carlos Sainz secured his first F1 career race win at Silverstone and Lewis Hamilton marked his 300th race start with a second place finish and first double podium of the season for Mercedes in France. Max Verstappen currently leads the Driver\u2019s Championship over Charles Leclerc of Ferrari has shown incredible speed and the battle between these two is intense. We have seen the fight between McLaren and Alpine, and it is great to see it has beginning to move forward, cornering [indiscernible] championship. And as we said, Mercedes continues to fight back with Lewis and George [indiscernible]. This action on the track has drawn in the fence will set out crowds at our events with 420,000 --; 400,000 at Silverstone; 300,000 in Austria, 300,000 in Hungary, and 338,000 for Canada. And Paddock Club has experienced record sales. We're coming over 35,000 people across nine events this year, including record-breaking attendance of Silverstone where we have 7,500 guests.  The TV audiences is also tuning in with the average audience program through France [ph], up to 9% versus 2001 season average. We continue to see tremendous growth on all platforms. We were thrilled to announce that the highly popular network series Drive to Survive has been renewed for the fifth and sixth season. The series is still attracting new fans and Season 4 broke into the weekly top 10 in 56 countries. Bidding on demands for our media rights, we reached a renewal agreement with Bandeirantes in Brazil throughout 2025, which will cover all qualifier session and Grand Prix\u2019s all live free to our bases. Additionally, we secured a strategic partnership with Claro Brasil to be the exclusive distributor of F1 TV Pro in the country.  F1 TV Pro has proven to be a compelling product for our fans, so it's worth a brief overview. F1 TV Pro office coverage of every F1 session live on demand as well as live access to all 20 onboard drivers cameras and teams radio channels, session replays and highlights, live streaming of every F2, F3, and F4 super cap session, and a library spending over 2,000 hours of archives and feature programming. The platform was revamped in 2021 and is now more accessible than ever before with the release of the service across many of these streaming platform, enhancing the viewing experience for Formula One fans around the world. On to the racing promotion side, we were pleased to reach a long-term agreement with Melbourne that will have us racing there through 2035. This new agreement will bring F2 and F3 to the track for the first time ever. We were also thrilled to announce Honda as the type of sponsor of the Japanese Grand Prix when we turn to Japan in October. We are focused on the calendar for 2023 and expect to have more details around early October. On the sponsorship front, we announced PATR\u00d3N Tequila as the first-ever official tequila partner of the F1 Paddock Club. We also focused on licenses opportunity and partnering with around Round Room Studios for the first official exhibition in Formula One history. Details, including venues and the sale days for tickets will be announced this fall.  We also extended our agreement with the Memento Group through the 2025 season. This already covered authentic certified and licensed F1 memorabilia and now includes the right to sell ex-F1 race and show cars. They recently completed the auction for the 1990 Leyton House CG901, which placed second in the French Grand Prix, sold for over 500,000 Pounds. We continue to push to hit our net zero carbon by 2030 target. F1 is developing a 100% sustainable fuel that will be used in Formula One cars from 2026 in line with the introduction of the next-generation hybrid engine. The fuel is purposely designed to drop in for both internal combustion engines and hybrids. It is already in development with support from our key stakeholders, the FIA, Aramco, and from the F1 global partners, fuel providers, and F1 piston manufacturer. While racing fuel represents only 0.7% of our emission, we believe sustainable fuels where we can have a greatest impact on the global transportation [ph] sector.  While we have already instituted significant changes to create the more sustainable sport, we are now focusing on the following areas; exploring carbon reduction measure for fast revenue to Formula One events, sharing the cover induction activities from across our sporting community, taking steps and continue to investigate our measures to deliver more efficient logistics and travel arrangements from air, sea, and land. Furthering our commitment to the environment, we have partnered with Banco Santander to amplify the Santander ex-Global challenge come down to zero, a competition that challenges entrepreneurs to create sustainable solution for the future.  We continue to promote diversity in each sport and hosted the F1 Esports Women\u2019s Wildcard Experience Day at the McLaren Technological Center. First launched in 2021, the Women Wildcard represents another route into F1 eSports for female participants. The initiative was born from the desire to create a space that encourage multi-males to take part and submit their time trials via the official F1 video games with the passes securing a spot in F1 Esports pro-exhibition for the chance to be selected by a team for the Pro-Championship later this year. We also announced earlier in the year our extended funding commitment to the Formula One Engineering Scholarship Program for unrepresented group until 2025, continuing its drive to increase diversity within the sport.  We hope everyone has enjoyed the first part of the season. While the teams and the drivers enjoy a much deserved break, we will continue to capitalize on the growing popularity of F1 and convert this into opportunities to drive the business forward. Avanti tutta, full speed ahead. And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Bye-bye. Ciao.\nGregory B. Maffei: Thank you, Brian and Stefano. Our Annual Investor Day will be Thursday, November 17th in New York. Please save the date. Additional details will be provided soon. We hope to see many of you there. We appreciate your continued support of and interest in Liberty Media. And with that, operator, I'd like to open the line for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll turn first to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning. Greg, a couple of things on the structural side I want to ask you about, you mentioned separating Live Nation. I think you mentioned in that context with Siri. Maybe just talk about sort of the pros and cons...\nGregory B. Maffei: Ben, just to be crisp, I said, highlight the value. I didn't say separate, but go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Okay, highlight the value. Okay, yes. I guess my question was sort of how do you highlight the value. And I'll let you answer that as you see fit. And then I wanted to -- we get the question quite a bit, I'm sure you do too about a hard spin of the Braves. I was curious if you could just comment on kind of the puts and takes and pros and cons to that thought process? And then I wanted to ask you and Stefano whoever wants to take it on Vegas, what do you guys do in second half of this year in terms of both staffing up and on the CAPEX side with the track and the Paddock Club, any way to help frame sort of the investment size here as we look into the back half of the year as you get ready for next year's race? Thanks. \nGregory B. Maffei: So we -- I'll try and answer the structural questions and then touch on Vegas and others as well. So on the structural side, look, we're not here to announce anything today. You'll know when we do. And the advantages of our structure have been with the trackers have allowed us to have flexibility to move assets around, have allowed us to have flexibility to align things in the most attractive way, to manage our taxes in the most efficient manner. There are reasons to want to keep things together until we have ATV flexibility around all of them. That's just more optionality. As far as how we might highlight value, there are ways from spinning to creating another tracker to other kinds of actions we can take. We haven\u2019t obviously decided any of those that we'd be announcing today. The history of Liberty is as we've tended to, over time, take this business to where we thought we could add value, keep them internally and then at some point spin them out. We thought that they would be more attractive as independent entities for the long term, not just in the short term. And we'll monitor all that for all of our entities. So obviously, I've given you as much of a non-answer as I can, Ben, but that's just with our history. But I think you should look at our history and say, we have taken corporate actions to spin things off, and I went through a few of them and the subsequent disposition of those companies.  On Vegas, it's a little hard to forecast the CAPEX because we are still putting together the program that we will undertake there. And I mentioned our goal is to have a facility which is not only magnificent for the race, but has the opportunity to be an ongoing activation, have ongoing activations and events at that facility even when the race is not underway. I think you should be thinking we can well manage this within the capital we have. It's not going to drain us in any way, and it's not going to forestall us from doing other actions, including potentially investments around the SPAC repurchases, debt management, and the like. I don't know if Brian or Renee or Stefano want to add anything on the Vegas question.\nRenee L. Wilm: No, totally good, Greg.\nStefano Domenicali: If I can, Greg, just to add on the fact that, of course, the CAPEX builds and the tight program is there, with just almost six months -- 16 months ago. But it's important that we are working very hard in driving the engagement and get the new city excited by Formula One. So we're going to come back to the detail with all the plans that we have in order to make sure that we want to bring F1 to life with a motion passion that is really important to increase the level of engagement that we expect from Vegas City.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks everybody.\nGregory B. Maffei: Thanks. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Kraft: Thank you, good morning. I guess Greg, I also had a structural question. I guess in eliminating or narrowing the NAV discount at LSXM, it sounds like you alluded to an RMT spin merge. I guess, another option that you have would be to distribute SiriusXM shares to Liberty shareholders. The former though would basically make the combined company though still a Liberty company with the Liberty Board and Management and the Liberty -- the ability for Liberty Management and Board to make strategic investments and acquisitions. The latter would sort of be an exit from that as a management team. So I guess, are both of those on the table or do you really want to kind of still control Sirius and be able to use it strategically? And then I also want to ask a question on Formula One costs. How should we think about the higher SG&A level this quarter in the context of future quarters, it seems as though there may have been some temporary impacts in there from legal and advisory fees, I guess, is that the right way to think about it or is that meaningful or is there kind of a reset in the SG&A run rate going forward and maybe that has to do with something with Vegas? Thanks.\nGregory B. Maffei: So on the first point, I think, Bryan there's a wide range all the way from distribution of shares, which would probably not -- would be -- unless you can figure out some way to get compensated for our controlled position, probably not optimal. There are things that are halfway in the middle, like as you may remember, with Lemidia where we did where we spun our DIRECTV shares, but we still had in the form of the B shares having influence to hard spins that are just fully away or even subsequent spin mergers like the GCI example or like effectively what we did in Expedia. So there's -- I don't think there's anything off the table based on either what we might do there or our history. I think there's a full range of opportunities, and we'll try and do the one that we think maximizes long-term value.  On the side of expenses, I'll let others comment as well, but we'll know we did have some increased expenses, increased investment to start up the round in Vegas, including some issues there. So as far as the longer term, I think we're not at an elevated level, but I'll let others add their views.\nBrian J. Wendling: Yes. This is Brian. I'd say we had some higher personnel and other costs to support the large increase in revenues and higher activities that we had in 2022 versus the prior year. There were some minor onetime professional fees that we wouldn't expect to repeat and, I would say, pretty minor Vegas expenses at this point in time.\nBryan Kraft: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: We'll turn next to Vijay Jayant with Evercore.\nVijay Jayant: Well thanks. On Formula One, obviously Greg, the equity is like because there's a contractual nature of the business. But obviously, there are numerous macro headwinds with inflation, higher rates. Obviously, you gave some color on the impact of FOREX. And with the escalators [ph], can you help us really think about what the variability of outcomes are given all those sort of pressures out there, given your contractual nature of the business, is sort of the budget and expectations pretty much in line with what you sort of expected at the beginning of the year kind of thing for what the performance could be at Formula One's operation?\nGregory B. Maffei: So I think a couple of things. I think you're right to note, Vijay, the highly contracted nature of the business and which manages downside. Obviously, there's FX downside and there's cost potential downside. But in general, we've seen demand that's been able to outstrip those. And while we made budget conservatively with contingencies is our nature, we've been able to outperform those contingencies even in light of the cost structures. So I remain -- I believe the demand that we have and the strength of the business on top of the contracted nature will allow us to power through most of that. But obviously, we can't foresee every inflationary impact. But in general, I think we've been able to work through those and the FX. I don't know if Brian, Stefano or anyone else wanted to add?\nBrian J. Wendling: Nothing to add there, Greg.\nVijay Jayant: And if I could follow up, obviously, on the -- maybe a little early on the race calendar for next year, but there's a bunch of European races that come sort of under contract. It looks like France, Belgium, Monaco, and obviously, you have a couple of new races next year Qatar coming back and Shanghai coming back. Can you just talk about what the sort of race outlook can be next year, obviously you are going to have more than 22 races and are we going to get more sort of higher dollar value races versus some that are not as lucrative?\nGregory B. Maffei: I'll let Brian or Stefano.\nBrian J. Wendling: If I may, Greg or Stefano, please?\nStefano Domenicali: Okay. Thank you, Wendling [ph]. As I've stated before, we will come back to the early October due to the process of course, having the clearance from the world multiple council of our calendar. Of course, there are discussions to make sure that the calendar is robust, it is following also the fact that we would like to keep the right flow in terms of efficiency around the world, considering the needs of a calendar to be spread out from March to November, all around the world. Of course, the effect that you were seeing before on the choice between the Europe and then out of European races has an effect on the revenue side. But I would say the main point is to have an excited calendar, the demand is very, very high, and it's our responsibility to put in place a calendar that is available to our stakeholders but also valuable to respond to the request that we are all around the world. So we cannot spot anything more than what we are saying because we are, of course, finalizing all the details but we, for sure, expect to have, I would say, capital raises more than this year, but less than 25%. That's for sure.\nVijay Jayant: Thanks so much guys.\nOperator: Next up is David Karnovsky with J.P. Morgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi, thank you. First off, we've seen in the press the possibility of some auto OEMs entering F1 either on the manufacturer or engine side. And a question we sometimes get is what's the potential benefit to Formula One, either from a commercial standpoint or to the product itself, so I wanted to put that question to you? And then separately, with other F1 revenue, I know there's a lot of noise in there because of the freight cost. But wondering if you could speak to the performance outside of the pass through revenues, in particular areas like Paddock Club or licensing, and maybe how that looks relative to the pre-pandemic period? Thanks. \nStefano Domenicali: Okay. Thank you. I mean with regards to the two new OEM coming in, as you can imagine, it's not for us to say anything that will be, let's say, we shouldn't say. It's true that we are adding contract without the manufacturer. And hopefully, we have the information soon. I think that in terms of what is the benefit, the beneficial credibility, the benefit is showing that our strategy of the future will help the manufacturer to have another route that will allow them not to be only fully electric in the offer to the mobility side, but also using the expertise that only follow on through the technology. That we have -- can help them in order to find new way of being present in the market with average engine with sustainable fuel that will be able to be much more effective in our opinion, all around the world if we want to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality. And on the other hand, from the sporting point of view, the more manufacturer we have, the more structure in terms of having manufactured with other teams will enable the sporting side to have, I would say, more things that could be seen even in the more independent into the sport. So I think that will be terrific news. Let's see how the situation will evolve. But no matter it will be the decision that the OEMs will provide to the market, hopefully very soon. We strongly believe that our technological platform for the future, if that is the right one in terms of redundancy. And this is something that time will prove that.\nGregory B. Maffei: And if I can just add I think -- if I could just add on. As Stefano just said, obviously, and Stefano touched on this, it's a great validation to have these OEMs want to enter or reportedly want to enter. If they were, they're both the ones discussed or both enormous engines of innovation and enormous engines of promotion and all of those have only seem to be good for our sport.  [Multiple Speakers] \nStefano Domenicali: No, no, I was just trying to briefly touch base on the second question. We see and this is what we have already seen for this year, incredible numbers with regard to Paddock Club, with regard to new license that will be seen as an effect on our balance sheet. And we see already an incredible number of orders despite the calendar has not been announced already in terms of reservation for the races that would be in any case definitely in the calendar next year. So great, great attention that means the attention on our platform is very huge today.\nBrian J. Wendling: Yes. And just to add to that, David. In the other F1 category, 98% of what we're seeing on the increase is all coming from Paddock Club and freight, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, where we didn't have races last year, and we weren't traveling as much. So big increases there. But within primary revenue, we're seeing increases across the board, as Stefano just mentioned. So licensing to your point and F1 TV as well as the main three categories, promotion, sponsorship media rights.\nGregory B. Maffei: If you look at some of these things like Paddock Club, yes, just to add to Brian. I mean if you look at some of these things like Paddock Club, we've never seen more demand. And we've not only seen demand, we've been able to, in some cases, promoters are able to increase the size of the Paddock Club areas and still manage it at a higher number and higher prices. So a lot of positives there.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you. \nOperator: Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities has our next question.\nBarton Crockett: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Greg, the discount at Liberty Sirius versus Sirius is so much larger than the discount you would see at Liberty Broadband and Charter. Why do you think that is, why is there such a disconnect, does that inform in any way what some of the solutions might be for that?\nGregory B. Maffei: Barton, it's a great question. I think you could argue a little more complexity, you could argue investor fatigue, you could argue the relative scale and size of the two entities compared to the broadband entity. Hard to attribute any certainty to any of those, but those are probably all factors that -- still that we're not going to act on it in some way, where is it broadband, maybe it's more crisp where the future is going. All of those are potential factors. I think as you said -- as we've said before, and I said earlier on this call, we're going to take advantage of that through the discount. And at some point, we're going to take an action, and we're looking at those actions to do -- to tighten that discount. But in the interim, we're going to buy that stock and take advantage of it and drive our NAV relative to the underlying NAV up. I don't know if anybody else on the team, Ben or somebody else wanted to add something, but I think it's hard to be determinative about which of these factors is driving the difference.\nBarton Crockett: Okay. And if I could ask one other kind of separate question. I'm just interested in your perspective on streaming at this point as pertains to kind of baseball. We have the direct-to-consumer launches at Nesson [ph] and at Diamond Sports. The Braves are not participating at this point. There's been some roll-up of rights at some of the big platform players like Apple. And do you think that this is the time to move in and restructure the streaming rights for baseball or do you think it's not right yet, you don't know what to do yet?\nGregory B. Maffei: Well, I think baseball has a more complicated situation because of the regional sports network situation than other sports, in particular, the cleanest comparisons or the completeness is football. And certainly, my understanding is that MLB would love to find a structure where they could deliver more national rights, which is really not available or difficult today on some kinds of games. The streaming interest has been high from people like Apple, which is a good sign. And obviously, the RSN weakness is going to create an opportunity, whether that happens this year or next I do think there will be some change in that given where Diamond appears to be headed. Looking just at the Braves, we're blessed, as we've said before, with a lot of demand and good audience in our territory. We're also blessed with the largest broadband household territory among baseball teams. So we remain optimistic about our relative position on any kind of streaming deal, and we feel good that we have a product which people want in a big territory and probably what some people estimate may be the most profitable RSN, where we're getting paid pretty well, but the RSN owner is also making money. So that seems to create some opportunity where there will be somebody who wants to something interesting in our space. But stay tuned. \nBarton Crockett: Yeah, thank you. \nOperator: We'll now move to David Joyce with Barclays.\nDavid Joyce: Thank you. I guess some more clarifications on the structural opportunities. Greg, I think you mentioned in response to Brent's question, something about the reasons to keep things together until you have full ATV flexibility. Maybe I misheard or misunderstood, but you thought that everything was -- I was just wondering if what restrictions there are still?\nGregory B. Maffei: No, I think we are -- if I could just interrupt, David. I said that's one of the factors we'd love to have as much flexibility on ATVs as possible as many. So that's a factor. That's not the only reason, I think I mentioned to keep the Corpus together or to keep things as I mentioned, some of the other reasons around ability to move assets, tax advantage, tax flexibility, etcetera. Sorry, go ahead. I just wanted to set before you set the question, I wanted to make clear that's not\u2026\nDavid Joyce: No, that's fine. No, that's fine. That clarification was part of my question. And then the other aspect is, are there any other further guiding factors on the separation of the equities such as do you need to prioritize getting something done with Almac to spec or is that completely a separate path?\nGregory B. Maffei: Yes, I don't -- I can't -- I don't know only on the top of my head, but I'll just note the one you called out. I don't think anything we're going to do around Almac is likely to be impacted by structural changes because it's generally getting funded by the excess cash and any incremental will be funded by the further excess cash. So I don't think that's the driver.\nDavid Joyce: Okay, appreciate it. Thank you. \nOperator: Next up is Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet: Hi, I just had a high-level question. You guys over the years have done such a good job improving the financials of the Braves and Formula One, I was just being curious, as you sort of look at the landscape, would you describe both of those as sort of one-off rare exceptions, unique opportunities, or do you think you're sort of building a competency that might be applicable to other potential assets experiences?\nBrian J. Wendling: Yes, I don't know. I don't know if we have a -- I'd like to think that credit to the teams at both the Braves and Formula One for what they've done with those assets. I think they've taken attractive businesses and only made them better. And I credit that. So if we deserve any credits for finding the right management teams and backing them and doing the great work that they've done, I'm not sure we can take much beyond that.\nJason Bazinet: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Now we'll move to Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark.\nMatthew Harrigan: Oh, thank you. Firstly, getting more specific on the Synfuels Ventures. There's a report in the European media that Porsche has something down in Chile that they're testing that's basically carbon capture synthetic methanol. And the story also alluded to Saudi Aramco building plants in Saudi Arabia and Spain. I guess you probably wouldn't be that specific, but have you nailed down a path on the technology, are you looking at a lot of different things, and what sort of capital commitment just vaguely would go into having that sort of plant because this sounds a little more real as well as aspirational at this point? And then secondly, on the venture that Ticketmaster did with Snapchat and now with TikTok, is that something that you really see pushing the event demand as well as people for pencil just to get out outside the house right now and now I had one super quick follow-up, if you don't mind?\nGregory B. Maffei: Stefano, do you want to take the synthetic fuel question?\nStefano Domenicali: Yes, yes. Thank you, Greg. Thank you, Matthew. I think that all these technologies capital capture and other things that are related to the path of technology is related to the transition in this sector that we live. And the beauty of what I believe we are doing with tremendous effectiveness is the fact that we are just pushing the system towards the future in the right way. So all the commitment that we have taken on our side to go to zero carbon fuel in such a short term is because we do believe that's the right way to go. And the good news is that on the other side, the investment on our side is not relevant because we don't own any CAPEX in that respect. So we are just the enabler to all the stakeholders of our business to push for the future. And this is something we do believe is our way to go. And we don't have to forget one other important element of the equation that we are not talking about the only about the manufacturers that are part of our teams. But with our system, we have promoters. We have a lot of people that have to invest a lot because when we are talking about big events, we are talking places where the needs of energy for hosting a Grand Prix where there are more than 400,000 people needs to have a path of evolution of this technology. And this is also where we are pushing the system to improve it to in this direction. So I think we should be very, very proud of this idea of pushing forward this technology to our leadership on that respect.\nBrian J. Wendling: Matthew, on the second point, I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to. Maybe you could help -- repeat the question, sorry.\nMatthew Harrigan: [Multiple Speakers] to comment on the operating companies. But they did arrangement with Snapchat a number of months ago to push basically Ticketmaster pushing tickets on Snapchat. And just a couple of days ago, they announced something really similar with TikTok, is that something that you really see as being a nice impetus for demand on the ticketing side or do you think it's just before surveys, you have they COVID and they just want to get outside the house?\nGregory B. Maffei: Well, I think it's part of Live Nation strategy to be ubiquitous as possible in making buying tickets as simple as possible. And the technologies that they built to distribute their ticket buying capabilities are a unique advantage, I think, compared to most in the industry. And they want to be where buyers are. And if buyers are on TikTok, which they increasingly are and looking for music and contemplates which would they originate. It's a logical place for them to be. And the same thing, I think, about SNAP, which has obviously had music aspirations as well. So I think it's an important element of continuing to grow the strategy, but I'm not sure it's uniquely different than anything else we've done. It's just a continuation.\nMatthew Harrigan: And then lastly, if you don't mind, do you have a secular view on sports teams valuations going up even higher that makes you want to wait further with the grades in terms of doing something?\nGregory B. Maffei: I think it's facts and circumstances will dictate. Obviously, these have been trophy assets that people have wanted to buy the best of. We've certainly looked at purchasing in a lot of cases, other sports assets and have been surprised at some of the prices. Nonetheless, they continue to move upwards. And I think for the right kind of trophy assets, the valuations are going to continue to rise. \nMatthew Harrigan: Thanks, Greg. \nGregory B. Maffei: Thank you. \nOperator: And with that, we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to the speakers for the closing remarks.\nGregory B. Maffei: No, I just want to say thank you to all our listening audience for your questions and your attention. And you -- appreciate your interest in Liberty Media. Hope to see you next quarter, if not sooner. And again, at our November meeting for many of you. Have a great rest of your summer. Thank you.\nA - Brian J. Wendling: Thank you. Bye-bye.\nOperator: With that, we'll conclude today's conference. Thank you, everyone for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian J. Wendling",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg and good morning, everyone. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, liquid investments, and liquid public debt and equity securities of approximately $368 million, which excludes $126 million of cash held directly at SiriusXM. There's also $1.3 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM and Live Nation margin loans. As of August 4th, the value of our SiriusXM stock held at Liberty SiriusXM Group was $21.5 billion, and the value of the Live Nation stock was $6.8 billion. We have $2.8 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.7 billion, which includes $10 billion of debt at SiriusXM. Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments, and monetizable public holdings of $1.1 billion at quarter end, which excludes $935 million of cash held directly at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.2 billion, which includes the $2.9 billion of debt at Formula One, leaving $306 million at the corporate level.  During the quarter, we repurchased $146 million face value of 1% FWONK cash convertible notes due in 2023 for approximately $240 million, effectively retiring 3.95 million underlying FWONK shares at an average price of $59.88. F1's $500 million revolver is undrawn and Formula One leverage at the end of the quarter was 3 times. As we discussed last quarter, under the current Concorde Agreement team payments now take the form of an entirely variable price fund, which is calculated with reference to a measure of F1's adjusted EBIT rather than the adjusted EBITDA measure used in previous agreements. Such that the calculation now takes into account CAPEX incurred by including depreciation cost. There is an immaterial difference today between Formula One's adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA for purposes of this calculation. Note that our reported F1 depreciation and amortization includes purchase accounting amortization related to the acquisition that is excluded for purposes of the price on calculations. We've quantified this purchase accounting amortization in our earnings release to assist in calculations.  Also at Formula One, other F1 revenue was running materially higher than the prior year, up about $80 million in the second quarter and $130 million year-to-date compared to 2021. Increased freight and hospitality income accounts for 98% of the quarter-over-quarter increase. Note that the Paddock Club didn't run until July of last year, while year-to-date through the second quarter, F1 has welcomed over 35,000 guests at the 7 events where we've ran our Paddock Club. Other costs of F1 revenue is higher primarily due to the same factors. These costs were up $76 million in the second quarter, approximately 75% of which is due to freight and hospitality cost variances. Finally, at F1, at last year's Investor Day, we included an appendix slide detailing F1's foreign exchange exposure. These percentages are still accurate with approximately 80% of F1's revenue and cost denominated in U.S. dollars. Finally, the Braves Group at quarter end, they had attributed cash and liquid investments of $207 million, which excludes $66 million of restricted cash. Braves Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $602 million. The Atlanta Braves also announced several new construction projects for 2022, a new office building will be constructed known as 5 Ballpark Center that will house the national headquarters for Truist Securities under a 15-year lease. Construction is expected to begin in the second half of 2022. The Braves estimate their cash contribution will be approximately $20 million. The Braves were also working on a new project with Goldenrod Development Company called the Henry, a luxury apartment building. If completed, the Braves would have a minority equity stake in exchange for two acres of contributed land with no additional cash contribution from the Braves. Additionally, the Braves are evaluating a Phase 2 project with Goldenrod to build an adjacent hotel and condominium complex. This is still in the evaluation phase, but would be another minority investment with a modest cash investment. Our real estate projects have individually and collectively performed ahead of our expectations. The Battery is generating healthy cash flow, which is partially used to support the operations of and future investments in the Battery and partially to support Braves Baseball. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with the debt covenants at quarter end. With that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One. Yes. This is Brian. I'd say we had some higher personnel and other costs to support the large increase in revenues and higher activities that we had in 2022 versus the prior year. There were some minor onetime professional fees that we wouldn't expect to repeat and, I would say, pretty minor Vegas expenses at this point in time. Nothing to add there, Greg. If I may, Greg or Stefano, please? Yes. And just to add to that, David. In the other F1 category, 98% of what we're seeing on the increase is all coming from Paddock Club and freight, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, where we didn't have races last year, and we weren't traveling as much. So big increases there. But within primary revenue, we're seeing increases across the board, as Stefano just mentioned. So licensing to your point and F1 TV as well as the main three categories, promotion, sponsorship media rights. Yes, I don't know. I don't know if we have a -- I'd like to think that credit to the teams at both the Braves and Formula One for what they've done with those assets. I think they've taken attractive businesses and only made them better. And I credit that. So if we deserve any credits for finding the right management teams and backing them and doing the great work that they've done, I'm not sure we can take much beyond that. Matthew, on the second point, I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to. Maybe you could help -- repeat the question, sorry."

            "name": "Gregory B. Maffei",
            "content": "Sorry was on mute. Good morning. Today on the call besides myself we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. So let's begin with Liberty's SiriusXM where we received a $70 million regular dividend from Sirius in the second quarter which was tax free. We also repurchased $93 million across the LSXMA and LSXMK shares from May to July and a look through price on Siri of $2.88 per share. We do understand the discount has widened and it is frustrating. And while the decline of LSXM is in line with the overall market, further widening of the discount has been very disappointing. We still believe repurchases are attractive means to capture that discount but it's becoming clear they are not enough to collapse on their own. We are focused on this.  While not a fulsome list, potential actions we might consider include reducing data LSXM to enable a combination and a not overly levered Siri LSXM, steps to better illuminate the value of our live stake, and other potential actions. I would remind you with Liberty Media and some of our various fun entities [ph] we have a long history of corporate action to capture discount and these include structuring the GCI acquisition in such a way it was a mid-lane ATB, the Direct TV RMT and subsequent sale to AT&T, and the subsequent -- the separation of Liberty Expedia and subsequent merger with Expedia.  In summary we have options and actions we have taken, we have a history of doing so. So let me turn to Siri itself which I believe is handling the market challenges well and maintaining their financial guidance despite a reduced sub guidance due to a weak SAR, which has been well documented for reasons like chip supply issues. They had robust financial results for the second quarter, including revenue up 4%, churn steady at 1.5%, and new and used car penetrations up to 84% and 51%, respectively. We also announced extensions with important automaker partners, including Mazda and Mitsubishi. We made continued progress on our connected TV platforms like Amazon Fire, Android TV, LG, and Roku. We signed a new agreement to fully integrate and launched SiriusXM audio experience on XFINITY with Comcast with video to come. And on demand music listening in the SiriusXM app is up 41% year-over-year, and that's partly driven by the addition of new, unique, and diverse content. Overall sports listening as up in the app. Our agreement to make Siri exclusive third party platform for NFL games is helpful. And keeping the family we also announced an extension with F1 to cover every race on the World Championship calendar.  Lastly, we're very excited about our continuing work in podcasting. Americans listen to audio of 9% last year podcast audio of 9% last year and our podcasting and off platform business revenues were up 50%. We also expanded our agreement with Comscore to release AI powered podcast audience targeting capabilities. So, we turn to Live Nation which announced very strong results. It is clear live events are back on a global scale with yet another quarter of record results. Versus 2019 AOI is up 50%, free cash flow was up 72%, and that rose to $379 million. At Ticketmaster itself AOI was up 86% and the transacted GTV was up 76% again over 2019. Sponsorship AOI was up 81% over 2019 and important new clients included Google, AWS, and Hulu. We had the highest quarterly attendance ever over 33 million fans and our onsite fan spend growth continues across all venues. We have an outlook for a record of 2022 with 100 million concert tickets already sold, fan attendance up 13% in operated venues and almost 30 new venues in the pipeline. And the 2023 August pipeline is the largest we've ever had at this point in the year. So exciting stuff.  Turning to Formula One Group, F1 continued to see record attendance and viewership in the second quarter. The Austrian Grand Prix was our second sprint event and viewership was up 39% versus the 2021 Austrian Qualifying. We also are benefiting from the return of coverage on CCTV boosting our audience in China. Suddenly, we've had record in person attendance, four races this year have had over 300,000 attendance with incredible demand for the Paddock Club. The Hungarian weekend attendance for example with 290,000 was the largest ticketed sporting event in history in Hungary. So we've seen strong ticket sales and sell out demand for the rest of the year and to the rest of the calendar as well. The new regulations that were part of the Concorde Agreement are succeeding and enabling closer racing and demonstrably more overtaking. We are continuing to pursue trail with brazen work around sustainable drop in fuel and regenerative engine development. And we think these will have implications across the entire transportation industry.  Turning to our most recent work in Las Vegas, we completed the land purchase at the foreign corporate level. We're excited about the potential for this property. We do expect to have year round activations on this site. The main Paddock building, which is estimated to be 900 feet long, was the length of three football fields will be exciting, and we're actively working with potential commercial partners to expand our opportunities there. We are building out the F1 team in Vegas across sales, marketing, race operations, and more. We are leveraging local expertise and talent as well, including the LVCVA and our partners at Live Nation. We're still working through the specifics on capacity but I'd note that our founding partners in Vegas; Caesars, Wynn, and MGM are seeing incredible demand and we haven't even announced the formal date. We will obviously share more details on Vegas over time. While some of you are excited, you don't have to wake up early for time. While some of you are excited, you don't have to wake up early for races over the summer break, we here at Liberty look forward to restarting Formula One at Spa on August 28th.  Turning to the Braves. They've been playing excellent baseball over the cap last past couple of months. As of today, we're just under 600 record for the season and since June 1st we have the best record in baseball despite a sad loss to the Mets last night. It's an exciting team and the world's Halo is still driving fans to Truist Park. Braves attendance is up 23% compared to an already strong 2019 season. We've had 24 sellouts to the All Star Break and trending to roughly 50% sellouts for the year. Tickets, parking, concessions, and concert, the Roxy are all performing well. We've had six All Stars named this year, most of the team since 2011 and double the amount from last year.  We just signed an extension with Austin Riley, a 10-year deal, a $212 million, the largest in franchise history after outstanding performance by Austin this season including a historic July. Alex Anthopoulos, once again deserves credit for the moves he took to strengthen the team before the trade deadline. We do remember how well this worked out last year, acquiring Grossman in left field and Odorizzi a pitcher, both insurance to our lineup, adding also bullpen capacity. We want to congratulate Snit on his 500th career win after defeating the Phillies last week. And again, we encourage you to tune in to the Mets tonight. We have nothing to report today on LMAC but we do continue to review opportunities and look at the environment, it was difficult for specs as an opportunity for us. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results. Thank you, Brian and Stefano. Our Annual Investor Day will be Thursday, November 17th in New York. Please save the date. Additional details will be provided soon. We hope to see many of you there. We appreciate your continued support of and interest in Liberty Media. And with that, operator, I'd like to open the line for questions. Ben, just to be crisp, I said, highlight the value. I didn't say separate, but go ahead. So we -- I'll try and answer the structural questions and then touch on Vegas and others as well. So on the structural side, look, we're not here to announce anything today. You'll know when we do. And the advantages of our structure have been with the trackers have allowed us to have flexibility to move assets around, have allowed us to have flexibility to align things in the most attractive way, to manage our taxes in the most efficient manner. There are reasons to want to keep things together until we have ATV flexibility around all of them. That's just more optionality. As far as how we might highlight value, there are ways from spinning to creating another tracker to other kinds of actions we can take. We haven't obviously decided any of those that we'd be announcing today. The history of Liberty is as we've tended to, over time, take this business to where we thought we could add value, keep them internally and then at some point spin them out. We thought that they would be more attractive as independent entities for the long term, not just in the short term. And we'll monitor all that for all of our entities. So obviously, I've given you as much of a non-answer as I can, Ben, but that's just with our history. But I think you should look at our history and say, we have taken corporate actions to spin things off, and I went through a few of them and the subsequent disposition of those companies.  On Vegas, it's a little hard to forecast the CAPEX because we are still putting together the program that we will undertake there. And I mentioned our goal is to have a facility which is not only magnificent for the race, but has the opportunity to be an ongoing activation, have ongoing activations and events at that facility even when the race is not underway. I think you should be thinking we can well manage this within the capital we have. It's not going to drain us in any way, and it's not going to forestall us from doing other actions, including potentially investments around the SPAC repurchases, debt management, and the like. I don't know if Brian or Renee or Stefano want to add anything on the Vegas question. Thanks. So on the first point, I think, Bryan there's a wide range all the way from distribution of shares, which would probably not -- would be -- unless you can figure out some way to get compensated for our controlled position, probably not optimal. There are things that are halfway in the middle, like as you may remember, with Lemidia where we did where we spun our DIRECTV shares, but we still had in the form of the B shares having influence to hard spins that are just fully away or even subsequent spin mergers like the GCI example or like effectively what we did in Expedia. So there's -- I don't think there's anything off the table based on either what we might do there or our history. I think there's a full range of opportunities, and we'll try and do the one that we think maximizes long-term value.  On the side of expenses, I'll let others comment as well, but we'll know we did have some increased expenses, increased investment to start up the round in Vegas, including some issues there. So as far as the longer term, I think we're not at an elevated level, but I'll let others add their views. So I think a couple of things. I think you're right to note, Vijay, the highly contracted nature of the business and which manages downside. Obviously, there's FX downside and there's cost potential downside. But in general, we've seen demand that's been able to outstrip those. And while we made budget conservatively with contingencies is our nature, we've been able to outperform those contingencies even in light of the cost structures. So I remain -- I believe the demand that we have and the strength of the business on top of the contracted nature will allow us to power through most of that. But obviously, we can't foresee every inflationary impact. But in general, I think we've been able to work through those and the FX. I don't know if Brian, Stefano or anyone else wanted to add? I'll let Brian or Stefano. And if I can just add I think -- if I could just add on. As Stefano just said, obviously, and Stefano touched on this, it's a great validation to have these OEMs want to enter or reportedly want to enter. If they were, they're both the ones discussed or both enormous engines of innovation and enormous engines of promotion and all of those have only seem to be good for our sport.  [Multiple Speakers] If you look at some of these things like Paddock Club, yes, just to add to Brian. I mean if you look at some of these things like Paddock Club, we've never seen more demand. And we've not only seen demand, we've been able to, in some cases, promoters are able to increase the size of the Paddock Club areas and still manage it at a higher number and higher prices. So a lot of positives there. Barton, it's a great question. I think you could argue a little more complexity, you could argue investor fatigue, you could argue the relative scale and size of the two entities compared to the broadband entity. Hard to attribute any certainty to any of those, but those are probably all factors that -- still that we're not going to act on it in some way, where is it broadband, maybe it's more crisp where the future is going. All of those are potential factors. I think as you said -- as we've said before, and I said earlier on this call, we're going to take advantage of that through the discount. And at some point, we're going to take an action, and we're looking at those actions to do -- to tighten that discount. But in the interim, we're going to buy that stock and take advantage of it and drive our NAV relative to the underlying NAV up. I don't know if anybody else on the team, Ben or somebody else wanted to add something, but I think it's hard to be determinative about which of these factors is driving the difference. Well, I think baseball has a more complicated situation because of the regional sports network situation than other sports, in particular, the cleanest comparisons or the completeness is football. And certainly, my understanding is that MLB would love to find a structure where they could deliver more national rights, which is really not available or difficult today on some kinds of games. The streaming interest has been high from people like Apple, which is a good sign. And obviously, the RSN weakness is going to create an opportunity, whether that happens this year or next I do think there will be some change in that given where Diamond appears to be headed. Looking just at the Braves, we're blessed, as we've said before, with a lot of demand and good audience in our territory. We're also blessed with the largest broadband household territory among baseball teams. So we remain optimistic about our relative position on any kind of streaming deal, and we feel good that we have a product which people want in a big territory and probably what some people estimate may be the most profitable RSN, where we're getting paid pretty well, but the RSN owner is also making money. So that seems to create some opportunity where there will be somebody who wants to something interesting in our space. But stay tuned. No, I think we are -- if I could just interrupt, David. I said that's one of the factors we'd love to have as much flexibility on ATVs as possible as many. So that's a factor. That's not the only reason, I think I mentioned to keep the Corpus together or to keep things as I mentioned, some of the other reasons around ability to move assets, tax advantage, tax flexibility, etcetera. Sorry, go ahead. I just wanted to set before you set the question, I wanted to make clear that's not... Yes, I don't -- I can't -- I don't know only on the top of my head, but I'll just note the one you called out. I don't think anything we're going to do around Almac is likely to be impacted by structural changes because it's generally getting funded by the excess cash and any incremental will be funded by the further excess cash. So I don't think that's the driver. Stefano, do you want to take the synthetic fuel question? Well, I think it's part of Live Nation strategy to be ubiquitous as possible in making buying tickets as simple as possible. And the technologies that they built to distribute their ticket buying capabilities are a unique advantage, I think, compared to most in the industry. And they want to be where buyers are. And if buyers are on TikTok, which they increasingly are and looking for music and contemplates which would they originate. It's a logical place for them to be. And the same thing, I think, about SNAP, which has obviously had music aspirations as well. So I think it's an important element of continuing to grow the strategy, but I'm not sure it's uniquely different than anything else we've done. It's just a continuation. I think it's facts and circumstances will dictate. Obviously, these have been trophy assets that people have wanted to buy the best of. We've certainly looked at purchasing in a lot of cases, other sports assets and have been surprised at some of the prices. Nonetheless, they continue to move upwards. And I think for the right kind of trophy assets, the valuations are going to continue to rise. Thank you. No, I just want to say thank you to all our listening audience for your questions and your attention. And you -- appreciate your interest in Liberty Media. Hope to see you next quarter, if not sooner. And again, at our November meeting for many of you. Have a great rest of your summer. Thank you."

            "name": "Stefano Domenicali",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. For the last earning calls, we were in Miami for the inaugural Miami Grand Prix. It was an incredible weekend as Formula One was welcomed to the city with open arms. The celebrities came out in full force and much of the coverage and helped in the establishment of Formula One in the U.S. It was wonderful to see so many of you in person. We are now over halfway through the 2022 race season, and we have seen unpredictable outcomes and a lot of wheel to wheel racing, especially in the mid field. It is a testament to the new regulation that everything [indiscernible] this season. Carlos Sainz secured his first F1 career race win at Silverstone and Lewis Hamilton marked his 300th race start with a second place finish and first double podium of the season for Mercedes in France. Max Verstappen currently leads the Driver's Championship over Charles Leclerc of Ferrari has shown incredible speed and the battle between these two is intense. We have seen the fight between McLaren and Alpine, and it is great to see it has beginning to move forward, cornering [indiscernible] championship. And as we said, Mercedes continues to fight back with Lewis and George [indiscernible]. This action on the track has drawn in the fence will set out crowds at our events with 420,000 --; 400,000 at Silverstone; 300,000 in Austria, 300,000 in Hungary, and 338,000 for Canada. And Paddock Club has experienced record sales. We're coming over 35,000 people across nine events this year, including record-breaking attendance of Silverstone where we have 7,500 guests.  The TV audiences is also tuning in with the average audience program through France [ph], up to 9% versus 2001 season average. We continue to see tremendous growth on all platforms. We were thrilled to announce that the highly popular network series Drive to Survive has been renewed for the fifth and sixth season. The series is still attracting new fans and Season 4 broke into the weekly top 10 in 56 countries. Bidding on demands for our media rights, we reached a renewal agreement with Bandeirantes in Brazil throughout 2025, which will cover all qualifier session and Grand Prix's all live free to our bases. Additionally, we secured a strategic partnership with Claro Brasil to be the exclusive distributor of F1 TV Pro in the country.  F1 TV Pro has proven to be a compelling product for our fans, so it's worth a brief overview. F1 TV Pro office coverage of every F1 session live on demand as well as live access to all 20 onboard drivers cameras and teams radio channels, session replays and highlights, live streaming of every F2, F3, and F4 super cap session, and a library spending over 2,000 hours of archives and feature programming. The platform was revamped in 2021 and is now more accessible than ever before with the release of the service across many of these streaming platform, enhancing the viewing experience for Formula One fans around the world. On to the racing promotion side, we were pleased to reach a long-term agreement with Melbourne that will have us racing there through 2035. This new agreement will bring F2 and F3 to the track for the first time ever. We were also thrilled to announce Honda as the type of sponsor of the Japanese Grand Prix when we turn to Japan in October. We are focused on the calendar for 2023 and expect to have more details around early October. On the sponsorship front, we announced PATRO\u0301N Tequila as the first-ever official tequila partner of the F1 Paddock Club. We also focused on licenses opportunity and partnering with around Round Room Studios for the first official exhibition in Formula One history. Details, including venues and the sale days for tickets will be announced this fall.  We also extended our agreement with the Memento Group through the 2025 season. This already covered authentic certified and licensed F1 memorabilia and now includes the right to sell ex-F1 race and show cars. They recently completed the auction for the 1990 Leyton House CG901, which placed second in the French Grand Prix, sold for over 500,000 Pounds. We continue to push to hit our net zero carbon by 2030 target. F1 is developing a 100% sustainable fuel that will be used in Formula One cars from 2026 in line with the introduction of the next-generation hybrid engine. The fuel is purposely designed to drop in for both internal combustion engines and hybrids. It is already in development with support from our key stakeholders, the FIA, Aramco, and from the F1 global partners, fuel providers, and F1 piston manufacturer. While racing fuel represents only 0.7% of our emission, we believe sustainable fuels where we can have a greatest impact on the global transportation [ph] sector.  While we have already instituted significant changes to create the more sustainable sport, we are now focusing on the following areas; exploring carbon reduction measure for fast revenue to Formula One events, sharing the cover induction activities from across our sporting community, taking steps and continue to investigate our measures to deliver more efficient logistics and travel arrangements from air, sea, and land. Furthering our commitment to the environment, we have partnered with Banco Santander to amplify the Santander ex-Global challenge come down to zero, a competition that challenges entrepreneurs to create sustainable solution for the future.  We continue to promote diversity in each sport and hosted the F1 Esports Women's Wildcard Experience Day at the McLaren Technological Center. First launched in 2021, the Women Wildcard represents another route into F1 eSports for female participants. The initiative was born from the desire to create a space that encourage multi-males to take part and submit their time trials via the official F1 video games with the passes securing a spot in F1 Esports pro-exhibition for the chance to be selected by a team for the Pro-Championship later this year. We also announced earlier in the year our extended funding commitment to the Formula One Engineering Scholarship Program for unrepresented group until 2025, continuing its drive to increase diversity within the sport.  We hope everyone has enjoyed the first part of the season. While the teams and the drivers enjoy a much deserved break, we will continue to capitalize on the growing popularity of F1 and convert this into opportunities to drive the business forward. Avanti tutta, full speed ahead. And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Bye-bye. Ciao. If I can, Greg, just to add on the fact that, of course, the CAPEX builds and the tight program is there, with just almost six months -- 16 months ago. But it's important that we are working very hard in driving the engagement and get the new city excited by Formula One. So we're going to come back to the detail with all the plans that we have in order to make sure that we want to bring F1 to life with a motion passion that is really important to increase the level of engagement that we expect from Vegas City. Okay. Thank you, Wendling [ph]. As I've stated before, we will come back to the early October due to the process of course, having the clearance from the world multiple council of our calendar. Of course, there are discussions to make sure that the calendar is robust, it is following also the fact that we would like to keep the right flow in terms of efficiency around the world, considering the needs of a calendar to be spread out from March to November, all around the world. Of course, the effect that you were seeing before on the choice between the Europe and then out of European races has an effect on the revenue side. But I would say the main point is to have an excited calendar, the demand is very, very high, and it's our responsibility to put in place a calendar that is available to our stakeholders but also valuable to respond to the request that we are all around the world. So we cannot spot anything more than what we are saying because we are, of course, finalizing all the details but we, for sure, expect to have, I would say, capital raises more than this year, but less than 25%. That's for sure. Okay. Thank you. I mean with regards to the two new OEM coming in, as you can imagine, it's not for us to say anything that will be, let's say, we shouldn't say. It's true that we are adding contract without the manufacturer. And hopefully, we have the information soon. I think that in terms of what is the benefit, the beneficial credibility, the benefit is showing that our strategy of the future will help the manufacturer to have another route that will allow them not to be only fully electric in the offer to the mobility side, but also using the expertise that only follow on through the technology. That we have -- can help them in order to find new way of being present in the market with average engine with sustainable fuel that will be able to be much more effective in our opinion, all around the world if we want to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality. And on the other hand, from the sporting point of view, the more manufacturer we have, the more structure in terms of having manufactured with other teams will enable the sporting side to have, I would say, more things that could be seen even in the more independent into the sport. So I think that will be terrific news. Let's see how the situation will evolve. But no matter it will be the decision that the OEMs will provide to the market, hopefully very soon. We strongly believe that our technological platform for the future, if that is the right one in terms of redundancy. And this is something that time will prove that. No, no, I was just trying to briefly touch base on the second question. We see and this is what we have already seen for this year, incredible numbers with regard to Paddock Club, with regard to new license that will be seen as an effect on our balance sheet. And we see already an incredible number of orders despite the calendar has not been announced already in terms of reservation for the races that would be in any case definitely in the calendar next year. So great, great attention that means the attention on our platform is very huge today. Yes, yes. Thank you, Greg. Thank you, Matthew. I think that all these technologies capital capture and other things that are related to the path of technology is related to the transition in this sector that we live. And the beauty of what I believe we are doing with tremendous effectiveness is the fact that we are just pushing the system towards the future in the right way. So all the commitment that we have taken on our side to go to zero carbon fuel in such a short term is because we do believe that's the right way to go. And the good news is that on the other side, the investment on our side is not relevant because we don't own any CAPEX in that respect. So we are just the enabler to all the stakeholders of our business to push for the future. And this is something we do believe is our way to go. And we don't have to forget one other important element of the equation that we are not talking about the only about the manufacturers that are part of our teams. But with our system, we have promoters. We have a lot of people that have to invest a lot because when we are talking about big events, we are talking places where the needs of energy for hosting a Grand Prix where there are more than 400,000 people needs to have a path of evolution of this technology. And this is also where we are pushing the system to improve it to in this direction. So I think we should be very, very proud of this idea of pushing forward this technology to our leadership on that respect."

During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded May 6. I would now like to turn the conference over to Courtnee Chun, Chief Portfolio Officer. Please go ahead.\nCourtnee Chun: Thank you. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in Liberty Media's most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q or Liberty Media acquisitions most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call and Liberty Media and Liberty Media Acquisition expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media or Liberty Media Acquisitions expectations with regard with regard there to or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Media and SiriusXM, including adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA, the required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media and SiriusXM. Schedules one and two can be found at the end of the earnings press release issued today, which is available on Liberty Media's website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Liberty President and CEO, Greg Maffei.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Courtnee, and good morning to all of our listeners. Today. Speaking on the call we'll also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. So I'll begin with Liberty SiriusXM, we received $872 million of gross dividends from SIRI tax free in the first quarter including the special and regular dividend. We, because of the nature of our convertible bonds, we had to pass through a $30 million of that special dividend. We continued our share repurchases repurchasing $182 million across LSXMA/K from February to April. We repurchased those at a look through price on Siri of about 356 a share. We of course remain disappointed with the discount and attack it as much as we can. We are very focused on long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now looking at SiriusXM itself, solid start to the year, continue to perform well financially despite a challenging auto market. Revenue was up 6%, monthly churn was wonderful down at 1.6%. And we had record ARPU up 9%. New car penetration for SiriusXM is now at 83% and is enabled a fleet of 146 million cars here in the US. As expected self-pay net ads were down slightly due to challenges in the auto market. This was partially offset by strength in digital, and we had a 50% increase in the subs listening digitally to our on demand content. I'd also note we launched our first ever streaming channel [Freakanomics] dedicated to podcasting and available across all the SXM platforms. SXM media was named the number one podcast ad network according to Edison Research, and we represent four of the top 15 podcasts in the country with the addition of Crooked Media in this month. Also beginning with this year's masters, SiriusXM is the exclusive audio provider for the [Indiscernible] and providing excellent programming across all four rounds. Turning the Live Nation, by Live\u2019s first best quarter ever, including give another record quarter and ticket master and compare to 2019 AOI is up 2x, transacted GTV is up 39% and sponsorship AOI is up 75%. We expect a record 2022, we've already sold 70 million concert tickets and expect double digit fan growth versus 2019. Concert ticket pricing is up double digits over 2019 due to fan demand for the best seats. And over 90% of our plan sponsorship net revenue is already committed. Turning to Formula One Group, on the corporate side we repurchase 348,000 FWONA shares for $20 million or $56.14 a share and looking at F1 itself thrilling start to the 2022 season. So far we've had battles back and forth on who will be on the podium each weekend. The spread event in Imola brought exciting qualifying results and the format is working well with the new regulations and producing strong viewership numbers. The sprint audience is up 28% versus the qualifying last year at Imola. We also see record demand in the US early in the season on ESPN viewers for the Sunday race in both Saudi and Bahrain were up 56% and that was the most viewed race since ESPN required the Formula One race in 2018. The momentum in the United States continues with this weekend's inaugural Miami GP. And of course, you can't have not heard about the announcement of our Las Vegas GP for November 2023. As we've noted before, that'll be a night race down the strip. And notably in differently than most places, Formula One and Liberty Media are self-promoting the race in partnership with local stakeholders and Live Nation. The build out for this track will require increased CapEx and OpEx to develop and it\u2019s too early to provide you with numbers but we intend to update you later this year. I would note that Liberty Media did enter an agreement to acquire 39 acres east of the strip to lock in circuit design and create capacity for the pit and paddock. Among other hospitality and race support venues, I expect that transaction will close in the second quarter and the purchase price was $240 million, it will be funded by cash on hand at the Formula One Group level. We announced numerous commercial announcements including on the media right side extension with Foxtel group in Australia and Canal+ in France. Sponsorship is off to an exciting start this year with several new deals including two new global partners, MSC and Salesforce, and we look forward to more announcements as the year progresses. We also look forward to seeing some of you this weekend in Miami. Turning the Braves. We started the season with a weeklong World Series Champion\u2019s celebration, including delivering World Championships rings to the players. We've completed less than 27% of the season. It's a long way to go and last season showed how far things can change over this 162 games. We are hovering at around the same record as last year. And we all know how that turned out. At least we did manage a split with the maps over the last couple of days. We are excited about our roster. We signed [Indiscernible] a 27 year old Atlanta native, we strengthen the [bullpen with Janssens] addition, and we're thrilled to welcome Ronald Acuna Jr. Back in the lineup this week. While it's still in the season, financial performance has already been incredible. Going into the season, we had the highest season ticket sales in more than two decades. We sold out all of our multiyear premium seats for the first time ever, and open our renovated delta club. And retail and concession sales have been strong for the first few home stand including selling out most of our Gold program jerseys. As you undoubtedly know, a new CBA was signed in March. There'll be minimal impact from the late start since the last games were away games, and we still expect a full 162 game season. In January, we also completed the sale of three minor league teams. And in final exciting news. We, Braves debuted the Digital Truist Park in April for future Metaverse fan opportunity engagement. Turning briefly to LMAC, nothing to report today. Obviously, we\u2019ll announce when we have something but I would note the environment which is very difficult, as many of, I think does favor us. And we continue to look at some interesting opportunities. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian Wendling for more on our financial results.\nBrian Wendling: Thank you, Greg and good morning, everyone. In January, we settled exchanges of the 2.25% Live Nation exchangeable bonds for total consideration of $664 million, funded with cash and margin loan draws. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group has attributed cash and liquid investments of approximately $634 million, which excludes $76 million of cash held at SiriusXM. There's also $1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM and Live Nation margin loans. As of May 5th, the value of the SiriusXM stock held at Liberty SiriusXM Group was $19.7 billion and the value of the Live Nation stock held was $6.6 billion. We have $3 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty Sirius XM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.9 billion, which includes $9.9 billion of debt at SiriusXM. Formula One Group had attributed cash liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $1.6 billion at quarter end, which excludes $834 million of cash held directly at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.4 billion, which includes $2.9 billion of debt Formula One, leaving $454 million at the corporate level. F1\u2019s $500 million revolvers undrawn and Formula One leverage at the end of the quarter was 3.7x meaningfully within our target leverage range of less than 5x. As of quarter end, we are no longer in a period of covenant waiver. Looking at a few cash items on Formula One, Formula One estimates its cash tax rate in 2022 to be single digit, a single digit percentage of adjusted OIBDA, increasing modestly to low double digits in 2023, and thereafter, as a result of the UK tax rate increase, effective next year. Additionally, Formula One is currently undergoing a project to refurbish and upgrade. Its UK based media and technology center at Biggins Hill in the UK, which broadcasts production and other technical activities and related staff are based. Formula One expects to incur about $40 million in incremental CapEx associated with this project, approximately half of which will be recognized in 2022 and the remainder next year. This elevated CapEx excludes any CapEx necessary just to support the launch of the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023. And as Greg mentioned, we'll provide updates on that later in the --later in the year. As a reminder, under the current Concorde Agreement, Team payments now take the form of an entirely variable price bond which is now calculated based on F1's adjusted EBIT rather than adjusted EBITDA. The adjusted EBITDA measure that was used in previous agreements such that the calculation now takes account CapEx which is incurred through including depreciation costs in the calculation. Finally, at the Braves Group, at quarter end, they have attributed cash and liquid investments of $311 million, which excludes $26 million of restricted cash. Braves Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $678 million. As Greg mentioned, the Braves completed their sale of three minor league teams in January. Proceeds are included in our financial results as a disposition in the first quarter and you can see additional details on that in our 10-Q which will get filed later today. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with the debt covenants at quarter end. And with that, I'll turn it over Stefano to discuss Formula One.\nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Brian. I'm thrilled to be in Miami this morning. As we have set for the inaugural Miami Grand Prix. The seat is buzzing with excitement, and we are looking forward to the weekend. The 2022 season is off to a phenomenal start. The many changes to the cars and regulation have resulted in improved racing. The cars now follow more closely, enabling greater opportunities for wheel to wheel racing with drivers trading position multiple times, making them think more strategically about the moves. The sprint is back and we held our first event of the season in Imola that came down to the final few laps. It turned out to be a Grand Slam weekend for Red Bull heading qualifying before winning both the race and the sprint and securing extra point for the fastest lap. The first sprint of the season recorded a total audience of 8.4 million, at 28% versus qualifying at the same Grand Prix in 2021. With strong growth in Brazil, and in the US. The Imola weekend on this Sky Sport Italy website recorded that 74% increase in unique user compared to the Emilia GP in 2021. On F1 social platforms, we saw one 149 million video view, up 36% versus Imola in 2021 and 45 minutes engagements, a 43% increase versus 2021. However, the start of the season so far is Ferrari, which has shown real strength with the car and ensures [Indiscernible] leading the Driver\u2019s Championship by 27 points. Red Bull are catching up, and we expect the season to continue to create great racing and close battle at the front. As the construction has continued to refine the new cars. We expect more surprises during the season and opportunities for great racing across the grid. As confirmed on our last earnings call, we will not be racing in Russia in September. We are currently considering the options for the spot and hope to announce more information soon. The action on the track is certainly drawing in the audience through Imola, the average oldest Grand Prix across the main Saturday and Sunday sessions is $23.8 million and is up 10% versus 2021 season average. In the US, The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix brought in over 1.4 million average of viewers, the ninth highest of all times and second highs on cable and other race themselves, the fans are back in huge numbers. We had record attendance in Bahrain, in Saudi, we had 140,000 fans over the weekend with full capacity. Melbourne was the largest weekend ever in Australian sporting history with 420,000 fans. Strong advance ticket sales almost everywhere suggests we may continue to see sell outs of the races for the remainder of the season, including here in Miami. We were thrilled with the response to season four of drive to survive, the series most popular season yet. On the opening weekend, fans consumed 28 minutes hours of drive to survive, and the show was ranked number one in 33 countries. Looking towards the 2023 season, we announced that the debut of the Las Vegas Grand Prix in November 2023. This will be a Saturday night race down the iconic strip, we cannot think of a more perfect marriage of speed and glamour. Staging operation US demonstrates the huge appeal and growth of our sport here. In fact, in the 24 hours following the official announcement wins Las Vegas and anchor resort, so more requests for hotel room reservation than any other one day period in their history. He also saw the announcement generate four times more social media activity than the 2024 Vegas Super Bowl announcement. It is precisely these opportunities that lead us to take on the promoter role for this race. We believe acting as promoted will provide us with valuable insight across the globe. As Greg mentioned that this will require investment on both the CapEx and OpEx side, and we plan to share more on this later this year. Additionally, on the race side, we announced that we extended the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix as they started to gain more track through 2025. We are pleased with the progress made in the other commercial areas, especially with our new sponsors, including several in the technology space, Salesforce has joined us as global partner in a multiyear deal. In addition to the growing and deepening engagement with our fan base, we will gain actionable insight around our carbon footprint as we march toward our goal of net zero emission by 2030. Tata Communications return as the official broadcast connectivity provider of Formula One, they will facilitate the transfer are more than 100 video feeds and 250 audio channel between the venues and the F1 medias and Technology Center in the UK in under 200 milliseconds, enabling us to reach over 500 million fans in 182 territories. We've already made great strides here on the ESG front as our move to remote broadcasts operation in 2020 allowed us to reduce our volumes of traveling freight and stuff at the racetrack. We also worked on the Lenovo as an official partner and we will use their technology across our operation. We will leverage their extensive selection of premium hardware innovative next generation technology such as augmented and virtual reality. Additionally, we will work together with Lenovo on projects around diversity and inclusion. We were also pleased to announce the renewal and expansion of our partnership with Workday, a leader in enterprise cloud application for finance and human resources. Outside of the global space, we announced a multiyear deal with MSC Cruises as a global partner and they plan to bring the cruise ship portside during selected Grand Prix weekends. And AlphaTauri, Red Bull\u2019s premium fashion brand has become the official premium fashion apparel supplier of Formula One. On the broadcast front, we renewed our partnership with Canal+ until 2029. We have seen significant viewership growth in France. The 2021 average viewership for each Grand Prix was up 18% over 2020 and up 50% compared to 2019. And the first two Grand Prix of the season already ranked among the top five racing of old times for F1 events for Canal. As part of the distance partnership, Canal+ subscribers will now get access to F1 TV pro through My Canal. We also renew our partnership with the Foxtel Group in Australia in a multiyear deal. Every Grand Prix will be available in 4K and Foxtel will integrate the F1 TV app into its set top boxes. From 2023, the F1 TV app will be available free to Foxtel subscribers and will provide multiple live in race feed, comprehensive life timing data and exclusive programming on the end of the track. F1 TV continues to see significant growth accelerating into 2022 from an already strong 2021 as the first race of the season in Bahrain, the platform gained 427k new users and concurrent viewers were up to 144% compared to 2021. We continue to evolve on the gaming front and feeding F1 Management 2022, the first management simulation game as part of a long term, multi title agreement that will be released this summer. The game allows you to be the team principal. Choose your drivers and engineers and balanced budget as you manage your team to victory. Find out if you are Toto or Christian or may even a Guenther. As you can see from our recent commercial announcement, our ESG goals are a major focus not only for us, but also for our partners. We are moving towards our goal of being net zero carbon as a sport by 2030. For the Bahrain Grand Prix, we exceeded our target to offset our emissions. Our experienced promoter, the Bahrain International Circuit demonstrate vision and speed by completing a major solar project that more than covered the energy requirements of the entire Grand Prix weekend. This successful [Indiscernible] shows what we can do as a supporting community to make a positive contribution to reduce emission and our carbon footprint. We hope you enjoy this weekend of racing as much as we plan to. [Indiscernible] And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Stefano and Brian. We hope you'll tune into our inaugural Miami GP this weekend. We do appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and look forward to a healthy and productive 2022. And with that operator, I'd like to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi, thank you. With the Las Vegas Grand Prix, I was hoping you could discuss a little bit more the decision to promote this yourself as opposed to a third party. This is primarily about capturing the financial upside beyond what you could get on a promoter fee. Would you look to apply this model elsewhere? And then Greg, I think at the start of the call, you mentioned $240 million purchase for land adjacent to the site in Vegas. Just wondering if you could provide some incremental detail on what you're buying here and kind of how that ties into the race logistics. Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: Well, I'll take a cut and let Stefano add, I think I indicated we're buying 39 acres for $240 million. And that'll be the site of the pit and paddock and some other hospitality. We don't have any other financial details yet to release on what else will be spent on that site. I think our decision to promote Vegas in conjunction with Live Nation and local partners is driven by a couple of things, one proximity, it's fairly easy relative to being in Denver to get to Vegas for us to do the work. And we have some knowledge of the local US market relative to many other markets. But I think more importantly, we see the opportunity to be a promoter as a way to expand our understanding the business, understand what, how to be a the best Formula One product on the track for other promoters as well, to look at an opportunity to grow our knowledge and our understanding and potentially promote other races down the road. And lastly, I think Vegas is going to be large and unique, perhaps unique opportunity. So from a financial perspective, we think this one sets up pretty well to be worth the time extra focus to become the promoter. Stefano, I don't know what you would add.\nStefano Domenicali: No, thanks. Greg, was very spot on all the points. I would say that as we remember, David, Vegas has been always a place where we do believe that the association between the values of Formula One and the glamour and the attractiveness, the possibilities to be in that community is crucial. But I would say on top of the financial things that we can see around that business, we can be seen the enabler to maximize what potentially Vegas could be for Formula One in terms of awareness, in terms of business creation, in terms of activating an area of the world where we can bring internationality and I think that is a great win to win business also for the ones that are investing there. But for sure our knowledge of the business and our opportunity to explore with our Live Nation partner and I think it's the best in order to make sure that in next year in November, when we're going to have to race that event will be spectacular. That will be unique, as I would say we can feel here in Miami already.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Kraft : Hi, good morning, I had a high level question and one on Formula One, if you don't mind, I guess, Greg, first, what are your overall thoughts on the economy and the interest rate environment? And how are they impacting your decisions around capital allocation, capital structure and potential new investments? Is now the time to say deploy capital for new investments, given the decline in asset prices? Are you more of the mind that cash preservation is most important now? And then, on the Formula One side, I guess, Stefano or Greg, can you talk about how Formula One benefits in the -- from what appears to be really strong economics around the Miami Grand Prix? I think the terms there for Miami are a bit more variable than some of your other race promotion deals. So any color there would be great. And I guess, as a follow up to David's question, was anything that you were seeing in Miami, did that help to inform your strategy to become the promoter for Vegas? Because you saw that things were going so well there and saw an opportunity to participate in a bigger way and the upside, and then I had one more just on the investment in Vegas and developing that, in terms of order of magnitude, how much bigger might the Vegas build out get in terms of dollars versus what you've already laid out for this year? And how would you think about potential external financing there? Whether it's debt specifically on the project, bringing in some of the creative stuff like you did, maybe with the Braves in Atlanta. Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: So I'm going to parse those. On the last one, I don't think we're ready to talk any more about the outlays at Vegas, it will be bigger than a breadbox but manageable. I don't think we'll need outside partners. And I don't think only debt we have quite a lot of cash at F1. I'll let Stefano talk a little bit about more about what Miami informed us and I'll talk more broadly about cash in the market. Thanks.\nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Greg. Right. I mean, as you know, different form of relation with the promoter is related to maximize the opportunity that the each place can bring to Formula One. And I think that it's clear that what we can see, I mean, just arrived two days ago in Miami, I mean, the vibes that we have created this Formula One is immense is great. And a keen developer, let's see, two strategy and that one, how we can maximize the value that Formula One will bring to community, but also how we can maximize the value of our partners that are coming here and investing for Formula One can see as once again, the enabling factor of creating business opportunity for them. And this is on direct value that Formula One is bringing very highly today because of the success of our international platform. And of course, the fact that here we invested together with our promoters, the Miami Dolphins, is because they knew the community, they have the right expertise to maximize in the shorter term as possible, what we want to bring here, for Formula One, and as I said, the success is already high before this type of event. And of course, this is the first time we are here, we can see a different business model having a lot of corporate business that wants to develop the data to a different mode that is different from place to place. So this is something that also from our side will be very important to learn in order to be even more effective when it comes to Las Vegas. And we're going to be direct able to promotion of it.\nGreg Maffei: So on the larger question about the market environment, it's scary to try and imagine investing, catching a falling knife in this industry environment and stocks. But I have seen general, we try and take a longer view. There are opportunities that can create in these environments, some of the best deals we've done, like SiriusXM, were created in difficult economic times, we are lucky to have not only cash availability at the SPAC and F1, significant excess cash at both, and strong free cash flows at Sirius and Formula One. That I think that creates opportunity for us exactly when that will be timed. And when we'll make a decision. We have a lot of benefits in our model. But we have some disadvantages. It's not like we can turn around and just say buy 5% of the company in the market, we think the bottom is it's a longer cycle in finding deals. But I definitely think the environment will create opportunities for us, and we'll be on the lookout.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vijay Jayant with Evercore.\nVijay Jayant: Thanks, on Formula One. On the Las Vegas race for next year. Should we think about that as an incremental race? So are we going to 24 races assuming you get a replacement for Russia this year? And again, what is the policy to actually add more races? At least reading, some of the drivers keep complaining that too many races already, is that like a regulatory process that you have to go through with the FIA or the teams, anything on that would be appreciated. And then on some of the new races coming back since COVID, really Japan and Singapore, they used to be reasonable sponsors for them. That's pretty material ones, I think. Is that an expectation we should have that they come back? I think Singapore Airlines and Honda. Thanks so much.\nGreg Maffei: Thanks, Vijay. I mean I can answer on the calendar. As you know, first of all, we will have not published at the calendar for next year. In terms of process, that there is an agreement within us the FIA and the teams to discuss, and it's on our side as a commercial right holder to make sure that we find the right balance between the number of events, historical events, new opportunities that can become because we are a world championship. And I think, if you think back a couple of years ago, as always, the right value for having a good calendar is related to the demand and to the offer that we can provide. And I think that today, we are always talking about 23, 24 races, and that what we believe today is the right number, considering the success that we are living today. While we were talking about Las Vegas, that will be in the calendar. Of course, that's the only thing that we have asked for next year. And I will say on the other hand, you will see soon what will be our strategy. And we have to respect the process as we discuss. And we're going to announce it not earlier that at the end of summer, because that's something that we want to keep it and prepare in the right way. With regard to the local promoters and slash sponsorship with Japan and Singapore. Yesterday, we have already announced that Singapore Airlines will be part of the promotional package on Singapore, because for them is a very important partner. And we respect that, Japan, we are -- you will discover soon that of course, for Honda, for example, because of their decision to quit officially Formula One, there could be something special that we want to recognize for them during that event. So this is part of the strategic discussion that we are having with our promoters. And I think that the economical benefit, of course will go into the system and of course also with us.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Laszczyk : Great, thank you, one on Formula One, revenue in the first quarter came in a little bit stronger than most of us expected. I was wondering if you could help us maybe unpack drivers of that strains maybe across media right sponsorship rates commission and other revenues even at that high level?\nBrian Wendling: I'm sorry, revenue beat expectations. Yes, Q1 was ahead. Well, I mean, for Formula One, obviously, we had two races versus one last year. And we're really back to more normal activities than we've been we've been over the past couple of years. So you had full crowds. And we had good sponsorship revenue as well. Also freight costs have been up a bit. And some of those costs are obviously passed on to the team. So there's incremental benefit there. But normal activities, compared to the past couple of years is really where we've seen the benefit.\nGreg Maffei: Yes, if I can just add, I think we've seen growth in almost every revenue category. But the way we recognize revenue randomly across races probably had the single largest impact the fact that it was two versus one in the first quarter, recognizing that many of our revenue streams are recognized ratably than could tie to the particular race.\nStephen Laszczyk : Got it, thanks for that. And then maybe one for Greg on sports media rights, I'm curious how you think the interest and ultimately the value of sports media rights could be impacted over the long term. If some of these concerns around growing subscriber growth ultimately play out? Do you think it helps improve [Indiscernible] given your unique live content? Or is the softening market something that you think affects content spend more broadly?\nGreg Maffei: Yes, I think it's a complicated topic. And partly where you sit is how you view it. And when I say that, I think there will be strains on the Braves, potentially over the long term as the RSN become less included in the bundle on a regular basis, that'll put pressure on some of the RSN revenue streams, the Braves in particular have a very strong RSN revenue stream and a lot of demand. So we may be less impacted than many, but obviously that turmoil it could be a negative. On the other hand, Formula One has seen increases in demand. And increases in viewership. And we have the US media rights is commonly known up for bid right now, beginning for next year season. And we have a lot of interest not only from traditional linear players, but digital players. And the offset to some of the decline in cable subs is the increase in some of the digital subscriptions. So that opportunity is, I think in the net, we're probably better off with more players bidding than the changing landscape, maybe little plus or minus, and then a charter, which is not the focus of today's call, we have a whole another set of dynamics where in some cases were helped. And in some cases, we may be hurt. So you really do either, a lot changing and a lot of it depends on which company we're talking about.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt securities.\nBarton Crockett: Great, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to put one question out, which comes from an investor, but I thought it was a good question, which is looking at the Braves, they're trading right now at market value of maybe 3.5x or so kind of sales. And you've seen private market transactions for baseball teams close to 7x kind of sales range. And so the question is why won't you guys take some more steps to try and achieve that value right now for the Braves? One of the things that would seem to be open to you is that you now have a second ATV with Formula One, and now Braves. So it'd be possible to split maybe the Braves offers an actual stock, which might help the value process, and get people thinking about private market transactions, maybe down the road. So kind of curious what your thought processes there, why you haven't pursued those type of opportunities to date?\nGreg Maffei: Great question. Even if it's not yours, Barton, from the investor still a good question. I think we are looking at all options. And considering what we might do, some of these things are more recent about when our ATP flexibility has occurred. There's some issues also, we're still looking at around Sirius and what we might do there, as you know, we crossed -- just crossed over the 80 there, we've just had Formula One become an ATP. So there's some moving targets. And we evaluate all opportunities. And I think your investor is probably right, I'm not sure 7x we'll see. But certainly, the multiple we're trading it is lower than that multiple, which has been in private transactions, whether it would still trade to that level of what it's a private sale transaction versus a public market transaction, open question. But I do agree that probably having the flexibility to do that would probably improve trading over time.\nBarton Crockett: Okay. And then also on the Braves, so I wanted to ask about the RSN deal with the Valley RSN. And they're pursued, obviously, rights from teams to do the direct to consumer streaming service. The Braves are not yet signed up for that. But we did see that, a friend of the Braves family and Charter has done a recent deal with Sinclair that involved the RSNs. And I'm just wondering, in the past, you guys have seemed very skeptical about signing up for, to have the Braves carried on that. It seems like you weren't really into that. Now Charter has done a deal with them. I'm just wondering if there's any evolution in your thinking or whether it still seems like not likely that you want to do that?\nGreg Maffei: Well, I think that's evolving, Barton, as well, and where Charter is like kind of similar to the answer I gave before where you sit, defines what you want to see happen. We have a good RSN deal that runs out till \u201827. I still think that's probably more valuable less than any digital deal. And they are incremental kind of digital deals that are around that potentially. And there you've seen growth in lots of kind of digital around baseball, and now people like Apple entering to buy rights. So I think it's evolving. I don't know if Valley is going to be the lead player. They've got their challenges, but we're certainly open to watching how the market evolves.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Joyce with Barclays.\nDavid Joyce: Thank you, another question on Formula One, please. Conceptually, how should we be thinking about the principal versus agency relationship on self-promoting this? Not looking for any financial specifics but just accounting wise, whether it be something where Live Nation is the promoter and is taking all the top line, but then they have the operating expenses, and therefore Formula One would get at least something along the lines of race promotion fee plus a margin, or is this something that is all going to be reflected directly on the Formula One's financials? And our partners \u2013 and how our partners reflected in that\nGreg Maffei: I'll start and let Brian give the really accurate answers. In general, we're the primary partner, Live Nation is the -- from a financial perspective is a secondary partner. They have a role is very important. But most of the capital investment, most of the outlays will come from us not from Live Nation. And we don't anticipate that this is going to be called out separately on our income statements, it won't be material in that sense. So the lines will generally be folded in promoter fees, and the like, sponsorship, hospitality, et cetera. But Brian, you might, you correct me on?\nBrian Wendling: No, that's very accurate. I would we'll consolidate, as Greg said. So the revenue and CapEx will be on our books, as well as the costs. And also, as Greg said, we would expect that we need to ultimately fine tune this once we have the race. But our expectation right now that you would see the revenues go into their traditional buckets, so paddock club would go into other revenue and then sponsorship then would go where sponsorship currently goes. And then to the extent we're selling tickets, we would expect that probably goes into our promoter revenues. So it'll look very similar except for the fact that we're consolidating the costs, which normally and all the revenue, was under normal promoter relationship, we just have that fee.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet: Another question on Formula One. You mentioned that you may over time maybe promote other races. And I guess if you look at the 24-ish races or whatever, some of those obviously, are in iconic places where you probably won't self-promote. But if you just you were going to blue sky it, how many of the 23 other races that you wouldn't be self-promoting would be in the bucket where you might self-promote?\nGreg Maffei: I don't think we've been, I\u2019ll let Stefano add, I don't think we've announced any plans, we're going to start and see where, how we do this, hopefully make the success of it, we believe we can make it. I would only cautiously say, don't be so certain that places which are iconic, or places where we will not eventually become a self-promoter. I wouldn't cast aside that opportunity. Stefano, what might you add?\nStefano Domenicali: No, absolutely, Greg. I think that the beauty if I may say that of this moment, is it's because the new promoters are really putting new energy and new vibes into the system, I think is something that has a collateral effect on the traditional promoter that needs to keep up the pace with respect to and we do respect a lot our promoters because they are the ones that really working with us to make sure that we have a great race show around the world. But this effect is giving us an incredible boost to make sure that all the system is very active to maximize what we're bringing into the platform. And this is really what Greg said is never say never. But with this in mind, I would say we are very happy with the promoters that working with us. They're very, very loyal, reliable partners, on which we're going to build up even a stronger future together.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark.\nMatthew Harrigan: Thank you. Clearly, you have a takeoff in the US for Formula One, which is really going to help with ESPN at the same time. You've got a lot of geopolitics -- geopolitical changes, Sochi going away, whac-a-mole zero COVID and China hopefully Shanghai comes back in particularly with the desirability of getting more better times in the US if it really becomes even more appealing for ESPN. Would you be more inclined to look at bringing back something like Nurburgring and maybe even promoting it yourself and some of the classic venues and kind of going more US and Europe versus a lot of the expanse in the second place in Asia and the Middle East? I know some of the Middle East races are hugely successful and they're going to stay around. But the world is changing so much. It looks like Formula One's a winner, but just how complex is your life after everything going on in the world on geopolitics? Thanks.\nStefano Domenicali: Well, what I can say Matthews that Formula One and we prove to be, let's say as flexible as possible, also in the COVID situation to maximize the fact that we wanted to have a great championship. And our duty is to make sure that we, first of all, our world championship. And we are investing either with partners or either with us involved directly in that to make sure that the strategic market has become crucial Formula One will be part of it. And you correctly say the US has an incredible boom in the last, I would say two years. And the duty is to make sure that we can even maximize more the effect on that. But we have other areas of the world that needs to be developed and need to be respected because of the tradition. But tradition doesn't mean that it's something given for granted, tradition is a great base on wish we're going to build up a better future. Europe has to stay for sure, with a good bunch of number of races in our calendar, they will stay, and you were talking about Nurburgring. I mean, the German landscape is for sure a very interesting landscape on which no matter who will be the promoter, we need to see what could be the action, if needed, that we can recover that in the calendar, I'm sure if you want to be specific on that something that could happen soon to be very important to be back on the calendar. But we don't have to forget that we have -- we want to invest in the Far East world because we so far being affected by COVID. But there is a great potential to grow there. We have to have -- other end of the world which is Africa, on which we may develop business there. So is a great moment for us to maximize the opportunities to see what would be the rights, right catalogue in the future of Formula One, we will not take the out of the equation [Indiscernible] having some places with rotational principles, because that will give a leverage to be multiple markets. So as I said, that is really our strategic thinking with regard to our future calendar.\nMatthew Harrigan: And I guess continuing with the German theme, are still discussion of new OEMs coming in to Formula One. I know you can't be specific, but it feels like there are a lot of positive things still pushing in that direction. Are you still having discussions with various people on that?\nStefano Domenicali: Well, as you can imagine, Matthew, we cannot be specific on that. The good news is that we can say what we read. And we know we're doing working with all the manufacturer, if I may, on that specific point without saying anything related to something that we cannot say. The good and incredible news that today Formula One is really showing the leadership in the technological landscape of the automotive business in the motorsport, of course, and our choices related to sustainable in the future. And our strong path that we want to prove to the world that we are really serious in the carbon net zero within 2030 is something that really gives us credibility. And this is the reason why everyone not only the ones that you read, are really interested to have talks with us.\nGreg Maffei: Operator, I think that we're done. To listening audience, again, thank you for your interest in Liberty Media. As we said, we hope to see some of you here in Miami. And for those who are not able to get to Miami, we do encourage you to watch and hope to speak to you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Now we'll conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Greg Maffei",
            "content": "Thank you, Courtnee, and good morning to all of our listeners. Today. Speaking on the call we'll also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. So I'll begin with Liberty SiriusXM, we received $872 million of gross dividends from SIRI tax free in the first quarter including the special and regular dividend. We, because of the nature of our convertible bonds, we had to pass through a $30 million of that special dividend. We continued our share repurchases repurchasing $182 million across LSXMA/K from February to April. We repurchased those at a look through price on Siri of about 356 a share. We of course remain disappointed with the discount and attack it as much as we can. We are very focused on long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now looking at SiriusXM itself, solid start to the year, continue to perform well financially despite a challenging auto market. Revenue was up 6%, monthly churn was wonderful down at 1.6%. And we had record ARPU up 9%. New car penetration for SiriusXM is now at 83% and is enabled a fleet of 146 million cars here in the US. As expected self-pay net ads were down slightly due to challenges in the auto market. This was partially offset by strength in digital, and we had a 50% increase in the subs listening digitally to our on demand content. I'd also note we launched our first ever streaming channel [Freakanomics] dedicated to podcasting and available across all the SXM platforms. SXM media was named the number one podcast ad network according to Edison Research, and we represent four of the top 15 podcasts in the country with the addition of Crooked Media in this month. Also beginning with this year's masters, SiriusXM is the exclusive audio provider for the [Indiscernible] and providing excellent programming across all four rounds. Turning the Live Nation, by Live's first best quarter ever, including give another record quarter and ticket master and compare to 2019 AOI is up 2x, transacted GTV is up 39% and sponsorship AOI is up 75%. We expect a record 2022, we've already sold 70 million concert tickets and expect double digit fan growth versus 2019. Concert ticket pricing is up double digits over 2019 due to fan demand for the best seats. And over 90% of our plan sponsorship net revenue is already committed. Turning to Formula One Group, on the corporate side we repurchase 348,000 FWONA shares for $20 million or $56.14 a share and looking at F1 itself thrilling start to the 2022 season. So far we've had battles back and forth on who will be on the podium each weekend. The spread event in Imola brought exciting qualifying results and the format is working well with the new regulations and producing strong viewership numbers. The sprint audience is up 28% versus the qualifying last year at Imola. We also see record demand in the US early in the season on ESPN viewers for the Sunday race in both Saudi and Bahrain were up 56% and that was the most viewed race since ESPN required the Formula One race in 2018. The momentum in the United States continues with this weekend's inaugural Miami GP. And of course, you can't have not heard about the announcement of our Las Vegas GP for November 2023. As we've noted before, that'll be a night race down the strip. And notably in differently than most places, Formula One and Liberty Media are self-promoting the race in partnership with local stakeholders and Live Nation. The build out for this track will require increased CapEx and OpEx to develop and it's too early to provide you with numbers but we intend to update you later this year. I would note that Liberty Media did enter an agreement to acquire 39 acres east of the strip to lock in circuit design and create capacity for the pit and paddock. Among other hospitality and race support venues, I expect that transaction will close in the second quarter and the purchase price was $240 million, it will be funded by cash on hand at the Formula One Group level. We announced numerous commercial announcements including on the media right side extension with Foxtel group in Australia and Canal+ in France. Sponsorship is off to an exciting start this year with several new deals including two new global partners, MSC and Salesforce, and we look forward to more announcements as the year progresses. We also look forward to seeing some of you this weekend in Miami. Turning the Braves. We started the season with a weeklong World Series Champion's celebration, including delivering World Championships rings to the players. We've completed less than 27% of the season. It's a long way to go and last season showed how far things can change over this 162 games. We are hovering at around the same record as last year. And we all know how that turned out. At least we did manage a split with the maps over the last couple of days. We are excited about our roster. We signed [Indiscernible] a 27 year old Atlanta native, we strengthen the [bullpen with Janssens] addition, and we're thrilled to welcome Ronald Acuna Jr. Back in the lineup this week. While it's still in the season, financial performance has already been incredible. Going into the season, we had the highest season ticket sales in more than two decades. We sold out all of our multiyear premium seats for the first time ever, and open our renovated delta club. And retail and concession sales have been strong for the first few home stand including selling out most of our Gold program jerseys. As you undoubtedly know, a new CBA was signed in March. There'll be minimal impact from the late start since the last games were away games, and we still expect a full 162 game season. In January, we also completed the sale of three minor league teams. And in final exciting news. We, Braves debuted the Digital Truist Park in April for future Metaverse fan opportunity engagement. Turning briefly to LMAC, nothing to report today. Obviously, we'll announce when we have something but I would note the environment which is very difficult, as many of, I think does favor us. And we continue to look at some interesting opportunities. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian Wendling for more on our financial results. Thank you, Stefano and Brian. We hope you'll tune into our inaugural Miami GP this weekend. We do appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and look forward to a healthy and productive 2022. And with that operator, I'd like to open the line for questions. Well, I'll take a cut and let Stefano add, I think I indicated we're buying 39 acres for $240 million. And that'll be the site of the pit and paddock and some other hospitality. We don't have any other financial details yet to release on what else will be spent on that site. I think our decision to promote Vegas in conjunction with Live Nation and local partners is driven by a couple of things, one proximity, it's fairly easy relative to being in Denver to get to Vegas for us to do the work. And we have some knowledge of the local US market relative to many other markets. But I think more importantly, we see the opportunity to be a promoter as a way to expand our understanding the business, understand what, how to be a the best Formula One product on the track for other promoters as well, to look at an opportunity to grow our knowledge and our understanding and potentially promote other races down the road. And lastly, I think Vegas is going to be large and unique, perhaps unique opportunity. So from a financial perspective, we think this one sets up pretty well to be worth the time extra focus to become the promoter. Stefano, I don't know what you would add. So I'm going to parse those. On the last one, I don't think we're ready to talk any more about the outlays at Vegas, it will be bigger than a breadbox but manageable. I don't think we'll need outside partners. And I don't think only debt we have quite a lot of cash at F1. I'll let Stefano talk a little bit about more about what Miami informed us and I'll talk more broadly about cash in the market. Thanks. So on the larger question about the market environment, it's scary to try and imagine investing, catching a falling knife in this industry environment and stocks. But I have seen general, we try and take a longer view. There are opportunities that can create in these environments, some of the best deals we've done, like SiriusXM, were created in difficult economic times, we are lucky to have not only cash availability at the SPAC and F1, significant excess cash at both, and strong free cash flows at Sirius and Formula One. That I think that creates opportunity for us exactly when that will be timed. And when we'll make a decision. We have a lot of benefits in our model. But we have some disadvantages. It's not like we can turn around and just say buy 5% of the company in the market, we think the bottom is it's a longer cycle in finding deals. But I definitely think the environment will create opportunities for us, and we'll be on the lookout. Thanks, Vijay. I mean I can answer on the calendar. As you know, first of all, we will have not published at the calendar for next year. In terms of process, that there is an agreement within us the FIA and the teams to discuss, and it's on our side as a commercial right holder to make sure that we find the right balance between the number of events, historical events, new opportunities that can become because we are a world championship. And I think, if you think back a couple of years ago, as always, the right value for having a good calendar is related to the demand and to the offer that we can provide. And I think that today, we are always talking about 23, 24 races, and that what we believe today is the right number, considering the success that we are living today. While we were talking about Las Vegas, that will be in the calendar. Of course, that's the only thing that we have asked for next year. And I will say on the other hand, you will see soon what will be our strategy. And we have to respect the process as we discuss. And we're going to announce it not earlier that at the end of summer, because that's something that we want to keep it and prepare in the right way. With regard to the local promoters and slash sponsorship with Japan and Singapore. Yesterday, we have already announced that Singapore Airlines will be part of the promotional package on Singapore, because for them is a very important partner. And we respect that, Japan, we are -- you will discover soon that of course, for Honda, for example, because of their decision to quit officially Formula One, there could be something special that we want to recognize for them during that event. So this is part of the strategic discussion that we are having with our promoters. And I think that the economical benefit, of course will go into the system and of course also with us. Yes, if I can just add, I think we've seen growth in almost every revenue category. But the way we recognize revenue randomly across races probably had the single largest impact the fact that it was two versus one in the first quarter, recognizing that many of our revenue streams are recognized ratably than could tie to the particular race. Yes, I think it's a complicated topic. And partly where you sit is how you view it. And when I say that, I think there will be strains on the Braves, potentially over the long term as the RSN become less included in the bundle on a regular basis, that'll put pressure on some of the RSN revenue streams, the Braves in particular have a very strong RSN revenue stream and a lot of demand. So we may be less impacted than many, but obviously that turmoil it could be a negative. On the other hand, Formula One has seen increases in demand. And increases in viewership. And we have the US media rights is commonly known up for bid right now, beginning for next year season. And we have a lot of interest not only from traditional linear players, but digital players. And the offset to some of the decline in cable subs is the increase in some of the digital subscriptions. So that opportunity is, I think in the net, we're probably better off with more players bidding than the changing landscape, maybe little plus or minus, and then a charter, which is not the focus of today's call, we have a whole another set of dynamics where in some cases were helped. And in some cases, we may be hurt. So you really do either, a lot changing and a lot of it depends on which company we're talking about. Great question. Even if it's not yours, Barton, from the investor still a good question. I think we are looking at all options. And considering what we might do, some of these things are more recent about when our ATP flexibility has occurred. There's some issues also, we're still looking at around Sirius and what we might do there, as you know, we crossed -- just crossed over the 80 there, we've just had Formula One become an ATP. So there's some moving targets. And we evaluate all opportunities. And I think your investor is probably right, I'm not sure 7x we'll see. But certainly, the multiple we're trading it is lower than that multiple, which has been in private transactions, whether it would still trade to that level of what it's a private sale transaction versus a public market transaction, open question. But I do agree that probably having the flexibility to do that would probably improve trading over time. Well, I think that's evolving, Barton, as well, and where Charter is like kind of similar to the answer I gave before where you sit, defines what you want to see happen. We have a good RSN deal that runs out till \u201827. I still think that's probably more valuable less than any digital deal. And they are incremental kind of digital deals that are around that potentially. And there you've seen growth in lots of kind of digital around baseball, and now people like Apple entering to buy rights. So I think it's evolving. I don't know if Valley is going to be the lead player. They've got their challenges, but we're certainly open to watching how the market evolves. I'll start and let Brian give the really accurate answers. In general, we're the primary partner, Live Nation is the -- from a financial perspective is a secondary partner. They have a role is very important. But most of the capital investment, most of the outlays will come from us not from Live Nation. And we don't anticipate that this is going to be called out separately on our income statements, it won't be material in that sense. So the lines will generally be folded in promoter fees, and the like, sponsorship, hospitality, et cetera. But Brian, you might, you correct me on? I don't think we've been, I'll let Stefano add, I don't think we've announced any plans, we're going to start and see where, how we do this, hopefully make the success of it, we believe we can make it. I would only cautiously say, don't be so certain that places which are iconic, or places where we will not eventually become a self-promoter. I wouldn't cast aside that opportunity. Stefano, what might you add? Operator, I think that we're done. To listening audience, again, thank you for your interest in Liberty Media. As we said, we hope to see some of you here in Miami. And for those who are not able to get to Miami, we do encourage you to watch and hope to speak to you again next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Greg and good morning, everyone. In January, we settled exchanges of the 2.25% Live Nation exchangeable bonds for total consideration of $664 million, funded with cash and margin loan draws. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group has attributed cash and liquid investments of approximately $634 million, which excludes $76 million of cash held at SiriusXM. There's also $1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM and Live Nation margin loans. As of May 5th, the value of the SiriusXM stock held at Liberty SiriusXM Group was $19.7 billion and the value of the Live Nation stock held was $6.6 billion. We have $3 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty Sirius XM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13.9 billion, which includes $9.9 billion of debt at SiriusXM. Formula One Group had attributed cash liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $1.6 billion at quarter end, which excludes $834 million of cash held directly at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3.4 billion, which includes $2.9 billion of debt Formula One, leaving $454 million at the corporate level. F1's $500 million revolvers undrawn and Formula One leverage at the end of the quarter was 3.7x meaningfully within our target leverage range of less than 5x. As of quarter end, we are no longer in a period of covenant waiver. Looking at a few cash items on Formula One, Formula One estimates its cash tax rate in 2022 to be single digit, a single digit percentage of adjusted OIBDA, increasing modestly to low double digits in 2023, and thereafter, as a result of the UK tax rate increase, effective next year. Additionally, Formula One is currently undergoing a project to refurbish and upgrade. Its UK based media and technology center at Biggins Hill in the UK, which broadcasts production and other technical activities and related staff are based. Formula One expects to incur about $40 million in incremental CapEx associated with this project, approximately half of which will be recognized in 2022 and the remainder next year. This elevated CapEx excludes any CapEx necessary just to support the launch of the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023. And as Greg mentioned, we'll provide updates on that later in the --later in the year. As a reminder, under the current Concorde Agreement, Team payments now take the form of an entirely variable price bond which is now calculated based on F1's adjusted EBIT rather than adjusted EBITDA. The adjusted EBITDA measure that was used in previous agreements such that the calculation now takes account CapEx which is incurred through including depreciation costs in the calculation. Finally, at the Braves Group, at quarter end, they have attributed cash and liquid investments of $311 million, which excludes $26 million of restricted cash. Braves Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $678 million. As Greg mentioned, the Braves completed their sale of three minor league teams in January. Proceeds are included in our financial results as a disposition in the first quarter and you can see additional details on that in our 10-Q which will get filed later today. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with the debt covenants at quarter end. And with that, I'll turn it over Stefano to discuss Formula One. I'm sorry, revenue beat expectations. Yes, Q1 was ahead. Well, I mean, for Formula One, obviously, we had two races versus one last year. And we're really back to more normal activities than we've been we've been over the past couple of years. So you had full crowds. And we had good sponsorship revenue as well. Also freight costs have been up a bit. And some of those costs are obviously passed on to the team. So there's incremental benefit there. But normal activities, compared to the past couple of years is really where we've seen the benefit. No, that's very accurate. I would we'll consolidate, as Greg said. So the revenue and CapEx will be on our books, as well as the costs. And also, as Greg said, we would expect that we need to ultimately fine tune this once we have the race. But our expectation right now that you would see the revenues go into their traditional buckets, so paddock club would go into other revenue and then sponsorship then would go where sponsorship currently goes. And then to the extent we're selling tickets, we would expect that probably goes into our promoter revenues. So it'll look very similar except for the fact that we're consolidating the costs, which normally and all the revenue, was under normal promoter relationship, we just have that fee."

            "name": "Stefano Domenicali",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. I'm thrilled to be in Miami this morning. As we have set for the inaugural Miami Grand Prix. The seat is buzzing with excitement, and we are looking forward to the weekend. The 2022 season is off to a phenomenal start. The many changes to the cars and regulation have resulted in improved racing. The cars now follow more closely, enabling greater opportunities for wheel to wheel racing with drivers trading position multiple times, making them think more strategically about the moves. The sprint is back and we held our first event of the season in Imola that came down to the final few laps. It turned out to be a Grand Slam weekend for Red Bull heading qualifying before winning both the race and the sprint and securing extra point for the fastest lap. The first sprint of the season recorded a total audience of 8.4 million, at 28% versus qualifying at the same Grand Prix in 2021. With strong growth in Brazil, and in the US. The Imola weekend on this Sky Sport Italy website recorded that 74% increase in unique user compared to the Emilia GP in 2021. On F1 social platforms, we saw one 149 million video view, up 36% versus Imola in 2021 and 45 minutes engagements, a 43% increase versus 2021. However, the start of the season so far is Ferrari, which has shown real strength with the car and ensures [Indiscernible] leading the Driver's Championship by 27 points. Red Bull are catching up, and we expect the season to continue to create great racing and close battle at the front. As the construction has continued to refine the new cars. We expect more surprises during the season and opportunities for great racing across the grid. As confirmed on our last earnings call, we will not be racing in Russia in September. We are currently considering the options for the spot and hope to announce more information soon. The action on the track is certainly drawing in the audience through Imola, the average oldest Grand Prix across the main Saturday and Sunday sessions is $23.8 million and is up 10% versus 2021 season average. In the US, The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix brought in over 1.4 million average of viewers, the ninth highest of all times and second highs on cable and other race themselves, the fans are back in huge numbers. We had record attendance in Bahrain, in Saudi, we had 140,000 fans over the weekend with full capacity. Melbourne was the largest weekend ever in Australian sporting history with 420,000 fans. Strong advance ticket sales almost everywhere suggests we may continue to see sell outs of the races for the remainder of the season, including here in Miami. We were thrilled with the response to season four of drive to survive, the series most popular season yet. On the opening weekend, fans consumed 28 minutes hours of drive to survive, and the show was ranked number one in 33 countries. Looking towards the 2023 season, we announced that the debut of the Las Vegas Grand Prix in November 2023. This will be a Saturday night race down the iconic strip, we cannot think of a more perfect marriage of speed and glamour. Staging operation US demonstrates the huge appeal and growth of our sport here. In fact, in the 24 hours following the official announcement wins Las Vegas and anchor resort, so more requests for hotel room reservation than any other one day period in their history. He also saw the announcement generate four times more social media activity than the 2024 Vegas Super Bowl announcement. It is precisely these opportunities that lead us to take on the promoter role for this race. We believe acting as promoted will provide us with valuable insight across the globe. As Greg mentioned that this will require investment on both the CapEx and OpEx side, and we plan to share more on this later this year. Additionally, on the race side, we announced that we extended the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix as they started to gain more track through 2025. We are pleased with the progress made in the other commercial areas, especially with our new sponsors, including several in the technology space, Salesforce has joined us as global partner in a multiyear deal. In addition to the growing and deepening engagement with our fan base, we will gain actionable insight around our carbon footprint as we march toward our goal of net zero emission by 2030. Tata Communications return as the official broadcast connectivity provider of Formula One, they will facilitate the transfer are more than 100 video feeds and 250 audio channel between the venues and the F1 medias and Technology Center in the UK in under 200 milliseconds, enabling us to reach over 500 million fans in 182 territories. We've already made great strides here on the ESG front as our move to remote broadcasts operation in 2020 allowed us to reduce our volumes of traveling freight and stuff at the racetrack. We also worked on the Lenovo as an official partner and we will use their technology across our operation. We will leverage their extensive selection of premium hardware innovative next generation technology such as augmented and virtual reality. Additionally, we will work together with Lenovo on projects around diversity and inclusion. We were also pleased to announce the renewal and expansion of our partnership with Workday, a leader in enterprise cloud application for finance and human resources. Outside of the global space, we announced a multiyear deal with MSC Cruises as a global partner and they plan to bring the cruise ship portside during selected Grand Prix weekends. And AlphaTauri, Red Bull's premium fashion brand has become the official premium fashion apparel supplier of Formula One. On the broadcast front, we renewed our partnership with Canal+ until 2029. We have seen significant viewership growth in France. The 2021 average viewership for each Grand Prix was up 18% over 2020 and up 50% compared to 2019. And the first two Grand Prix of the season already ranked among the top five racing of old times for F1 events for Canal. As part of the distance partnership, Canal+ subscribers will now get access to F1 TV pro through My Canal. We also renew our partnership with the Foxtel Group in Australia in a multiyear deal. Every Grand Prix will be available in 4K and Foxtel will integrate the F1 TV app into its set top boxes. From 2023, the F1 TV app will be available free to Foxtel subscribers and will provide multiple live in race feed, comprehensive life timing data and exclusive programming on the end of the track. F1 TV continues to see significant growth accelerating into 2022 from an already strong 2021 as the first race of the season in Bahrain, the platform gained 427k new users and concurrent viewers were up to 144% compared to 2021. We continue to evolve on the gaming front and feeding F1 Management 2022, the first management simulation game as part of a long term, multi title agreement that will be released this summer. The game allows you to be the team principal. Choose your drivers and engineers and balanced budget as you manage your team to victory. Find out if you are Toto or Christian or may even a Guenther. As you can see from our recent commercial announcement, our ESG goals are a major focus not only for us, but also for our partners. We are moving towards our goal of being net zero carbon as a sport by 2030. For the Bahrain Grand Prix, we exceeded our target to offset our emissions. Our experienced promoter, the Bahrain International Circuit demonstrate vision and speed by completing a major solar project that more than covered the energy requirements of the entire Grand Prix weekend. This successful [Indiscernible] shows what we can do as a supporting community to make a positive contribution to reduce emission and our carbon footprint. We hope you enjoy this weekend of racing as much as we plan to. [Indiscernible] And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. No, thanks. Greg, was very spot on all the points. I would say that as we remember, David, Vegas has been always a place where we do believe that the association between the values of Formula One and the glamour and the attractiveness, the possibilities to be in that community is crucial. But I would say on top of the financial things that we can see around that business, we can be seen the enabler to maximize what potentially Vegas could be for Formula One in terms of awareness, in terms of business creation, in terms of activating an area of the world where we can bring internationality and I think that is a great win to win business also for the ones that are investing there. But for sure our knowledge of the business and our opportunity to explore with our Live Nation partner and I think it's the best in order to make sure that in next year in November, when we're going to have to race that event will be spectacular. That will be unique, as I would say we can feel here in Miami already. Thanks, Greg. Right. I mean, as you know, different form of relation with the promoter is related to maximize the opportunity that the each place can bring to Formula One. And I think that it's clear that what we can see, I mean, just arrived two days ago in Miami, I mean, the vibes that we have created this Formula One is immense is great. And a keen developer, let's see, two strategy and that one, how we can maximize the value that Formula One will bring to community, but also how we can maximize the value of our partners that are coming here and investing for Formula One can see as once again, the enabling factor of creating business opportunity for them. And this is on direct value that Formula One is bringing very highly today because of the success of our international platform. And of course, the fact that here we invested together with our promoters, the Miami Dolphins, is because they knew the community, they have the right expertise to maximize in the shorter term as possible, what we want to bring here, for Formula One, and as I said, the success is already high before this type of event. And of course, this is the first time we are here, we can see a different business model having a lot of corporate business that wants to develop the data to a different mode that is different from place to place. So this is something that also from our side will be very important to learn in order to be even more effective when it comes to Las Vegas. And we're going to be direct able to promotion of it. No, absolutely, Greg. I think that the beauty if I may say that of this moment, is it's because the new promoters are really putting new energy and new vibes into the system, I think is something that has a collateral effect on the traditional promoter that needs to keep up the pace with respect to and we do respect a lot our promoters because they are the ones that really working with us to make sure that we have a great race show around the world. But this effect is giving us an incredible boost to make sure that all the system is very active to maximize what we're bringing into the platform. And this is really what Greg said is never say never. But with this in mind, I would say we are very happy with the promoters that working with us. They're very, very loyal, reliable partners, on which we're going to build up even a stronger future together. Well, what I can say Matthews that Formula One and we prove to be, let's say as flexible as possible, also in the COVID situation to maximize the fact that we wanted to have a great championship. And our duty is to make sure that we, first of all, our world championship. And we are investing either with partners or either with us involved directly in that to make sure that the strategic market has become crucial Formula One will be part of it. And you correctly say the US has an incredible boom in the last, I would say two years. And the duty is to make sure that we can even maximize more the effect on that. But we have other areas of the world that needs to be developed and need to be respected because of the tradition. But tradition doesn't mean that it's something given for granted, tradition is a great base on wish we're going to build up a better future. Europe has to stay for sure, with a good bunch of number of races in our calendar, they will stay, and you were talking about Nurburgring. I mean, the German landscape is for sure a very interesting landscape on which no matter who will be the promoter, we need to see what could be the action, if needed, that we can recover that in the calendar, I'm sure if you want to be specific on that something that could happen soon to be very important to be back on the calendar. But we don't have to forget that we have -- we want to invest in the Far East world because we so far being affected by COVID. But there is a great potential to grow there. We have to have -- other end of the world which is Africa, on which we may develop business there. So is a great moment for us to maximize the opportunities to see what would be the rights, right catalogue in the future of Formula One, we will not take the out of the equation [Indiscernible] having some places with rotational principles, because that will give a leverage to be multiple markets. So as I said, that is really our strategic thinking with regard to our future calendar. Well, as you can imagine, Matthew, we cannot be specific on that. The good news is that we can say what we read. And we know we're doing working with all the manufacturer, if I may, on that specific point without saying anything related to something that we cannot say. The good and incredible news that today Formula One is really showing the leadership in the technological landscape of the automotive business in the motorsport, of course, and our choices related to sustainable in the future. And our strong path that we want to prove to the world that we are really serious in the carbon net zero within 2030 is something that really gives us credibility. And this is the reason why everyone not only the ones that you read, are really interested to have talks with us."

A reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Shane Kleinstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Shane. You may begin. \nShane Kleinstein: Thank you, and good morning. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in the most recent Form 10-K filed by Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings with the SEC.\n These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call, and Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media or Atlanta Braves Holdings expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Media, SiriusXM and Atlanta Braves Holdings, including adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media, SiriusXM and Atlanta Braves Holdings, schedules 1 through 3 can be found at the end of the earnings press releases issued today, which are available on Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings website.\n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO. \nGregory Maffei: Thank you, Shane, and good morning to all. Today speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali, and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling.\n Also during the Q&A, we will answer any questions related to Atlanta Braves Holdings and Braves management will be available too.\n So let me begin with Liberty SiriusXM. The LSXM and Sirius transaction is on schedule. We filed the preliminary proxy on the first -- January 30 rather. We still expect to close by early Q3 and the NAV discount, which was about 42% prior to announcement is now closed to about 25% as we had hoped, and we expect it will continue to close.\n Looking at SiriusXM itself, the strong operating and financial performance that it had in 2023 showed the durability of the business, [ sub-pay ] net adds were up in the second half, as expected, boosted by streaming, the strong margins and free cash flow generation remained largely through cost discipline. Importantly, they rebuilt their tech stack and relaunched their app in the fourth quarter. And we're beginning to show positive early results from that with better personalization, promising engagement and improved service quality. We believe these initiatives as well as the incremental content they added will continue to drive long-term growth.\n Looking at the 2024 priorities of the business: first, increasing 360L adoption and boosting conversion and retention, continuing to deliver engaging content. Recently, they signed the quite popular SmartLess podcast with Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes. We do expect self-pay net add improvement throughout the year. And there is a focus on maintaining stable EBITDA margins and free cash flow. I look forward to remaining involved personally in the next evolution of the business as Chairman and a shareholder. \n Turning to Formula One Group. It was an amazing 2023 at F1, we saw double-digit growth across all revenue streams and adjusted OIBDA up 22%. We see a strong commercial start to the season. Four REITs promotion renewals, including Silverstone, a 10-year deal with venue upgrades in our important heritage market and a new race in Madrid beginning in 2026, which will be a partial street race with convenient fan access.\n We do see continued growth in fandom. Recently, this week, F1 joined Threads and 2.8 million followers were on board of the platform after half a day of use. We closed the Quint acquisition in January, as we previously noted, and it's that growing partnership opportunities from Quint with F1, LPGP and other sports properties, including the Kentucky Derby and the NBA All-Star game. \n Let me turn to a minute to Vegas. It was an incredible race. We were fortunate to have such a great outcome with a record 181 overtakes and the podium came down to the final lap. It was a great result for Formula One. We created new commercial opportunities and generated fantastic global buzz. A high percentage of the first time F1 attendees and massive audiences tuning into this race. It drew marquee brands to F1, for example, American Express, T-Mobile, Moet Hennessy, Google. And we think these brands and the marquee aspects that they are joining Vegas will continue to help us in 2024 and beyond.\n It was also a hugely success for the local community. The total economic impact of the race was estimated at $1.2 billion, and the average visitor spent 3.6x of what a typical visitor spends for a non-F1 event.\n We look forward to building on the success of LVGP in 2024. For example, we're going to increase the GA and expand the product offerings at various price points. We're going to optimize the cost structure. The year-round commercialization efforts at Grand Prix Plaza are developing, but we will expect only a modest contribution from those in 2024. Corporate events at that site kicked off around the Super Bowl this year.\n In summary, the Vegas race exceeded our expectations on many levels, even though year 1 costs came in higher than we had anticipated. We do not intend to close -- disclose rate specifics on this race consistent with our practice across all races. I would note that the -- we are kicking off F1 season with testing in Bahrain, which occurred and look forward to the first race in Bahrain this weekend.\n Turning to Live Nation. 2023 was the biggest year ever, where they were all-time highs for attendance, ticket sales and sponsorship, concert attendance grew 20% with 145 million fans. Global demand for concerts continues to grow. The top 50 tours did 50% more international acts in 2023. We have an incredible pipeline for 2024 with no sign of consumer slowdown. We're seeing strong demand across all price points. For example, large venue shows are up double digits, and 65% of full year large venue shows are already booked versus only 50% last year at this time. The number of shows at amphitheaters and other operated venues will also increase in 2024.\n Let me turn to the Braves. Obviously, there was incredible team performance in 2023, so much to highlight. I'd [indiscernible] one, the 947 runs scored was the first in MLB, in a tied MLB home run record as well for the team. The Braves also experienced great financial growth for the year. Baseball revenue was up 9%. We see continued success results in higher payments under MLB's revenue sharing plan. So that is the one negative about our continued revenue growth. But I'd also note the battery revenue was up 10% and our adjusted OIBDA was up 11%.\n We clearly benefit from the strengths of the Braves' territory. In a recent study YouGov, the Braves had 8.4 million fans in the South region, #1 in MLB, and over 65% of all other local sports team fans support the Braves, which is the highest crossover of any fandom in Atlanta.\n We've seen encouraging early season trades, including for 7x All-Star Chris Sale and Outfielder, Jared Kelenic. We are well positioned for future commercial and on-field success. For example, 2024 season tickets are already sold out and there is a 16,000-person wait list. We are looking forward with beta [indiscernible] to the home opener against the DBacks on April 5.\n And with that, let me turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results. \nBrian Wendling: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. At year-end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $90 million. This excludes $216 million of cash held directly at SiriusXM. During the quarter, Liberty SiriusXM repaid the remaining $199 million outstanding principal of its $1.375 basket convertible notes using cash on hand. Also during Q4, Liberty SiriusXM paid down $80 million under the margin loan, $61 million of which was from the monetization of its 1.8 million batter K shares.\n At quarter end, there's $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM margin loan. As of February 27, the value of our SiriusXM stock was $15 billion. We have $1.3 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $11.1 billion, which includes $9.3 billion of debt held directly at SiriusXM.\n Turning to the Formula One Group. At quarter end, Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $1.4 billion, which includes $1 billion of cash held directly at Formula One.\n Now the Quint acquisition closed in January. Which will be a use of Formula One Group cash. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $2.9 billion, which includes $2.5 billion of debt at Formula One, leaving $533 million at the corporate level. And F1's $500 million revolver remains undrawn and leverage at the end of the year was 1.9x.\n As we've said in the past, the F1 business is best annualized on an annual basis. So we'll only be speaking to full year results. Total revenue grew 25% in 2023 with double-digit growth across all primary revenue streams. Year-over-year revenue increases include the significant revenue generation from self-promoting the Las Vegas Grand Prix, including ticketing revenue, which is included in race promotion, sponsorship revenue, which is recognized accordingly. And hospitality and experience income, which is included in other F1 revenue.\n Rates promotion revenue also benefited from the mix of events held compared to 2022 with 2 additional flyaway races this year with Qatar and Las Vegas versus Imola in France in the prior year. And sponsorship and media rights revenue grew due to increased fees under new and renewed commercial agreements.\n Other F1 revenue grew 42% or $196 million, driven by hospitality and experiences, largely attributed to the Las Vegas Grand Prix. As well as growth in the Paddock Club and other events, partially offset by reduced freight income due to easing of freight cost inflation. Team payments as a percent of pre-team adjusted OIBDA as reported, was 63% in 2023, down from 66% in 2022. Other costs of F1 revenue increased from 23% of total revenue in the prior year to 32% of total revenue this year, primarily driven by promoting, organizing and delivering the Las Vegas Grand Prix. As well as increased cost of servicing additional hospitality offerings.\n SG&A at 7% of total revenue was in line with historic averages. Corporate and other adjusted OIBDA was a loss of $39 million in 2023, which includes $15 million of revenue for use of the pit building during the Las Vegas race weekend. Formula One incurs a fixed monthly rent payment that approximates depreciation, plus a variable rent component during the race weekend. Note that the fixed rent payment in 2023 reflects only a portion of the year as the building wasn't occupied until closer to the race weekend.\n Corporate level expense at Formula One Group was also elevated due to the split-off and reclassification costs. In 2024, Formula One Group Corporate and other adjusted OIBDA will benefit from the Quint acquisition that closed in January as well as a full year of the rent payment.\n Looking to 2024, F1 will host 24 races with the return of China and Imola compared to 22 races in this past year. Quickly looking at a few cash items. F1 estimates its cash tax rate in '24 to be a high single-digit percent of F1 adjusted OIBDA, increasing towards low double digits in future years as a result of the U.K. tax rate increase.\n Total CapEx incurred at the Formula One Group in 2023 was $426 million, approximately $390 million of which related to the development of LVGP, with the majority incurred at the Formula One Group corporate level.\n At the Liberty Live Group, there's attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $418 million, which includes ETF assets. There's $400 million of undrawn margin loan capacity related to our Live Nation margin loan. And as of February 27, value of the Live Nation stock was $6.5 billion. We have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings.\n Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end and then quickly looking at the Braves. The Braves business is also best analyzed on an annual basis due to fluctuations in game count.\n Baseball revenue increased 9% in 2023, primarily due to increased ticket demand and attendance, leading to a 14% growth in baseball event revenue and 8% growth in retail and licensing revenue. Other baseball revenue declined primarily due to fewer concerts held compared to the prior year. The battery had another great year with mixed-use revenue increasing 10%.\n Total adjusted OIBDA decreased for the year, primarily due to increased player payroll expense as Braves management continues to invest in its on-field success, including a number of trades and accelerated player signings in December of 2023. Adjusted OIBDA for the mixed-use development increased 11% in 2023. And just a reminder that SG&A was elevated for the full year due to the split-off costs. We would anticipate a $10 million to $15 million annual run rate for corporate overhead at the Atlanta Braves Holdings.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One. \nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Brian. The 2023 season delivered incredible racing and record financial results. On the track, we want to recognize Max Verstappen and Red Bull once again on their superb performance. The rest of the grid battled until the end. The race for the second in the Constructor championship came down to the final lap of the season between Mercedes and Ferrari.\n McLaren and Aston Martin battled for fourth with McLaren intensifying the competition after a solid mid-season upgrade. Oscar Piastri at the stellar rookie season, securing 97 points included 2 podiums and a sprint race victory. And Albon fans have much to cheer about as it scored points in a number of races in 2023, helping Williams finishing 7th, showing good progress under James Vowles' leaderships.\n Across the entire 2023 season, 6 teams were represented on the podium, a reflection of the talent up and down the grid. The new regulation are increasingly benefiting competition across the field. And we believe this will continue in 2024 as the benefit of the cost cap and the technical regulation continue to mature.\n Financially, the business generated a record revenue and adjusted OIBDA for the year. Our primary revenue stream grew, benefiting from new and renewed commercial agreement. Furthermore, our Paddock Club had an incredibly strong year with hospitality and experiences revenue growing nearly 100% year-on-year. This was driven by the expansive suite of hospitality and experience offerings at Las Vegas Grand Prix as well as growth in our core Paddock Club product with the Paddock Club sellout at 10 of 19 events.\n Towards the end of the season, we had the spectacular inaugural at Las Vega Grand Prix. It was a formidable undertake in moving the project from start-up planning to raise delivery in a little more than 1 year. We are incredibly proud of the Las Vegas team, worked with multiple stakeholders in the city and within the wider on community to deliver an incredible event on and off the track.\n Total ticket sales were 316,000 for the weekend. The race was thrilling from the start to finish. Charles Leclerc passed Perez on the last lap to secure its second-place finish. The race generated fan reach in multi-platform bus and with new viewers who haven't engaged all season. The local economic benefit generated by this race is remarkable. Local casino partners had record revenue with monthly gaming revenue for cloud counting at all-time high for the month of November.\n Stepping back to the broader calendar. The 2023 season overall delivered another year of record attendance. 6 million total fans attended the race weekend, up 5% compared to the 2022 season. 12 race promoter, report a new attendance record, including 480,000 of Silverstone, 445,000 of Mobil, 405,000 in Mexico and 308,000 in Belgium. Ratio tenders remain strong through the end of the season with record crowd in Sao Paulo and Abu Dhabi. F1 fans tuned in across platforms. Last season, we work closely with our media partners and create new tools to estimate digital viewership on platforms and channels not covered by Nielsen. Our findings suggest an additional 29% of audience that are not currently covered by traditional measurements globally, representing almost 20-million on average per race-weekend. The share of digital viewership is much higher for markets like the U.S. where fans rely more on video-on-demand and streaming platforms towards rates, especially those at less convenient times for live viewing. We will keep working with Nielsen this year to incorporate more of these digital audiences into their standard reporting to provide the most accurate picture of our total audience.\n Looking at broadcast TV, cumulative TV audience for 2023 season, excluding digital viewership was 1.5 billion, and average viewership per race was approximately 70 million. In the U.S. cumulative viewership was up 4% compared to the prior year, setting a new season cumulative TV audience record. Importantly, viewership among the under 35 and female demographics grew across all of our markets.\n Our spring series continued to drive increased engagement throughout the season, which boosted TV audiences and race weekend attendances. For our sponsor, there was an over 50% decrease in average brand exposure during the spring weekend. We look forward to the 6 events in 2024.\n Formula 1 was once again the fastest-growing major sport league on social media for the fourth year in a row with the highest growth rate compared to the 11 other global sports, including NBA, NFL and Champions League. We grew to 70.5 million followers on social media, up 17% from the prior year. We continued growth, especially in the U.S., where social media followers were up 28%.\n The U.S. continues to make up our largest orders on YouTube and Tiktok social platforms. For our f1.com and F1 app platforms, over 100 million unique visitors view it over 3.1 billion pages an increase of plus 10% over 2022, consumption of highlight videos on our web and app also grew by 35%. And we made greater commercial progress in 2023, securing contracts that will underpin our continued future success.\n As of year-end, we had over $12 billion in future revenue under multiyear contracts. Our momentum continued during the off season and into 2024. Our race promotion, we are prioritizing the quality and the value of every race slot, have it reached what we believe is a comfortable near-term MAX of '24 race. Earlier this month, we announced 10 years extension with Silverstone and look forward to enhancement to the Paddock Club and other physical infrastructure upgrade of the circuit. We are excited to welcome the Madrid Grand Prix and the 10-years agreement in a brand-new circuit with both Street and non Street segment for 2026. The race as planned to invite 110,000 fans initially and has potential to expand to over 140,000 over several years.\n We also announced 5 years extension for our Japan and Brazil races. With this announcement, we have now finalized all contract negotiation for the 2025 season, and we turn our attention to optimize the risk calendar for 2026 and beyond.\n Additionally, on media right, we are delighted to have recently secured the long-term pan-regional deal across the MENA region with its biggest sport platform beIN. This is on the heels of over half of those renewal signed in 2023.\n F1 continues to benefit from the demand for live global premium contents. We are broadcasting 200 territories and have a well-diversified portfolio of media right contracts across markets, typically ranging from 3 to 5 years. As we have said, alternative bidders including digital players are increasingly showing interest in life sports and increases competition from scarce media rights. Our F1 TV product has grown significantly since launch, with active F1TV Pro subscribers growing 37% in 2023 compared to 2022. The product has been bolstered by growing in the F1 calendars, F1 sprint races, new in-depth shows all 20 on-board cameras, Team Radius and continuously adding live programming around every season plus have revamped mobile friendly designs. We believe it delivers the best-in-class product for fans and is now available in 120 countries.\n Early this year, we rolled our price increase in the cross market for the first time since product launch in 2018 to bring the pricing in line with the market rates for the qualifying of the offering.\n Turning to sponsorship. We had successful 2023 growing existing partnership while securing new brands, including leveraging new assets like Las Vegas and F1 Academy to generate incremental demand. Puma and Tommy Hilfiger recently announced as official partner of F1 academy, and we'll have designed Liberty for the season. And beauty brands like Charlotte Tilbury also became an official partner of F1 academy, marking their first ever global sport partnership. We also announced an attractive multiyear renewal with our global partner, DHL this week.\n Going forward, we are optimizing our existing inventory to minimize impact, exclusivity and value for our partners. We are also actively creating new assets to capitalize our growing demand as sponsor preference for tailored opportunity in live events. There are targets vertical where we are underexposed including financial services and betting to name a few.\n Our fund engagement activities off the track continue to gain momentum. F1 arcades first location in London recorded 400,000 digital in this first year and the second U.K. location opening in the Birmingham. The first U.S. venue will open in Boston and D.C. this year with 20 venues targeted over the next 5 years. The F1 exhibition moved from Madrid where we welcome 170,000 visitors, it opened its second location in Vienna, early this month and will continue touring iconic global city to inspire the next generation of F1 fans.\n Sustainability remains a large priority for Formula One across our organization, commercial partner and F1 teams. More detail will be provided in the coming weeks, detailing our progress towards reaching the sustainability strategy we laid out in 2019. There are a number of sustainability accomplishment to highlight from last year. To name a few, progress continuing to develop of 100% sustainable hybrid fuel that will be introduced in 2026 and will be a drop in fuel usable in road cars without modification, which provides broader global benefits to the automotive industry well beyond the impact of Formula One. The 9 European events of the 2023 season used the freight transportation by DHL on the new fleet of biofuel truck, reducing related logistic carbon emission by 83%. The first cohort of students from F1 engineering scholarship embarked on their first word placement with the F1 teams. We will welcome the third cohort this year.\n Finally, we launched F1 Academy. The old payment driver category to develop and prepare young female drivers to progress to higher levels of competition. The second season in 2024 will see F1 academy race as a support series at 7 F1 events. The F1 teams are getting more involved in support in the series.\n In 2024, all 10 will have their liveries displayed on one F1 academic car each and will each nominate a one [ team-mate ] driver to race in the series. We look forward to beginning our 2024 season next month.\n The '24 race calendar has greater regionalization and more efficiently close of races, which reduced the distance of our [ freight kit ] travel globally in support of our 2013 net 0 commitment. China returned to the calendar for the first time since 2019. The 6 Sprint series will take place in Miami, Austria, Austin, Brazil, Qatar and China. We made small changes to the format this season with Sprint-qualified on Friday. Sprint race followed by race qualifiers on Saturday and the Grand Prix as normal on Sunday.\n And much to the delight of our fans, this off-season are certainly derive exciting. Young talent secured seats for years to come with Charles Leclerc committing to the Scuderia at least through 2025, and Lando Norris remaining with McLaren's at least through 2026. Capturing headlines, Lewis Hamilton will leave Mercedes for Ferrari in 2025 after an incredible 12 seasons with the silver arrows.\n In closing, and incredibly proud of the accomplishment in 2023 and eager to begin our '24 season. We have a solid financial foundation and an attractive growing fund base. Our team is focused on deepening this fandom with optimized content and platforms, to boost engagement while capturing more fast data so we can better tailor our commercial outreach. These efforts are spread across protecting our established fan, nurturing newly acquired fans and growing into new cohorts, especially younger audiences and underserved growth markets like Asia. We will continue to invest in our sport to capitalize on our incredible momentum. Avanti Tutta, full speed ahead.\n And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Bye-bye, Ciao. \nGregory Maffei: Thank you, Stefano, and thank you, Brian. To the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and the Atlanta Braves Holdings. And with that, operator, I'd like to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stan. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Congratulations to Renee and the Las Vegas team on a great race and outcome. I know that was a lot of work. Greg, I had a couple for you and maybe one for Brian, if he just want to entertain it. You mentioned optimizing the cost structure in Las Vegas for year 2. I just -- maybe you could spend a minute on what the opportunities are, and even if you're willing to tell us where in the P&L that might show up between kind of G&A at F1 versus direct costs.\n Any thoughts on a new Concorde Agreement that have been -- you guys had talked about trying to execute last year. Just curious if you had any update there. And then, Brian, I don't know if you had any guidance for us on CapEx at F1 in '24, now that everything is sort of built, but you probably have some maintenance costs on all these new assets. So that was it. \nGregory Maffei: Ben, I'm going to touch on the optimizing the cost structure, then let Renee add to it. And on the Concorde Agreement, I'll let Stefano cover where we stand. So on the optimizing cost structure, look, because we moved with real speed to try and get Las Vegas up in a record time. Many things were done to accommodate a great fan experience and make sure we got done on time. And with the benefit of more time, there are many things we can optimize. There, for example, there is a temporary structure a bridge that was put over one of the roads that will become -- but it was our cost that will not be reincurred there was work that was done around ensuring great security. And I think we'll learn how to do that in a more cost-effective manner. But I'll let Renee touch on other items to see things we might be able to say about. \nRenee Wilm: Sure. Thanks, Greg. So to Greg's point, we really did lean in on transportation planning and security. No one knew just how traffic would flow. We were hoping for the best planning for the worst. And it did turn out to be significantly better than anyone feared. That will hopefully allow us this year to start looking for areas that we can cut back in. We also have the benefit in year 2 of having a playbook.\n Again, we had to lean in on fan experience and other events that will allow us to create that inaugural race weekend that we needed for year 1. But this year, we are looking very closely at every line item on the budget to see where can we maximize the fan experience and ensure safety while also looking to really cut back on some of those costs. \nGregory Maffei: Some of that will be -- I think most of that will be a direct cost. Some of that will be in G&A, but mostly in direct. Do you agree Brian? \nBrian Wendling: I would think most of them -- yes, most would be in the operating costs yes. \nGregory Maffei: Stefano, do you want to touch on the Concorde Agreement? \nStefano Domenicali: Yes. Thank you, Greg. Yes, Ben. So we expect to address the renewal of the Concorde Agreement with the teams very, very shortly. We are -- our view that is basically shared with the things that basically the Concorde Agreement will need -- will not need any substantial changes this time around. So we're going to start very, very soon. We had priority to finalize before the end of the season talking about regulation and other stuff with regard to other things that need to be sold before. So now we are getting close to the time where we're going to start this discussion. Very, very shortly, as I said, Ben. \nBrian Wendling: And then last, Ben, on the CapEx. We're not going to disclose any specific numbers, but we would expect it to start to trend back to what our normal rate was in the past, specifically on LVGP. The team might evaluate different opportunities where you could put stuff on the balance sheet versus having it as rentals and OpEx. So those opportunities might arise, but overall, we wouldn't expect it to be really material. \nOperator: Our next question is from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. \nBryan Kraft: I had one for Greg and Stefano and Brian. Greg, I was wondering if you could walk us through the steps that you still need to take in order to close the [ spin merge ] from SiriusXM, Stefano. I was wondering if you could just clarify with the Madrid Grand Prix in the race count to 25 in 2026? Or will it substitute for Barcelona or another race? And then also, Stefano, if you could just comment, I mean, just qualitatively on the media rights outlook, it seems like 2024 will be a lighter year from our media rights revenue growth standpoint based on the renewal schedule and then a stronger year in '25. I just want to see if that was right.\n And then the last one I had was for Brian. Brian, I was wondering if you could just help us with some baseline numbers for Quint events so that we could try to model that correctly? Any estimate of revenue and EBITDA from last year? And any color on seasonality? \nGregory Maffei: So I'll touch on the first one. We received initial comments from the SEC on the proxy. I think those were relatively light credit, the legal and accounting teams for answering those or having a proxy that was clear and transparent, and we'll be able to answer those relatively quickly. So that we'll need to be cleared the final proxy by the SEC before we can go forward with a vote at the Liberty-Sirius level. We also have a parallel process with the FCC that I think is relatively pro forma, we do not believe that will be the long pole in the tent. So we're still targeting early third quarter, some chance we may be able to get it done quicker, but we're trying to manage your expectations and ours. Next question, whats the next part of the question. \nStefano Domenicali: It's -- I would say, I think I can come in, Greg, to answer Bryan the point of Madrid, but in '26, that is a year where there will be a lot of Grand Prix, where mainly Europe, we have different options that we can take over. Therefore, I think Madrid shows one thing that was very important for us to see that the attention F1 is there also in the old continent where everyone was thinking, no, we need to move out of Europe because there's not any more the interest, Madrid shows the opposite.\n I think '26 you're going to see something interesting. We are discussing with other promoters in Europe to do something that will be announced as soon as we close for sure. But Madrid will be a big boost because the event will be organized in a place where, as Greg was mentioning at the beginning of the speech, it will be a sort of track and a place where we'll be around the convention area to allow to give the opportunity to the fans to lead that event in an incredible way.\n But of course, so far, the focus in Spain is in Barcelona. There is a big convenient to do a Grand Prix there in the next couple of years. But with regard to the media rights, I would say there are 2 points that I think that we cannot consider light the 2024 because we just signed a very important deal with beIN for the next 10 years. And we do believe that also the [ F1+TV ] were going very, very well this year. So I think that for sure is in the year where we're going to see another growth. And of course, we are getting ready for a very important year when in the future into [indiscernible], there will be the media deal in U.S. that will be a very important deal we need to discuss in the right moment. where we're going to believe -- where we believe this will be another step in terms of our growth in that landscape. \nBrian Wendling: Yes. And then, Bryan, on Quint, we're not going to give the 2024 numbers, but what we would say is that the acquisition should be accretive to the Formula One Group overall. So you can kind of do the math from there. It's not overly material to the Formula One business, but it should be accretive going forward. \nBryan Kraft: And maybe just one follow-up for Greg. Just Greg, what's the amount of time you need between SEC approval for the proxy and the vote and then the vote closing the transaction? \nGregory Maffei: [indiscernible] Circa 2 months. \nOperator: Our next question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. \nDavid Karnovsky: For Greg and Renee, I think your biggest hotel partners were consistent in their views on their earnings calls that the rate should have a broader appeal and benefit some of the lower end or further properties on the strip. So interested in how you're thinking about potentially accommodating that and what it means for the rates in terms of ticketing or operational adjustments?\n And then for Brian, F1 operating leverage for the year was a little better than I think some investors had anticipated. The release you called out a reduction in the gene payout percentage as per the 2021 Concorde. Just want to make sure that was the main driver, and there weren't kind of any onetime adjustments to consider. \nGregory Maffei: I'll let Renee touch on the Vegas partners. \nRenee Wilm: Yes. Thanks for the question. So we will be going on sale pretty soon. And when we go and sell, you'll see that we have a significantly higher number of general admission. We're actually creating a brand-new general admission only zone, which will have single-day tickets and will be at the lowest price point that you will have seen for the Las Vegas Grand Prix. This is largely driven to accommodate the lower end properties and also to bring downtown into the mix. We are also working in partnership with the LVCVA to actually engage downtown, different types of activations, potentially watch parties, but really to spread this benefit of what was an incredible weekend throughout the entirety of the rally. \nBrian Wendling: And then on the F1 operating leverage, to your point, it primarily is the team fees. There's lots of ins and outs, but there's no material onetime items. \nOperator: Our next question is from David Joyce with Seaport Research Partners. \nDavid Joyce: I just wanted to try to get a finer point on the team payments there. Would Quints be excluded from team share payments? Or would some of those activities, if there are only F1 related -- be involved. I guess the same would go for any other acquisitions. Would any tuck-ins be outside of the Concorde Agreement? And related to that, how are you balancing reinvesting in the business versus thinking about capital returns from here? \nGregory Maffei: So I think Quint has an arm's length deal existing prior to our purchase with F1 and we would expect that arm's length deal to continue, but the Quint results are part of the F1 tracking stock, not part of F1. And that would likely be the case for any other acquisitions. Can't say absolutely because it would depend on the company, but likely that would be outside the F1 group or the F1 operating statement we shared with the teams.\n We continue to weigh opportunities like Vegas. Obviously, we look at lots of sporting properties. We think we have something to bring to the sporting world based on what we have been able to achieve at F1, and we think there are some things that we could bring forward to other sports properties, but we're judicious in that and people approach us because of those skills.\n Certainly, looking at continued share repurchase is an alternative as well, and we weigh third-party alternatives that might arise with that. \nDavid Joyce: And if I could add one on the brief, you -- could just get an update, please, on where that -- the process is with the bankruptcy courts and the RSNs? \nGregory Maffei: Derek, do you want to touch on that? \nDerek Schiller: Sure. Thanks for your question. We're watching that closely. And what we see is the bankruptcy presentation that was made is still being followed. Diamond Sports seems to have a plan for emerging from bankruptcy. As you've probably read, we're watching and seeing that just like you are. For our purposes, we're still getting full payment and operating the agreement as normal. So at this point in time, nothing is deviating from that. We don't expect that, especially as they've laid out per their plan. \nOperator: Our next question is from Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities. \nBarton Crockett: I'm just wondering on the EBITDA growth year-over-year. I understand you're not going to break out Vegas in any specificity, but is there any comment you can make on whether or not Vegas provided any material impact on that EBITDA change, did it up, down or was it no impact because that was very big kind of year-over-year growth, and that was a new race that was obviously meaningful. So that's one.\n And then secondarily, on the following up on the Braves kind of questioning. I was wondering if you could comment on some of the discussion that Major League Baseball is interested potentially rolling up on sports, local team rights or its own kind of streaming service and that, that could potentially be a roadblock or something to be resolved as you go through this Diamond restructuring? If you could talk about kind of your views, your support for that idea. \nGregory Maffei: So touching on LVGP, I can say that LVGP was a positive contributor to F1's earnings for 2023. And with the cost optimization measures we've discussed and frankly, improved interest in the race and improved potential price points, I think we will see a greater contribution in 2024, I think that's where we'll leave that.\n On MLB, I think I'm reluctant to comment. You've seen some of the public actions that MLB has -- was against some of the Diamond proposed restructurings. But other than that, I think we'd leave it alone other than Derek, if you want anything. \nDerek Schiller: No. The only other thing I might say, just a point of clarification, if you're not aware, the current agreement with Diamond does not include streaming rights. So those streaming rights continue to be held at the league level. That's not necessarily the case for all teams, but in our case, it is. And so -- we're obviously differential to what the league is going to do as a whole, but right now, our streaming remains at the league-wide level. \nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. \nStephen Laszczyk: Two on Formula One, maybe for both Greg and Stefano. First on Paddock. Could you maybe talk a little bit about where you see opportunity to grow hospitality revenues in '24? I'm curious what any of the pricing increase from [indiscernible] Paddock, it's been a pretty nice tailwind over the last few years. And then are there any areas across in particular where you think there's opportunity to grow capacity?\n And then secondly, on sponsorship, nice growth in '23. Could you maybe just talk a little bit more about the opportunity in '24? How much room do you feel like there still is to increase inventory without diluting the existing sponsorship value-add. Stefano, I think you mentioned creating some new assets. I'd be curious if you coul talk a little bit more about that and what verticals remain large opportunities. \nGregory Maffei: Stefano, do you want to start on hospitality? \nStefano Domenicali: Yes. Yes. Thank you, Greg. Thank you, Stephen. I think that -- what has been amazing is in the last couple of years, the fact that our offer in terms of Paddock Club been always appreciated by our customers. we did some adjustment on pricing, not everywhere because, of course, we understand that, of course, the prices are very important and very [indiscernible] things to do, or to apply. And therefore, I think that what we have done this year that is basically already confirming an incredible request from our partners and teams and guests is try to maximize eventual potential of growth in area that there is still availability of space. And the other thing that we are doing is to see if there is another kind of offer that we can put together.\n Of course, the fact that now we are together with Quint, we're going to exploit the maximum opportunity to make sure that the Paddock Club experience can grow also in the area of entertainment because that's the other place where we are exploiting a different way the racing can be experienced for our fans.\n And with regard to the sponsorship, I think that what we have seen in the last couple of years has been an incredible growth in terms of quality and in terms of quantity of our partners. That means that we need to keep having the right attention toward this kind of revenue stream. But that means that also we need to be ready to increase our possibilities to having the right offer in terms of new opportunity. I think that one that is pretty clear that we are able to optimize what we have done already last year in a way, has been the digital possibilities to differentiate from area to area, this different option for our partners.\n On the other side, of course, there are 2 main areas where we believe there is potential to do, but we need to have the right competencies, and we need to find the right partners consider the complexity. That is one area that's the gambling. And the other area is on the financial services that has been already taking a big step last year with Amex, but I think there is a huge opportunity that we can take into the future. And that's really where I believe in all terms that the potential to even grow is still there and will be there. \nOperator: Our next question is from Peter Supino with Wolf Research. \nPeter Supino: One for Stefano and one for Greg. Stefano, if you wouldn't mind, with Silverstone and Madrid and Sao Paulo and Suzuka all signed in the last quarter, I guess, we have seen contracts locked in for 5 or 10 years, in some cases. So how should we be thinking about the trade-offs in terms of contract duration, escalators, step-ups for promotion rights like this? Curious about the pros and cons and how we can think about that for modeling.\n And then, Greg, if you could please comment on the bigger picture for sports rights. It's become very controversial this topic that was once only driven by Optimus. And if you could let us know how you see sports rights values playing out over the next several years given the puts and takes of when you're in streaming? \nStefano Domenicali: Well, Peter, thank you for -- with regard to the first question. I think, as always, while we take the decision with regard to the renewal, there are a lot of [ balance ] that we need to consider. First of all, of course, the financial aspect is relevant, no doubt. And the fact that we are able to stabilize with certain promoters, which we believe represent an incredible opportunities in terms of our stability on this market is a relevant element to consider. The fact that you have seen in the last couple of years that we were able to ratify incredible agreement with certain promoter means that there is, from one side, of course, a very interesting financial package. But on the other side, an incredible opportunity to develop our business in areas that are on top of the one that is related to the promotional fee. And that's really our approach.\n It is clear that if you see the development of our regionalization of the calendar, we have moved out from being a European-centric to a very worldwide basic development that needs to be kept into the future. I just want to comfort the fact that we believe 24 races is the right number. And I think that we're going to play in the right way I was mentioning just briefly before on the fact that we have certain opportunities that we want to bring into the market in the next couple of years, starting from 2026 onwards. \nGregory Maffei: So I could just add on what Stefano said, look, you weigh, I think it's -- not unlike the sports rights question, which I'll get to in a second, you weigh, way what's the appeal of the venue and what are the economic opportunities for us. And in general, if you see us cut a very long deal, you must think -- we think it's a pretty good opportunity, both on the fan basis and on the economic basis. You see a shorter-term deal, that's open to question. And so we weigh all of those.\n On the sports rights, really the world has gotten more muddled as you suggested. In general, more people bidding, that's a positive. Also more sports, that may be a challenge. And then they issue a fragmentation and trying to find where your sport is for your fans and making it easy. We are always looking, particularly given our big sponsorship business on the trade-off between reach and what we get paid. So lots of factors there.\n Overall, on whether you're positive or negative, I would note -- I feel very positive about the sports properties we're involved with. Why? Both have incredible fan demand, have high ratings relative to what they get paid, both have passionate fan base, as I suggested, looking at ratings for where the Braves are, look at who is watching F1 and where they're willing to get up and watch it early in the morning. Both of them are not hugely monetized relative to what some of their peers are monetized.\n And I think if you look at sports rights in general, you've seen renewals on properties that did not necessarily have massive growth and still get more money. So I remain, in general, bullish on sports rights given the multiplicity of buyers and in particular, bullish on the sports rights of the properties we're involved in. \nPeter Supino: That's a great answer. And if I could pile on with one since my esteemed colleague seems to be comfortable doing the same. I wanted to ask you on the U.S. media rights for F1 ESPN renewal, it's generally understood that ESPN doesn't earn much advertising revenue on that contract. And so how do you think about the case for them paying more? \nGregory Maffei: I think the case -- and obviously, I have a little bit of bias for this. I think the case is pretty easy. You've got one of the cases where you have massive growth in fan interest and we can show statistically how much our fan interest has grown across all sorts of platforms. We have a very desirable upscale audience. We have a younger audience, a lot of factors that they would like to bring to the party, ESPN or anybody else, not to limit it to that. So I think there are a lot of reasons why we can make the case that our media rights in the U.S. are more valuable, and there will be likely a multiplicity of players, and we will likely get a better number. \nOperator: Our last question is from Jeffrey Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group. \nJeffrey Wlodarczak: I had a follow-up on Vegas. Do you anticipate after your bags experience taking a promoter role in more races, I guess, post '25. And then specifically on your decision not to let it in the 11 team, I assume -- I guess, can you provide color on that? And then, do you need a new Concorde Agreement to raise the interest fee to make more teams more palatable for the existing teams? \nGregory Maffei: Thanks, Jeff. I'll touch on the first part about promotion or co-promoting or -- well you'll see my answer. And then Stefano, maybe you will comment on the 11th team.\n So on promotion, look, I think we went in and promoted Vegas for a variety of reasons. We thought it was a unique opportunity to promote the sport. We thought it was a unique economic opportunity. We thought we would learn a lot about being a promoter and make us more credible with other promoters. I do not know that there are many opportunities out there like Vegas, where we're going to say, we absolutely want to do this. There may be opportunities in the future where we can partner with promoters, some promoters are short on capital. Some promoters are short on some skills and there are things that we could bring to the table. But in many cases, our promoters bring local knowledge, local contacts, local strengths that are very valuable. And we wouldn't necessarily be able to supplant those. So in some way to think about enhancing that and working together, I think that's the more likely path than thinking we're going to become a promoter of a bunch of raises. \nStefano Domenicali: And yes, Jeffrey, with regard to the second question, [indiscernible], for sure, is a point related to the Concorde Agreement, but is a point of a joint work that has to be done between the FIA and FOM in regard to the different kind of evaluation that we need to do. So I think that with regard to what has happened I think that the process has been followed and we presented the result in the right way.\n For the future, it's a matter of discussion, of course, with the teams with the right commercial and technical proposition that will be discussed accordingly within this year. \nGregory Maffei: All right. Thank you. I believe that was our last question. Thank you again to the listening audience for both your interest in Liberty Media and the Braves. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, if not sooner. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Stefano Domenicali",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. The 2023 season delivered incredible racing and record financial results. On the track, we want to recognize Max Verstappen and Red Bull once again on their superb performance. The rest of the grid battled until the end. The race for the second in the Constructor championship came down to the final lap of the season between Mercedes and Ferrari.\n McLaren and Aston Martin battled for fourth with McLaren intensifying the competition after a solid mid-season upgrade. Oscar Piastri at the stellar rookie season, securing 97 points included 2 podiums and a sprint race victory. And Albon fans have much to cheer about as it scored points in a number of races in 2023, helping Williams finishing 7th, showing good progress under James Vowles' leaderships.\n Across the entire 2023 season, 6 teams were represented on the podium, a reflection of the talent up and down the grid. The new regulation are increasingly benefiting competition across the field. And we believe this will continue in 2024 as the benefit of the cost cap and the technical regulation continue to mature.\n Financially, the business generated a record revenue and adjusted OIBDA for the year. Our primary revenue stream grew, benefiting from new and renewed commercial agreement. Furthermore, our Paddock Club had an incredibly strong year with hospitality and experiences revenue growing nearly 100% year-on-year. This was driven by the expansive suite of hospitality and experience offerings at Las Vegas Grand Prix as well as growth in our core Paddock Club product with the Paddock Club sellout at 10 of 19 events.\n Towards the end of the season, we had the spectacular inaugural at Las Vega Grand Prix. It was a formidable undertake in moving the project from start-up planning to raise delivery in a little more than 1 year. We are incredibly proud of the Las Vegas team, worked with multiple stakeholders in the city and within the wider on community to deliver an incredible event on and off the track.\n Total ticket sales were 316,000 for the weekend. The race was thrilling from the start to finish. Charles Leclerc passed Perez on the last lap to secure its second-place finish. The race generated fan reach in multi-platform bus and with new viewers who haven't engaged all season. The local economic benefit generated by this race is remarkable. Local casino partners had record revenue with monthly gaming revenue for cloud counting at all-time high for the month of November.\n Stepping back to the broader calendar. The 2023 season overall delivered another year of record attendance. 6 million total fans attended the race weekend, up 5% compared to the 2022 season. 12 race promoter, report a new attendance record, including 480,000 of Silverstone, 445,000 of Mobil, 405,000 in Mexico and 308,000 in Belgium. Ratio tenders remain strong through the end of the season with record crowd in Sao Paulo and Abu Dhabi. F1 fans tuned in across platforms. Last season, we work closely with our media partners and create new tools to estimate digital viewership on platforms and channels not covered by Nielsen. Our findings suggest an additional 29% of audience that are not currently covered by traditional measurements globally, representing almost 20-million on average per race-weekend. The share of digital viewership is much higher for markets like the U.S. where fans rely more on video-on-demand and streaming platforms towards rates, especially those at less convenient times for live viewing. We will keep working with Nielsen this year to incorporate more of these digital audiences into their standard reporting to provide the most accurate picture of our total audience.\n Looking at broadcast TV, cumulative TV audience for 2023 season, excluding digital viewership was 1.5 billion, and average viewership per race was approximately 70 million. In the U.S. cumulative viewership was up 4% compared to the prior year, setting a new season cumulative TV audience record. Importantly, viewership among the under 35 and female demographics grew across all of our markets.\n Our spring series continued to drive increased engagement throughout the season, which boosted TV audiences and race weekend attendances. For our sponsor, there was an over 50% decrease in average brand exposure during the spring weekend. We look forward to the 6 events in 2024.\n Formula 1 was once again the fastest-growing major sport league on social media for the fourth year in a row with the highest growth rate compared to the 11 other global sports, including NBA, NFL and Champions League. We grew to 70.5 million followers on social media, up 17% from the prior year. We continued growth, especially in the U.S., where social media followers were up 28%.\n The U.S. continues to make up our largest orders on YouTube and Tiktok social platforms. For our f1.com and F1 app platforms, over 100 million unique visitors view it over 3.1 billion pages an increase of plus 10% over 2022, consumption of highlight videos on our web and app also grew by 35%. And we made greater commercial progress in 2023, securing contracts that will underpin our continued future success.\n As of year-end, we had over $12 billion in future revenue under multiyear contracts. Our momentum continued during the off season and into 2024. Our race promotion, we are prioritizing the quality and the value of every race slot, have it reached what we believe is a comfortable near-term MAX of '24 race. Earlier this month, we announced 10 years extension with Silverstone and look forward to enhancement to the Paddock Club and other physical infrastructure upgrade of the circuit. We are excited to welcome the Madrid Grand Prix and the 10-years agreement in a brand-new circuit with both Street and non Street segment for 2026. The race as planned to invite 110,000 fans initially and has potential to expand to over 140,000 over several years.\n We also announced 5 years extension for our Japan and Brazil races. With this announcement, we have now finalized all contract negotiation for the 2025 season, and we turn our attention to optimize the risk calendar for 2026 and beyond.\n Additionally, on media right, we are delighted to have recently secured the long-term pan-regional deal across the MENA region with its biggest sport platform beIN. This is on the heels of over half of those renewal signed in 2023.\n F1 continues to benefit from the demand for live global premium contents. We are broadcasting 200 territories and have a well-diversified portfolio of media right contracts across markets, typically ranging from 3 to 5 years. As we have said, alternative bidders including digital players are increasingly showing interest in life sports and increases competition from scarce media rights. Our F1 TV product has grown significantly since launch, with active F1TV Pro subscribers growing 37% in 2023 compared to 2022. The product has been bolstered by growing in the F1 calendars, F1 sprint races, new in-depth shows all 20 on-board cameras, Team Radius and continuously adding live programming around every season plus have revamped mobile friendly designs. We believe it delivers the best-in-class product for fans and is now available in 120 countries.\n Early this year, we rolled our price increase in the cross market for the first time since product launch in 2018 to bring the pricing in line with the market rates for the qualifying of the offering.\n Turning to sponsorship. We had successful 2023 growing existing partnership while securing new brands, including leveraging new assets like Las Vegas and F1 Academy to generate incremental demand. Puma and Tommy Hilfiger recently announced as official partner of F1 academy, and we'll have designed Liberty for the season. And beauty brands like Charlotte Tilbury also became an official partner of F1 academy, marking their first ever global sport partnership. We also announced an attractive multiyear renewal with our global partner, DHL this week.\n Going forward, we are optimizing our existing inventory to minimize impact, exclusivity and value for our partners. We are also actively creating new assets to capitalize our growing demand as sponsor preference for tailored opportunity in live events. There are targets vertical where we are underexposed including financial services and betting to name a few.\n Our fund engagement activities off the track continue to gain momentum. F1 arcades first location in London recorded 400,000 digital in this first year and the second U.K. location opening in the Birmingham. The first U.S. venue will open in Boston and D.C. this year with 20 venues targeted over the next 5 years. The F1 exhibition moved from Madrid where we welcome 170,000 visitors, it opened its second location in Vienna, early this month and will continue touring iconic global city to inspire the next generation of F1 fans.\n Sustainability remains a large priority for Formula One across our organization, commercial partner and F1 teams. More detail will be provided in the coming weeks, detailing our progress towards reaching the sustainability strategy we laid out in 2019. There are a number of sustainability accomplishment to highlight from last year. To name a few, progress continuing to develop of 100% sustainable hybrid fuel that will be introduced in 2026 and will be a drop in fuel usable in road cars without modification, which provides broader global benefits to the automotive industry well beyond the impact of Formula One. The 9 European events of the 2023 season used the freight transportation by DHL on the new fleet of biofuel truck, reducing related logistic carbon emission by 83%. The first cohort of students from F1 engineering scholarship embarked on their first word placement with the F1 teams. We will welcome the third cohort this year.\n Finally, we launched F1 Academy. The old payment driver category to develop and prepare young female drivers to progress to higher levels of competition. The second season in 2024 will see F1 academy race as a support series at 7 F1 events. The F1 teams are getting more involved in support in the series.\n In 2024, all 10 will have their liveries displayed on one F1 academic car each and will each nominate a one [ team-mate ] driver to race in the series. We look forward to beginning our 2024 season next month.\n The '24 race calendar has greater regionalization and more efficiently close of races, which reduced the distance of our [ freight kit ] travel globally in support of our 2013 net 0 commitment. China returned to the calendar for the first time since 2019. The 6 Sprint series will take place in Miami, Austria, Austin, Brazil, Qatar and China. We made small changes to the format this season with Sprint-qualified on Friday. Sprint race followed by race qualifiers on Saturday and the Grand Prix as normal on Sunday.\n And much to the delight of our fans, this off-season are certainly derive exciting. Young talent secured seats for years to come with Charles Leclerc committing to the Scuderia at least through 2025, and Lando Norris remaining with McLaren's at least through 2026. Capturing headlines, Lewis Hamilton will leave Mercedes for Ferrari in 2025 after an incredible 12 seasons with the silver arrows.\n In closing, and incredibly proud of the accomplishment in 2023 and eager to begin our '24 season. We have a solid financial foundation and an attractive growing fund base. Our team is focused on deepening this fandom with optimized content and platforms, to boost engagement while capturing more fast data so we can better tailor our commercial outreach. These efforts are spread across protecting our established fan, nurturing newly acquired fans and growing into new cohorts, especially younger audiences and underserved growth markets like Asia. We will continue to invest in our sport to capitalize on our incredible momentum. Avanti Tutta, full speed ahead.\n And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Bye-bye, Ciao. Yes. Thank you, Greg. Yes, Ben. So we expect to address the renewal of the Concorde Agreement with the teams very, very shortly. We are -- our view that is basically shared with the things that basically the Concorde Agreement will need -- will not need any substantial changes this time around. So we're going to start very, very soon. We had priority to finalize before the end of the season talking about regulation and other stuff with regard to other things that need to be sold before. So now we are getting close to the time where we're going to start this discussion. Very, very shortly, as I said, Ben. It's -- I would say, I think I can come in, Greg, to answer Bryan the point of Madrid, but in '26, that is a year where there will be a lot of Grand Prix, where mainly Europe, we have different options that we can take over. Therefore, I think Madrid shows one thing that was very important for us to see that the attention F1 is there also in the old continent where everyone was thinking, no, we need to move out of Europe because there's not any more the interest, Madrid shows the opposite.\n I think '26 you're going to see something interesting. We are discussing with other promoters in Europe to do something that will be announced as soon as we close for sure. But Madrid will be a big boost because the event will be organized in a place where, as Greg was mentioning at the beginning of the speech, it will be a sort of track and a place where we'll be around the convention area to allow to give the opportunity to the fans to lead that event in an incredible way.\n But of course, so far, the focus in Spain is in Barcelona. There is a big convenient to do a Grand Prix there in the next couple of years. But with regard to the media rights, I would say there are 2 points that I think that we cannot consider light the 2024 because we just signed a very important deal with beIN for the next 10 years. And we do believe that also the [ F1+TV ] were going very, very well this year. So I think that for sure is in the year where we're going to see another growth. And of course, we are getting ready for a very important year when in the future into [indiscernible], there will be the media deal in U.S. that will be a very important deal we need to discuss in the right moment. where we're going to believe -- where we believe this will be another step in terms of our growth in that landscape. Yes. Yes. Thank you, Greg. Thank you, Stephen. I think that -- what has been amazing is in the last couple of years, the fact that our offer in terms of Paddock Club been always appreciated by our customers. we did some adjustment on pricing, not everywhere because, of course, we understand that, of course, the prices are very important and very [indiscernible] things to do, or to apply. And therefore, I think that what we have done this year that is basically already confirming an incredible request from our partners and teams and guests is try to maximize eventual potential of growth in area that there is still availability of space. And the other thing that we are doing is to see if there is another kind of offer that we can put together.\n Of course, the fact that now we are together with Quint, we're going to exploit the maximum opportunity to make sure that the Paddock Club experience can grow also in the area of entertainment because that's the other place where we are exploiting a different way the racing can be experienced for our fans.\n And with regard to the sponsorship, I think that what we have seen in the last couple of years has been an incredible growth in terms of quality and in terms of quantity of our partners. That means that we need to keep having the right attention toward this kind of revenue stream. But that means that also we need to be ready to increase our possibilities to having the right offer in terms of new opportunity. I think that one that is pretty clear that we are able to optimize what we have done already last year in a way, has been the digital possibilities to differentiate from area to area, this different option for our partners.\n On the other side, of course, there are 2 main areas where we believe there is potential to do, but we need to have the right competencies, and we need to find the right partners consider the complexity. That is one area that's the gambling. And the other area is on the financial services that has been already taking a big step last year with Amex, but I think there is a huge opportunity that we can take into the future. And that's really where I believe in all terms that the potential to even grow is still there and will be there. Well, Peter, thank you for -- with regard to the first question. I think, as always, while we take the decision with regard to the renewal, there are a lot of [ balance ] that we need to consider. First of all, of course, the financial aspect is relevant, no doubt. And the fact that we are able to stabilize with certain promoters, which we believe represent an incredible opportunities in terms of our stability on this market is a relevant element to consider. The fact that you have seen in the last couple of years that we were able to ratify incredible agreement with certain promoter means that there is, from one side, of course, a very interesting financial package. But on the other side, an incredible opportunity to develop our business in areas that are on top of the one that is related to the promotional fee. And that's really our approach.\n It is clear that if you see the development of our regionalization of the calendar, we have moved out from being a European-centric to a very worldwide basic development that needs to be kept into the future. I just want to comfort the fact that we believe 24 races is the right number. And I think that we're going to play in the right way I was mentioning just briefly before on the fact that we have certain opportunities that we want to bring into the market in the next couple of years, starting from 2026 onwards. And yes, Jeffrey, with regard to the second question, [indiscernible], for sure, is a point related to the Concorde Agreement, but is a point of a joint work that has to be done between the FIA and FOM in regard to the different kind of evaluation that we need to do. So I think that with regard to what has happened I think that the process has been followed and we presented the result in the right way.\n For the future, it's a matter of discussion, of course, with the teams with the right commercial and technical proposition that will be discussed accordingly within this year."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Gregory Maffei",
            "content": "Thank you, Shane, and good morning to all. Today speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali, and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling.\n Also during the Q&A, we will answer any questions related to Atlanta Braves Holdings and Braves management will be available too.\n So let me begin with Liberty SiriusXM. The LSXM and Sirius transaction is on schedule. We filed the preliminary proxy on the first -- January 30 rather. We still expect to close by early Q3 and the NAV discount, which was about 42% prior to announcement is now closed to about 25% as we had hoped, and we expect it will continue to close.\n Looking at SiriusXM itself, the strong operating and financial performance that it had in 2023 showed the durability of the business, [ sub-pay ] net adds were up in the second half, as expected, boosted by streaming, the strong margins and free cash flow generation remained largely through cost discipline. Importantly, they rebuilt their tech stack and relaunched their app in the fourth quarter. And we're beginning to show positive early results from that with better personalization, promising engagement and improved service quality. We believe these initiatives as well as the incremental content they added will continue to drive long-term growth.\n Looking at the 2024 priorities of the business: first, increasing 360L adoption and boosting conversion and retention, continuing to deliver engaging content. Recently, they signed the quite popular SmartLess podcast with Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes. We do expect self-pay net add improvement throughout the year. And there is a focus on maintaining stable EBITDA margins and free cash flow. I look forward to remaining involved personally in the next evolution of the business as Chairman and a shareholder. \n Turning to Formula One Group. It was an amazing 2023 at F1, we saw double-digit growth across all revenue streams and adjusted OIBDA up 22%. We see a strong commercial start to the season. Four REITs promotion renewals, including Silverstone, a 10-year deal with venue upgrades in our important heritage market and a new race in Madrid beginning in 2026, which will be a partial street race with convenient fan access.\n We do see continued growth in fandom. Recently, this week, F1 joined Threads and 2.8 million followers were on board of the platform after half a day of use. We closed the Quint acquisition in January, as we previously noted, and it's that growing partnership opportunities from Quint with F1, LPGP and other sports properties, including the Kentucky Derby and the NBA All-Star game. \n Let me turn to a minute to Vegas. It was an incredible race. We were fortunate to have such a great outcome with a record 181 overtakes and the podium came down to the final lap. It was a great result for Formula One. We created new commercial opportunities and generated fantastic global buzz. A high percentage of the first time F1 attendees and massive audiences tuning into this race. It drew marquee brands to F1, for example, American Express, T-Mobile, Moet Hennessy, Google. And we think these brands and the marquee aspects that they are joining Vegas will continue to help us in 2024 and beyond.\n It was also a hugely success for the local community. The total economic impact of the race was estimated at $1.2 billion, and the average visitor spent 3.6x of what a typical visitor spends for a non-F1 event.\n We look forward to building on the success of LVGP in 2024. For example, we're going to increase the GA and expand the product offerings at various price points. We're going to optimize the cost structure. The year-round commercialization efforts at Grand Prix Plaza are developing, but we will expect only a modest contribution from those in 2024. Corporate events at that site kicked off around the Super Bowl this year.\n In summary, the Vegas race exceeded our expectations on many levels, even though year 1 costs came in higher than we had anticipated. We do not intend to close -- disclose rate specifics on this race consistent with our practice across all races. I would note that the -- we are kicking off F1 season with testing in Bahrain, which occurred and look forward to the first race in Bahrain this weekend.\n Turning to Live Nation. 2023 was the biggest year ever, where they were all-time highs for attendance, ticket sales and sponsorship, concert attendance grew 20% with 145 million fans. Global demand for concerts continues to grow. The top 50 tours did 50% more international acts in 2023. We have an incredible pipeline for 2024 with no sign of consumer slowdown. We're seeing strong demand across all price points. For example, large venue shows are up double digits, and 65% of full year large venue shows are already booked versus only 50% last year at this time. The number of shows at amphitheaters and other operated venues will also increase in 2024.\n Let me turn to the Braves. Obviously, there was incredible team performance in 2023, so much to highlight. I'd [indiscernible] one, the 947 runs scored was the first in MLB, in a tied MLB home run record as well for the team. The Braves also experienced great financial growth for the year. Baseball revenue was up 9%. We see continued success results in higher payments under MLB's revenue sharing plan. So that is the one negative about our continued revenue growth. But I'd also note the battery revenue was up 10% and our adjusted OIBDA was up 11%.\n We clearly benefit from the strengths of the Braves' territory. In a recent study YouGov, the Braves had 8.4 million fans in the South region, #1 in MLB, and over 65% of all other local sports team fans support the Braves, which is the highest crossover of any fandom in Atlanta.\n We've seen encouraging early season trades, including for 7x All-Star Chris Sale and Outfielder, Jared Kelenic. We are well positioned for future commercial and on-field success. For example, 2024 season tickets are already sold out and there is a 16,000-person wait list. We are looking forward with beta [indiscernible] to the home opener against the DBacks on April 5.\n And with that, let me turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results. Thank you, Stefano, and thank you, Brian. To the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and the Atlanta Braves Holdings. And with that, operator, I'd like to open the line for questions. Ben, I'm going to touch on the optimizing the cost structure, then let Renee add to it. And on the Concorde Agreement, I'll let Stefano cover where we stand. So on the optimizing cost structure, look, because we moved with real speed to try and get Las Vegas up in a record time. Many things were done to accommodate a great fan experience and make sure we got done on time. And with the benefit of more time, there are many things we can optimize. There, for example, there is a temporary structure a bridge that was put over one of the roads that will become -- but it was our cost that will not be reincurred there was work that was done around ensuring great security. And I think we'll learn how to do that in a more cost-effective manner. But I'll let Renee touch on other items to see things we might be able to say about. Some of that will be -- I think most of that will be a direct cost. Some of that will be in G&A, but mostly in direct. Do you agree Brian? Stefano, do you want to touch on the Concorde Agreement? So I'll touch on the first one. We received initial comments from the SEC on the proxy. I think those were relatively light credit, the legal and accounting teams for answering those or having a proxy that was clear and transparent, and we'll be able to answer those relatively quickly. So that we'll need to be cleared the final proxy by the SEC before we can go forward with a vote at the Liberty-Sirius level. We also have a parallel process with the FCC that I think is relatively pro forma, we do not believe that will be the long pole in the tent. So we're still targeting early third quarter, some chance we may be able to get it done quicker, but we're trying to manage your expectations and ours. Next question, whats the next part of the question. [indiscernible] Circa 2 months. I'll let Renee touch on the Vegas partners. So I think Quint has an arm's length deal existing prior to our purchase with F1 and we would expect that arm's length deal to continue, but the Quint results are part of the F1 tracking stock, not part of F1. And that would likely be the case for any other acquisitions. Can't say absolutely because it would depend on the company, but likely that would be outside the F1 group or the F1 operating statement we shared with the teams.\n We continue to weigh opportunities like Vegas. Obviously, we look at lots of sporting properties. We think we have something to bring to the sporting world based on what we have been able to achieve at F1, and we think there are some things that we could bring forward to other sports properties, but we're judicious in that and people approach us because of those skills.\n Certainly, looking at continued share repurchase is an alternative as well, and we weigh third-party alternatives that might arise with that. Derek, do you want to touch on that? So touching on LVGP, I can say that LVGP was a positive contributor to F1's earnings for 2023. And with the cost optimization measures we've discussed and frankly, improved interest in the race and improved potential price points, I think we will see a greater contribution in 2024, I think that's where we'll leave that.\n On MLB, I think I'm reluctant to comment. You've seen some of the public actions that MLB has -- was against some of the Diamond proposed restructurings. But other than that, I think we'd leave it alone other than Derek, if you want anything. Stefano, do you want to start on hospitality? So I could just add on what Stefano said, look, you weigh, I think it's -- not unlike the sports rights question, which I'll get to in a second, you weigh, way what's the appeal of the venue and what are the economic opportunities for us. And in general, if you see us cut a very long deal, you must think -- we think it's a pretty good opportunity, both on the fan basis and on the economic basis. You see a shorter-term deal, that's open to question. And so we weigh all of those.\n On the sports rights, really the world has gotten more muddled as you suggested. In general, more people bidding, that's a positive. Also more sports, that may be a challenge. And then they issue a fragmentation and trying to find where your sport is for your fans and making it easy. We are always looking, particularly given our big sponsorship business on the trade-off between reach and what we get paid. So lots of factors there.\n Overall, on whether you're positive or negative, I would note -- I feel very positive about the sports properties we're involved with. Why? Both have incredible fan demand, have high ratings relative to what they get paid, both have passionate fan base, as I suggested, looking at ratings for where the Braves are, look at who is watching F1 and where they're willing to get up and watch it early in the morning. Both of them are not hugely monetized relative to what some of their peers are monetized.\n And I think if you look at sports rights in general, you've seen renewals on properties that did not necessarily have massive growth and still get more money. So I remain, in general, bullish on sports rights given the multiplicity of buyers and in particular, bullish on the sports rights of the properties we're involved in. I think the case -- and obviously, I have a little bit of bias for this. I think the case is pretty easy. You've got one of the cases where you have massive growth in fan interest and we can show statistically how much our fan interest has grown across all sorts of platforms. We have a very desirable upscale audience. We have a younger audience, a lot of factors that they would like to bring to the party, ESPN or anybody else, not to limit it to that. So I think there are a lot of reasons why we can make the case that our media rights in the U.S. are more valuable, and there will be likely a multiplicity of players, and we will likely get a better number. Thanks, Jeff. I'll touch on the first part about promotion or co-promoting or -- well you'll see my answer. And then Stefano, maybe you will comment on the 11th team.\n So on promotion, look, I think we went in and promoted Vegas for a variety of reasons. We thought it was a unique opportunity to promote the sport. We thought it was a unique economic opportunity. We thought we would learn a lot about being a promoter and make us more credible with other promoters. I do not know that there are many opportunities out there like Vegas, where we're going to say, we absolutely want to do this. There may be opportunities in the future where we can partner with promoters, some promoters are short on capital. Some promoters are short on some skills and there are things that we could bring to the table. But in many cases, our promoters bring local knowledge, local contacts, local strengths that are very valuable. And we wouldn't necessarily be able to supplant those. So in some way to think about enhancing that and working together, I think that's the more likely path than thinking we're going to become a promoter of a bunch of raises. All right. Thank you. I believe that was our last question. Thank you again to the listening audience for both your interest in Liberty Media and the Braves. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, if not sooner."

            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. At year-end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $90 million. This excludes $216 million of cash held directly at SiriusXM. During the quarter, Liberty SiriusXM repaid the remaining $199 million outstanding principal of its $1.375 basket convertible notes using cash on hand. Also during Q4, Liberty SiriusXM paid down $80 million under the margin loan, $61 million of which was from the monetization of its 1.8 million batter K shares.\n At quarter end, there's $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM margin loan. As of February 27, the value of our SiriusXM stock was $15 billion. We have $1.3 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $11.1 billion, which includes $9.3 billion of debt held directly at SiriusXM.\n Turning to the Formula One Group. At quarter end, Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $1.4 billion, which includes $1 billion of cash held directly at Formula One.\n Now the Quint acquisition closed in January. Which will be a use of Formula One Group cash. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $2.9 billion, which includes $2.5 billion of debt at Formula One, leaving $533 million at the corporate level. And F1's $500 million revolver remains undrawn and leverage at the end of the year was 1.9x.\n As we've said in the past, the F1 business is best annualized on an annual basis. So we'll only be speaking to full year results. Total revenue grew 25% in 2023 with double-digit growth across all primary revenue streams. Year-over-year revenue increases include the significant revenue generation from self-promoting the Las Vegas Grand Prix, including ticketing revenue, which is included in race promotion, sponsorship revenue, which is recognized accordingly. And hospitality and experience income, which is included in other F1 revenue.\n Rates promotion revenue also benefited from the mix of events held compared to 2022 with 2 additional flyaway races this year with Qatar and Las Vegas versus Imola in France in the prior year. And sponsorship and media rights revenue grew due to increased fees under new and renewed commercial agreements.\n Other F1 revenue grew 42% or $196 million, driven by hospitality and experiences, largely attributed to the Las Vegas Grand Prix. As well as growth in the Paddock Club and other events, partially offset by reduced freight income due to easing of freight cost inflation. Team payments as a percent of pre-team adjusted OIBDA as reported, was 63% in 2023, down from 66% in 2022. Other costs of F1 revenue increased from 23% of total revenue in the prior year to 32% of total revenue this year, primarily driven by promoting, organizing and delivering the Las Vegas Grand Prix. As well as increased cost of servicing additional hospitality offerings.\n SG&A at 7% of total revenue was in line with historic averages. Corporate and other adjusted OIBDA was a loss of $39 million in 2023, which includes $15 million of revenue for use of the pit building during the Las Vegas race weekend. Formula One incurs a fixed monthly rent payment that approximates depreciation, plus a variable rent component during the race weekend. Note that the fixed rent payment in 2023 reflects only a portion of the year as the building wasn't occupied until closer to the race weekend.\n Corporate level expense at Formula One Group was also elevated due to the split-off and reclassification costs. In 2024, Formula One Group Corporate and other adjusted OIBDA will benefit from the Quint acquisition that closed in January as well as a full year of the rent payment.\n Looking to 2024, F1 will host 24 races with the return of China and Imola compared to 22 races in this past year. Quickly looking at a few cash items. F1 estimates its cash tax rate in '24 to be a high single-digit percent of F1 adjusted OIBDA, increasing towards low double digits in future years as a result of the U.K. tax rate increase.\n Total CapEx incurred at the Formula One Group in 2023 was $426 million, approximately $390 million of which related to the development of LVGP, with the majority incurred at the Formula One Group corporate level.\n At the Liberty Live Group, there's attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $418 million, which includes ETF assets. There's $400 million of undrawn margin loan capacity related to our Live Nation margin loan. And as of February 27, value of the Live Nation stock was $6.5 billion. We have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings.\n Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end and then quickly looking at the Braves. The Braves business is also best analyzed on an annual basis due to fluctuations in game count.\n Baseball revenue increased 9% in 2023, primarily due to increased ticket demand and attendance, leading to a 14% growth in baseball event revenue and 8% growth in retail and licensing revenue. Other baseball revenue declined primarily due to fewer concerts held compared to the prior year. The battery had another great year with mixed-use revenue increasing 10%.\n Total adjusted OIBDA decreased for the year, primarily due to increased player payroll expense as Braves management continues to invest in its on-field success, including a number of trades and accelerated player signings in December of 2023. Adjusted OIBDA for the mixed-use development increased 11% in 2023. And just a reminder that SG&A was elevated for the full year due to the split-off costs. We would anticipate a $10 million to $15 million annual run rate for corporate overhead at the Atlanta Braves Holdings.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One. I would think most of them -- yes, most would be in the operating costs yes. And then last, Ben, on the CapEx. We're not going to disclose any specific numbers, but we would expect it to start to trend back to what our normal rate was in the past, specifically on LVGP. The team might evaluate different opportunities where you could put stuff on the balance sheet versus having it as rentals and OpEx. So those opportunities might arise, but overall, we wouldn't expect it to be really material. Yes. And then, Bryan, on Quint, we're not going to give the 2024 numbers, but what we would say is that the acquisition should be accretive to the Formula One Group overall. So you can kind of do the math from there. It's not overly material to the Formula One business, but it should be accretive going forward. And then on the F1 operating leverage, to your point, it primarily is the team fees. There's lots of ins and outs, but there's no material onetime items."

            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Greg. So to Greg's point, we really did lean in on transportation planning and security. No one knew just how traffic would flow. We were hoping for the best planning for the worst. And it did turn out to be significantly better than anyone feared. That will hopefully allow us this year to start looking for areas that we can cut back in. We also have the benefit in year 2 of having a playbook.\n Again, we had to lean in on fan experience and other events that will allow us to create that inaugural race weekend that we needed for year 1. But this year, we are looking very closely at every line item on the budget to see where can we maximize the fan experience and ensure safety while also looking to really cut back on some of those costs. Yes. Thanks for the question. So we will be going on sale pretty soon. And when we go and sell, you'll see that we have a significantly higher number of general admission. We're actually creating a brand-new general admission only zone, which will have single-day tickets and will be at the lowest price point that you will have seen for the Las Vegas Grand Prix. This is largely driven to accommodate the lower end properties and also to bring downtown into the mix. We are also working in partnership with the LVCVA to actually engage downtown, different types of activations, potentially watch parties, but really to spread this benefit of what was an incredible weekend throughout the entirety of the rally."

            "content": "Sure. Thanks for your question. We're watching that closely. And what we see is the bankruptcy presentation that was made is still being followed. Diamond Sports seems to have a plan for emerging from bankruptcy. As you've probably read, we're watching and seeing that just like you are. For our purposes, we're still getting full payment and operating the agreement as normal. So at this point in time, nothing is deviating from that. We don't expect that, especially as they've laid out per their plan. No. The only other thing I might say, just a point of clarification, if you're not aware, the current agreement with Diamond does not include streaming rights. So those streaming rights continue to be held at the league level. That's not necessarily the case for all teams, but in our case, it is. And so -- we're obviously differential to what the league is going to do as a whole, but right now, our streaming remains at the league-wide level."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference will be recorded November 3. I would now like to turn the call over to Shane Kleinstein, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nShane Kleinstein: Thank you. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially, due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed by Liberty Media with the SEC and the most recent Form 10-Q and registration statement on Form S-1 filed by Atlanta Braves Holdings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call, and Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media or Atlanta Braves Holdings expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Media, SiriusXM and Atlanta Braves Holdings, including adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media, SiriusXM and Atlanta Braves Holdings Schedules one through three can be found at the end of the earnings press release issued today, which are available on Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Shane, and good morning to all. Today, speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali; and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. Also during Q&A, we will be available to answer questions related to the Atlanta Braves Holdings and the Braves management will be available as well. So beginning with Liberty SiriusXM. We did propose a combination of LSXM and SIRI. The goal is to rationalize the dual corporate structure, create a single share class and benefit both groups of shareholders. We believe such a combination would lead to enhanced trading dynamics in new Sirius with increased liquidity, less technical pressure, for example, a small short interest, and a higher likelihood of future index inclusion. We will provide updates on this potential transaction only if and when an agreement is reached. So let me turn to Sirius itself. Q3 results demonstrate what management had put forward during the year that there would be continuous improvement throughout the year, and we saw sequential improvements in self-pay net adds, and we expect a slightly positive back half of the year. EBITDA grew 4% versus the prior year and 6% sequentially, and there were $40 million of cost savings that were realized during the third quarter. The dividend was raised 10%. The Board approved that, showing continued confidence in Sirius' cash flow generation capabilities. Sirius also announced an expanded partnership with Ford to make SiriusXM a standard feature in all traditional F1s, beginning with the 2024 model year. That's important because the Ford F-150 has been the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for over four years. Management does remain focused on its strategic objectives, supported by the significant EBITDA and free cash flow generation. You will see a new streaming experience and branded platform announced next Wednesday, the day before our Analyst Day by the Sirius management team at their own event, and we believe this new experience will be able to drive engagement and enhance subscriber acquisition and retention. Turning now to the Formula One Group. We announced in September our planned acquisition of Quint. Quint is a provider of hospitality inventory, and they sell unique experiences to F1, the NBA, for the NBA All-Star game, the Kentucky Derby and other sporting events. We believe this merger or this purchase will announce and enable us an enhanced partnership with F1 and lead us to expand to other live sporting events. Quint is a high-growth asset with EBITDA and cash flow positive capabilities and currently already are both, but we'll expect will grow more over time. Turning to other things at F1. During the quarter, in October, we repriced the $1.7 billion of our F1 term loan B, and we tightened the spread there from 300 basis points to 225 basis points. At F1 itself, we see surge in popularity and it continues. We've had continued sell-outs in the grandstands in the Paddock Club. We've seen growth in engagement and awareness across social platforms, TV, digital platforms like F1T, social consumer media and others. You continue to see new interest in Formula One. For example, we've seen new investors, high-profile investors joined at Alpine, Rory McIlroy, Anthony Joshua and Patrick Mahomes, and that follows Ryan Reynolds investment in June. This morning, at F1, we also announced a 5-year extension of our race in Brazil through 2030. We are excited for the inaugural Vegas race in just under two weeks begin. The Pit Building is ready. We received the certificate of occupancy to operate for the race. This will be the largest Pit Building on the F1 calendar. The rooftop deck and wraparound balcony will provide 360-degree views of the track. The temporary structure is in place. The bridges are complete. We are ready to go. This event will offer an unparalleled fan experience. It's going to kick off with an All-Star line-up for the opening ceremony Wednesday before the race, which will air on ESPN2. To name a few, they'll be Keith Urban, Andra Day, J Balvin, will.i.am, Journey and others. We'll also have Netflix hosting its first ever live sporting event the Netflix Cup. This will be a golf tournament with F1 drivers and PGA Tour players, and it will stream on Netflix on the 14th of November at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The Vegas race is generating record-breaking sponsorship levels, with new marquee brands, and these examples include Moet Hennessy, Timo and Google Chrome. But more importantly, we think the biggest experience will create commercial opportunities beyond the race itself and accrue to the broader F1 ecosystem. The AmEx partnership we recently announced is a great example, and there are more to come. We did incur significant expense in launching year one in Vegas, and that included extra provisions for safety, security and traffic planning, which was required by local regulators. And we had several nonrecurring items, for example, our first year only opening ceremony, as I mentioned, and the design and launch of our multipurpose app and creation of a fan database. We remain highly confident and increased efficiency, to operate there on our growing profitability in years two and beyond, and we remain bullish on the broader value creation at LVGP that, far outweighs the increased investment in start-up costs. Let me turn now to Liberty Live Group, where we issued new $1.15 billion of 2.375% [LVY] Exchangeable in September, $918 million of those proceeds were used to repurchase 93% of our existing LVY exchangeable. Looking at the Live Nation itself, another record quarter announced. Looking year-to-date, they've sold 140 million tickets versus 121 million for the full 2022. Revenue was up 36%, AOI was up 33%. They saw strength in all markets, venues and price points with international leading the way. Year-to-date, concert fans are up 21%, with international fans up 34%. Per fan profitability is up double-digits globally at operated and owned theatres and clubs, and sponsorship has been a tremendous win with a new large deal with MasterCard, driven again by growth in the international concerts platform. Live sees continuing tailwinds into 2024 and beyond. Consumer wallets are continuing to be spent on live experiences. We see untapped potential in the continuing globalization of lives business, and large venues are showing a pipeline and sponsorship commitments, which are up double-digits. Lastly, looking at the Braves. It was an incredible season on field and off the field, even if the playoff run was obviously more disappointing and ended earlier than we had hoped. We finished with the best record in Major League Baseball, 104 wins against 58 losses. 3.2 million tickets were sold, a new record for Truist Park. We won our sixth straight National League title. The Braves have won the most division titles of any team in baseball since the institution of Divisional Play in 1969. Braves had strong financial performance. Baseball revenue was up 11% year-to-date, from increased ticket demand and attendance, and the Battery continue to benefit from increased traffic and rent growth, with adjusted OIBDA at the mixed-use up 15% in the nine months, versus the prior year. And with that, let me turn it over to Brian for some more on our financial results.\nBrian Wendling: Thank you, Greg, and good morning. My remarks this morning when I'm talking about balance sheet figures, we'll be comparing 9/30 to the adjusted 6/30 balances that are adjusted for the split-off that was completed on July 18, and the reclassification of our tracking stocks that, was completed on August 3, as you'll see noted in the release. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $339 million. Excluding $53 million of cash held at SiriusXM and including the Battery stake held at LSXM that's valued at $65 million as of 9/30. We expect these shares will be exchanged with third-party lenders to paydown debt in the near term. There's also $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level, related to our SiriusXM margin loan. As of November 2, the value of the SiriusXM stock, was $14.9 billion. We have $1.4 billion in principal amount of debt, against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt, is $11.5 billion, which includes $9.4 billion of debt, at SiriusXM. Subsequent to quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM retired, the remaining $199 million outstanding face value, of the 1.375 basket convertible notes. Turning to the Formula One Group. At quarter end, Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $1.5 billion. This includes $947 million of cash at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $2.9 billion, which includes $2.4 billion of debt at F1, leaving $500 million at the corporate level. F1's $500 million revolver is undrawn, and their leverage at quarter end was 2.2 times. And as Greg mentioned, the F1 repriced its term loan B in October, resulting in 75 basis points of margin compression to 225 basis points. The F1 business is best analyzed on an annual basis, given its variability in the year-over-year rate calendar. With that said, though, I will make a few brief remarks on the quarterly results. During the quarter, F1 recognized a higher proportion of season-based income, due to eight out of 22 races occurring during this quarter, compared to seven out of 22 in last year. The mix of races has also benefited our financial results in the third quarter, with two flyaway races Singapore and Japan taking place this year, versus France in the prior year period. Formula One grew OIBDA in the quarter in line, with revenue growth. We realized leverage on fee payments, during the quarter while also making incremental investments and growth initiatives that, were lower or not incurred in the prior year period, like the Vegas race and F1 Academy. Our team payments, are best viewed on a year-to-date basis and represented 64.6% of pre-team OIBDA, for the first nine months. I will note that Q2 and Q3 tend to have higher percent payout ratios, based on the greater mix of European races in these two quarters. Reminder that other costs of F1 revenue and SG&A, are best viewed as a percent of total revenue. Other costs at F1 revenue for the quarter, was 21% of total revenue. Note that the LVGP-related revenues and other cost of sales will largely be recognized in the fourth quarter when the race occurs. On SG&A, the third quarter included $8 million of costs, related to LVGP. Non-Vegas, as Greg said, the Paddock building is ready. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we incurred approximately $280 million of CapEx, related to the Pit building structure and track preparation. The majority of the CapEx spend has and will be incurred at the corporate level, related to the Pit building as the land and buildings sit within F1 - Formula One Group, sorry, separate from the Formula One OPCO. Track-related CapEx has and will be incurred at the F1-OPCO level. At the Liberty Live Group, there's attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $417 million, which includes the ETF assets. There's also $400 million of undrawn margin loan capacity, related to our Live Nation margin loan. As of November 2, the value of our Live Nation stock was $5.7 billion. We have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. And during the quarter, we raised 1.15 billion of new 2.375 Live Nation exchangeable bonds. Portion of these proceeds were used to repurchase approximately 93% of our outstanding 0.5% Live Nation exchangeable bonds for $918 million. There's 62 million remaining outstanding on the 0.5% bonds, which have a September '24, put call date that we expect, to settle with the remaining proceeds from the recent issuance. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. And turning briefly to the Atlanta Braves. Revenue growth in the quarter primarily reflects increased attendance, at regular season games and growth in related revenues, including ticket and concession revenue, which more than offset the impact of one less home game in the current period. Battery mixed-use revenue grew, due to increased rental income, from existing and new tenants, and then baseball operating costs grew in the third quarter, primarily due to increased player payroll and higher minor league expenses. SG&A was also elevated in the third quarter, driven by costs related to the split-off. And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One.\nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Brian. Good morning. We are coming to the end of an action-pack triple header in the Americas, from Austin to Mexico City and this weekend to Brazil. Max Verstappen Red Bull have had an incredible season winning their second consecutive Constructor Championship and second, third consecutive title. While the Championship has been secured for several races, the other teams are still competing firstly, with tight battles all the way down the field at every event. We have had six different teams represented on the podium season to-date. McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari have gained strength throughout the season evidenced in Austin with Lando's excellent start and excitement around the various type strategy implemented. Santa Lewis is getting closer Max in Austin and Mexico and Ford, Ferrari paused in the 6 races. We have more battles left to witness for the remainder of the season, even with the number of teams shifting focus to their 2024 forecast. With gaps in performance appearing to be closing over recent events, we hope for a real challenge for Max next year. Our business is in a position of strength. Fun engagement is high, commercial interest is strong. The teams have sustainably improved their financial health, generating their own incremental sponsorship, which benefit our entire F1 ecosystem. And we have a number of brand expansion initiatives in the works, including the much anticipated Apple TV starting Brad Pitt. I will have more to share on our strategy to capitalize on this momentum at Liberty's Investor Day next week. Braves attendance in 2023 continues to sell out. The highlight of the third quarter was the record 480,000 weekend attendance at Silverstone for the British Grand Prix, the highest recorded in any event in recent decades. Other highlights, so the Japanese Grand Prix welcome total weekend attendance of 202,000 to the highest level since 2006. The Netherlands sold out a 305,000 fans. Singapore sold out a 260,000 and last weekend in Mexico, saw another record with 400,000 attending. These are massive crowds for the country where we race. As we've discussed, our fans are increasing in excess in F1 content across multiple media platforms, including leaner, digital and social. We are building a richer and more varied content across median to satisfy the various types of fans. All in a TV, global audiences averaged approximately 70 million. Growth market has seen solid year-over-year growth viewership, including Spain, Australia, Mexico as well as the U.S., where we have also had particularly strong growth in F1 TV subs. We've seen growth on digital video viewership with the F1 YouTube channel reaching almost 10 million subscribers, plus 14% year-over-year. Across our social media channels, F1 reached 67.6 million followers as of Q3, up 26% year-over-year. TikTok is now fastest-growing platform on social media, growing existing and new fans alike. Massive audience gravitate to both racing and lifestyle content across our social channels. EI launched their F1 '23 game in June, and the U.S. is now the biggest market for our game, surpassing the U.K. for the first time. According to OpenCritic, the game continues to be the highest-rated annualized sporting game franchise globally. F1 continues to advance our approach to audience measurement as consumer behaviors evolve. We aim to better capture our wider viewership and engagement for the future as we continue to grow these touch points. Turning to recent updates on our commercial agreement. On race promotion, we look forward to the '24 race championship calendar next year. We recently renewed our agreement in Belgium for an additional year in 2025, after record year race attendance of 380,000 this season. The promoter has invested in its capacity increases, and more variety entertainment for fans in recent years, which has benefited their attendance figures. On Media right, we entered into a strategic partnership with the Viaplay in the Netherlands that will allow their customer to access F1 TV Pro as part of their Viaplay subscription, providing fans with incremental commentary, camera angles, radio communication and more. Our agreement with RTBF in the Netherlands and Belgium were also new for multiple seasons. This past week, we have announced an expansion of our agreement with DAZN to broadcast F1 in Spain in an attractive deal until the end of 2026, a market with strong growth in TV viewership this season. TV Pro and access subscribers are continuing to grow and provide a tailwind to our Media right revenue. On sponsorship, our recently announced new multiyear regional partnership with American Express, welcome them as official payment partner for the F1 in the Americas and for Las Vegas Grand Prix. Card members will have special benefits and access across F1 races in the Americas, including presale tickets and curated on-site benefits. We were also thrilled to renew our agreement with Pirelli and Liqui Moly. Pirelli will remain F1 global partner until 2027, securing their place as long-standing supply to Formula One. Liqui Moly will also continue as an official partner under a multiyear renewal. Overall, demand and interest from sponsors continue to be strong, given the growth in our brand and the opportunity to align with F1 sustainability initiatives. We continue to have meaningful success in securing new and renewed sponsors, and we are confident in our coming pipeline. All eyes are now on Las Vegas as we countdown to the Grand Prix weekend. While the race is set, we will be a spectacle. It has also generated exciting noise that benefits the entire F1 ecosystem through the increased commercial interest, fan awareness and broader brand value. The fan experience will be unparalleled. The team has continued to invest in creative offering for its fans, including announcing with the Wynn Grid Club, a first of its kind membership program that will debut in Las Vegas Grand Prix. The program is designed for the F1 enthusiasts and will provide members with an unparalleled hospitality experience, including exclusive access to location within the Pit building, bespoken services and incredible cuisine. Members will also enjoy year-round benefits to additional F1 races services through all over Wynn properties. As part of our partnership with the brand new Sphere, we will be taking over the exosphere from Wednesday to Sunday or race we can to display a combination of unique partners, F1 and Las Vegas Grand Prix content. The team in Las Vegas, led by Renee Wilm, has real secured a number of new partnership in addition to the previously mentioned Americas fresh deal. With the agreements announced this quarter, the Las Vegas Grand Prix has now secured over 20 partnerships to-date for the marquee event. We are committed to raising Las Vegas in the long-term. The total local economical benefit of the Grand Prix, this year is expected to reach over $1.2 billion, which includes the direct spend from F1, to put on the race, the incremental spend by visitor and the impact of local supplier and businesses. In addition, the Las Vegas Grand Prix will generate estimated $25 million that will be allocated to K-12 public school and is developed in a STEM program that will be implemented in the Cloud County school district in the coming years. Perhaps a future F1 engineer will be born out of this. Finally, F1 continues to progress our sustainability and diversity and inclusion efforts. F1 Academy completed its debut season in Austin last month. Congratulations to Marta Garcia on the victory. And as we promised, she has now secured a full founded seat with PREMA Racing in the FRECA Series underlining our determination to ensure the best in the Academy series move upwards to the system. The F1 Academy final was broadcasted live in over 100 territories, marking a significant extension of coverage. This demonstrates the support of our broadcast partners and their commitment in bringing F1 Academy to both existing and new generation F1 fan, who can be inspired by this incredible racing talent. Additionally, our ambition effort in the development of 100% advanced sustainable fuel advancing well. Just last week, our partner, Aramco, announced that they will start operating 2 plus to produce synthetic fuels by 2025. Our partnership with DHL to use biofuel truck across the European of the season was highly successful. They reduced emission by an average of 83%, compared to the diesel-driven trucks. The use of biofuel will continue into 2024 and beyond. And we are excited about the insight we are gaining this year as we're exploring further opportunity in the connection with DHL. We have only three races left in the record-breaking season. I want to thank our F1 family, FIA, fans, teams, partners and shareholders to all of their support and enthusiasm decision. Our own track excitement isn't done yet. With the battle of constructor standing outside of first place likely to conduct to the last round of racing, we hope you tune into Brazil this weekend before we make our way to the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix and then wrap the season in Abu Dubai. I look forward to providing additional updates at Liberty's Investor Day next week [Avanti Tutta] full speed ahead. And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Ciao.\nGreg Maffei: Ciao, Stefano, and thank you, Stefano and Brian. Some of you may have seen our release that Albert Rosenthaler is retiring after 20 years at Liberty. Many of you know who Albert is and how much value he has added for our shareholders. Most recently, he served as Chief Corporate Development Officer, previously he was Head of Tax. He never really relinquished that as we know. Fortunately, he will remain a Senior Advisor. We do have a deep bench of talent, both on the corporate development and tax teams and will continue to grow in those areas. But I'm pleased that they, Albert, will work with them and me to drive future investment opportunities and our tax strategies. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Investor Day on Thursday, November 9 in New York. Additional information is available on our website. John Malone and I will be hosting our Annual Q&A session. If you would like to submit questions in advance, you can email investorday@libertymedia.com. None of the questions can ask if they will be about comedy. We do appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and the Atlanta Braves Holdings. And with that, operator, we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thanks for question. On Formula One payments or team payments year-to-date, if we look at the implied figure for the full year, I think it's down a bit relative to where it was in August. Greg, you noted significant launch in nonrecurring costs related to Vegas. So I wanted to see if you've adjusted your expectation for the economics of the race in the first year?\nGreg Maffei: I'm going to comment a little on Vegas and then I'll let Brian reiterate some of his comments or hopefully, clarity about how those payouts - team payouts can be misleading as looked at just on a quarterly basis. On the first point, yes, I think Vegas is proving to be a bigger spectacle and more impactful than we had anticipated, but there also have proven to be initial start-up costs. I outlined some of them increased security, onetime things like the open day ceremony, but there were other ones like consultants that help us set it up, permitting costs that were unusual and the like. So there are a bunch of initial costs that are probably higher than we had originally estimated. I remain very bullish. We remain very bullish on, as I said, the impact of Formula One overall by Las Vegas and the potential for this race be a profitable exercise itself.\nBrian Wendling: Yes. And just year-to-date, we're running at 64.6%. As you rightly noted out, you can see an implied decline in the overall team payment for the year, but those are covered by what Greg noted. But Q2 and Q3 tend to have a higher percentage team payment than what we typically see for the full year just, because of that higher mix of the European races that have lower economics versus flyways.\nGreg Maffei: So to say another way, as we come into some of the races that are -- have higher revenue, one might expect that the payout ratio will be higher payouts to the team, but a lower percentage overall. So that this quarter may not be indicative, of the full year number. Does that help?\nDavid Karnovsky: Yes. And just sticking with Vegas for a second, it looks like there is a possibility of a labor strike next week at the hotels. Obviously, this could resolve before the race, but how are you thinking about the potential impact should a work stoppage go through?\nGreg Maffei: We have worked with the unions, and I believe our race will not be impacted directly. We're obviously watching what impact that may have on the overall Las Vegas market.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Swinburne: Yes. Good morning. Congratulations to Albert, and I guess, the IRS.\nGreg Maffei: He's not quite done yet. We're going to -- thank goodness, we're going to keep him around. So I don't have to say goodbye to him yet. But go ahead, I'm sorry.\nBen Swinburne: No problem. Greg, just to put a finer point on it, I think people want to know, are you guys still expecting this sort of approaching $500 million of revenue race weekend that will be top five - within the top five freezing EBITDA type numbers? Or are you changing that perspective today?\nGreg Maffei: A couple of thoughts. I think those revenue numbers approaching that still a reasonable estimate on profitability. I think I noted we've seen some one-time and start-up costs that may have been larger than anticipated. But remembering how this is impactful to us, not only directly, but indirectly, this is a very profitable race for us. As far as being measured as a top five, obviously, we don't tell the world what the top five are, but we have noted that this one will have that impact. I still think that's true, particularly when you look at the bottom line for FWON, it will have that impact overall. And I think that we will see that profitability, as I noted. Once we get past some of these initial start-up costs, we'll - and we optimize, it will increase. Let's be clear, this year, we optimize for being there, being on time and having a great race. That's not to say we won't have some of that objectives next year, but I think we'll be able to optimize on other variables as well and increase profitability.\nBen Swinburne: Okay. Thank you. And then you made a comment, Greg, at a conference recently, I think acknowledging that you kind of post the Disney, the charter thing and just higher interest rates in the world we're in. Sports rights inflation are probably going to be impacted. You guys just announced this one deal. There was the Apple story out there that you probably won't comment on. But can you guys - can you just give us your perspective on what the market feels like right now for sports rights as a seller? And whether the deal is an indication of the direction ahead as we think about forecasting your businesses that are in the sports business? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: There are really a couple of variables here. I mean, if you're a fully distributed and more stable sports property, there are certainly trends about fragmentation of the market and overall pricing that might give you pause. Nonetheless, we've seen pretty good increases at some properties. We're in somewhat of a different position, and I think, Ben, your focused rightly on the U.S., where we're still relatively nascent, and our product is gaining traction, and our audiences are growing dramatically. So I think I feel very comfortable with the F1 renewals much more than I do with the overall market. There are a lot of factors in the overall market where you know well, the fragmentation to find scale. And if you're a property trying, to decide between how you get paid and reach and that is always a challenge to be managed, that will be made more difficult with the fragmentation of the market. But on the other side, things like the SAG strike, things like the continued increase in cost of scripted content do make sports, still a very desirable place to be and the place where scale can be reached. So, there are a bunch of counter-growing trends that are - [make me met] on the whole market, but still very bullish on F1.\nBen Swinburne: Is Europe tougher than the U.S.? How would you compare those?\nGreg Maffei: I think the reality is most of the trends that are negative are further along in the U.S. than in Europe. But a lot of cases, Ben, as you know, the - how would sports rates get bid, largely a function of which distributor in the market needs the product or wants the product. And it could be a market where there are multiple bidders you're going to do very well, and where there are fewer bidders, you will do less well. And that may almost be unrelated to what is going on in the market in that particular geography.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks so much.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Kraft: Good morning. I guess I wanted to ask a couple, if I could. Greg, what do you think the time line will look like, to reach an agreement with the special committee of Sirius, assuming you do reach one? And whether you just answered that question or not, I was wondering if you could maybe address the second one, which is if you do reach an agreement, once that agreement has been reached, what would be the key milestones and the probable timing to close the spin and merge? And then separately, I just want to ask you about QuintEvents. Once you close that acquisition, are there significant advantages to F1 from owning the asset? Or is it more of an opportunistic acquisition to pursue growth opportunities outside of F1? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: Okay. It's a lot, Bryan. All right. Let's start with - I already said I'm not going to comment on any further on the negotiations, timing or the like. If a deal is reached, I think it will be required a shareholder vote likely, the structure of - the shareholder vote on the LSXM side, the structure on the SXM side, given our high equity ownership and the structure of how they work their charter and bylaws will be quicker. But there will also be the typical regulatory SEC matters and FCC matters that likely have to be cleared. So I would still expect several months delay even post any deal that has made reached. On Quint, I think we're excited about Quint for many reasons, and I'll let either Stefano or Renee, who both have views add it. But we're excited because of what it can do for us. One of the trends that we are pushing forward in Formula One is understanding our customers better and really having a direct connection. And so many things that we are doing, whether it be the app or Las Vegas or Quint allow us, to better understand our customers and their needs and desires. And I think that's a continuing trend, you will see that will add power, to the F1 ecosystem and allow us to do much more. Quint is important, because of how they touch those customers are some of our best customers and how we can utilize their talents, to grow and our understanding of our existing customer base, but also expand that customer base. The opportunity outside of F1 is also very interesting. I mentioned some of the places where they are at MBA, Churchill Downs. We think there are many sporting events, many live events that could benefit from Quint-type experiences. And we think Liberty can be in a position potentially to help them reach out to some of those leagues and opportunities. So, we're excited both for what it can do for F1 and what we can help do together, hopefully in the outside world of sports. Stefano, do you want to add anything?\nStefano Domenicali: No. I think, Greg that you touched exactly the point that is for Formula One, for sure. The need of understanding better our customer. And the growth of the request that, we have in all around the world makes - it's related, to the experience, and this acquisition will allow us, to talk with them better and to offer them better products and better things that will be - will enable them to be closer to our F1 world.\nBryan Kraft: Greg, if I could ask one follow-up just on the first one. I think you mentioned FCC is in Federal Communications Commission matters. I guess my understanding, is there would be no HSR approval needed, because you already have hard control. Is there an approval needed? How should we think about what the FCC's role would be?\nGreg Maffei: My understanding is, is that - Renee, you want to go?\nRenee Wilm: Yes. No, I'm happy to. It would be very much a pro forma application process, likely done within 45 to 60 days is what we're expecting. I think the longer pole in the tent will be the SEC review, which to Greg's point, should take a few months, I think maybe four to six months to get the entire thing done after we have an announcement.\nBryan Kraft: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nVijay Jayant: So thanks. A question on the Las Vegas race. I'm assuming that the OpCo is paying the holding company, as a promoter, given Liberty Media spend money on the track and the land sort of a promotion fee. So when -- Greg, when you talk about the profitability of the Vegas race, are you assuming that includes arguably that, payment to the OpCo - from the OpCo to the Holdco? Or is it at the operating company, the profits you're sort of expecting from the race? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: Well, Vijay, you're correct that there is that relationship. I think we are talking about the totality, but also, I think, over time, how the OpCo will be a very profitable race as well. So I think you can look at it both ways.\nVijay Jayant: And then just - Stefano talked about the attendance in all these races. Can you sort of confirm that the Vegas race is sold out on ticketing?\nRenee Wilm: Stefano, I'm happy to take that one. Vijay, it's Renee. We have a handful of tickets left, and the demand coming in, in the last minute, which knowing Vegas is the last-minute market, we didn't back - hold ticket back for that purpose. So, we are very excited, and we will be sold out by the time of the event.\nGreg Maffei: Los Angeles -- for Las Vegas relatively late, which is part of the war strategy.\nVijay Jayant: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Laszczyk: Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the media rights strategy for F1 to the extent you'd be willing to add to Ben's question. I would just be curious to better understand how you would think through the pros and cons of entering a longer-term exclusive global media rights deal with a single distributor? Just curious to the extent you think the Formula One IP could be well suited for that type of structure over the long term? And I have a follow-up? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Thanks for the question. I think we've tried to be consistent in answering this. There's always a trade-off between reach and profitability. There are relatively few, if any, distributors today who have the global reach that individual players do in their respective markets. So there would be - if you think hard about that trade-off. And you can see that in some markets where we've actually tried to play both sides of that, where they're made some of it's on broadcast and some of it's on pay because we don't want to see all of our product behind the paywall which is not widely distributed. So I don't have a comment other than you're always going to weigh that trade-off, and it depends on what - how we feel about the maturity of the business and in each respective market. And the length of deal we're willing to cut in many cases is dependent on how far we are on that curve. I note - we've noted before, in the U.S., we're fairly nascent, and we try to keep a shorter-term deal partly because we think we will do better as time goes on. In other markets, where it's more material, we're willing to talk about more stability. And there is benefit in many cases for the distributor to have more stability because they will be able to make a greater investment in the product promotion, et cetera, if they know they have long term. So you weigh all those factors.\nStefano Domenicali: And if I may add, Greg, on that correctly saying about this ratio between reach and profitability, the speed of this change is different from country-to-country, from region-to-region. And this is really the reason why, the media market today is quite complex. But we do believe that with the mix that we have, we will take the advantage of the strategy put in place today. That's why we are very confident about it.\nStephen Laszczyk: Got it. And then maybe one on the sponsorship side. Could you talk a little bit more about the regional deal with American Express that you recently signed, maybe the value you saw on each other to bring this deal to the table? And if you think that could be a good template or framework for other payment providers or financial institutions on a more global basis? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: I'll let Renee add, but I would note that one of the reasons why AmEx is unique is not only it is a great company, great brand, et cetera, with an audience and a customer base which fits very well with us, but also the case where really they came out on the regional basis because of the strength and wanting, to be involved in Las Vegas. So, it's a great example of Las Vegas leading us and broadening the base. It's also a case where using our digital capabilities, we're going to be able to - for regional players, to be able to show sponsorship capabilities and opportunities in a respective market, or in respective series of markets in a region because of those. Renee?\nRenee Wilm: So I would just add to that, something Greg mentioned earlier around the importance of data management and understanding who our fan base is and being able to work with American Express on their presale platform has really proven to not only help us move the hospitality early but also to get more visibility into who our fans are. So we think this is going to be a great win across the board.\nStephen Laszczyk: Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Glagola: Yes. Thanks for the question were these initial start-up costs for Vegas fully captured in the increased CapEx guidance last quarter? And what are your expectations for recurring annual maintenance CapEx for the Grand Prix Vegas? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: I think we are not changing anything we said about CapEx from what we said last quarter. I think most of my comments were really directed at more OpEx. And some of those costs that I mentioned, like security, like the opening festival - opening ceremony rather. I don't believe we are making any announcements today on CapEx. I would differentiate there will potentially be -- I don't think there's massive ongoing CapEx for maintenance. I'll make that statement. But there will be CapEx potentially for year-round activation as we come up with new opportunities to take advantage of the facility. And we really have not captured or forecast that because we're still working on what that may look like. So we don't really have a number for you today or something to talk about because we are looking at a range of activation capabilities. And candidly, we're focused on November 18.\nStephen Glagola: I appreciate that. And if I can just ask one more with you or Stefano on - with the FIA approving and ready last month, can you just give us any updates on your views with respect to adding 11 team to the grid? How are you evaluating this? And what are the potential gating items for you to get incrementally more inclined to grant admission or reject?\nGreg Maffei: I'll let Stefano answer that.\nStefano Domenicali: Yes. Okay. Thanks, Stephen. I mean, as you know, there is a process that is in place. So as always, we don't have to give any anticipation. The FIA did it's right role of doing its first assessment. Now we're in the process of doing our assessment on the commercial and marketing side. And as soon as this process will be finished, of course, we will inform everyone accordingly. First of all, of course, sharing this info in the first instance with the FIA.\nStephen Glagola: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Joyce with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Joyce: Thank you. I wanted to turn to the Liberty Live tracker. Just wondering what your opportunities and constraints are there? Conceptually, what might be some logical next steps for that? Might you buy a music venue that, could allow you to spin that off in 5 years? Or might you do something like you propose, to do with Sirius? And given that you've got such, a discount at that equity, would that be something of interest you think with Live Nation to combine, given that they've got a significant cash balance now? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: Yes. Thank you, David. I think our strategies around Liberty Live are evolving. We do look at it, as you've seen in the past, is something we've been able to do expand and grow, creating an ATB there so that we could potentially have a spin down the road. That's always something Liberty wants to maintain optionality around. But our first goal would probably be to build a strategy and maybe in conjunction with Live Nation around things that, are incremental and additive that we could own that we think are positive that could somewhere potentially be valuable to Live Nation as well. So no plan or intent today on any of the above, but we're - we have ideas, and they're working through.\nDavid Joyce: Thanks. And second, if I could, on the Atlanta Braves on the RSN side of the equation, that's significant revenues annually that's coming from the RSNs. Is there any update or any thoughts on how that could be replaced if needed, either by the league or your own capabilities?\nGreg Maffei: Derek, do you want to handle that?\nDerek Schiller: Yes, sure. So obviously, there's ongoing legal with this situation. So, we don't want to go too far with what we can say on it. I think probably the best way to answer this is we are continuing to deliver what we are expected to do under the terms of our agreement. And up to this point in time, they are and - we expect that to continue.\nGreg Maffei: Yes. Derek's way being more cautious than I would. I think our understanding is this is among, if not the most profitable of Diamond's RSNs reflecting, the large territory we have, the high demand that Derek and his team have built around, the Braves and the relatively, not the highest payment among RSN payments. It is a very profitable in our sense. So, I do not believe they will be rejected. But given the strength of the territory and the strength of the Braves, people's interest in Braves, I do believe we could replace that revenue stream, or a good portion of it at least with other alternatives.\nDavid Joyce: Thanks Greg. Thanks Derek.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Bazinet: I just had a question on Formula One. You guys have accomplished so much with this asset since you bought it. The concrete agreement growing sponsorship, tweaking the calendar, increasing popularity of the sport. I would just be curious, over the next three to five years, other than getting to know your fan base better, which you mentioned, what do you think the top two or three opportunities that remain are?\nGreg Maffei: Look, I think we have three or four big revenue streams, and I think all of them have upside starting with broadcast. The increased interest in the sport globally, but particularly in the U.S., have given us an opportunity with a broader range of distributors and the increasing number of digital players, who might enter the market. And as they get broader awareness as sports players, our willingness to go with them only increases. So you've seen examples like DAZN, you're seeing things like Netflix coming and doing something with us around golf and Formula One, admittedly small, but an interesting start. All those make us have opportunities there. In the races, yes, we are not going to increase the number of races at - certainly at the pace, if at all, that we have. But in a perverse way, the fact that there's a limited supply and an increasing number of people, who want a race and increasing number of cities or venues that want a race have allowed us, in many cases, to utilize that limited supply to play off, raise the requirements, raise our prices. And promoters are doing far better if you've seen, for example, how many people showed up at Austin, how many people are showing up. The increase in demand has made it, so promoters are more profitable, have more scale, and we're able to extract more money from them, not in the victim way that some people would call it, but because it's a better business for them and there are other players who want to bid if they don't want to play. In sponsorship, you're seeing us have grown that dramatically, over the last several years. I think far more we can do. AmEx is a great example, moving from a world that just paint on the track to a digital experience, to activation. Part of that's, again, understanding our customers better, all of those, I think, have an opportunity. And then hospitality. And Quint is a part of that. What we're doing - what we've been able to do, increase the Paddock Club, frankly, because of demand, how we've been able to increase prices, at the Paddock club, all those give us, I think, a range of opportunities in hospitality. So I think all 4 revenue streams are healthy and have upside. Stefano, what did I miss?\nStefano Domenicali: I think that the list is already quite interesting and full. But for sure, the concept that we have seen about AmEx, the regionalization is another key factor of attracting new partners, and this was going to be our strategy. But we do not forget that two other areas, for sure, will be very important, is licensing and merchandising, where we just at the beginning of restructuring where we can really see potential of what we can do. I mean, we don't have to also underestimate the potential of being bigger on social and bigger on the awareness of the sport and being able to connect more and more with this new initiative with our fans, we will be able to provide services that, of course, we have to pay back for us. So an incredible time in front of us. And that's the beauty of the sport that we are investing now really believe in it.\nJason Bazinet: Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: I believe our last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBarton Crockett: Okay. Thanks for getting me in here. I was curious, Greg, about your thoughts about the opportunities for baseball, overall to create a better streaming experience than the kind of fragmented circumstance that's developing right now with teams doing their own kind of local streaming, their own local broadcast. Do you think over time there should be some type of aggregation of the local team rights into new streaming, or an existing streaming platform to optimize kind of the experience from a market opportunity and from a consumer experience perspective? Do you think that should happen? Do you think it can happen if you guys play a role on that that creates value for your shareholders?\nGreg Maffei: I'll comment, and then I'll let Derek add. Baseball was an innovator with mlb.com, everything back to Bob Bowman that they did with BAMTech. And much of that has been accrued to the benefit. And I think with the increased interest in the sport this year, all to the good, you're right that the local rights regime is complicated. And how that has been divided, has made probably some innovation more difficult over time. We, at various times, have looked at that and potentially partnering with MLB to help on that. I think there are many plans out there being looked at, none has yet come to pass, but there's surely a demand in the sport. Derek, what would you add?\nDerek Schiller: Yes. Thanks, Greg. So what I would say, just on the macro level, not trying to get too far ahead of major baseball or the commissioner's office in this. But you think about baseball and maybe even ahead of that, live sports content still very much in demand, regardless of all the changes and fragmentation that's happening in the marketplace. So, I think being in the live sports content business, is certainly a very good thing. And then to baseball specifically, you've got 162 games. So, there's an enormous amount of that content. The sport is extremely popular, as Greg mentioned, selling 70 million tickets this year and just all the other factors. So, I think from a macro perspective, the sport is very healthy and has great opportunity. And looking at it from just at Braves lens, a little bit to Greg's earlier comments, we have a very large marketplace. We are significantly advantaged in that marketplace, especially against a lot of our peer sets. And so, there's a lot of opportunity, and that disruption might happen. But at the same time, I think the opportunity for us and for the broader sport is certainly there.\nBarton Crockett: Great. Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you all for your interest in Liberty Media. I think that was our last question. We look forward to seeing in the Atlanta Braves, don't mean to slide our Braves friends. I so used to being part of the family, I don't have to call them out separately. Thank you for your interest. As I said, we look forward to seeing many of you next week in New York. And if not, on our next earnings call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Greg Maffei",
            "content": "Thank you, Shane, and good morning to all. Today, speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali; and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. Also during Q&A, we will be available to answer questions related to the Atlanta Braves Holdings and the Braves management will be available as well. So beginning with Liberty SiriusXM. We did propose a combination of LSXM and SIRI. The goal is to rationalize the dual corporate structure, create a single share class and benefit both groups of shareholders. We believe such a combination would lead to enhanced trading dynamics in new Sirius with increased liquidity, less technical pressure, for example, a small short interest, and a higher likelihood of future index inclusion. We will provide updates on this potential transaction only if and when an agreement is reached. So let me turn to Sirius itself. Q3 results demonstrate what management had put forward during the year that there would be continuous improvement throughout the year, and we saw sequential improvements in self-pay net adds, and we expect a slightly positive back half of the year. EBITDA grew 4% versus the prior year and 6% sequentially, and there were $40 million of cost savings that were realized during the third quarter. The dividend was raised 10%. The Board approved that, showing continued confidence in Sirius' cash flow generation capabilities. Sirius also announced an expanded partnership with Ford to make SiriusXM a standard feature in all traditional F1s, beginning with the 2024 model year. That's important because the Ford F-150 has been the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for over four years. Management does remain focused on its strategic objectives, supported by the significant EBITDA and free cash flow generation. You will see a new streaming experience and branded platform announced next Wednesday, the day before our Analyst Day by the Sirius management team at their own event, and we believe this new experience will be able to drive engagement and enhance subscriber acquisition and retention. Turning now to the Formula One Group. We announced in September our planned acquisition of Quint. Quint is a provider of hospitality inventory, and they sell unique experiences to F1, the NBA, for the NBA All-Star game, the Kentucky Derby and other sporting events. We believe this merger or this purchase will announce and enable us an enhanced partnership with F1 and lead us to expand to other live sporting events. Quint is a high-growth asset with EBITDA and cash flow positive capabilities and currently already are both, but we'll expect will grow more over time. Turning to other things at F1. During the quarter, in October, we repriced the $1.7 billion of our F1 term loan B, and we tightened the spread there from 300 basis points to 225 basis points. At F1 itself, we see surge in popularity and it continues. We've had continued sell-outs in the grandstands in the Paddock Club. We've seen growth in engagement and awareness across social platforms, TV, digital platforms like F1T, social consumer media and others. You continue to see new interest in Formula One. For example, we've seen new investors, high-profile investors joined at Alpine, Rory McIlroy, Anthony Joshua and Patrick Mahomes, and that follows Ryan Reynolds investment in June. This morning, at F1, we also announced a 5-year extension of our race in Brazil through 2030. We are excited for the inaugural Vegas race in just under two weeks begin. The Pit Building is ready. We received the certificate of occupancy to operate for the race. This will be the largest Pit Building on the F1 calendar. The rooftop deck and wraparound balcony will provide 360-degree views of the track. The temporary structure is in place. The bridges are complete. We are ready to go. This event will offer an unparalleled fan experience. It's going to kick off with an All-Star line-up for the opening ceremony Wednesday before the race, which will air on ESPN2. To name a few, they'll be Keith Urban, Andra Day, J Balvin, will.i.am, Journey and others. We'll also have Netflix hosting its first ever live sporting event the Netflix Cup. This will be a golf tournament with F1 drivers and PGA Tour players, and it will stream on Netflix on the 14th of November at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The Vegas race is generating record-breaking sponsorship levels, with new marquee brands, and these examples include Moet Hennessy, Timo and Google Chrome. But more importantly, we think the biggest experience will create commercial opportunities beyond the race itself and accrue to the broader F1 ecosystem. The AmEx partnership we recently announced is a great example, and there are more to come. We did incur significant expense in launching year one in Vegas, and that included extra provisions for safety, security and traffic planning, which was required by local regulators. And we had several nonrecurring items, for example, our first year only opening ceremony, as I mentioned, and the design and launch of our multipurpose app and creation of a fan database. We remain highly confident and increased efficiency, to operate there on our growing profitability in years two and beyond, and we remain bullish on the broader value creation at LVGP that, far outweighs the increased investment in start-up costs. Let me turn now to Liberty Live Group, where we issued new $1.15 billion of 2.375% [LVY] Exchangeable in September, $918 million of those proceeds were used to repurchase 93% of our existing LVY exchangeable. Looking at the Live Nation itself, another record quarter announced. Looking year-to-date, they've sold 140 million tickets versus 121 million for the full 2022. Revenue was up 36%, AOI was up 33%. They saw strength in all markets, venues and price points with international leading the way. Year-to-date, concert fans are up 21%, with international fans up 34%. Per fan profitability is up double-digits globally at operated and owned theatres and clubs, and sponsorship has been a tremendous win with a new large deal with MasterCard, driven again by growth in the international concerts platform. Live sees continuing tailwinds into 2024 and beyond. Consumer wallets are continuing to be spent on live experiences. We see untapped potential in the continuing globalization of lives business, and large venues are showing a pipeline and sponsorship commitments, which are up double-digits. Lastly, looking at the Braves. It was an incredible season on field and off the field, even if the playoff run was obviously more disappointing and ended earlier than we had hoped. We finished with the best record in Major League Baseball, 104 wins against 58 losses. 3.2 million tickets were sold, a new record for Truist Park. We won our sixth straight National League title. The Braves have won the most division titles of any team in baseball since the institution of Divisional Play in 1969. Braves had strong financial performance. Baseball revenue was up 11% year-to-date, from increased ticket demand and attendance, and the Battery continue to benefit from increased traffic and rent growth, with adjusted OIBDA at the mixed-use up 15% in the nine months, versus the prior year. And with that, let me turn it over to Brian for some more on our financial results. Ciao, Stefano, and thank you, Stefano and Brian. Some of you may have seen our release that Albert Rosenthaler is retiring after 20 years at Liberty. Many of you know who Albert is and how much value he has added for our shareholders. Most recently, he served as Chief Corporate Development Officer, previously he was Head of Tax. He never really relinquished that as we know. Fortunately, he will remain a Senior Advisor. We do have a deep bench of talent, both on the corporate development and tax teams and will continue to grow in those areas. But I'm pleased that they, Albert, will work with them and me to drive future investment opportunities and our tax strategies. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Investor Day on Thursday, November 9 in New York. Additional information is available on our website. John Malone and I will be hosting our Annual Q&A session. If you would like to submit questions in advance, you can email investorday@libertymedia.com. None of the questions can ask if they will be about comedy. We do appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and the Atlanta Braves Holdings. And with that, operator, we will open the line for questions. I'm going to comment a little on Vegas and then I'll let Brian reiterate some of his comments or hopefully, clarity about how those payouts - team payouts can be misleading as looked at just on a quarterly basis. On the first point, yes, I think Vegas is proving to be a bigger spectacle and more impactful than we had anticipated, but there also have proven to be initial start-up costs. I outlined some of them increased security, onetime things like the open day ceremony, but there were other ones like consultants that help us set it up, permitting costs that were unusual and the like. So there are a bunch of initial costs that are probably higher than we had originally estimated. I remain very bullish. We remain very bullish on, as I said, the impact of Formula One overall by Las Vegas and the potential for this race be a profitable exercise itself. So to say another way, as we come into some of the races that are -- have higher revenue, one might expect that the payout ratio will be higher payouts to the team, but a lower percentage overall. So that this quarter may not be indicative, of the full year number. Does that help? We have worked with the unions, and I believe our race will not be impacted directly. We're obviously watching what impact that may have on the overall Las Vegas market. He's not quite done yet. We're going to -- thank goodness, we're going to keep him around. So I don't have to say goodbye to him yet. But go ahead, I'm sorry. A couple of thoughts. I think those revenue numbers approaching that still a reasonable estimate on profitability. I think I noted we've seen some one-time and start-up costs that may have been larger than anticipated. But remembering how this is impactful to us, not only directly, but indirectly, this is a very profitable race for us. As far as being measured as a top five, obviously, we don't tell the world what the top five are, but we have noted that this one will have that impact. I still think that's true, particularly when you look at the bottom line for FWON, it will have that impact overall. And I think that we will see that profitability, as I noted. Once we get past some of these initial start-up costs, we'll - and we optimize, it will increase. Let's be clear, this year, we optimize for being there, being on time and having a great race. That's not to say we won't have some of that objectives next year, but I think we'll be able to optimize on other variables as well and increase profitability. There are really a couple of variables here. I mean, if you're a fully distributed and more stable sports property, there are certainly trends about fragmentation of the market and overall pricing that might give you pause. Nonetheless, we've seen pretty good increases at some properties. We're in somewhat of a different position, and I think, Ben, your focused rightly on the U.S., where we're still relatively nascent, and our product is gaining traction, and our audiences are growing dramatically. So I think I feel very comfortable with the F1 renewals much more than I do with the overall market. There are a lot of factors in the overall market where you know well, the fragmentation to find scale. And if you're a property trying, to decide between how you get paid and reach and that is always a challenge to be managed, that will be made more difficult with the fragmentation of the market. But on the other side, things like the SAG strike, things like the continued increase in cost of scripted content do make sports, still a very desirable place to be and the place where scale can be reached. So, there are a bunch of counter-growing trends that are - [make me met] on the whole market, but still very bullish on F1. I think the reality is most of the trends that are negative are further along in the U.S. than in Europe. But a lot of cases, Ben, as you know, the - how would sports rates get bid, largely a function of which distributor in the market needs the product or wants the product. And it could be a market where there are multiple bidders you're going to do very well, and where there are fewer bidders, you will do less well. And that may almost be unrelated to what is going on in the market in that particular geography. Thank you. Okay. It's a lot, Bryan. All right. Let's start with - I already said I'm not going to comment on any further on the negotiations, timing or the like. If a deal is reached, I think it will be required a shareholder vote likely, the structure of - the shareholder vote on the LSXM side, the structure on the SXM side, given our high equity ownership and the structure of how they work their charter and bylaws will be quicker. But there will also be the typical regulatory SEC matters and FCC matters that likely have to be cleared. So I would still expect several months delay even post any deal that has made reached. On Quint, I think we're excited about Quint for many reasons, and I'll let either Stefano or Renee, who both have views add it. But we're excited because of what it can do for us. One of the trends that we are pushing forward in Formula One is understanding our customers better and really having a direct connection. And so many things that we are doing, whether it be the app or Las Vegas or Quint allow us, to better understand our customers and their needs and desires. And I think that's a continuing trend, you will see that will add power, to the F1 ecosystem and allow us to do much more. Quint is important, because of how they touch those customers are some of our best customers and how we can utilize their talents, to grow and our understanding of our existing customer base, but also expand that customer base. The opportunity outside of F1 is also very interesting. I mentioned some of the places where they are at MBA, Churchill Downs. We think there are many sporting events, many live events that could benefit from Quint-type experiences. And we think Liberty can be in a position potentially to help them reach out to some of those leagues and opportunities. So, we're excited both for what it can do for F1 and what we can help do together, hopefully in the outside world of sports. Stefano, do you want to add anything? My understanding is, is that - Renee, you want to go? Well, Vijay, you're correct that there is that relationship. I think we are talking about the totality, but also, I think, over time, how the OpCo will be a very profitable race as well. So I think you can look at it both ways. Los Angeles -- for Las Vegas relatively late, which is part of the war strategy. Thanks for the question. I think we've tried to be consistent in answering this. There's always a trade-off between reach and profitability. There are relatively few, if any, distributors today who have the global reach that individual players do in their respective markets. So there would be - if you think hard about that trade-off. And you can see that in some markets where we've actually tried to play both sides of that, where they're made some of it's on broadcast and some of it's on pay because we don't want to see all of our product behind the paywall which is not widely distributed. So I don't have a comment other than you're always going to weigh that trade-off, and it depends on what - how we feel about the maturity of the business and in each respective market. And the length of deal we're willing to cut in many cases is dependent on how far we are on that curve. I note - we've noted before, in the U.S., we're fairly nascent, and we try to keep a shorter-term deal partly because we think we will do better as time goes on. In other markets, where it's more material, we're willing to talk about more stability. And there is benefit in many cases for the distributor to have more stability because they will be able to make a greater investment in the product promotion, et cetera, if they know they have long term. So you weigh all those factors. I'll let Renee add, but I would note that one of the reasons why AmEx is unique is not only it is a great company, great brand, et cetera, with an audience and a customer base which fits very well with us, but also the case where really they came out on the regional basis because of the strength and wanting, to be involved in Las Vegas. So, it's a great example of Las Vegas leading us and broadening the base. It's also a case where using our digital capabilities, we're going to be able to - for regional players, to be able to show sponsorship capabilities and opportunities in a respective market, or in respective series of markets in a region because of those. Renee? Thank you. I think we are not changing anything we said about CapEx from what we said last quarter. I think most of my comments were really directed at more OpEx. And some of those costs that I mentioned, like security, like the opening festival - opening ceremony rather. I don't believe we are making any announcements today on CapEx. I would differentiate there will potentially be -- I don't think there's massive ongoing CapEx for maintenance. I'll make that statement. But there will be CapEx potentially for year-round activation as we come up with new opportunities to take advantage of the facility. And we really have not captured or forecast that because we're still working on what that may look like. So we don't really have a number for you today or something to talk about because we are looking at a range of activation capabilities. And candidly, we're focused on November 18. I'll let Stefano answer that. Yes. Thank you, David. I think our strategies around Liberty Live are evolving. We do look at it, as you've seen in the past, is something we've been able to do expand and grow, creating an ATB there so that we could potentially have a spin down the road. That's always something Liberty wants to maintain optionality around. But our first goal would probably be to build a strategy and maybe in conjunction with Live Nation around things that, are incremental and additive that we could own that we think are positive that could somewhere potentially be valuable to Live Nation as well. So no plan or intent today on any of the above, but we're - we have ideas, and they're working through. Derek, do you want to handle that? Yes. Derek's way being more cautious than I would. I think our understanding is this is among, if not the most profitable of Diamond's RSNs reflecting, the large territory we have, the high demand that Derek and his team have built around, the Braves and the relatively, not the highest payment among RSN payments. It is a very profitable in our sense. So, I do not believe they will be rejected. But given the strength of the territory and the strength of the Braves, people's interest in Braves, I do believe we could replace that revenue stream, or a good portion of it at least with other alternatives. Look, I think we have three or four big revenue streams, and I think all of them have upside starting with broadcast. The increased interest in the sport globally, but particularly in the U.S., have given us an opportunity with a broader range of distributors and the increasing number of digital players, who might enter the market. And as they get broader awareness as sports players, our willingness to go with them only increases. So you've seen examples like DAZN, you're seeing things like Netflix coming and doing something with us around golf and Formula One, admittedly small, but an interesting start. All those make us have opportunities there. In the races, yes, we are not going to increase the number of races at - certainly at the pace, if at all, that we have. But in a perverse way, the fact that there's a limited supply and an increasing number of people, who want a race and increasing number of cities or venues that want a race have allowed us, in many cases, to utilize that limited supply to play off, raise the requirements, raise our prices. And promoters are doing far better if you've seen, for example, how many people showed up at Austin, how many people are showing up. The increase in demand has made it, so promoters are more profitable, have more scale, and we're able to extract more money from them, not in the victim way that some people would call it, but because it's a better business for them and there are other players who want to bid if they don't want to play. In sponsorship, you're seeing us have grown that dramatically, over the last several years. I think far more we can do. AmEx is a great example, moving from a world that just paint on the track to a digital experience, to activation. Part of that's, again, understanding our customers better, all of those, I think, have an opportunity. And then hospitality. And Quint is a part of that. What we're doing - what we've been able to do, increase the Paddock Club, frankly, because of demand, how we've been able to increase prices, at the Paddock club, all those give us, I think, a range of opportunities in hospitality. So I think all 4 revenue streams are healthy and have upside. Stefano, what did I miss? I believe our last question. I'll comment, and then I'll let Derek add. Baseball was an innovator with mlb.com, everything back to Bob Bowman that they did with BAMTech. And much of that has been accrued to the benefit. And I think with the increased interest in the sport this year, all to the good, you're right that the local rights regime is complicated. And how that has been divided, has made probably some innovation more difficult over time. We, at various times, have looked at that and potentially partnering with MLB to help on that. I think there are many plans out there being looked at, none has yet come to pass, but there's surely a demand in the sport. Derek, what would you add? Thank you all for your interest in Liberty Media. I think that was our last question. We look forward to seeing in the Atlanta Braves, don't mean to slide our Braves friends. I so used to being part of the family, I don't have to call them out separately. Thank you for your interest. As I said, we look forward to seeing many of you next week in New York. And if not, on our next earnings call. Thank you."

            "name": "Stefano Domenicali",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Good morning. We are coming to the end of an action-pack triple header in the Americas, from Austin to Mexico City and this weekend to Brazil. Max Verstappen Red Bull have had an incredible season winning their second consecutive Constructor Championship and second, third consecutive title. While the Championship has been secured for several races, the other teams are still competing firstly, with tight battles all the way down the field at every event. We have had six different teams represented on the podium season to-date. McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari have gained strength throughout the season evidenced in Austin with Lando's excellent start and excitement around the various type strategy implemented. Santa Lewis is getting closer Max in Austin and Mexico and Ford, Ferrari paused in the 6 races. We have more battles left to witness for the remainder of the season, even with the number of teams shifting focus to their 2024 forecast. With gaps in performance appearing to be closing over recent events, we hope for a real challenge for Max next year. Our business is in a position of strength. Fun engagement is high, commercial interest is strong. The teams have sustainably improved their financial health, generating their own incremental sponsorship, which benefit our entire F1 ecosystem. And we have a number of brand expansion initiatives in the works, including the much anticipated Apple TV starting Brad Pitt. I will have more to share on our strategy to capitalize on this momentum at Liberty's Investor Day next week. Braves attendance in 2023 continues to sell out. The highlight of the third quarter was the record 480,000 weekend attendance at Silverstone for the British Grand Prix, the highest recorded in any event in recent decades. Other highlights, so the Japanese Grand Prix welcome total weekend attendance of 202,000 to the highest level since 2006. The Netherlands sold out a 305,000 fans. Singapore sold out a 260,000 and last weekend in Mexico, saw another record with 400,000 attending. These are massive crowds for the country where we race. As we've discussed, our fans are increasing in excess in F1 content across multiple media platforms, including leaner, digital and social. We are building a richer and more varied content across median to satisfy the various types of fans. All in a TV, global audiences averaged approximately 70 million. Growth market has seen solid year-over-year growth viewership, including Spain, Australia, Mexico as well as the U.S., where we have also had particularly strong growth in F1 TV subs. We've seen growth on digital video viewership with the F1 YouTube channel reaching almost 10 million subscribers, plus 14% year-over-year. Across our social media channels, F1 reached 67.6 million followers as of Q3, up 26% year-over-year. TikTok is now fastest-growing platform on social media, growing existing and new fans alike. Massive audience gravitate to both racing and lifestyle content across our social channels. EI launched their F1 '23 game in June, and the U.S. is now the biggest market for our game, surpassing the U.K. for the first time. According to OpenCritic, the game continues to be the highest-rated annualized sporting game franchise globally. F1 continues to advance our approach to audience measurement as consumer behaviors evolve. We aim to better capture our wider viewership and engagement for the future as we continue to grow these touch points. Turning to recent updates on our commercial agreement. On race promotion, we look forward to the '24 race championship calendar next year. We recently renewed our agreement in Belgium for an additional year in 2025, after record year race attendance of 380,000 this season. The promoter has invested in its capacity increases, and more variety entertainment for fans in recent years, which has benefited their attendance figures. On Media right, we entered into a strategic partnership with the Viaplay in the Netherlands that will allow their customer to access F1 TV Pro as part of their Viaplay subscription, providing fans with incremental commentary, camera angles, radio communication and more. Our agreement with RTBF in the Netherlands and Belgium were also new for multiple seasons. This past week, we have announced an expansion of our agreement with DAZN to broadcast F1 in Spain in an attractive deal until the end of 2026, a market with strong growth in TV viewership this season. TV Pro and access subscribers are continuing to grow and provide a tailwind to our Media right revenue. On sponsorship, our recently announced new multiyear regional partnership with American Express, welcome them as official payment partner for the F1 in the Americas and for Las Vegas Grand Prix. Card members will have special benefits and access across F1 races in the Americas, including presale tickets and curated on-site benefits. We were also thrilled to renew our agreement with Pirelli and Liqui Moly. Pirelli will remain F1 global partner until 2027, securing their place as long-standing supply to Formula One. Liqui Moly will also continue as an official partner under a multiyear renewal. Overall, demand and interest from sponsors continue to be strong, given the growth in our brand and the opportunity to align with F1 sustainability initiatives. We continue to have meaningful success in securing new and renewed sponsors, and we are confident in our coming pipeline. All eyes are now on Las Vegas as we countdown to the Grand Prix weekend. While the race is set, we will be a spectacle. It has also generated exciting noise that benefits the entire F1 ecosystem through the increased commercial interest, fan awareness and broader brand value. The fan experience will be unparalleled. The team has continued to invest in creative offering for its fans, including announcing with the Wynn Grid Club, a first of its kind membership program that will debut in Las Vegas Grand Prix. The program is designed for the F1 enthusiasts and will provide members with an unparalleled hospitality experience, including exclusive access to location within the Pit building, bespoken services and incredible cuisine. Members will also enjoy year-round benefits to additional F1 races services through all over Wynn properties. As part of our partnership with the brand new Sphere, we will be taking over the exosphere from Wednesday to Sunday or race we can to display a combination of unique partners, F1 and Las Vegas Grand Prix content. The team in Las Vegas, led by Renee Wilm, has real secured a number of new partnership in addition to the previously mentioned Americas fresh deal. With the agreements announced this quarter, the Las Vegas Grand Prix has now secured over 20 partnerships to-date for the marquee event. We are committed to raising Las Vegas in the long-term. The total local economical benefit of the Grand Prix, this year is expected to reach over $1.2 billion, which includes the direct spend from F1, to put on the race, the incremental spend by visitor and the impact of local supplier and businesses. In addition, the Las Vegas Grand Prix will generate estimated $25 million that will be allocated to K-12 public school and is developed in a STEM program that will be implemented in the Cloud County school district in the coming years. Perhaps a future F1 engineer will be born out of this. Finally, F1 continues to progress our sustainability and diversity and inclusion efforts. F1 Academy completed its debut season in Austin last month. Congratulations to Marta Garcia on the victory. And as we promised, she has now secured a full founded seat with PREMA Racing in the FRECA Series underlining our determination to ensure the best in the Academy series move upwards to the system. The F1 Academy final was broadcasted live in over 100 territories, marking a significant extension of coverage. This demonstrates the support of our broadcast partners and their commitment in bringing F1 Academy to both existing and new generation F1 fan, who can be inspired by this incredible racing talent. Additionally, our ambition effort in the development of 100% advanced sustainable fuel advancing well. Just last week, our partner, Aramco, announced that they will start operating 2 plus to produce synthetic fuels by 2025. Our partnership with DHL to use biofuel truck across the European of the season was highly successful. They reduced emission by an average of 83%, compared to the diesel-driven trucks. The use of biofuel will continue into 2024 and beyond. And we are excited about the insight we are gaining this year as we're exploring further opportunity in the connection with DHL. We have only three races left in the record-breaking season. I want to thank our F1 family, FIA, fans, teams, partners and shareholders to all of their support and enthusiasm decision. Our own track excitement isn't done yet. With the battle of constructor standing outside of first place likely to conduct to the last round of racing, we hope you tune into Brazil this weekend before we make our way to the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix and then wrap the season in Abu Dubai. I look forward to providing additional updates at Liberty's Investor Day next week [Avanti Tutta] full speed ahead. And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Ciao. No. I think, Greg that you touched exactly the point that is for Formula One, for sure. The need of understanding better our customer. And the growth of the request that, we have in all around the world makes - it's related, to the experience, and this acquisition will allow us, to talk with them better and to offer them better products and better things that will be - will enable them to be closer to our F1 world. And if I may add, Greg, on that correctly saying about this ratio between reach and profitability, the speed of this change is different from country-to-country, from region-to-region. And this is really the reason why, the media market today is quite complex. But we do believe that with the mix that we have, we will take the advantage of the strategy put in place today. That's why we are very confident about it. Yes. Okay. Thanks, Stephen. I mean, as you know, there is a process that is in place. So as always, we don't have to give any anticipation. The FIA did it's right role of doing its first assessment. Now we're in the process of doing our assessment on the commercial and marketing side. And as soon as this process will be finished, of course, we will inform everyone accordingly. First of all, of course, sharing this info in the first instance with the FIA. I think that the list is already quite interesting and full. But for sure, the concept that we have seen about AmEx, the regionalization is another key factor of attracting new partners, and this was going to be our strategy. But we do not forget that two other areas, for sure, will be very important, is licensing and merchandising, where we just at the beginning of restructuring where we can really see potential of what we can do. I mean, we don't have to also underestimate the potential of being bigger on social and bigger on the awareness of the sport and being able to connect more and more with this new initiative with our fans, we will be able to provide services that, of course, we have to pay back for us. So an incredible time in front of us. And that's the beauty of the sport that we are investing now really believe in it."

            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning. My remarks this morning when I'm talking about balance sheet figures, we'll be comparing 9/30 to the adjusted 6/30 balances that are adjusted for the split-off that was completed on July 18, and the reclassification of our tracking stocks that, was completed on August 3, as you'll see noted in the release. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $339 million. Excluding $53 million of cash held at SiriusXM and including the Battery stake held at LSXM that's valued at $65 million as of 9/30. We expect these shares will be exchanged with third-party lenders to paydown debt in the near term. There's also $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level, related to our SiriusXM margin loan. As of November 2, the value of the SiriusXM stock, was $14.9 billion. We have $1.4 billion in principal amount of debt, against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt, is $11.5 billion, which includes $9.4 billion of debt, at SiriusXM. Subsequent to quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM retired, the remaining $199 million outstanding face value, of the 1.375 basket convertible notes. Turning to the Formula One Group. At quarter end, Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $1.5 billion. This includes $947 million of cash at Formula One. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $2.9 billion, which includes $2.4 billion of debt at F1, leaving $500 million at the corporate level. F1's $500 million revolver is undrawn, and their leverage at quarter end was 2.2 times. And as Greg mentioned, the F1 repriced its term loan B in October, resulting in 75 basis points of margin compression to 225 basis points. The F1 business is best analyzed on an annual basis, given its variability in the year-over-year rate calendar. With that said, though, I will make a few brief remarks on the quarterly results. During the quarter, F1 recognized a higher proportion of season-based income, due to eight out of 22 races occurring during this quarter, compared to seven out of 22 in last year. The mix of races has also benefited our financial results in the third quarter, with two flyaway races Singapore and Japan taking place this year, versus France in the prior year period. Formula One grew OIBDA in the quarter in line, with revenue growth. We realized leverage on fee payments, during the quarter while also making incremental investments and growth initiatives that, were lower or not incurred in the prior year period, like the Vegas race and F1 Academy. Our team payments, are best viewed on a year-to-date basis and represented 64.6% of pre-team OIBDA, for the first nine months. I will note that Q2 and Q3 tend to have higher percent payout ratios, based on the greater mix of European races in these two quarters. Reminder that other costs of F1 revenue and SG&A, are best viewed as a percent of total revenue. Other costs at F1 revenue for the quarter, was 21% of total revenue. Note that the LVGP-related revenues and other cost of sales will largely be recognized in the fourth quarter when the race occurs. On SG&A, the third quarter included $8 million of costs, related to LVGP. Non-Vegas, as Greg said, the Paddock building is ready. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we incurred approximately $280 million of CapEx, related to the Pit building structure and track preparation. The majority of the CapEx spend has and will be incurred at the corporate level, related to the Pit building as the land and buildings sit within F1 - Formula One Group, sorry, separate from the Formula One OPCO. Track-related CapEx has and will be incurred at the F1-OPCO level. At the Liberty Live Group, there's attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $417 million, which includes the ETF assets. There's also $400 million of undrawn margin loan capacity, related to our Live Nation margin loan. As of November 2, the value of our Live Nation stock was $5.7 billion. We have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. And during the quarter, we raised 1.15 billion of new 2.375 Live Nation exchangeable bonds. Portion of these proceeds were used to repurchase approximately 93% of our outstanding 0.5% Live Nation exchangeable bonds for $918 million. There's 62 million remaining outstanding on the 0.5% bonds, which have a September '24, put call date that we expect, to settle with the remaining proceeds from the recent issuance. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. And turning briefly to the Atlanta Braves. Revenue growth in the quarter primarily reflects increased attendance, at regular season games and growth in related revenues, including ticket and concession revenue, which more than offset the impact of one less home game in the current period. Battery mixed-use revenue grew, due to increased rental income, from existing and new tenants, and then baseball operating costs grew in the third quarter, primarily due to increased player payroll and higher minor league expenses. SG&A was also elevated in the third quarter, driven by costs related to the split-off. And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One. Yes. And just year-to-date, we're running at 64.6%. As you rightly noted out, you can see an implied decline in the overall team payment for the year, but those are covered by what Greg noted. But Q2 and Q3 tend to have a higher percentage team payment than what we typically see for the full year just, because of that higher mix of the European races that have lower economics versus flyways."

            "name": "Renee Wilm",
            "content": "Yes. No, I'm happy to. It would be very much a pro forma application process, likely done within 45 to 60 days is what we're expecting. I think the longer pole in the tent will be the SEC review, which to Greg's point, should take a few months, I think maybe four to six months to get the entire thing done after we have an announcement. Stefano, I'm happy to take that one. Vijay, it's Renee. We have a handful of tickets left, and the demand coming in, in the last minute, which knowing Vegas is the last-minute market, we didn't back - hold ticket back for that purpose. So, we are very excited, and we will be sold out by the time of the event. So I would just add to that, something Greg mentioned earlier around the importance of data management and understanding who our fan base is and being able to work with American Express on their presale platform has really proven to not only help us move the hospitality early but also to get more visibility into who our fans are. So we think this is going to be a great win across the board."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Derek Schiller",
            "content": "Yes, sure. So obviously, there's ongoing legal with this situation. So, we don't want to go too far with what we can say on it. I think probably the best way to answer this is we are continuing to deliver what we are expected to do under the terms of our agreement. And up to this point in time, they are and - we expect that to continue. Yes. Thanks, Greg. So what I would say, just on the macro level, not trying to get too far ahead of major baseball or the commissioner's office in this. But you think about baseball and maybe even ahead of that, live sports content still very much in demand, regardless of all the changes and fragmentation that's happening in the marketplace. So, I think being in the live sports content business, is certainly a very good thing. And then to baseball specifically, you've got 162 games. So, there's an enormous amount of that content. The sport is extremely popular, as Greg mentioned, selling 70 million tickets this year and just all the other factors. So, I think from a macro perspective, the sport is very healthy and has great opportunity. And looking at it from just at Braves lens, a little bit to Greg's earlier comments, we have a very large marketplace. We are significantly advantaged in that marketplace, especially against a lot of our peer sets. And so, there's a lot of opportunity, and that disruption might happen. But at the same time, I think the opportunity for us and for the broader sport is certainly there."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Liberty Media Corporation's 2023 Q2 Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, August 4th. I would now like to turn the call over to Shane Kleinstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nShane Kleinstein: Thank you and good morning. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties including those mentioned in most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed and registration statement on Form S4 followed by Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings with the SEC on June 8, 2023. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call and Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media or Atlanta Braves Holdings expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Media, SiriusXM and Atlanta Braves Holdings including adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media, SiriusXM and Atlanta Braves Holdings scheduled one through three can be found at the end of the earnings press release issued today, which is available on Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you. Good morning. Today speaking on the call we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali, Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. Also during Q&A, we will be able to answer questions related to Atlanta Braves Holdings, and the Braves management will be available too. Starting with some corporate updates. Atlanta Braves Holdings began trading as a C Corp on July 19th. We believe this Split-Off will better highlight value at the Braves and its real estate. For example, the BATRA [ph], A shares, and the K shares are up 38% since the Split announced last November. We also settled all of the remaining inter-group interests in connection with this Split-Off. Today marks the first day of trading for our new trackers, and we expect more focused equities, more focused equities and increased future flexibility will trade better and be easier for investors to follow. Beginning with Liberty SiriusXM. This simplified tracker consists only of an 83% interest in Siri, cash, and debt. And we continue to reduce debt in the second quarter, retiring the remaining $275 million of our two and one-eighth exchangeables for Siri, and we wish having the 1.8 million new BATRA shares at LSXM exchange for debt retirement in the near term. We reiterate the focus on rationalizing the Siri and LSXM structures in the near term. Looking at SiriusXM itself, it reported strong financial results with an improvement over the first quarter as was expected. We had a sequential improvement in self-pay net ads and we do expect a positive back half in the aggregate in self-pay net ads. Siri has sustained a historically low churn of 1.5% and the business is focused on improved efficiency and cost structure and that will benefit EBITDA in the coming quarters. During their announcement, Siri increased its full year free cash flow guidance by $50 million up to $1.15 billion. During the quarter, we experienced continued progress on lowering the streaming cost for customer acquisition and it was down 20% over the prior year. Data shows that this half is a great accelerant for in-car conversion as well and we are making progress on our next generation SXM mobile app which will launch this fall. Sirius is maintaining its focus on enhancing its in-car position, and I'd note, ED manufacturers which are growth area, are area of new success for us as demonstrated by our agreement with Volvo. Turning to the Formula One Group, at the corporate level, I remind you that the assets consist of F1 ownership and the motorsport related assets we have including the Vegas property. During the quarter, we effectively repurchased $1.1 million FWONA shares in settling the inter-group interest that were previously held at LSXM for $6,750 a share. At F1 itself, the number of fans engaging with F1 content across the platforms is bigger than ever. Stefano will give you more stats in a moment, but to name a few, we continue to have sellouts at almost all races. The Sprint weekends are driving year-over-year growth in viewership. For example, the SPA [ph] total audience across race, sprint, shootout, and qualifying was up versus the Belgian GP last year. I'd note, we've seen particularly solid growth in the U.S. Viewership on ESPN is up season-to-date versus the 2022 average viewership with strong F1 TV performance as well. The 2023 season has already seen three of the four largest live audiences in F1 history on U.S. TV including Miami, Monaco, and the Canadian GPs. All but two of our races have averaged more than 1 million viewers, huge numbers for the U.S. market. On the financial side, OIBDA was up slightly quarter-over-quarter despite one less race due to improved operating leverage on team payments and freight. And now turning to LVGP, excitement for the race grows as demonstrated by momentum across social platforms. For example, LVGP had over 11 million social impressions and over 1 million engagements in July. The Las Vegas team is pulling together an event of unprecedented complexity and scale. It will be the largest and our argument would be the most premium sporting event of 2023, and it's a view that's a testament to our Super Bowl aspirations for all our Grand Prix events. I am pleased to say preparations are running on schedule and despite inflationary cost pressures, we expect no change in revenue and profitability assumptions that we laid out previously. We are increasing CapEx estimates for the Paddock building and track work, and Brian will go into that in more detail in a moment. We remain confident in the return profile of this incredible project which will support the incremental capital investment that we are making. I'd note we've also been already receiving inbounds with a track of economics for use of the Paddock building within the next year and we look forward to sharing those commercial plans once they are finalized. We expect to learn a lot from our inaugural race and look forward to racing in Las Vegas for many years to come. Turning now to Liberty Live Group, Live Nation experienced its strongest second quarter ever and their confident and continued growth into the balance of the year in 2024. Revenue for the quarter was up 27% and AOI was up 23% over the prior year. Growth was driven by international man, a real opportunity for Live. International fans were up 46% and more artists are touring globally. And lastly, on the international front, our Assess acquisition in Mexico is outperforming expectations. Overall attendance and per fan profitability were both up double digits for the quarter overall at Live Nation. Turning now to the Braves, now a separate public company, but business as usual is continuing in Braves country. We've seen continued momentum in fan demand, having sold 56% of our ticket capacity season to date, tied for MLB's best. We've made it to 40 sellouts already, the fastest we've ever hit this milestone in a season of truest and concession revenue is up season to date despite shorter game times. We announced a Jersey patch sponsorship with Quikrete in a multi-year deal. And most importantly on field, the Braves lead the NL East in the entire MLB. A franchise record eight players were in the all-star game, including our entire infield. All eight of these players are locked up through 2023 and most even longer, excuse me, 2025 with most even longer. The Battery is also seeing continued growth, adjusted OBIDA for the mixed use development was up 18% in the first six months versus the prior year. And with that, I will turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results.\nBrian Wendling: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will focus mainly on the 6.30 [ph] balance sheet figures adjusted for the split-off that was completed July 18th, and the reclassification of our tracking stocks that was completed yesterday. At quarter end and adjusted for the split-off and reclassification, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of approximately $331 million, which excludes $51 million of cash held at SiriusXM. There's also $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM margin loan. As of August 3rd, the value of our SiriusXM stock was $16 billion. We have $1.5 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $11.7 billion, which includes $9.5 billion of debt held directly at SiriusXM. In April, Liberty SiriusXM settled the remaining $275 million of its 2.125% Sirius exchangeables. Due to the net pay down at both SiriusXM and Liberty SiriusXM during the quarter, total attributed Liberty SiriusXM Group debt was down $360 million from $331. This is exclusive of the debt reduction due to the reclassification. The 1.375 basket convertible notes mature in October and $199 million principal remains on these notes. Liberty SiriusXM plans to exchange its 1.8 billion Battery shares with one or more third-party lenders to pay down debt in the near term. Turning to the Formula One group, at quarter end adjusted for the split-off and reclassification, Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments, and monetizable public holdings of $1.4 billion, which includes $1.1 billion of cash at F1. In connection with the reclassification, approximately $100 million of cash, as well as certain private and public assets previously held at Formula One group were attributed to the Liberty Live tracking stock. This includes $33 million of ETF and public assets that were liquidated prior to the reclassification and made up a portion of the $100 million of cash that was contributed over. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3 billion, which includes $2.4 billion of debt at F1, leaving $536 million at the corporate level. F1's $500 million revolvers undrawn and their leverage at quarter ends 2.2 times, and as we mentioned last quarter, the margin on F1's term loan be permanently stepped down to 3% from 3.25 effective at the beginning of May. The F1 business is best analyzed on an annual basis given variability in the year-over-year race calendar, but I'll make a couple brief remarks on their quarterly results. During the quarter, F1 recognized a lower proportion of season-based income due to six out of 22 races occurring during the period compared to seven out of 22 that occurred in the prior year period. F1 also recognized proportionally less team payments given one less race, which was partially offset by expected increased team payments for the full year compared to 2022. Our team payments are best viewed on a year-to-date basis and represented 63% of pre-team EBITDA in the first half of the year. Formula One generated modest OBIDA growth in the quarter despite one less race, held and incremental investments in growth initiatives that were not in the prior year period like the Vegas race and F1 Academy, as well as costs associated with the canceled Imola race. Given Imola was canceled on the Wednesday of race week, the majority of the race-related costs with regard to planning, logistics, and setup had already been incurred. On a full-year basis, we estimate the impact to adjusted OBIDA from the cancellation of Imola is modest at less than $20 million. Reminder that other costs of F1 revenue and SG&A are best viewed as a percent of total revenue. Other costs of F1 revenue in the quarter was 24% of total revenue consistent with our historical average. Note that the LVGP-related revenues and other costs of sales will largely be incurred in the fourth quarter when the race occurs, but for the quarter on SG&A, we had $7 million of costs associated with LVGP. On Vegas, as Greg already noted, there's no change to our revenue and profit expectations for the race in year one. Our Paddock building is now 85% complete. We expect CapEx related to the Vegas race, including both the Paddock building structure and track-related CapEx, to be close to $400 million, of which approximately $155 million was incurred in the first half of the year. The majority of the CapEx spend will be incurred at the corporate level related to the Paddock building, as the land and building both sit within F1, or FWON, separate from Formula One. Track-related CapEx has and will be incurred at the F1-OPCO level. Our team has managed this project on a compressed timeline and in an inflationary environment. Much of our cost increase is attributed to track-related expenses incurred to be responsive to the concerns of the local community, such as minimizing disruption to businesses along the Strip. We have also invested in security enhancements and expenses incurred to ensure the quality of the fan experience, with infrastructure changes to improve sidelines. We are working closely with our local Vegas partners, and the speed and efficiency with which we have completed this project is a testament to these relationships. We are excited about our investment in Las Vegas and the associated opportunities for both the Grand Prix and year-round activities at the Paddock building. At the Liberty Live Group, adjusted for the reclassification, there is attributed cash, liquid investments, and monetizable public holdings of $204 million, which includes the ETF assets contributed from Formula One Group. In connection with the reclassification, the Formula One Group also has contributed private assets with a fair value of approximately $380 million, measured at the time of our definitive S4 filing. We do not anticipate providing ongoing updates to the value of these private assets. Additional disclosure on the composition of these assets can be found in the asset list posted to our website. There is $400 million of undrawn marginal loan capacity at Liberty Live Group related to our Live Nation marginal loan, and as of yesterday, the value of our Live Nation stock held at Liberty Live was $6 billion. We have $920 million in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. Looking quickly at the Braves.\nGreg Maffei: Let me interrupt you for one sec, Brian. As we turn to the Braves, I think I misspoke too early in the morning here, and said it was at 56 capacity -- 56% capacity. The Braves Stadium is actually at 96% capacity. Sorry, go ahead.\nBrian Wendling: Thank you, Greg, for clarifying that. So looking at the Braves, revenue growth reflects that 96% capacity in the quarter with more regular season home games in the period as well as increased game attendance and growth in related revenues, including ticket and concession revenue. Battery mixed use revenue also grew due to increased rental income from existing and new tenants. Baseball operating costs grew in the second quarter primarily due to increased player payroll, as well as increased payments under MLB's revenue sharing plan and higher variable stadium operating costs due to the increased attendance. At quarter end and adjusted for the split-off, they had attributed cash and liquid investments of $131 million, which excludes $52 million of restricted cash. And Atlanta Braves Holdings had attributed principal amount of debt of $543 million. And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One.\nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Brian, and good morning to everyone. We are already over halfway through the 2023 Formula One season. I would first like to congratulate Red Bull and Max Verstappen on their incredible performance this season, breaking an all-time record on consecutive wins. The title field behind them has produced incredible action for all our fans, and I believe the gas [ph] will continue to close over time for all the teams. In Silverstone, the top six finishers crosses the line within 13 seconds of one another. Hungary had one of the most thrilling qualifying rounds to date, with the top six all within three-tenths of a second. McLaren's performance improvement following recent upgrades has delighted fans with London's second-place podiums at Silverstone and Hungary, and strong drive from Piastri. Our fans are accessing F1 content across multiple media platforms. Global audience averaged 68 million through the first eight races. In growth markets like the U.S., viewership over the same period is up 5% on ESPN, and events like Monaco have grown of 29% compared to last year's U.S. viewership. The sprint series has continued to both generate excitement on the track and drive viewership growth. At Azerbaijan, our first sprint of the season, total weekend viewership across the race and sprint events was up 10% versus 2022. We recognize that sport fans today engage with content across a variety of platforms, including linear, digital, and social. Across our social media channels, F1 reached 64.6 million followers as of Q2, up 29% year-over-year. F1 continues to adapt and expand our content to gather to different platforms and serve all segments of fans. For example, at the Hungarian Grand Prix, we piloted our first ever F1 broadcast for kids in partnership with Sky UK in Germany. In just one day, social media coverage for the announcement of the KitKat [ph] and the presentation of the driver's avatar reached more than 45 million users. With 93 million impressions and hugely positive sentiment, F1's celebrity presence continues to be a large draw for fans. For example, F1's social post featuring Shakira at the Spanish Grand Prix generated over 50 million impressions and over 2 million engagements. As filming for the Apple TV movie began, the post of Silverstone with Brad Pitt and Damson Idris lining up at the back of the grid generated 2.8 million engagements and over 7,000 comments. The social [Indiscernible] when the Yuki Tsunoda and his AlphaTauri teammates helped the community after the flood in Florence generated almost 15 million social impressions. F1 is considering how to advance our approach to audience measurement, add consumer behavior, evolve to better capture, have a wider viewership and engagement for the future. Our discussion with commercial partners successfully focused on these broader engagement metrics. The promoters continue to improve the quality of Grand Prix events and invest in enhancing the overall fan experience. We have seen the result of these efforts with continuous sell-out races, many at increased capacity. The Canadian and Silverstone Grand Prix both set new attendance records with crowds of 345,000 and 4,800,000 respectively. Silverstone attendance was up 20% compared to last year, in part due to cultivating fan experience across the entire race weekend, including at Calvin Harvey's Corners on Thursdays, evening before on-track activities started. We will continue to work with our promoters on these efforts. The success of their events is beneficial to the entire F1 ecosystem. There are growing ways to engage with F1 outside of race weekends. Our F1 Arcade licensees announced further expansion plans, with new sites opening in Birmingham in the UK this December and Boston in May 2024. Football at Flagship London location grew 16% in Q2 compared to the prior quarter, with an average of over 7,000 visitors per week. In June, EI launched the F1-23 video game. In its first week, the game ranked at number two and number three in UK Games and Global Steam sales charts, respectively. And finally, F1-related podcasts are increasingly providing other content to engage our fans. A new Formula Y podcast launched in May. It reached number one in the U.S. and UK sports podcast channels, performing particularly well among newer fan cohort with 35% of its audience in the U.S. and 30% of its audience female. Tune in to raise an update on our commercial agreements. On race promotion, we recently announced a further extension of the Austrian Grand Prix throughout 2030. Hungary also extended through 2032, with commitments made by the promoters to invest significantly in their physical infrastructure, including a new pit building and Main Grandstand by 2026. We announced a record-breaking 24 races championship calendar for 2024, with the return of the race in China for the first time since 2019. F1 is further progressing on a journey towards greater regionalization of the calendar where possible, including back-to-back races in Japan and China, as well as Abu Dhabi and Qatar. This improves the efficiency of our operations and reduces unnecessary lags in our travel, particularly from a freight perspective. On media rights, we entered into a multi-year agreement with Tencent to stream F1 events across its digital platform. This complements our existing coverage in China on CCTV. Additionally, we continue to grow F1 TV Pro and access subscribers with particular strength in the U.S. market. On sponsorship, Heineken extended their global partnership in a new multi-year deal. As previously announced, they will also be the official title partners of the Formula One Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix. The relevance of F1 brands continues to generate interest in sponsorship opportunity, including leveraging our sustainability strategy and new inventory like Las Vegas. We are focused on delivering incremental values to our existing sponsors and further developing our strong pipeline of new commercial partners. We are just over three months away from the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix. The Las Vegas Grand Prix will provide an unparalleled guest experience, combining the thrill of F1 racing with premium live entertainment, musical acts, world-class culinary offerings and more. We continue to grow our fan offerings with new partnerships, ensuring all partner venues meet the quality standards our fans expect and deserve. Most recently, we were excited to announce additional hospitality experiences, including the Heineken House, Club SI and Club Paris, as well as a partnership with Hilton Grand Vacation to host a premier on-track hospitality suite. Musical acts including Jay Belding, Major Lazer, Mark Robson with a headline with a T-Mobile Zone at the Sphere Stage, with many high-profile music and DJ acts still to be announced. The beverage brand Liquid Death was named as official event partner and will provide fans with a more sustainable alternative to single-use plastic through their beverage offerings. Formula One and Liberty have made a long-term commitment to race in Las Vegas, and have invested meaningful capital to make it happen. The team, led by Renee Wilm has built incredible partnerships with the local community, all of whom stand to benefit from the tremendous economic value we believe Formula One will bring. The Las Vegas team worked with third parties in gathering market-based data and estimated the economic impacts to Las Vegas in year one of the race will be over $1.2 billion. This is an additional two meaningful community efforts focused on food insecurity, water conservation and access to education in Southern Nevada. We are proud of the work our team is doing and are confident that Las Vegas Grand Prix will weigh the global sporting community this November. Finally, F1 continues to progress our sustainability and diversity and inclusion efforts. F1 Academy began its inaugural season in Austria in April and is now through six of seven races. The season finale will take place in Austin alongside the F1 Race Weekend with Marta Garcia leading the championship. Last week, we announced that all ten Formula One teams will have F1 Academy drivers and liveries for the 2024 season. This demonstrates the depth of support across the F1 community for the importance of F1 Academy grassroots initiatives. Building the next generation of young women in races tends to provide tremendous benefit for the entire F1 ecosystem. F1 has also progressed initiatives this season in environmental sustainability. In Austria, we piloted an energy-efficient power system that delivered a 90% reduction in carbon emissions from operating the Paddock pit lane and F1 broadcast area. Additionally, a new fleet of biofuel trucks operated by DHL are delivering our broadcast production, technical and other equipment for the European events of the 2023 season, which we expect will reduce our road freight emissions by a minimum of 60% compared to traditional fuel vehicles. The Formula Two and Formula Three cars are successfully running on 55% advanced sustainable fuels this season, and we remain on track to introduce 100% advanced sustainable fuels to Formula One in 2026. We are also encouraged by the increased awareness and openness of governments to include advanced sustainable fuels in their policy roadmaps to net zero, something F1 will continue to be at the forefront of pushing. We look forward to an exciting rest of the season, and of course, a well-deserved summer break for our teams. The season will resume in the Netherlands later this month before going to Monza. The gaps are getting increasingly closer within the pack on the grid. We have three-month sprint series to come in Austin, Qatar and Brazil. Our business is in a position of incredible strength both financially and commercially, and I look forward to updating you on our progress. Avanti tutta! \"Full speed ahead\". And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Bye-bye.\nGreg Maffei: Thanks, Stefano and Brian. Our annual investor day will be Thursday, November 9th, in New York. Please save the date. Additional details we'll be provide it soon. We hope to see many of you there. We do appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings. And with that, operator, I'd like to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Stephen Glagola with Cowen & Company.\nStephen Glagola: Hi. Thanks for the question. Greg, can you help us better understand monetization of the Las Vegas Paddock outside of the Grand Prix in 2024 and beyond? So, what type of events do you plan on holding? Any early indicators on sponsorship interest outside of the Grand Prix? And do you expect this OBIDA contribution match -- to match or exceed the Vegas Grand Prix over time? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: I will manage expectations first and say I do not expect it will exceed the amount we'll make in the Grand Prix over time. But with that, we have Renee Wilm here who's running our Las Vegas effort. I'll let her comment on some of the things we're thinking  about outside the race.\nRenee Wilm: Thanks, Greg. Happy to. So we are just beginning to really scratch the surface on what is available for us on a go-forward basis with the building. We have had a number of inbound requests. Think about Super Bowl parties. Think about something related to racing, maybe karting, high-end supercars. Of course, Las Vegas is the convention center of the world. Lots of interest in our state-of-the-art LED certified, I'm sorry, LEED certified building. Many of our partners in the F1 ecosystem are very interested in working with us throughout the year. So all I could say is a lot more to come over the next few months.\nGreg Maffei: Thanks.\nStephen Glagola: Thank you. And if I could squeeze in one more. How should we interpret what appears to be some recent conflicting comments from the FIA with regards to an early renewal. And then, the Concorde Agreement and then the appetite of new team entrants. And maybe just like more high-level, Greg, do you see any conflicts of interest with your vision of the sport long-term versus what the FIA views? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Well, I'll make a comment or two and then I'll let Stefano add. I think there's little daylight between Stefano and my view, which is we have 10 great teams. We're very excited about what they're doing. There is a process to add more teams, but the bar is very high and it's unclear what an 11th team value they would add. And there is a lot of uncertainty among the other teams about an 11th team. The FIA and we have had productive discussions about all this. Do we agree on everything every moment? No. We discuss it and we hopefully work things out. Stefano, what would you add?\nStefano Domenicali: I think, Greg, you said it perfectly. I mean, the FIA has started the process as it is in their possibility. We're waiting for the final conclusion. But as always in this discussion, we will find an agreement together, because as you said, the value of the team and the value of the business today is very, very strong. So, that decision, that information will come very, very soon. I would say within the month of September.\nStephen Glagola: All right. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning. On F1, any -- what's your sense of optimism about potentially signing a concrete agreement with the teams this year, which would be a couple of years early? And Stefano, when you look at the product this year, obviously being dominated by one team, how do you look at that relative to all of the changes you guys have made around driving more parity into the sport? Do you see this as a step backwards or just sort of the natural way the sport evolves unpredictably over time? And then I just had one Braves question for you guys. There's been some teams that have left Diamond and gone on to new business models in different sports. What does that tell you, if anything, about how you think about the Braves opportunity over the next couple of years as this Diamond process plays out? Thanks a lot.\nGreg Maffei: I'll let Stefano take the first two and I'll take a shot at the Diamond question. And obviously, Derek, if you have things to add. But Stefano, why don't you speak first?\nStefano Domenicali: Yes, thanks, Greg. I mean, I would say, first of all, I think it's the right moment to celebrate the incredible job that this company is doing with that car. Because if you see the other car and where the odds are in terms of gap, it's just incredible how much is doing an incredible job. But that has been always part of Formula One. And I would say this is part of the game. I'm pretty sure that in the next couple of years the term of technical doubts would be reduce, but if someone is great we need to see the great what is doing. And sometimes I have to say that it is also the need to confirm the legacy of someone, they're doing some particular stuff. And in certain mark maybe the new one you can see that this also who is an incredible legacy, because you know doesn't mean something. If you are able to win so many races, I mean you are really a great leader. So nothing negative in that perspective. If I need to look back I would say, this has something -- this has been always part of FI research. With regard to Concorde agreement, I would say today conversation are really going ahead because the moment of the sport is really great. Of course, we are not in a rush, but I would say that all things are heading to a positive conclusion for this discussion both the team and the FIA.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: On the Braves, I'll give my view and Derek please feel free to add. We're blessed to have an incredibly strong territory. 14 million broadband households, a fan base which is very appreciative of a very successful team. And with a reasonable deal on what we are paid by Diamond or Valley, we think we are probably the most profitable than they have. Some of the other ones were less attractive either territories or less attractive fan bases or relatively less attractive revenue versus cost to valley, and it is why in the bankruptcy proceedings they were terminated as an executory contract by Valley. I don't anticipate that will happen for us, because we have for all the reasons I said it above. But I do think if it does happen there will be other alternatives because of the strength of our product and the demand in our territory for that will generate us positive returns. Derek, you want to add anything?\nUnidentified Company representative: Greg, thanks. You said it very well. I would just comment first of all, we and Valleys [ph] are both adhering to the terms of our agreement as we currently stand. We are being paid in full and we are delivering our rights in full. So we don't see that changing anytime soon. And then just generally I would just tell you large sports content continues to be very desirable. So we take long-term and this is a good position regardless of what happens.\nBen Swinburne: You guys want to comment on the next season today.\nGreg Maffei: No, thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Jayant with Evercore.\nVijay Jayant : Hi, good morning. Couple for me. On Liberty Live, Greg, some of those private assets that were moved from Formula One, are there any ATBs there? And then just broadly, do you have some liquidity at Liberty Live? Is there any business strategy of buying venues or doing some stuff with Live Nation directly and growing sort of a real estate portfolio anything? Or is it purely to tackle any discount if it that sort of remains? And on Formula One, don't need to want to nitpick particularly, but the team payments, again, seem to be a little lower than our thoughts and some implies like a 1.3 billion. And I know you said in the past that you are conservative. I know there's one less race. Is any tough in the numbers that sort of impact the 2Q estimate?\nGreg Maffei: Okay, Vijay. A lot to unpack there, but thank you. On Liberty Live, look, I think we are looking for -- there is no ATB currently in that business to start. We are looking for businesses in there which we think will be accretive and fit well potentially with the Live Nation strategy. And we'd like to do things which were additive to us and pertains to them in the future. That gives us a wide latitude, but real estate certainly is on the list of things we think could be attractive particularly real estate which is anchored by Live Nation events Our liquidity there is relatively light, so we'll have to be creative about the ways we do that, but we have some ideas. Turning to a Formula One, I noted a couple things. I think in general how we look at the rest of the year, we feel good about where things stand very good. But some of the analysis about how payments were done and where it would flow between the third and fourth quarters, I think in general we looked at analysts has being slightly optimistic on three and slightly pessimistic on four. The nature of the payouts is you rightly noted is conservative. And the timing of how the races fall impacts the payouts. Brian, what would you add?\nBrian Wendling: Yes. I would just say the other thing that there is noise in the second quarter, because of the rephasing and the impact of Imola. So I would just have you look at the first two quarters together and look at that percentage as we said in our remarks. We were at 63%.\nVijay Jayant : Great. Thank you both.\nBrian Wendling: Thank you Vijay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Kraft: Greg, I had a couple for you on Liberty Sirius. I guess first a question that many investors often ask is, why Liberty hasn't made it Sirius shares available for borrow, so that the market can be more efficient around that spread. So would love to hear if you wouldn't mind share in the rationale behind your decision not to do that? And then the second question is, I understand that the leverage is a sensitivity and a potential merger of Liberty Sirius with SiriusXM. Would it make sense for Liberty Sirius to sell some of its Sirius shares down to get closer to the 80% level, so you kind of stay above the 80, but bring some cash in and then use that to reduce debt of Liberty Sirius. And are there any restrictions or considerations preventing you from doing that or discouraging for doing that? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Yes. I will let Ben Oren, if you're on Ben I think you are answer the first one after all into the second first. I think that strategy, we are concerned -- not concerned about the leverage. I think Sirius could support the leverage of the combined businesses to be clear. It might depend on how that was executed in terms of who bought whom. But I think in general, Sirius can support that leverage. I don't like the idea and I think we at Liberty don't like the idea of trying to sell some shares, because we have very low tax basis in those and would be very tax inefficient. And as I said, I think we can support the combination. We are continuing to look at ways to manage our leverage. We do get dividends out of SiriusXM and from time to time they have paid special dividends and in general over the last year plus we've been applying that to reducing leverage. But I don't like the tax inefficient. We have very low basis in those shares. Ben do you want to address the borrow issue?\nBen Oren: Yes, sir. While we are very sympathetic to the borrow issue, because it does create a lot of volatility. We have done a lot of work internally and employers on the ability to actually lend out our shares. I think at this time I would probably just summarized to say, there are legal -- there are different tax considerations to how any borrow facility or borrow our shares would have to be structured. That would make it relatively inefficient for a potential user. So for now that coupled with the optics that to the extent that we were going to lend out our shares. What would the borrowers be doing with those shares is probably why we will reluctant and not lend our shares for the time being. But we will continue to look at it and if any of the legal or tax considerations we will be able to never say never.\nBryan Kraft: Thanks to you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Karnovsky with J.P. Morgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi, thank you. On the increased CapEx for Vegas, can you just remind us of what the original projection was for Paddock and maybe expand a bit on the drivers, the increase spend. And then just on the race promo, I'm curious, revenue was up versus last year in Q2. That's the same mix of races minus Imola. Just want to see if you could comment on the drivers there with any one-offs or kind of material steps that we could be aware of? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: Brian, you want to take the CapEx.\nBrian Wendling: Yes. I would say on the CapEx, we never officially gave a number. We said it at a proximate or slightly higher than the land purchase value.\nGreg Maffei: So we still have not given a firm number. We just told you that we now think it will be larger than the amount that we are spending on the land. Yes, approximating 400 is what we said. Can you repeat the second question just to make sure I followed it?\nDavid Karnovsky: Yes, sure. And just with the CapEx, if you could expand on just the drivers of the increase, that'd be great. But on the second question, it was on [Indiscernible].\nGreg Maffei: Renee, do you want to comment on the drivers?\nRenee Wilm: Yes, I'm happy to. So we've entered into a couple of challenges as we've uncovered asphalt, cables under the ground that needed to be addressed. There have been wires overhead that have needed to be moved. A lot of this was driven by the requests and, quite honestly, requirements of the local stakeholders as we began this process of preparing the track for actual usage. We've also encountered some additional requests from the local stakeholders, such as the casino properties around enhanced security, around opening and closing the track. So this has led to additional equipment that was needed, as well as just additional actual road work. Of course, with regard to the paddock building, it is being built at lightning speed in an inflationary environment. So as you can imagine there have also been some additional costs along the way in that regard.\nGreg Maffei: Great. Thanks, Renee. And to your second question about timing and revenue recognition, maybe you could repeat it, please.\nDavid Karnovsky: Sure. It was just on race promo. The press release had noted it was up year-over-year. And I think you had the same number of \u2013 sorry, same mix of races, minus Imola. So I just wanted to see if you could comment on the drivers there, if there were any one-offs or material step-ups to be aware of?\nGreg Maffei: No. I mean, it's just regular contractual increases there, offset by the impact of the Imola race going away.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Laszczyk: Hi. Great. Thank you. Maybe for Greg and Renee on Las Vegas. I appreciate the focus for year one is just fan experience. But maybe thinking into years two and beyond, are there any opportunities around the GP that have come more into focus over the last six months that you're particularly excited about, but might not be able to fit in time for this November? Just trying to think through the long-term vision and the profitability opportunity around Las Vegas compared to what we might see in year one? Thank you. \nGreg Maffei: Yes, I think we touched on some of this. I think both on the revenue side and the cost side, there will be opportunities both around the GP and outside the GP as we go into year two. We moved with lightning speed, the F1 team, Renee's team, to put this in place. And that's probably led to increased costs. And it's also meant that there are opportunities we had to not capitalize on, whether it be fan festivals, whether it be sporting events, whether it be music events, all of those things that are potentially can grow around the second and beyond GP. So those are all GP related. And I think we already touched on the fact, Renee touched on some of the things outside the GP that people are interested in. But I don't think we have more to talk about today in terms of numbers.\nStephen Laszczyk: Got it. Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you. This is our last question, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Marlane Pereiro with Bank of America.\nMarlane Pereiro: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just quickly, on Liberty SiriusXM, is there sort of a target or an amount of debt you're looking to get down over the next year?\nGreg Maffei: Well, I think I touched on this a little earlier. We are, have looked at many perturbations and potential combinations with SiriusXM. All of them would involve in one form or another adding the debt that's in LSXM to the SXM debt, and in some cases taking on incremental debt. So there is no particular target, because we don't know exactly what path it will follow. SiriusXM is a massive cash flow generator. One of the reasons why we're not -- another reason why we're not particularly interested in selling our stock. We're bullish on the prospects of the business and its continued ability to generate that cash. So any combination, though it might have for a short period of time, a relatively high leverage amount or leverage four to five times, we know that that cash flow generating capabilities would allow the combined entity to pay that debt down back to the three and a half target relatively quickly.\nMarlane Pereiro: Got it. And are there any factors? I mean, I think for the most part, most think a combination would occur and perhaps make sense. But, are there any factors to consider as to why maybe a combination wouldn't happen?\nGreg Maffei: Well, I think you've got a -- you'll have a independent committee at SiriusXM, which will negotiate on behalf of their shareholders and their considerations, and you'll have Liberty representing LSXM. And hopefully there'll be a meeting of the minds. But there's always the potential that there is not an agreement between the two parties.\nMarlane Pereiro: Got it. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you very much to all our questioners. Thank you very much for all of you on the line for your interest in Liberty Media. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, if not sooner. And I think we're done, operator. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Greg Maffei",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning. Today speaking on the call we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali, Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. Also during Q&A, we will be able to answer questions related to Atlanta Braves Holdings, and the Braves management will be available too. Starting with some corporate updates. Atlanta Braves Holdings began trading as a C Corp on July 19th. We believe this Split-Off will better highlight value at the Braves and its real estate. For example, the BATRA [ph], A shares, and the K shares are up 38% since the Split announced last November. We also settled all of the remaining inter-group interests in connection with this Split-Off. Today marks the first day of trading for our new trackers, and we expect more focused equities, more focused equities and increased future flexibility will trade better and be easier for investors to follow. Beginning with Liberty SiriusXM. This simplified tracker consists only of an 83% interest in Siri, cash, and debt. And we continue to reduce debt in the second quarter, retiring the remaining $275 million of our two and one-eighth exchangeables for Siri, and we wish having the 1.8 million new BATRA shares at LSXM exchange for debt retirement in the near term. We reiterate the focus on rationalizing the Siri and LSXM structures in the near term. Looking at SiriusXM itself, it reported strong financial results with an improvement over the first quarter as was expected. We had a sequential improvement in self-pay net ads and we do expect a positive back half in the aggregate in self-pay net ads. Siri has sustained a historically low churn of 1.5% and the business is focused on improved efficiency and cost structure and that will benefit EBITDA in the coming quarters. During their announcement, Siri increased its full year free cash flow guidance by $50 million up to $1.15 billion. During the quarter, we experienced continued progress on lowering the streaming cost for customer acquisition and it was down 20% over the prior year. Data shows that this half is a great accelerant for in-car conversion as well and we are making progress on our next generation SXM mobile app which will launch this fall. Sirius is maintaining its focus on enhancing its in-car position, and I'd note, ED manufacturers which are growth area, are area of new success for us as demonstrated by our agreement with Volvo. Turning to the Formula One Group, at the corporate level, I remind you that the assets consist of F1 ownership and the motorsport related assets we have including the Vegas property. During the quarter, we effectively repurchased $1.1 million FWONA shares in settling the inter-group interest that were previously held at LSXM for $6,750 a share. At F1 itself, the number of fans engaging with F1 content across the platforms is bigger than ever. Stefano will give you more stats in a moment, but to name a few, we continue to have sellouts at almost all races. The Sprint weekends are driving year-over-year growth in viewership. For example, the SPA [ph] total audience across race, sprint, shootout, and qualifying was up versus the Belgian GP last year. I'd note, we've seen particularly solid growth in the U.S. Viewership on ESPN is up season-to-date versus the 2022 average viewership with strong F1 TV performance as well. The 2023 season has already seen three of the four largest live audiences in F1 history on U.S. TV including Miami, Monaco, and the Canadian GPs. All but two of our races have averaged more than 1 million viewers, huge numbers for the U.S. market. On the financial side, OIBDA was up slightly quarter-over-quarter despite one less race due to improved operating leverage on team payments and freight. And now turning to LVGP, excitement for the race grows as demonstrated by momentum across social platforms. For example, LVGP had over 11 million social impressions and over 1 million engagements in July. The Las Vegas team is pulling together an event of unprecedented complexity and scale. It will be the largest and our argument would be the most premium sporting event of 2023, and it's a view that's a testament to our Super Bowl aspirations for all our Grand Prix events. I am pleased to say preparations are running on schedule and despite inflationary cost pressures, we expect no change in revenue and profitability assumptions that we laid out previously. We are increasing CapEx estimates for the Paddock building and track work, and Brian will go into that in more detail in a moment. We remain confident in the return profile of this incredible project which will support the incremental capital investment that we are making. I'd note we've also been already receiving inbounds with a track of economics for use of the Paddock building within the next year and we look forward to sharing those commercial plans once they are finalized. We expect to learn a lot from our inaugural race and look forward to racing in Las Vegas for many years to come. Turning now to Liberty Live Group, Live Nation experienced its strongest second quarter ever and their confident and continued growth into the balance of the year in 2024. Revenue for the quarter was up 27% and AOI was up 23% over the prior year. Growth was driven by international man, a real opportunity for Live. International fans were up 46% and more artists are touring globally. And lastly, on the international front, our Assess acquisition in Mexico is outperforming expectations. Overall attendance and per fan profitability were both up double digits for the quarter overall at Live Nation. Turning now to the Braves, now a separate public company, but business as usual is continuing in Braves country. We've seen continued momentum in fan demand, having sold 56% of our ticket capacity season to date, tied for MLB's best. We've made it to 40 sellouts already, the fastest we've ever hit this milestone in a season of truest and concession revenue is up season to date despite shorter game times. We announced a Jersey patch sponsorship with Quikrete in a multi-year deal. And most importantly on field, the Braves lead the NL East in the entire MLB. A franchise record eight players were in the all-star game, including our entire infield. All eight of these players are locked up through 2023 and most even longer, excuse me, 2025 with most even longer. The Battery is also seeing continued growth, adjusted OBIDA for the mixed use development was up 18% in the first six months versus the prior year. And with that, I will turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results. Let me interrupt you for one sec, Brian. As we turn to the Braves, I think I misspoke too early in the morning here, and said it was at 56 capacity -- 56% capacity. The Braves Stadium is actually at 96% capacity. Sorry, go ahead. Thanks, Stefano and Brian. Our annual investor day will be Thursday, November 9th, in New York. Please save the date. Additional details we'll be provide it soon. We hope to see many of you there. We do appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings. And with that, operator, I'd like to open the line for questions. I will manage expectations first and say I do not expect it will exceed the amount we'll make in the Grand Prix over time. But with that, we have Renee Wilm here who's running our Las Vegas effort. I'll let her comment on some of the things we're thinking  about outside the race. Thanks. Well, I'll make a comment or two and then I'll let Stefano add. I think there's little daylight between Stefano and my view, which is we have 10 great teams. We're very excited about what they're doing. There is a process to add more teams, but the bar is very high and it's unclear what an 11th team value they would add. And there is a lot of uncertainty among the other teams about an 11th team. The FIA and we have had productive discussions about all this. Do we agree on everything every moment? No. We discuss it and we hopefully work things out. Stefano, what would you add? I'll let Stefano take the first two and I'll take a shot at the Diamond question. And obviously, Derek, if you have things to add. But Stefano, why don't you speak first? On the Braves, I'll give my view and Derek please feel free to add. We're blessed to have an incredibly strong territory. 14 million broadband households, a fan base which is very appreciative of a very successful team. And with a reasonable deal on what we are paid by Diamond or Valley, we think we are probably the most profitable than they have. Some of the other ones were less attractive either territories or less attractive fan bases or relatively less attractive revenue versus cost to valley, and it is why in the bankruptcy proceedings they were terminated as an executory contract by Valley. I don't anticipate that will happen for us, because we have for all the reasons I said it above. But I do think if it does happen there will be other alternatives because of the strength of our product and the demand in our territory for that will generate us positive returns. Derek, you want to add anything? No, thank you. Next question. Okay, Vijay. A lot to unpack there, but thank you. On Liberty Live, look, I think we are looking for -- there is no ATB currently in that business to start. We are looking for businesses in there which we think will be accretive and fit well potentially with the Live Nation strategy. And we'd like to do things which were additive to us and pertains to them in the future.

            "name": "Stefano Domenicali",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning to everyone. We are already over halfway through the 2023 Formula One season. I would first like to congratulate Red Bull and Max Verstappen on their incredible performance this season, breaking an all-time record on consecutive wins. The title field behind them has produced incredible action for all our fans, and I believe the gas [ph] will continue to close over time for all the teams. In Silverstone, the top six finishers crosses the line within 13 seconds of one another. Hungary had one of the most thrilling qualifying rounds to date, with the top six all within three-tenths of a second. McLaren's performance improvement following recent upgrades has delighted fans with London's second-place podiums at Silverstone and Hungary, and strong drive from Piastri. Our fans are accessing F1 content across multiple media platforms. Global audience averaged 68 million through the first eight races. In growth markets like the U.S., viewership over the same period is up 5% on ESPN, and events like Monaco have grown of 29% compared to last year's U.S. viewership. The sprint series has continued to both generate excitement on the track and drive viewership growth. At Azerbaijan, our first sprint of the season, total weekend viewership across the race and sprint events was up 10% versus 2022. We recognize that sport fans today engage with content across a variety of platforms, including linear, digital, and social. Across our social media channels, F1 reached 64.6 million followers as of Q2, up 29% year-over-year. F1 continues to adapt and expand our content to gather to different platforms and serve all segments of fans. For example, at the Hungarian Grand Prix, we piloted our first ever F1 broadcast for kids in partnership with Sky UK in Germany. In just one day, social media coverage for the announcement of the KitKat [ph] and the presentation of the driver's avatar reached more than 45 million users. With 93 million impressions and hugely positive sentiment, F1's celebrity presence continues to be a large draw for fans. For example, F1's social post featuring Shakira at the Spanish Grand Prix generated over 50 million impressions and over 2 million engagements. As filming for the Apple TV movie began, the post of Silverstone with Brad Pitt and Damson Idris lining up at the back of the grid generated 2.8 million engagements and over 7,000 comments. The social [Indiscernible] when the Yuki Tsunoda and his AlphaTauri teammates helped the community after the flood in Florence generated almost 15 million social impressions. F1 is considering how to advance our approach to audience measurement, add consumer behavior, evolve to better capture, have a wider viewership and engagement for the future. Our discussion with commercial partners successfully focused on these broader engagement metrics. The promoters continue to improve the quality of Grand Prix events and invest in enhancing the overall fan experience. We have seen the result of these efforts with continuous sell-out races, many at increased capacity. The Canadian and Silverstone Grand Prix both set new attendance records with crowds of 345,000 and 4,800,000 respectively. Silverstone attendance was up 20% compared to last year, in part due to cultivating fan experience across the entire race weekend, including at Calvin Harvey's Corners on Thursdays, evening before on-track activities started. We will continue to work with our promoters on these efforts. The success of their events is beneficial to the entire F1 ecosystem. There are growing ways to engage with F1 outside of race weekends. Our F1 Arcade licensees announced further expansion plans, with new sites opening in Birmingham in the UK this December and Boston in May 2024. Football at Flagship London location grew 16% in Q2 compared to the prior quarter, with an average of over 7,000 visitors per week. In June, EI launched the F1-23 video game. In its first week, the game ranked at number two and number three in UK Games and Global Steam sales charts, respectively. And finally, F1-related podcasts are increasingly providing other content to engage our fans. A new Formula Y podcast launched in May. It reached number one in the U.S. and UK sports podcast channels, performing particularly well among newer fan cohort with 35% of its audience in the U.S. and 30% of its audience female. Tune in to raise an update on our commercial agreements. On race promotion, we recently announced a further extension of the Austrian Grand Prix throughout 2030. Hungary also extended through 2032, with commitments made by the promoters to invest significantly in their physical infrastructure, including a new pit building and Main Grandstand by 2026. We announced a record-breaking 24 races championship calendar for 2024, with the return of the race in China for the first time since 2019. F1 is further progressing on a journey towards greater regionalization of the calendar where possible, including back-to-back races in Japan and China, as well as Abu Dhabi and Qatar. This improves the efficiency of our operations and reduces unnecessary lags in our travel, particularly from a freight perspective. On media rights, we entered into a multi-year agreement with Tencent to stream F1 events across its digital platform. This complements our existing coverage in China on CCTV. Additionally, we continue to grow F1 TV Pro and access subscribers with particular strength in the U.S. market. On sponsorship, Heineken extended their global partnership in a new multi-year deal. As previously announced, they will also be the official title partners of the Formula One Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix. The relevance of F1 brands continues to generate interest in sponsorship opportunity, including leveraging our sustainability strategy and new inventory like Las Vegas. We are focused on delivering incremental values to our existing sponsors and further developing our strong pipeline of new commercial partners. We are just over three months away from the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix. The Las Vegas Grand Prix will provide an unparalleled guest experience, combining the thrill of F1 racing with premium live entertainment, musical acts, world-class culinary offerings and more. We continue to grow our fan offerings with new partnerships, ensuring all partner venues meet the quality standards our fans expect and deserve. Most recently, we were excited to announce additional hospitality experiences, including the Heineken House, Club SI and Club Paris, as well as a partnership with Hilton Grand Vacation to host a premier on-track hospitality suite. Musical acts including Jay Belding, Major Lazer, Mark Robson with a headline with a T-Mobile Zone at the Sphere Stage, with many high-profile music and DJ acts still to be announced. The beverage brand Liquid Death was named as official event partner and will provide fans with a more sustainable alternative to single-use plastic through their beverage offerings. Formula One and Liberty have made a long-term commitment to race in Las Vegas, and have invested meaningful capital to make it happen. The team, led by Renee Wilm has built incredible partnerships with the local community, all of whom stand to benefit from the tremendous economic value we believe Formula One will bring. The Las Vegas team worked with third parties in gathering market-based data and estimated the economic impacts to Las Vegas in year one of the race will be over $1.2 billion. This is an additional two meaningful community efforts focused on food insecurity, water conservation and access to education in Southern Nevada. We are proud of the work our team is doing and are confident that Las Vegas Grand Prix will weigh the global sporting community this November. Finally, F1 continues to progress our sustainability and diversity and inclusion efforts. F1 Academy began its inaugural season in Austria in April and is now through six of seven races. The season finale will take place in Austin alongside the F1 Race Weekend with Marta Garcia leading the championship. Last week, we announced that all ten Formula One teams will have F1 Academy drivers and liveries for the 2024 season. This demonstrates the depth of support across the F1 community for the importance of F1 Academy grassroots initiatives. Building the next generation of young women in races tends to provide tremendous benefit for the entire F1 ecosystem. F1 has also progressed initiatives this season in environmental sustainability. In Austria, we piloted an energy-efficient power system that delivered a 90% reduction in carbon emissions from operating the Paddock pit lane and F1 broadcast area. Additionally, a new fleet of biofuel trucks operated by DHL are delivering our broadcast production, technical and other equipment for the European events of the 2023 season, which we expect will reduce our road freight emissions by a minimum of 60% compared to traditional fuel vehicles. The Formula Two and Formula Three cars are successfully running on 55% advanced sustainable fuels this season, and we remain on track to introduce 100% advanced sustainable fuels to Formula One in 2026. We are also encouraged by the increased awareness and openness of governments to include advanced sustainable fuels in their policy roadmaps to net zero, something F1 will continue to be at the forefront of pushing. We look forward to an exciting rest of the season, and of course, a well-deserved summer break for our teams. The season will resume in the Netherlands later this month before going to Monza. The gaps are getting increasingly closer within the pack on the grid. We have three-month sprint series to come in Austin, Qatar and Brazil. Our business is in a position of incredible strength both financially and commercially, and I look forward to updating you on our progress. Avanti tutta! \"Full speed ahead\". And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Bye-bye. I think, Greg, you said it perfectly. I mean, the FIA has started the process as it is in their possibility. We're waiting for the final conclusion. But as always in this discussion, we will find an agreement together, because as you said, the value of the team and the value of the business today is very, very strong. So, that decision, that information will come very, very soon. I would say within the month of September. Yes, thanks, Greg. I mean, I would say, first of all, I think it's the right moment to celebrate the incredible job that this company is doing with that car. Because if you see the other car and where the odds are in terms of gap, it's just incredible how much is doing an incredible job. But that has been always part of Formula One. And I would say this is part of the game. I'm pretty sure that in the next couple of years the term of technical doubts would be reduce, but if someone is great we need to see the great what is doing. And sometimes I have to say that it is also the need to confirm the legacy of someone, they're doing some particular stuff. And in certain mark maybe the new one you can see that this also who is an incredible legacy, because you know doesn't mean something. If you are able to win so many races, I mean you are really a great leader. So nothing negative in that perspective. If I need to look back I would say, this has something -- this has been always part of FI research. With regard to Concorde agreement, I would say today conversation are really going ahead because the moment of the sport is really great. Of course, we are not in a rush, but I would say that all things are heading to a positive conclusion for this discussion both the team and the FIA."

            "name": "Brian Wendling",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will focus mainly on the 6.30 [ph] balance sheet figures adjusted for the split-off that was completed July 18th, and the reclassification of our tracking stocks that was completed yesterday. At quarter end and adjusted for the split-off and reclassification, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of approximately $331 million, which excludes $51 million of cash held at SiriusXM. There's also $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM margin loan. As of August 3rd, the value of our SiriusXM stock was $16 billion. We have $1.5 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $11.7 billion, which includes $9.5 billion of debt held directly at SiriusXM. In April, Liberty SiriusXM settled the remaining $275 million of its 2.125% Sirius exchangeables. Due to the net pay down at both SiriusXM and Liberty SiriusXM during the quarter, total attributed Liberty SiriusXM Group debt was down $360 million from $331. This is exclusive of the debt reduction due to the reclassification. The 1.375 basket convertible notes mature in October and $199 million principal remains on these notes. Liberty SiriusXM plans to exchange its 1.8 billion Battery shares with one or more third-party lenders to pay down debt in the near term. Turning to the Formula One group, at quarter end adjusted for the split-off and reclassification, Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments, and monetizable public holdings of $1.4 billion, which includes $1.1 billion of cash at F1. In connection with the reclassification, approximately $100 million of cash, as well as certain private and public assets previously held at Formula One group were attributed to the Liberty Live tracking stock. This includes $33 million of ETF and public assets that were liquidated prior to the reclassification and made up a portion of the $100 million of cash that was contributed over. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3 billion, which includes $2.4 billion of debt at F1, leaving $536 million at the corporate level. F1's $500 million revolvers undrawn and their leverage at quarter ends 2.2 times, and as we mentioned last quarter, the margin on F1's term loan be permanently stepped down to 3% from 3.25 effective at the beginning of May. The F1 business is best analyzed on an annual basis given variability in the year-over-year race calendar, but I'll make a couple brief remarks on their quarterly results. During the quarter, F1 recognized a lower proportion of season-based income due to six out of 22 races occurring during the period compared to seven out of 22 that occurred in the prior year period. F1 also recognized proportionally less team payments given one less race, which was partially offset by expected increased team payments for the full year compared to 2022. Our team payments are best viewed on a year-to-date basis and represented 63% of pre-team EBITDA in the first half of the year. Formula One generated modest OBIDA growth in the quarter despite one less race, held and incremental investments in growth initiatives that were not in the prior year period like the Vegas race and F1 Academy, as well as costs associated with the canceled Imola race. Given Imola was canceled on the Wednesday of race week, the majority of the race-related costs with regard to planning, logistics, and setup had already been incurred. On a full-year basis, we estimate the impact to adjusted OBIDA from the cancellation of Imola is modest at less than $20 million. Reminder that other costs of F1 revenue and SG&A are best viewed as a percent of total revenue. Other costs of F1 revenue in the quarter was 24% of total revenue consistent with our historical average. Note that the LVGP-related revenues and other costs of sales will largely be incurred in the fourth quarter when the race occurs, but for the quarter on SG&A, we had $7 million of costs associated with LVGP. On Vegas, as Greg already noted, there's no change to our revenue and profit expectations for the race in year one. Our Paddock building is now 85% complete. We expect CapEx related to the Vegas race, including both the Paddock building structure and track-related CapEx, to be close to $400 million, of which approximately $155 million was incurred in the first half of the year. The majority of the CapEx spend will be incurred at the corporate level related to the Paddock building, as the land and building both sit within F1, or FWON, separate from Formula One. Track-related CapEx has and will be incurred at the F1-OPCO level. Our team has managed this project on a compressed timeline and in an inflationary environment. Much of our cost increase is attributed to track-related expenses incurred to be responsive to the concerns of the local community, such as minimizing disruption to businesses along the Strip. We have also invested in security enhancements and expenses incurred to ensure the quality of the fan experience, with infrastructure changes to improve sidelines. We are working closely with our local Vegas partners, and the speed and efficiency with which we have completed this project is a testament to these relationships. We are excited about our investment in Las Vegas and the associated opportunities for both the Grand Prix and year-round activities at the Paddock building. At the Liberty Live Group, adjusted for the reclassification, there is attributed cash, liquid investments, and monetizable public holdings of $204 million, which includes the ETF assets contributed from Formula One Group. In connection with the reclassification, the Formula One Group also has contributed private assets with a fair value of approximately $380 million, measured at the time of our definitive S4 filing. We do not anticipate providing ongoing updates to the value of these private assets. Additional disclosure on the composition of these assets can be found in the asset list posted to our website. There is $400 million of undrawn marginal loan capacity at Liberty Live Group related to our Live Nation marginal loan, and as of yesterday, the value of our Live Nation stock held at Liberty Live was $6 billion. We have $920 million in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. Looking quickly at the Braves. Thank you, Greg, for clarifying that. So looking at the Braves, revenue growth reflects that 96% capacity in the quarter with more regular season home games in the period as well as increased game attendance and growth in related revenues, including ticket and concession revenue. Battery mixed use revenue also grew due to increased rental income from existing and new tenants. Baseball operating costs grew in the second quarter primarily due to increased player payroll, as well as increased payments under MLB's revenue sharing plan and higher variable stadium operating costs due to the increased attendance. At quarter end and adjusted for the split-off, they had attributed cash and liquid investments of $131 million, which excludes $52 million of restricted cash. And Atlanta Braves Holdings had attributed principal amount of debt of $543 million. And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One. Yes. I would just say the other thing that there is noise in the second quarter, because of the rephasing and the impact of Imola. So I would just have you look at the first two quarters together and look at that percentage as we said in our remarks. We were at 63%. Thank you Vijay. Yes. I would say on the CapEx, we never officially gave a number. We said it at a proximate or slightly higher than the land purchase value."

            "name": "Renee Wilm",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Happy to. So we are just beginning to really scratch the surface on what is available for us on a go-forward basis with the building. We have had a number of inbound requests. Think about Super Bowl parties. Think about something related to racing, maybe karting, high-end supercars. Of course, Las Vegas is the convention center of the world. Lots of interest in our state-of-the-art LED certified, I'm sorry, LEED certified building. Many of our partners in the F1 ecosystem are very interested in working with us throughout the year. So all I could say is a lot more to come over the next few months. Yes, I'm happy to. So we've entered into a couple of challenges as we've uncovered asphalt, cables under the ground that needed to be addressed. There have been wires overhead that have needed to be moved. A lot of this was driven by the requests and, quite honestly, requirements of the local stakeholders as we began this process of preparing the track for actual usage. We've also encountered some additional requests from the local stakeholders, such as the casino properties around enhanced security, around opening and closing the track. So this has led to additional equipment that was needed, as well as just additional actual road work. Of course, with regard to the paddock building, it is being built at lightning speed in an inflationary environment. So as you can imagine there have also been some additional costs along the way in that regard."

            "name": "Ben Oren",
            "content": "Yes, sir. While we are very sympathetic to the borrow issue, because it does create a lot of volatility. We have done a lot of work internally and employers on the ability to actually lend out our shares. I think at this time I would probably just summarized to say, there are legal -- there are different tax considerations to how any borrow facility or borrow our shares would have to be structured. That would make it relatively inefficient for a potential user. So for now that coupled with the optics that to the extent that we were going to lend out our shares. What would the borrowers be doing with those shares is probably why we will reluctant and not lend our shares for the time being. But we will continue to look at it and if any of the legal or tax considerations we will be able to never say never."

Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, May 05. I would now like to turn the conference over to Shane Kleinstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nShane Kleinstein: Thank you and good morning. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties including those mentioned in Liberty Media's most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call and Liberty Media expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Media and SiriusXM including adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media and SiriusXM scheduled one through three can be found at the end of the earnings press release issued today, which is available on Liberty's website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Shane, and good morning. Today speaking the call we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali, and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. I'm going to first update you on the split up of the Braves and the creation of the new Liberty Live Tracker. We filed the amended S-4 and are pleased with the speed of the SEC review. We believe we are nearing the end of that SEC process and we are still targeting completion before the end of the second quarter. Turning first to Liberty SiriusXM. We continued our efforts to delever and simplify the balance sheet there. We raised $575 million of 3.75% LSXMA converts and we used the proceeds to repurchase $703 million principal amount of LSXMA debt including $591 million of the 1.375% basket convert and $112 million of the two \u2013 2.125% Siri exchangeables. We also repaid the remaining balance of those in April. That was a reduction in gross debt just over $400 million year-to-date, including the April activity. The reclassification of the LSXMA tracker without the Live stake will simplify our structure further and we continue to be focused on rationalizing Siri and LSXM's structures in the near-term. Let me look at SiriusXM itself. As expected, they had a challenging first quarter due to the SAAR and ad market trends. We expect this is the low point of the year on net pay \u2013 net self-pay net ads, due to the lower Q4 trial starts, the seasonal Q1 higher churn and the pullback in marketing as we will way to rollout our new app. Advertising did perform better than expectations and podcasting continues to be a bright spot. We saw solid progress in rolling out 360L, our revolutionary new product enhancement, which leverages the best of our content and interactivity. We expect 40% of its penetration \u2013 40% penetration in new car trials by year end 2023. We see a good conversion lift in vehicles with 360L, particularly if consumers are aware of and use advanced features. We did take costs out of the business at SiriusXM with an 8% workforce reduction in March, and we are confident that we will see improvement in operating results for the year with likely positive self-pay net ads in the back half of the year, and the cost savings and ad revenue seasonality benefiting EBITDA. As a result, SiriusXM on their earnings announcement raised both EBITDA and free cash flow guidance, $50 million each. We were excited to name Tom Barry as the new CFO. He was previously our Chief Accounting Officer. He's been with SiriusXM since 2009 and has a detailed knowledge of financial and strategic elements of the business. We do wish Sean well in his new role and his success on the course. Turning to Live Nation. Tremendous quarter, continued growth in live events across all of its segments with a great Q1, as I said, even against a pretty reasonably strong comp last year though there were some international markets that were not open in the prior period. Ticketing GTV was up 60%, AOi was up a stunning 53% to $320 million, and they converted 59% of that AOi into $190 million of free cash flow. We look forward to yet another expected record year at Live with about 90 million tickets sold for Live Nation shows year-to-date. We expect to manage 600 million tickets globally. We will host a record number of fans even against a strong 2022 comp, which benefit from rescheduled shows in prior periods. We believe the AOi at Live can compound at double digits for the foreseeable future. On the legislative updates, we continue to make solid progress and hope the market will begin to recognize the momentum there. We continue to gain momentum on the FAIR Ticketing Act and the proposed bill in the Senate called the TICKET Act is actually a significant positive first step towards implementing initiatives we support. Turning now to the Formula One Group. On the corporate side, we paid $202 million of cash to LSXM to settle the intergroup interest in connection with the repurchase of the basket converts. That\u2019s an effective buyback of 3.1 million FWONA shares at $65 a share proportionate to the amount of the convert repurchased. The F1 season is back after several weeks off, beginning here with the exciting Miami race this weekend. I would note, we had our first F1 Accelerate conference yesterday, was successful. This business summit brought together leaders in sports, tech and media, and we expect we\u2019ll have further iterations of that in the future. We announced format tweaks to Sprint events, now a standalone event with separate points and no impact to the grid on the GP itself. I also expect we\u2019ll see continued improvements in this format and three full days \u2013 resulting in three full days of on-track excitement. We continue to see growth in the sport. The Baku Sprint weekend TV audience was up 7% versus the 2022 GP in part due to Sprint. Continuing from here in Miami, we see growth in the U.S. fandom on full display. The Saudi GP was on ESPN and cable\u2019s most live GP on record to date. U.S. social media fallers were up dramatically, 43% in the first quarter versus the prior year, and the U.S. is now Formula One\u2019s biggest audience across Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat. Quick update on Vegas. We completed the Wave 1 and Wave 2 ticket sales with strong demand. The final Wave 3 sales are expected later this spring. We remain confident in our sponsorship pipeline with many big deals already announced. We most recently added Virgin at Hard Rock. The construction of Paddock Building itself is over 60% complete. CapEx is running in line with expectations, modestly exceeding our original cost of land purchase. Reiterate the \u2013 reiterating the race specific economics for year one. We expect total revenues will approach $500 million, and we do expect that will be a top five race in profit economics. On the balance sheet, F1\u2019s leverage at quarter end was 2.2 times. This will trigger a 25 basis point permanent reduction in the margin on our existing term loan B regardless of future leverage ratios. Turning to Braves. Great start to the season, 22 [ph] and 10 Best Record in the NLF and leading the NLEs by six games Ronald Acuna Jr. was named NL player of the month for April. He led the Major League Baseball and stolen bases and runs. We had the largest home opener crowd in Truist Park history. We\u2019ve seen incredible ticket demand for season to date. We stopped selling season ticket tails for the first time in franchise history and started a wait list before opening day. We expect to sell out over half the games this season. Baseball is clearly benefiting from MLB\u2019s rule changes. Games have more action and less downtime across Major League Baseball, you\u2019ve seen stolen base attempts up over 30% and versus last year to the highest rate since 2012. Games are about 30 minutes shorter versus last year and dropping below three hours. Looking at the Braves themselves and innovation there, we already plan to implement a new \u2013 we already plan to implement a new POS system this year to enhance our fan experience, and this will help mitigate any impact to concessions from shorter games, and we are actually seeing favorable trends in concessions year-to-date. Let me turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results.\nBrian Wendling: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of approximately $377 million, which excludes $53 million of cash held directly at SiriusXM. There\u2019s also $1.5 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM and Live Nation margin loans. As of May 4, the value of our SiriusXM stock held by LSXM was $11.5 billion, and the value of the Live Nation stock was $4.7 billion. We have $2.7 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings or $2.4 billion pro forma for the additional pay down that occurred after the quarter. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13 billion, which includes $9.6 billion directly at the Sirius level. In March, Liberty SiriusXM Group issued $575 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% LSXMA convertible notes due 2028. We used the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase $591 million principal amount of the 1.375% cash convertible notes and $112 million of the 2.125% senior exchangeable debentures. In addition to the proceeds raised from the new convertible, LSXM used cash on hand, including $39 million from the proportional net settlement of the bond hedge and warrant and cash received from Formula One Group to retire $3.1 million FWONA intergroup interest shares underlying the corresponding portion of the convertible repurchase. Subsequent to quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM settled the remaining 2.125% senior exchangeables for $275 million at the April-foot call date. There\u2019s approximately $199 million remaining on the 1.375% cash convertible notes, which mature in October. All remaining intergroup interest are expected to be settled and extinguished in connection with the Braves spin-off and additional information regarding the intergroup interest is available in our press release and as well as the S-4 that was filed with the SEC. Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $1.8 billion at quarter end, which includes $1 billion of cash at the Formula One level. Formula One Group purchased $129 million of exchange traded funds in the first quarter, which we expect to attribute to the Liberty Live Group tracking stock in connection with the announced reclassification of the trackers. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3 billion, which includes $2.4 billion of debt of F1 leaving $538 million at the corporate level. F1 $500 million revolvers undrawn and their leverage ratio at quarter ends 2.2 times, which will trigger a 25 basis point reduction in the margin on the term loan B debt. Looking quickly at the F1 operating business given quarterly variability, we will remind you to look at this business on a full year basis. But that being said, let\u2019s take a quick look at the quarter. Our race count in the first quarter was consistent year-over-year with two races. Primary revenue grew with increases across race promotion, media rights and sponsorship. Other F1 revenue decreased in the first quarter primarily due to easing a freight cost inflation versus the prior year which was partially offset by growth in Paddock Club attendance. On the cost side, our team payments grew in the first quarter due to the pro rata recognition of increased payments for the year. Reminder that other costs of revenue, F1 revenue and SG&A are best viewed as a percent of total revenue. Other cost of F1 revenue benefited from the easing of the freight inflation. This was largely offset by increased hospitality costs and higher commission than partner servicing costs paid to \u2013 related to the growth in the primary F1 revenue streams. On SG&A, the first quarter included $6 million of costs from the LV \u2013 from the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Looking at Vegas, nearly all of LBGP\u2019s revenue and costs will be recognized in the fourth quarter when the race takes place, just a reminder on that. The Paddock Club building is progressing on schedule. In the first quarter, we incurred approximately $53 million of corporate level capital expenditures related to Las Vegas. We will not be providing a forward-looking allocation between the F1 Opco and the Formula One corporate CapEx. LBGP will pay rent and other fees out of F1 Opco to Formula One corporate for use of the building during the race period, which will show up in our financial statements as revenue at the corporate level in the fourth quarter, but will eliminate in consolidation.  Finally, at the Braves Group at quarter end, they had attributed cash and liquid investments of $215 million, which excludes $30 million of restricted cash. Braves Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $542 million. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One.\nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Brian. Good morning from Miami. We are thrilled to be back for our second Miami Grand Prix, where the excitement in the city is as vibrant as year one. This year event feature on expanded Paddock now located inside the Dolphins Stadium and upgraded Paddock Club and a fully resurfaced track. We have four races into our record 2023 race calendar. While Red Bull has dominated the race to date, it is still very early in the season and the races have been packed with excitement and drama. Alonso fans have unmatched cheer about with Aston Martin recent performance. Alonso first place finishes in Saudi Arabia, marked his 100 podium, making him one of only six drivers in F1 history to claim these feet. The Australian Grand Prix featured three red flags adding even more complexity to this strategy and ended with only 12 of 20 drivers crossing the finish line. The new sprint format was unanimous approved by the teams F1 and FIA advance of Baku. We all believe that the new format is the right one for our fans and the sport and increase the level of intensity and action across the weekend. Starting the season at the six sprint events, all three days of the weekend will be packed with on track excitement. The Saturday Sprint Shootout is a shorter qualifying session to determine the sprint grid later that day. This makes the sprint standard on event with no bearing on the Grand Prix, allowing drivers to find more aggressively without fear to raise of the implication. Formula One is engaging with our fans across platform. Global audiences exceed 70 million viewers for the first two races of the season with significant increases in key markets across Europe and North America. In the U.S., the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix broke 1.52 million viewers marking ESPN and cables most viewed Grand Prix on record. Across our digital channels, F1 reached 62.9 million social media followers as of Q1, up 31% year-over-year. Our f1.com website and F1 apps have launched additional content including a new what is F1 section dedicated to new fans with videos and beginner\u2019s guide to the sport. Crowds continue to flock to our races globally. The vast majority of events are sold out for the 2023 season. Bahrain set his new record with nearly a 100,000 fans over the weekend. Melbourne top at last year record as the largest weekend sporting event in the recent Australian history. We welcomed 445,000 fans over the course of the weekend up from 420,000 the prior year. This also marks a new record this century perform one internal total race weekend attendance. Turning to recent updates on our commercial agreements. On race promotion, we extended our Austrian Grand Prix through 2027 fully in last year sold out crowd of 303,000 fans. This year event will mark our 10th anniversary since F1 returned to Spielberg [ph]. We also announced the extension of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix through 2026. On Meteorite, we entered into a multiyear extension of our partnership with ESPN to broadcast F1 channel, in Latin America and in the Caribbean. ESPN will provide live coverage of over half of the races with the full season available on the streaming service Star Plus. ESPN has continued to develop dedicated content across web and social platforms, allowing us to expand our global reach and attract and increasingly the diverse fan base. Our Pro and Access product continue to see solid subscriber growth this season. On sponsorship, we made the Liqui Moly an official partner. Our enhanced agreement includes track signage at the three races and visual branding out 15 races demonstrated the opportunity for digital ad insertion within the broadcast fee. We first welcomed Liqui Moly as regional sponsor in 2019, grew our relation to official sports in 2020 and now official partner in 2023. We continue to demonstrate growing value to our partners. We were thrilled to announce Paramount+ as an official partner following our successful sport and entertainment collaboration last season. Our new multiyear agreement will feature the popular series at Fan Zone on trackside display and in digital placement. This week, we announced Puma as official provider of F1 sports and apparel in a new multiyear partnership and we extended our agreement with MSC Cruises as global partner throughout 2026. As part of the extension, MSC will bring a unique specialty experience. Our sponsorship pipeline remains strong. To try to survive return for its fifth season in February, avid, casual and new fans alike continue to be drawn to the cities. The latest season didn't disappoint. On April 14, we celebrate the topping out of our Las Vegas Grand Prix Paddock Building by placing a symbolic concrete barrier on top of the structure. We are very pleased with our progress. The efficiency of this project is a function of the incredible collaboration between the Las Vegas Grand Prix team, our talented design and construction crew and local officials. We thank them all for their support. The Paddock Building spans 1,000 feet long, 100 feet wide and three stories told with the rooftop deck. It will be the largest Paddock Building on the race calendar and will host the largest Paddock club. On the roof, we have a 28,000 square foot LED screen in the shape of our F1 logo that provides unparalleled branding opportunities. When you fly over Las Vegas, you will know that F1 has established a permanent home in the U.S. We can monetize the LED screen and display third-party branding in the future years. The building itself has advanced AV capabilities, temporary walls between thin garages and additional features ensures ample flexibility to convert the entire space for a broad range of year-round users. Future year-round activation are under development, and we hope to have more to share in the coming months. I encourage you to visit the Las Vegas Grand Prix website for the time lapse video of the extraordinary construction progress. Our track surfaces of Las Vegas roads began last month, and the second phase is scheduled for July. Once complete, this track surface can last six years to 10 years. The team also recently announced addition to this sponsorship lineup. Virgin Hotel, Las Vegas was named an event partner, and will have entitlement to the East Harmon Fan Zone. Hard Rock International, who's name of presenting partner and will build a grandstand in front of the mirage on the street. In March, we announced an event partnership with Switch, the technology infrastructure company who will supply LVGP with its sustainable goals and establish [indiscernible] conscious practice for the race we can and beyond. Finally, touching on our broader F1 sustainability and inclusion effort. The European Union recently recognized the role that sustainable fuel needs to play as part of the automotive solution alongside the electric vehicles up to 2035. This cement the future of sustainable fuels following F1 extensive work with policymakers. Our F2 and F3 cars are running 55% sustainable fuels this season. Current F1 cars are running at 10% sustainable fuels, and we are on track to introduce 100% advanced sustainable fuels in 2026. The F1 Academy, our new/old series, began its season in Austria last weekend, following two testing session in Barcelona and Paul Ricard [ph] in France. Congratulations to Marta Garcia from Prime Racing on winning two of the three races on opening weekend, with just 0.3 seconds separating her and the second place finisher in the third place. The season will have seven race weekends with the final race alongside us in Austin in October. I'm pleased to say that in 2024 season, we'll have all F1 Academy races joined F1 weekends. The creation of F1 Academy is an important step forward towards increasing opportunity for female participation in motor sports. It is the start of a journey, and we hope it will be aspirational for young female drivers aspiring to reach professional motor sport; we now have the F1 Academy to aim for. I believe we are creating the best possible structure to find and nurture female talent, including those already in the series and those yet to come through from the grassroots level. We are looking forward to the season. Yesterday, F1 partnered with Custom Events from Wall Street Journal or to host our first F1 Accelerate Summit. We brought together Trailblazer from the walls of sport, entertainment and business to discuss how they can make a significant impact on the future of technology performance, diversity and sustainability not only in their own business, but across interesting culture. We welcome familiar faces from the F1 Group and management alongside Marquee Sports figures including Maria Sharapova and [indiscernible]. Jay Leno was our host as business executives traveled from across the country into the Jerry Bruckheimer, Joe Kosinski, Maverick Carter, Sarah Harden and Brooke Magnus [ph]. We hope to continue leverage F1 brands to drive innovation and commercial success for the sporting and entertainment worlds. It is an exciting time for Formula One on the track and in the commercial operation. Our unusual early season sprint break didn't have a mandatory shutdown like summer break meaning it was hard at work with their cars upgrade. I believe competition will intensifies as the season progresses. Miami caused us the first doubleheader of the season before we head to Europe for the first triple-header. There is plenty of action to come of [indiscernible] full speed ahead. And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Stefano, and thank you Brian. And to our listening audience, we appreciate your continued support of and interest in Liberty Media, we hope you will all turn in to see the Miami Grand Prix this weekend and the start of our Braves series against the Orioles tonight. And with that operator, I'd like to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from David Karnovsky of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thanks. Stefano, just on the new sprint format I'm interested to know what the response has been from your partners on the promotion side. How are they thinking about the potential lift to their own ticket sales? And then what's the process you have to determine what GPs get that format? And is that something you can build into your contracts?\nStefano Domenicali: Well, thanks, Dave. Of course, we did that thing in accordance with the teams and with the FIA because as you know, our idea is to make sure that during the racing weekend there is always action on the track. Actually, the result of the first one of this year has been very encouraging and every one of our partners, promoter, media partners and also team are very positive about that. Of course, there is something that we want to take as a lesson learned to see at the end of summer if there is something that we can learn to do some \u2013 even something better. But in a general term, the first weekend of the sprint format has been great. And I think that as always we wanted to do something different in a very standardized ecosystem, the reaction of the, let's say, the traditional fans is the one that needs to be awaited for longer term. But normally with the new fans, we've seen a very, very positive reaction. Promoter was pushing for that. And I would say the real thing is that we don't want to go in a situation where in the future we're going to have all the races with the sprint format. We want to keep a limited number of bit, maybe one third of the calendar number, and create something special with regard to the competition that we can give sporting value with trophies and of course commercial opportunity to these things. But I think that's the right way to go. And if I may summarize another thing that I think is important, I see a big trend today in Motor Sport not to be stable, let's say not to stay consistent with your regulation. We are just following what the base will be, I just following what the NBA has done. So that means that all the professional sport needs to listen to the request and to the new input that the fans, promoters, and partners are asking to have more excitement around the game. So positive and looking forward to keep working on this project.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. And then you've called out F1 TV in your releases for a few quarters now. Just wanted to see if you could update us on the product where you see it in terms of the growth trajectory. And then just for Brian, just to the extent someone buys an annual plan at the start of the season. Is that all booked in the first quarter with the partner cost? Or is that proportional of the races? Thanks.\nStefano Domenicali: So if I may the first part of it, F1 TV is really working very well. You know that we are not providing any numbers on that. But what I can tell you in terms of quality, in term of products and in term of attention is also an opportunity to select new market where there is not really a strong broadcaster provider. And we are doing that with certain countries and the effect is regular. We have a new plan also to update some of the content that we want to give to our fans. And as I said, after a couple of years of very high investment, now we are paying back what has been a great decision taken couple of years ago. Brian, do you want to progress with the other question?\nBrian Wendling: Yes, David, on your second question, it's proportional over the season.\nDavid Karnovsky: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. Greg, I wanted to ask you how should we think about the capital needs of the Liberty Live Tracker, both initially and over time, particularly as the business side of Liberty Live evolves and begins to invest in owning and operating venues. I assume that's still part of the plan and it seems like it's capital intensive. So just wanted to understand how you might go about funding those endeavors. Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Thanks, Bryan, for the question. As we've outlined, we expect to capitalize Liberty Live with a decent amount of cash, but candidly to the degree we go out and do something large there. We'll have to find other sources of capital \u2013 other sources of cash capital. So I don't think it will be a massive generator of cash as you would expect looking what's in the asset base there. But we have some ideas that involve leveraging Liberty Live itself, not reliance as much on other trackers if that's your fear, Bryan?\nBryan Kraft: Yes, that was the nature of the question. Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: You might have read that subtext a little bit.\nBryan Kraft: Well, a lot of people are asking about it, so, I think it's good to\u2026\nGreg Maffei: You get to asking straight upfront.\nStefano Domenicali: You get to asking straight up front.\nBryan Kraft: If I could ask you also may be related on the F1 side. I mean, it seems like what you\u2019re doing in Vegas is really exciting. Do you see other opportunities to invest in F1\u2019s business by taking on the promoter role and other markets and investing in facilities to drive that longer-term growth?\nGreg Maffei: Look, I think Vegas was unique and the opportunity and also the geography and a bunch of other factors, which made it the place where we should be the promoter first. We\u2019ll try not to have too much hubris and assume that we need to prove we can be a good promoter first. I don\u2019t look at a lot of other places where it\u2019s as obvious. I have mentioned in the past that I do think, in some cases, some of our partners in the promoter space are not necessarily as capital rich as Formula One. And so there may be opportunities for us to participate alongside them. maybe not a full co-promotion role but to take elements of the chain of value being created and further for both of our benefits. So we\u2019ll certainly look at that and talk to partners to the degree that\u2019s available.\nStefano Domenicali: And if you may add another comment at a direct qualitative effect is that with this investment, we are pushing also after the quality of the promoters that are already very important for us in Formula One. So now the game is to have unique events that are working very, very well, of course, commercially viable, but I would say that direct effect as given to the system not lifting the quality approach of every grand prix.\nBryan Kraft: Yes. Thanks, Greg. Thanks, Stefano. Appreciated.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Vijay Jayant of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nVijay Jayant: Hi good morning I have a couple on Formula One. So Greg, the $112 million of team payments in the quarter implies a little less than, I think, $1.3 billion for the year. Can you sort of talk about how team payments have been communicated to the team given the fact that this year you have something sort of different with the Vegas rates that is not sort of contractual? And is that something we should look at as a proxy and what you\u2019re sort of thinking on the full year EBITDA number? And second, obviously, the free cash flow was very, very strong at Formula One supporter and assuming that had to do with ticket sales for I think Wave 1 and Wave 2 on Vegas. Any way you can help us think about what sort of the underlying free cash flow excluding the ticket sales, if possible?\nGreg Maffei: So I\u2019ll comment on the first and second. And if Brian, you want to add anything on the free cash flow when I\u2019m done, that would be great. Looking at the team payments, I think if you look at our history, we try to manage that conservatively. Particularly in the first quarter of the year. And as you rightly know, probably even more conservatively this year given we\u2019ve added some volatility of the payroll rather to the potential in \u2013 by having Vegas. We think it\u2019s positive volatility. It\u2019s going to be a great event. But it is unknown. It is not as well experience and some of the other events that we have. So, I think you should look at that as a conservative proxy for how we expect the year will go. The last thing we want to do is have teams overspending in anticipation of money that don\u2019t show up towards the end of the year. The free cash flow, you rightly note, because of the Wave 1 and Wave 2 sales, a lot of cash has been broadcast. It\u2019s deferred collection, but it\u2019s generated in that free cash flow line. So it has probably overstated the true impact of the operating business for Q1, but we do expect to recognize that as free cash flow as the year progresses. I don\u2019t know, Brian, if you want to comment or can comment a little more on a more normalized level without providing Vijay too much clarity because gosh, we wanted to do some real work.\nBrian Wendling: Yes. I mean to help the efforts, I guess, I would say, if you look at our tracking stock schedules, you can see the deferred revenue as of March 31, 2023, and you can go back and look at the you look at our first quarter from last year, you can see the deferred revenue related to Formula One at 2022. It\u2019s up roughly $130 million, give or take, and you could think of that largely being related to Vegas, although there are other puts and takes.\nStefano Domenicali: If I may add one comment\u2026\nGreg Maffei: Go ahead Stefano, please add.\nStefano Domenicali: So Vijay, I just want to add two comments that I think it\u2019s important to consider a number that at the end of the day, it\u2019s important to remember that the teams are benefiting for what we are doing so far. I mean investing in Vegas for them is an incredible opportunity and directly also for them to develop their business. And indirectly, it will get our proposition even stronger as an ecosystem in Formula One. So, I think that is really something that as I was mentioning, we have a prudential approach that gives you the magnitude of what we need to do and need to deliver a dispose will be very, very important for all of us.\nGreg Maffei: Thanks, Vijay.\nVijay Jayant: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nPeter Supino: Hey good morning and thanks. On the Concorde Agreement, Greg, I wondered \u2013 Greg or Stefano, I wondered if you could comment on how you\u2019d like investors to think about the timing of that renegotiation? And then the second question, Greg, if you would talk about Live Nation, your view of both the risks posed by the DOJ investigation? And then separately, the bear case that the business ought to slow down a lot in 2024 after this post pandemic surge of supply? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Look, we have several years left to run on the Concorde agreement. But I think there\u2019s a consensus among the teams and the FIA and ourselves that now might be a good time to try and strike while the iron is hot and renew and extend the Concorde agreement. There\u2019s certainly no obligation to do that and there\u2019s certainly no risk if that doesn\u2019t get done. As you may recall, we went right to the end and historically in many cases, the teams have operated without a Concorde agreement. They\u2019ve basically done a handshake and then completed the deal post, the period when the Concorde \u2013 new Concorde agreement was supposed to start. Our hope is that this time we\u2019ll be able to change that dynamic in part because of the way that Chase and Stefano have changed the dynamic with the teams in particular. I hope we have a more positive relationship and everybody sees the benefit of going early and providing certainty for all involved. Stefano, what would you add?\nStefano Domenicali: Nothing because I think that you sympathize perfectly the situation. And I think that will be our strategies now.\nGreg Maffei: On Live Nation, I would not say it\u2019s a DOJ investigation, you could always say that, but look, we\u2019ve had a DOJ consent decree and monitor now for several years and it was renewed. And there is a hotline that anybody can report what they perceive as violations of that consent decree. And the DOJ has a monitor who is investigating continuously perceived or alleged violations of the consent decree. There obviously is another track, which is legislative potential and we\u2019ve talked about some of those I mentioned the couple of bills that are being considered. I\u2019m not sure those bills will get done, but in the main, we view those bills as positive. And frankly, I think anything that moves forward and ends the negative speculation about the regulatory side is positive because we do not perceive it nearly as big a risk as the market perceives it to be. On the business itself, hard to project what the consumer will do when you can imagine recession scenarios and the like. But we see none of that. We see strong demands and we see it going forward with upcoming tours and our expectations, as I noted, are the business is going to continue to grow.\nPeter Supino: Thanks a lot, Greg.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Peter.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen Laszczyk of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Good morning. Maybe one on F1 sponsorship for Stefano. It seems like you\u2019re finding a fair amount of success in stepping up some sponsors into more comprehensive packages. I know you had Paramount+ MSC [indiscernible] this past quarter. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about is this more how much opportunity you think there is as you look at across your sponsorship portfolio to step more sponsors up and if there\u2019s any constraints, especially with there being 10 global partners already that could limit us?\nStefano Domenicali:\n.: So I would say now the real thing is not to work only on the already more, but making sure that each of them receive the right qualitative answer to their question. And the other thing that I think is really relevant like this in another way, the fact that we receive this on the sustainability platform because no one will invest today in a business that is not credible on this landscape. Therefore, that is another push that we receive from our partners to make sure that our goals with sustainability [indiscernible] has been achieved. So it\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s say a constructive push that we are working together in order to be stronger and stronger together.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thanks for that. And then maybe one for Greg. Could you just update us on the way you\u2019re thinking about capital allocation at Formula One now that you hit the trigger on your term loan this quarter? Should we expect this to give you some more flexibility from this point going forward to ramp leverage back to more historical levels? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Well, thank you Stephen. I think, look, we\u2019re pleased to have triggered the reduction. Honestly, that\u2019s a nice benefit, but it has not been what\u2019s driving our thinking about capital allocation. We are looking for and believe we will find attractive opportunities for our cash and our generate cash flow generation. I\u2019ve talked about some of those in the past, including the Vegas effort, which I think is going to generate a good return ancillary businesses around which are synergistic and around our existing business and the potential for return of capital versus share repurchase. As I noted, we effectively did that this quarter for just over 3 million shares to the intergroup interest settlement. So, I expect you\u2019ll see us look at all of the alternatives above. And again, it was nice to click off the 25 bps reduction, but that wasn\u2019t what drove our thinking. It\u2019s really the strength of the business, which is generating the capital..\nStephen Laszczyk: Okay, thanks Greg. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from David Joyce of Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. \nDavid Joyce: Thank you. Couple questions, first on Formula One, what\u2019s the current view of Formula One, the league and FIA and the F1 teams related to potential addition of work teams, what are the gating factors from here? And then secondly, if you could provide any update on your views of what\u2019s happening with the regional sports network as it pertains to Atlanta Braves? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: I\u2019ll let Stefano handle the first part, and I\u2019ll hand the second question.\nStefano Domenicali: Thank you, Greg. I mean with regard to the situation of a new team potentially entering or interesting for one. No, as we said, there are someone that is quite vocal. Some others are quite silent. As you may know, David, there is a process in place that has been activated by the regulator to see and to collect the interest of other partners to be part of one. The first time will be finished, I think, within the middle of May. And then there will be the analysis done properly, checking the technical visibility, the financial feasibility and that we\u2019re going to have the discussion to see if any kind of potential enter will fit into the equation of creating more value to the sport. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to take the decision at the right time within the end of this year. That\u2019s the plan. But of course, that is once again showing the growth of Formula One. I mean, just a couple of years ago, the [indiscernible] team was very small, actually, almost none. Today, the value of the franchise is very high. So we have the duty to protect the business and making the right decision. And this is something we\u2019re going to do within the end of this year.\nGreg Maffei: And regarding RSNs look, obviously, it\u2019s a difficult situation given Diamond\u2019s filing. That having been said, we continue to receive payments from our Sports Star contract. That is not true for some other RSNs out there, but my understanding is three or four have not received payments from Diamond. And that, I think reflects the fundamental strength of the territory we have and the interest in the Braves such that our understanding is we have a profitable RSN. So it\u2019s unlikely that Diamond will view us as an executory contract which they wish to reject even if they were to reject it, which again, don\u2019t expect, I think there are other alternatives we could construct in the marketplace that would enable us to get paid and have our products shown to our fans, which is really the most important thing. And we\u2019re certainly prepared if we have to go out and exercise those alternatives.\nDavid Joyce: Great. Thanks Greg and Stefano. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Matthew Harrigan of Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Harrigan: Thank you. Live Nation among its other merit absolute home run acquisition for OCESA, just Mexico and Colombia. I think they said that and Asia were like 50% of AOI growth in the quarter year-over-year. I mean do you see there are many other targets out there to expand internationally as the music business is just now underlay globalized given the cross-market appeal of artists as Michael Tino [ph] talked about yesterday? Thank you. \nGreg Maffei: Thank you, Matthew. You\u2019re right, OCESA is a great deal, and it\u2019s nice that Alejandro Soberon\u2019s business, who is also our partner in the Formula One Mexico City, Grand Prix is being acting so successfully. There are other targets out there, probably not as many with the scale of OCESA that we could get done because of potential regulatory issues. But Live Nation has a long history of successfully adding primarily promoters into the fold usually in some point of a partnership agreement where the management stays involved, but we take some ownership interest as well. And I expect you\u2019ll continue to see that either in venues or promoter relationships where we continue to take advantage of the strength of our business and our ability to try and offer both fans and artists to global product. And the more we can fill in our global footprint to better for both of them.\nMatthew Harrigan: Thanks, Greg. \nGreg Maffei: Operator, I think we\u2019re done. And to our listening audience. Again, thank you for your interest in the Liberty Media Companies. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter, if not sooner. And have a great weekend.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Greg Maffei",
            "content": "Thank you, Shane, and good morning. Today speaking the call we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali, and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. I'm going to first update you on the split up of the Braves and the creation of the new Liberty Live Tracker. We filed the amended S-4 and are pleased with the speed of the SEC review. We believe we are nearing the end of that SEC process and we are still targeting completion before the end of the second quarter. Turning first to Liberty SiriusXM. We continued our efforts to delever and simplify the balance sheet there. We raised $575 million of 3.75% LSXMA converts and we used the proceeds to repurchase $703 million principal amount of LSXMA debt including $591 million of the 1.375% basket convert and $112 million of the two \u2013 2.125% Siri exchangeables. We also repaid the remaining balance of those in April. That was a reduction in gross debt just over $400 million year-to-date, including the April activity. The reclassification of the LSXMA tracker without the Live stake will simplify our structure further and we continue to be focused on rationalizing Siri and LSXM's structures in the near-term. Let me look at SiriusXM itself. As expected, they had a challenging first quarter due to the SAAR and ad market trends. We expect this is the low point of the year on net pay \u2013 net self-pay net ads, due to the lower Q4 trial starts, the seasonal Q1 higher churn and the pullback in marketing as we will way to rollout our new app. Advertising did perform better than expectations and podcasting continues to be a bright spot. We saw solid progress in rolling out 360L, our revolutionary new product enhancement, which leverages the best of our content and interactivity. We expect 40% of its penetration \u2013 40% penetration in new car trials by year end 2023. We see a good conversion lift in vehicles with 360L, particularly if consumers are aware of and use advanced features. We did take costs out of the business at SiriusXM with an 8% workforce reduction in March, and we are confident that we will see improvement in operating results for the year with likely positive self-pay net ads in the back half of the year, and the cost savings and ad revenue seasonality benefiting EBITDA. As a result, SiriusXM on their earnings announcement raised both EBITDA and free cash flow guidance, $50 million each. We were excited to name Tom Barry as the new CFO. He was previously our Chief Accounting Officer. He's been with SiriusXM since 2009 and has a detailed knowledge of financial and strategic elements of the business. We do wish Sean well in his new role and his success on the course. Turning to Live Nation. Tremendous quarter, continued growth in live events across all of its segments with a great Q1, as I said, even against a pretty reasonably strong comp last year though there were some international markets that were not open in the prior period. Ticketing GTV was up 60%, AOi was up a stunning 53% to $320 million, and they converted 59% of that AOi into $190 million of free cash flow. We look forward to yet another expected record year at Live with about 90 million tickets sold for Live Nation shows year-to-date. We expect to manage 600 million tickets globally. We will host a record number of fans even against a strong 2022 comp, which benefit from rescheduled shows in prior periods. We believe the AOi at Live can compound at double digits for the foreseeable future. On the legislative updates, we continue to make solid progress and hope the market will begin to recognize the momentum there. We continue to gain momentum on the FAIR Ticketing Act and the proposed bill in the Senate called the TICKET Act is actually a significant positive first step towards implementing initiatives we support. Turning now to the Formula One Group. On the corporate side, we paid $202 million of cash to LSXM to settle the intergroup interest in connection with the repurchase of the basket converts. That's an effective buyback of 3.1 million FWONA shares at $65 a share proportionate to the amount of the convert repurchased. The F1 season is back after several weeks off, beginning here with the exciting Miami race this weekend. I would note, we had our first F1 Accelerate conference yesterday, was successful. This business summit brought together leaders in sports, tech and media, and we expect we'll have further iterations of that in the future. We announced format tweaks to Sprint events, now a standalone event with separate points and no impact to the grid on the GP itself. I also expect we'll see continued improvements in this format and three full days \u2013 resulting in three full days of on-track excitement. We continue to see growth in the sport. The Baku Sprint weekend TV audience was up 7% versus the 2022 GP in part due to Sprint. Continuing from here in Miami, we see growth in the U.S. fandom on full display. The Saudi GP was on ESPN and cable's most live GP on record to date. U.S. social media fallers were up dramatically, 43% in the first quarter versus the prior year, and the U.S. is now Formula One's biggest audience across Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat. Quick update on Vegas. We completed the Wave 1 and Wave 2 ticket sales with strong demand. The final Wave 3 sales are expected later this spring. We remain confident in our sponsorship pipeline with many big deals already announced. We most recently added Virgin at Hard Rock. The construction of Paddock Building itself is over 60% complete. CapEx is running in line with expectations, modestly exceeding our original cost of land purchase. Reiterate the \u2013 reiterating the race specific economics for year one. We expect total revenues will approach $500 million, and we do expect that will be a top five race in profit economics. On the balance sheet, F1's leverage at quarter end was 2.2 times. This will trigger a 25 basis point permanent reduction in the margin on our existing term loan B regardless of future leverage ratios. Turning to Braves. Great start to the season, 22 [ph] and 10 Best Record in the NLF and leading the NLEs by six games Ronald Acuna Jr. was named NL player of the month for April. He led the Major League Baseball and stolen bases and runs. We had the largest home opener crowd in Truist Park history. We've seen incredible ticket demand for season to date. We stopped selling season ticket tails for the first time in franchise history and started a wait list before opening day. We expect to sell out over half the games this season. Baseball is clearly benefiting from MLB's rule changes. Games have more action and less downtime across Major League Baseball, you've seen stolen base attempts up over 30% and versus last year to the highest rate since 2012. Games are about 30 minutes shorter versus last year and dropping below three hours. Looking at the Braves themselves and innovation there, we already plan to implement a new \u2013 we already plan to implement a new POS system this year to enhance our fan experience, and this will help mitigate any impact to concessions from shorter games, and we are actually seeing favorable trends in concessions year-to-date. Let me turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results. Thank you, Stefano, and thank you Brian. And to our listening audience, we appreciate your continued support of and interest in Liberty Media, we hope you will all turn in to see the Miami Grand Prix this weekend and the start of our Braves series against the Orioles tonight. And with that operator, I'd like to open the line for questions. Thanks, Bryan, for the question. As we've outlined, we expect to capitalize Liberty Live with a decent amount of cash, but candidly to the degree we go out and do something large there. We'll have to find other sources of capital \u2013 other sources of cash capital. So I don't think it will be a massive generator of cash as you would expect looking what's in the asset base there. But we have some ideas that involve leveraging Liberty Live itself, not reliance as much on other trackers if that's your fear, Bryan? You might have read that subtext a little bit. You get to asking straight upfront. Look, I think Vegas was unique and the opportunity and also the geography and a bunch of other factors, which made it the place where we should be the promoter first. We'll try not to have too much hubris and assume that we need to prove we can be a good promoter first. I don't look at a lot of other places where it's as obvious. I have mentioned in the past that I do think, in some cases, some of our partners in the promoter space are not necessarily as capital rich as Formula One. And so there may be opportunities for us to participate alongside them. maybe not a full co-promotion role but to take elements of the chain of value being created and further for both of our benefits. So we'll certainly look at that and talk to partners to the degree that's available. So I'll comment on the first and second. And if Brian, you want to add anything on the free cash flow when I'm done, that would be great. Looking at the team payments, I think if you look at our history, we try to manage that conservatively. Particularly in the first quarter of the year. And as you rightly know, probably even more conservatively this year given we've added some volatility of the payroll rather to the potential in \u2013 by having Vegas. We think it's positive volatility. It's going to be a great event. But it is unknown. It is not as well experience and some of the other events that we have. So, I think you should look at that as a conservative proxy for how we expect the year will go. The last thing we want to do is have teams overspending in anticipation of money that don't show up towards the end of the year. The free cash flow, you rightly note, because of the Wave 1 and Wave 2 sales, a lot of cash has been broadcast. It's deferred collection, but it's generated in that free cash flow line. So it has probably overstated the true impact of the operating business for Q1, but we do expect to recognize that as free cash flow as the year progresses. I don't know, Brian, if you want to comment or can comment a little more on a more normalized level without providing Vijay too much clarity because gosh, we wanted to do some real work. Go ahead Stefano, please add. Thanks, Vijay. Look, we have several years left to run on the Concorde agreement. But I think there's a consensus among the teams and the FIA and ourselves that now might be a good time to try and strike while the iron is hot and renew and extend the Concorde agreement. There's certainly no obligation to do that and there's certainly no risk if that doesn't get done. As you may recall, we went right to the end and historically in many cases, the teams have operated without a Concorde agreement. They've basically done a handshake and then completed the deal post, the period when the Concorde \u2013 new Concorde agreement was supposed to start. Our hope is that this time we'll be able to change that dynamic in part because of the way that Chase and Stefano have changed the dynamic with the teams in particular. I hope we have a more positive relationship and everybody sees the benefit of going early and providing certainty for all involved. Stefano, what would you add? On Live Nation, I would not say it's a DOJ investigation, you could always say that, but look, we've had a DOJ consent decree and monitor now for several years and it was renewed. And there is a hotline that anybody can report what they perceive as violations of that consent decree. And the DOJ has a monitor who is investigating continuously perceived or alleged violations of the consent decree. There obviously is another track, which is legislative potential and we've talked about some of those I mentioned the couple of bills that are being considered. I'm not sure those bills will get done, but in the main, we view those bills as positive. And frankly, I think anything that moves forward and ends the negative speculation about the regulatory side is positive because we do not perceive it nearly as big a risk as the market perceives it to be. On the business itself, hard to project what the consumer will do when you can imagine recession scenarios and the like. But we see none of that. We see strong demands and we see it going forward with upcoming tours and our expectations, as I noted, are the business is going to continue to grow. Thank you, Peter. Well, thank you Stephen. I think, look, we're pleased to have triggered the reduction. Honestly, that's a nice benefit, but it has not been what's driving our thinking about capital allocation. We are looking for and believe we will find attractive opportunities for our cash and our generate cash flow generation. I've talked about some of those in the past, including the Vegas effort, which I think is going to generate a good return ancillary businesses around which are synergistic and around our existing business and the potential for return of capital versus share repurchase. As I noted, we effectively did that this quarter for just over 3 million shares to the intergroup interest settlement. So, I expect you'll see us look at all of the alternatives above. And again, it was nice to click off the 25 bps reduction, but that wasn't what drove our thinking. It's really the strength of the business, which is generating the capital.. I'll let Stefano handle the first part, and I'll hand the second question. And regarding RSNs look, obviously, it's a difficult situation given Diamond's filing. That having been said, we continue to receive payments from our Sports Star contract. That is not true for some other RSNs out there, but my understanding is three or four have not received payments from Diamond. And that, I think reflects the fundamental strength of the territory we have and the interest in the Braves such that our understanding is we have a profitable RSN. So it's unlikely that Diamond will view us as an executory contract which they wish to reject even if they were to reject it, which again, don't expect, I think there are other alternatives we could construct in the marketplace that would enable us to get paid and have our products shown to our fans, which is really the most important thing. And we're certainly prepared if we have to go out and exercise those alternatives. Thank you, Matthew. You're right, OCESA is a great deal, and it's nice that Alejandro Soberon's business, who is also our partner in the Formula One Mexico City, Grand Prix is being acting so successfully. There are other targets out there, probably not as many with the scale of OCESA that we could get done because of potential regulatory issues. But Live Nation has a long history of successfully adding primarily promoters into the fold usually in some point of a partnership agreement where the management stays involved, but we take some ownership interest as well. And I expect you'll continue to see that either in venues or promoter relationships where we continue to take advantage of the strength of our business and our ability to try and offer both fans and artists to global product. And the more we can fill in our global footprint to better for both of them. Operator, I think we're done. And to our listening audience. Again, thank you for your interest in the Liberty Media Companies. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter, if not sooner. And have a great weekend."

            "content": "Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of approximately $377 million, which excludes $53 million of cash held directly at SiriusXM. There's also $1.5 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity at the parent level related to our SiriusXM and Live Nation margin loans. As of May 4, the value of our SiriusXM stock held by LSXM was $11.5 billion, and the value of the Live Nation stock was $4.7 billion. We have $2.7 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings or $2.4 billion pro forma for the additional pay down that occurred after the quarter. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $13 billion, which includes $9.6 billion directly at the Sirius level. In March, Liberty SiriusXM Group issued $575 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% LSXMA convertible notes due 2028. We used the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase $591 million principal amount of the 1.375% cash convertible notes and $112 million of the 2.125% senior exchangeable debentures. In addition to the proceeds raised from the new convertible, LSXM used cash on hand, including $39 million from the proportional net settlement of the bond hedge and warrant and cash received from Formula One Group to retire $3.1 million FWONA intergroup interest shares underlying the corresponding portion of the convertible repurchase. Subsequent to quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM settled the remaining 2.125% senior exchangeables for $275 million at the April-foot call date. There's approximately $199 million remaining on the 1.375% cash convertible notes, which mature in October. All remaining intergroup interest are expected to be settled and extinguished in connection with the Braves spin-off and additional information regarding the intergroup interest is available in our press release and as well as the S-4 that was filed with the SEC. Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $1.8 billion at quarter end, which includes $1 billion of cash at the Formula One level. Formula One Group purchased $129 million of exchange traded funds in the first quarter, which we expect to attribute to the Liberty Live Group tracking stock in connection with the announced reclassification of the trackers. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $3 billion, which includes $2.4 billion of debt of F1 leaving $538 million at the corporate level. F1 $500 million revolvers undrawn and their leverage ratio at quarter ends 2.2 times, which will trigger a 25 basis point reduction in the margin on the term loan B debt. Looking quickly at the F1 operating business given quarterly variability, we will remind you to look at this business on a full year basis. But that being said, let's take a quick look at the quarter. Our race count in the first quarter was consistent year-over-year with two races. Primary revenue grew with increases across race promotion, media rights and sponsorship. Other F1 revenue decreased in the first quarter primarily due to easing a freight cost inflation versus the prior year which was partially offset by growth in Paddock Club attendance. On the cost side, our team payments grew in the first quarter due to the pro rata recognition of increased payments for the year. Reminder that other costs of revenue, F1 revenue and SG&A are best viewed as a percent of total revenue. Other cost of F1 revenue benefited from the easing of the freight inflation. This was largely offset by increased hospitality costs and higher commission than partner servicing costs paid to \u2013 related to the growth in the primary F1 revenue streams. On SG&A, the first quarter included $6 million of costs from the LV \u2013 from the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Looking at Vegas, nearly all of LBGP's revenue and costs will be recognized in the fourth quarter when the race takes place, just a reminder on that. The Paddock Club building is progressing on schedule. In the first quarter, we incurred approximately $53 million of corporate level capital expenditures related to Las Vegas. We will not be providing a forward-looking allocation between the F1 Opco and the Formula One corporate CapEx. LBGP will pay rent and other fees out of F1 Opco to Formula One corporate for use of the building during the race period, which will show up in our financial statements as revenue at the corporate level in the fourth quarter, but will eliminate in consolidation.  Finally, at the Braves Group at quarter end, they had attributed cash and liquid investments of $215 million, which excludes $30 million of restricted cash. Braves Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $542 million. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One. Yes, David, on your second question, it's proportional over the season. Yes. I mean to help the efforts, I guess, I would say, if you look at our tracking stock schedules, you can see the deferred revenue as of March 31, 2023, and you can go back and look at the you look at our first quarter from last year, you can see the deferred revenue related to Formula One at 2022. It's up roughly $130 million, give or take, and you could think of that largely being related to Vegas, although there are other puts and takes."

            "name": "Stefano Domenicali",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Good morning from Miami. We are thrilled to be back for our second Miami Grand Prix, where the excitement in the city is as vibrant as year one. This year event feature on expanded Paddock now located inside the Dolphins Stadium and upgraded Paddock Club and a fully resurfaced track. We have four races into our record 2023 race calendar. While Red Bull has dominated the race to date, it is still very early in the season and the races have been packed with excitement and drama. Alonso fans have unmatched cheer about with Aston Martin recent performance. Alonso first place finishes in Saudi Arabia, marked his 100 podium, making him one of only six drivers in F1 history to claim these feet. The Australian Grand Prix featured three red flags adding even more complexity to this strategy and ended with only 12 of 20 drivers crossing the finish line. The new sprint format was unanimous approved by the teams F1 and FIA advance of Baku. We all believe that the new format is the right one for our fans and the sport and increase the level of intensity and action across the weekend. Starting the season at the six sprint events, all three days of the weekend will be packed with on track excitement. The Saturday Sprint Shootout is a shorter qualifying session to determine the sprint grid later that day. This makes the sprint standard on event with no bearing on the Grand Prix, allowing drivers to find more aggressively without fear to raise of the implication. Formula One is engaging with our fans across platform. Global audiences exceed 70 million viewers for the first two races of the season with significant increases in key markets across Europe and North America. In the U.S., the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix broke 1.52 million viewers marking ESPN and cables most viewed Grand Prix on record. Across our digital channels, F1 reached 62.9 million social media followers as of Q1, up 31% year-over-year. Our f1.com website and F1 apps have launched additional content including a new what is F1 section dedicated to new fans with videos and beginner's guide to the sport. Crowds continue to flock to our races globally. The vast majority of events are sold out for the 2023 season. Bahrain set his new record with nearly a 100,000 fans over the weekend. Melbourne top at last year record as the largest weekend sporting event in the recent Australian history. We welcomed 445,000 fans over the course of the weekend up from 420,000 the prior year. This also marks a new record this century perform one internal total race weekend attendance. Turning to recent updates on our commercial agreements. On race promotion, we extended our Austrian Grand Prix through 2027 fully in last year sold out crowd of 303,000 fans. This year event will mark our 10th anniversary since F1 returned to Spielberg [ph]. We also announced the extension of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix through 2026. On Meteorite, we entered into a multiyear extension of our partnership with ESPN to broadcast F1 channel, in Latin America and in the Caribbean. ESPN will provide live coverage of over half of the races with the full season available on the streaming service Star Plus. ESPN has continued to develop dedicated content across web and social platforms, allowing us to expand our global reach and attract and increasingly the diverse fan base. Our Pro and Access product continue to see solid subscriber growth this season. On sponsorship, we made the Liqui Moly an official partner. Our enhanced agreement includes track signage at the three races and visual branding out 15 races demonstrated the opportunity for digital ad insertion within the broadcast fee. We first welcomed Liqui Moly as regional sponsor in 2019, grew our relation to official sports in 2020 and now official partner in 2023. We continue to demonstrate growing value to our partners. We were thrilled to announce Paramount+ as an official partner following our successful sport and entertainment collaboration last season. Our new multiyear agreement will feature the popular series at Fan Zone on trackside display and in digital placement. This week, we announced Puma as official provider of F1 sports and apparel in a new multiyear partnership and we extended our agreement with MSC Cruises as global partner throughout 2026. As part of the extension, MSC will bring a unique specialty experience. Our sponsorship pipeline remains strong. To try to survive return for its fifth season in February, avid, casual and new fans alike continue to be drawn to the cities. The latest season didn't disappoint. On April 14, we celebrate the topping out of our Las Vegas Grand Prix Paddock Building by placing a symbolic concrete barrier on top of the structure. We are very pleased with our progress. The efficiency of this project is a function of the incredible collaboration between the Las Vegas Grand Prix team, our talented design and construction crew and local officials. We thank them all for their support. The Paddock Building spans 1,000 feet long, 100 feet wide and three stories told with the rooftop deck. It will be the largest Paddock Building on the race calendar and will host the largest Paddock club. On the roof, we have a 28,000 square foot LED screen in the shape of our F1 logo that provides unparalleled branding opportunities. When you fly over Las Vegas, you will know that F1 has established a permanent home in the U.S. We can monetize the LED screen and display third-party branding in the future years. The building itself has advanced AV capabilities, temporary walls between thin garages and additional features ensures ample flexibility to convert the entire space for a broad range of year-round users. Future year-round activation are under development, and we hope to have more to share in the coming months. I encourage you to visit the Las Vegas Grand Prix website for the time lapse video of the extraordinary construction progress. Our track surfaces of Las Vegas roads began last month, and the second phase is scheduled for July. Once complete, this track surface can last six years to 10 years. The team also recently announced addition to this sponsorship lineup. Virgin Hotel, Las Vegas was named an event partner, and will have entitlement to the East Harmon Fan Zone. Hard Rock International, who's name of presenting partner and will build a grandstand in front of the mirage on the street. In March, we announced an event partnership with Switch, the technology infrastructure company who will supply LVGP with its sustainable goals and establish [indiscernible] conscious practice for the race we can and beyond. Finally, touching on our broader F1 sustainability and inclusion effort. The European Union recently recognized the role that sustainable fuel needs to play as part of the automotive solution alongside the electric vehicles up to 2035. This cement the future of sustainable fuels following F1 extensive work with policymakers. Our F2 and F3 cars are running 55% sustainable fuels this season. Current F1 cars are running at 10% sustainable fuels, and we are on track to introduce 100% advanced sustainable fuels in 2026. The F1 Academy, our new/old series, began its season in Austria last weekend, following two testing session in Barcelona and Paul Ricard [ph] in France. Congratulations to Marta Garcia from Prime Racing on winning two of the three races on opening weekend, with just 0.3 seconds separating her and the second place finisher in the third place. The season will have seven race weekends with the final race alongside us in Austin in October. I'm pleased to say that in 2024 season, we'll have all F1 Academy races joined F1 weekends. The creation of F1 Academy is an important step forward towards increasing opportunity for female participation in motor sports. It is the start of a journey, and we hope it will be aspirational for young female drivers aspiring to reach professional motor sport; we now have the F1 Academy to aim for. I believe we are creating the best possible structure to find and nurture female talent, including those already in the series and those yet to come through from the grassroots level. We are looking forward to the season. Yesterday, F1 partnered with Custom Events from Wall Street Journal or to host our first F1 Accelerate Summit. We brought together Trailblazer from the walls of sport, entertainment and business to discuss how they can make a significant impact on the future of technology performance, diversity and sustainability not only in their own business, but across interesting culture. We welcome familiar faces from the F1 Group and management alongside Marquee Sports figures including Maria Sharapova and [indiscernible]. Jay Leno was our host as business executives traveled from across the country into the Jerry Bruckheimer, Joe Kosinski, Maverick Carter, Sarah Harden and Brooke Magnus [ph]. We hope to continue leverage F1 brands to drive innovation and commercial success for the sporting and entertainment worlds. It is an exciting time for Formula One on the track and in the commercial operation. Our unusual early season sprint break didn't have a mandatory shutdown like summer break meaning it was hard at work with their cars upgrade. I believe competition will intensifies as the season progresses. Miami caused us the first doubleheader of the season before we head to Europe for the first triple-header. There is plenty of action to come of [indiscernible] full speed ahead. And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Well, thanks, Dave. Of course, we did that thing in accordance with the teams and with the FIA because as you know, our idea is to make sure that during the racing weekend there is always action on the track. Actually, the result of the first one of this year has been very encouraging and every one of our partners, promoter, media partners and also team are very positive about that. Of course, there is something that we want to take as a lesson learned to see at the end of summer if there is something that we can learn to do some \u2013 even something better. But in a general term, the first weekend of the sprint format has been great. And I think that as always we wanted to do something different in a very standardized ecosystem, the reaction of the, let's say, the traditional fans is the one that needs to be awaited for longer term. But normally with the new fans, we've seen a very, very positive reaction. Promoter was pushing for that. And I would say the real thing is that we don't want to go in a situation where in the future we're going to have all the races with the sprint format. We want to keep a limited number of bit, maybe one third of the calendar number, and create something special with regard to the competition that we can give sporting value with trophies and of course commercial opportunity to these things. But I think that's the right way to go. And if I may summarize another thing that I think is important, I see a big trend today in Motor Sport not to be stable, let's say not to stay consistent with your regulation. We are just following what the base will be, I just following what the NBA has done. So that means that all the professional sport needs to listen to the request and to the new input that the fans, promoters, and partners are asking to have more excitement around the game. So positive and looking forward to keep working on this project. So if I may the first part of it, F1 TV is really working very well. You know that we are not providing any numbers on that. But what I can tell you in terms of quality, in term of products and in term of attention is also an opportunity to select new market where there is not really a strong broadcaster provider. And we are doing that with certain countries and the effect is regular. We have a new plan also to update some of the content that we want to give to our fans. And as I said, after a couple of years of very high investment, now we are paying back what has been a great decision taken couple of years ago. Brian, do you want to progress with the other question? You get to asking straight up front. And if you may add another comment at a direct qualitative effect is that with this investment, we are pushing also after the quality of the promoters that are already very important for us in Formula One. So now the game is to have unique events that are working very, very well, of course, commercially viable, but I would say that direct effect as given to the system not lifting the quality approach of every grand prix. If I may add one comment... So Vijay, I just want to add two comments that I think it's important to consider a number that at the end of the day, it's important to remember that the teams are benefiting for what we are doing so far. I mean investing in Vegas for them is an incredible opportunity and directly also for them to develop their business. And indirectly, it will get our proposition even stronger as an ecosystem in Formula One. So, I think that is really something that as I was mentioning, we have a prudential approach that gives you the magnitude of what we need to do and need to deliver a dispose will be very, very important for all of us. Nothing because I think that you sympathize perfectly the situation. And I think that will be our strategies now. .: So I would say now the real thing is not to work only on the already more, but making sure that each of them receive the right qualitative answer to their question. And the other thing that I think is really relevant like this in another way, the fact that we receive this on the sustainability platform because no one will invest today in a business that is not credible on this landscape. Therefore, that is another push that we receive from our partners to make sure that our goals with sustainability [indiscernible] has been achieved. So it's \u2013 let's say a constructive push that we are working together in order to be stronger and stronger together. Thank you, Greg. I mean with regard to the situation of a new team potentially entering or interesting for one. No, as we said, there are someone that is quite vocal. Some others are quite silent. As you may know, David, there is a process in place that has been activated by the regulator to see and to collect the interest of other partners to be part of one. The first time will be finished, I think, within the middle of May. And then there will be the analysis done properly, checking the technical visibility, the financial feasibility and that we're going to have the discussion to see if any kind of potential enter will fit into the equation of creating more value to the sport. And that's something that we're going to take the decision at the right time within the end of this year. That's the plan. But of course, that is once again showing the growth of Formula One. I mean, just a couple of years ago, the [indiscernible] team was very small, actually, almost none. Today, the value of the franchise is very high. So we have the duty to protect the business and making the right decision. And this is something we're going to do within the end of this year."

Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference will be recorded November 7th. I would now like to turn the call over to Shane Kleinstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nShane Kleinstein: Thank you, and good morning.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO.\nGreg Maffei: Thank you. Good morning. Today speaking in the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali, and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. So let me start with a couple of corporate updates. As you may recall, we completed the LSXM-Siri merger on the 9th of September. I look forward to remaining involved as Board Chair and a shareholder at Siri, but Liberty's ties are cut. We also announced updates to our voting and governance at the Atlanta Braves Holdings, and we are transitioning services directly to the Atlanta team. They held their earnings call yesterday. This is the next step in their evolution as a standalone private company, and I want to thank all the Braves management team for their partnership over the years. It's been so fruitful. Now let me turn to the underlying businesses, beginning with the Formula One group and looking at it from some corporate update perspective. We refinanced the F1 date. The Term Loan B was refinanced at SOFR plus 200 bps. We expect to step down to SOFR plus 175 bps upon the deleveraging post the MotoGP transaction. We raised an incremental 850 Term Loan B and 150 million Term Loan A, commitments to fund that MotoGP transaction. All of that is deal contingent. We also issued 949 million FWONK shares, replacing the equity consideration to the sellers in the transaction, so we'll directly pay them cash. We issued that stock at only a 4% discount to the market price, and it was placed with long-term holders. Those transactions complete the necessary funding for our MotoGP acquisition, and we expect F1 leverage to be between 3.5 to 4 times, assuming a year-end close on that MotoGP deal. The F1 season itself remains highly competitive. Both the constructors' and drivers' championships are coming down to the final races. We've seen also similarly incredible financial performance at Formula One year-to-date, with revenue up 15% and adjusted OIBDA up 21%. We've seen double-digit growth across all of our revenue streams, boosted by two additional races. And we've benefited from new partners signed, contractual uplifts in our contracts, and the performance of F1 TV and our hospitality products. I know we've signed several new commercial agreements, which we begin next year. LVMH and AmEx were introduced to F1 through LVGP in terms of their relationship, but now they've become broader partners with F1. We feel that partners continue to be attracted to the growth of the sport in the EOS and our younger demographic, which has also grown. And correspondingly, we feel good about the pipeline for commercial activity in 2026. We all look forward to the LVGP in the coming weeks. We expect there will be another great spectacle for fans attending and watching at home. We will have a free daytime fan experience, which will bring energy and welcome local Las Vegas fans to F1. And we expect great entertainment, including Ludacris, Alesso, and OneRepublic. Now let me turn briefly and give you a MotoGP transaction update. We are making progress with the European Commission, which is our only remaining regulatory jurisdictional hurdle, and we continue to expect a year-end close. And looking at the underlying MotoGP business, the Valencia race was canceled due to the tragic flooding in that region. Our thoughts were with the entire community. We give credit to Carmelo and the management team at MotoGP for their quick and thoughtful response. They will pivot since the final race will be in Barcelona. It will be hosted there in solidarity with Valencia. And that will be the final race of the season. Various initiatives are also underway there to support relief efforts for Valencia during that weekend. MotoGP racing has continued to be great, with only 24 points separating the title fight participants. Attendance is trending well, with 2.9 million attendees year-to-date, which is plus 9% on leg-for-leg races. And six races have set all-time attendance records this year. And looking at the business updates, MotoGP extended its rights agreement with FIM, their regulator, until 2060. They've announced their 2025 MotoGP calendar with 22 races across 18 countries. And they expect to release a new brand identity post-season. We look forward to more exciting racing and Liberty's involvement. Turning briefly to Quint, as you may recall, Q3 is a seasonally light quarter. We've seen strong F1 experiences during the quarter, and we are also seeing positive movement across MotoGP products that they are selling. Profitability in the quarter was partially offset by softness at a different sporting event. And there was an agreement with a rights holder, which was subsequently terminated by a mutual agreement, which impacted our third quarter results. And just touching on Live Nation, they've had strong performance through the first half, despite fewer stadium concerts. They are set up very well for 2025, which will be a monster stadium year. But I won't comment further on results because LYB did not release their earnings until Tuesday. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results.\nBrian Wendling: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. The merger of Liberty SiriusXM with SiriusXM closed on September 9th. Please note that SiriusXM Holdings is presented as a discontinued operation in Liberty's consolidated financial statements. Please also note that due to the timing of the Live Nation release of their reported results, as Greg mentioned, Liberty does not expect to file its 10-Q until Tuesday, November 12th. At quarter end, Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments, and monetizable public holdings to $2.7 billion, which includes $1.4 billion of cash at F1 and $65 million of cash at Quint. Cash balance as of 930 also includes the proceeds from the previously mentioned FWONK share issuance. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $2.9 billion at quarter end, which includes $2.4 billion of debt at F1, leaving $530 million at the corporate level. F1's $500 million revolver is undrawn and their leverage at 930 was 1.1 times. During the quarter, Liberty entered into additional interest rate swaps, and as of quarter end, $2.2 billion of the $2.4 billion of F1 debt was at a fixed rate. In September, F1 refinanced its Term Loan B and extended the maturities of its debt facilities. The Term Loan A and revolving credit facility now mature in September 29, and the Term Loan B matures in September 2031. The margin on F1's Term Loan B was permanently reduced from 2.25% to 2% with a potential to step down to 1.75% if certain leverage is met after the MotoGP acquisition closes. In connection with the refinance, F1 secured incremental funding for the new MotoGP transaction, and all acquisition-related financing is now complete. Reminder that we also obtained commitments for an incremental \u20ac150 million Term Loan A and an upsized \u20ac100 million revolver at Dorna to be entered into subject to the transaction close. Turning to the F1 business, I'll make comments on Q3, but remind you that the business is best analyzed on an annual basis given the impact that both the race count and mix can have on quarterly results. During the third quarter, F1 recognized a lower proportion of season-based income with 7 out of 24 races for 29% occurring during the period compared to 8 out of 22 or 36% in the prior year period. Sponsorship revenue declined due to this lower pro rata revenue recognition. The recognition of sponsorship income varies based on the mix of races during the quarter, including the allocation of title sponsorship and other race-specific sponsorship packages. To a lesser extent, this also contributed to the sponsorship revenue decline for the third quarter. This was partially offset by revenue from new partners compared to the prior year period. The decline in pro rata recognition of Media rights revenue was partially offset by contractual fee increases and continued F1 TV growth. Race promotion revenue increased in the third quarter despite one less race being held due to the mix of events year over year with Azerbaijan this year compared to Austria and Japan last year. Other revenue increased due to the higher licensing revenue and revenue from third-party events at Grand Prix Plaza. Hospitality and experiences income decreased due to the mix of events in Q3, though note that the Paddock Club is seeing very strong growth year-to-date. Adjusted OIBDA grew in the quarter due to the lower pro rata recognition of team payments, partially offset by the expectation of increased team payments for the full year over 2023. Team payments represented 62.2% of pre-team adjusted OIBDA year-to-date through Q3 compared to 64.6% in the prior year. Reminder that Q2 and Q3 tend to have the highest percentage payout ratios based on the greater mix of European races. We continue to expect slight leverage on team payments for the full year \u201824 relative to our year-to-date payout as a percent of pre-team share OIBDA. It's consistent with the message we communicated on our Q2 call. Other costs of F1 revenue and SG&A should be viewed as a percent of total revenue. And looking on a year-to-date basis, the adjusted OIBDA margin improved from 24.4% to 25.8% through Q3 \u201824. Looking briefly at corporate and other results in the third quarter, corporate and other revenue was $70 million, which includes Quint results, and approximately $7 million of rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza. Corporate and other adjusted OIBDA loss was $14 million and includes Grand Prix Plaza rental income, Quint results, and corporate expenses. Quint results in the third quarter were primarily driven by F1 experiences across the seven races held. Note that Q3 is a seasonally light quarter for Quint. Turning to the Liberty Live group, there's attributed cash of $388 million. There's $400 million of undrawn marginal loan capacity related to our Live Nation marginal loan. As of November 6, the value of the Live Nation stock held at Liberty Live Group was $8.8 billion. We have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. In August, Liberty issued a redemption notice for all of its 0.5% Live Nation exchangeable debentures. Approximately $12 million of debentures were redeemed and settled in the third quarter, and the remainder were exchanged by holders in September but did not settle out until October. The $50 million remaining debentures that settled in October were funded with cash on hand. Liberty and F1 are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One.\nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Brian. It's been a fantastic season at F1. The competition across the grid is captivating odysseys in the stands and on the screen. We just completed a triple header in the Americas with amazing action exciting on and off the track. We have a three-way battle for the Constructor Championship between McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull. And the Driver's Championship is still very alive as we head into the final races between Verstappen and Norris, following three events in Austin, Mexico and Brazil, in front of huge crowds. It has been great to see the variety of winners this year. Something that is thrilling fans and raises excitement and the participation for a special season in 2025. Looking at our engagement across the season, 5.8 million fans have attended Grand Prix through Brazil. Attendance is up season to date, with sell-out crowds on many races and seven races setting new attendance records including the British Grand Prix, which welcomed 480,000 fans over the weekend, the largest crowd for the season. In the third quarter, we have massive crowds of over 300,000 at the Hungarian, Belgian, Dutch and Italian Grand Prix. We have also had a strong path to play Brazil this season, with attendance up across almost all races and four teams sold out. We have been expanding and innovating our hospitality products like the F1 Garage and the Monaco Yacht to continue to provide premium experience to our fans. Our promoter partners are investing in improved infrastructure and enhanced fan experience with live entertainment and on-site activation. Better fan experience benefits the promoters and the broader F1 brand. In Silverstone Castle with Kings of Lyon and Stormzy drew crowds on Thursday and Friday evenings. In Singapore, they had a festival-style lineup with over 100 hours of live entertainment in addition to the on-track action, including concerts with the Kylie Minogue and Lenny Kravitz. In Austin, over 100,000 fans attended Eminem's performance. The sprint races are also successfully drawing incremental audiences. Attendance on Friday of sprint weekends are up approximately 30% compared to non-sprint weekends. TV viewership on sprint weekends is also, on average, 10% greater than non-sprint weekends. This content offers incremental benefits for our promoters, broadcast partners and sponsors with increased exposure. Beyond sprints, average viewership for race weekends through Singapore averaged 65 million on leader TV channels, with around 20 million of incremental viewers on digital channels including YouTube and F1 TV. Viewership on digital channels continued to increase year over year. Looking at few races in particular, the British Grand Prix was the most viewed European race ever in the UK and drew record viewership in the U.S. for the event. F1 TV subscriber growth continued to be robust, with subscribers up 10% year over year and particularly strong in the US market. We continue to innovate on digital platforms with creative ways for fans to experience the world of F1 Worldwide. For example, this season we introduced video episodes for our F1 Beyond the Grid podcast and watch time is up over 30% since this format was introduced. Social media followers grew 38% year over year to 94 million, in part due to the new platform launches like Threads and WhatsApp. Our WhatsApp partnership enables a closer direct relationship with fans through the messaging platform. On the F1 app we registered 6 million unique users in the third quarter and we are seeing continued growth on the platform, contributed to a younger audience and higher engagement. F1 Arcade was thrilled to open their Washington DC location on October 13th, the second venue in the U.S. Their opening party on October 9th had nearly 1,000 guests. The DC location is hosting a number of Grand Prix watch parties this season, including one last month for the Austin Grand Prix, and it is inviting fans for other F1-inspired gatherings like the live recording of the F1 Explained podcast during the Mexico Grand Prix. F1 Arcade is on track to open its Las Vegas location in the third quarter of 2025. The F1 exhibition reached the first stop of its global tour in London, opening on August 23rd with great reviews from visitors. The location is already seeing incredible demand with 135,000 tickets sold and as a result the exhibition stays at the location as being extended through the first quarter of 2025. Turning to commercial updates, we have had incredible momentum in 2024 and that continues this quarter. Most notably, our new partnership with LDMH. For 2025, an expanded agreement with American Express and Lenovo demonstrates our ability to bring in iconic brands and scale our partnership into broader and larger deals. LDMH first partnered with Formula One for the last year's inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix with representation primarily from its Vulcan tequila brand. We will now welcome LDMH as a global partner under a groundbreaking 10-year deal beginning in 2025, which will see us partner with their iconic Maison Louis Vuitton, Moet NSC and Tag Heuer. We will provide additional details on specific activation by this brand early next year. American Express initially partnered with F1 in 2023 as a regional sponsor with branding and activation rights in the Americas. Beginning in 2025, we will expand our relationship globally, with American Express becoming an official partner encompassing Australia, Asia, Europe, the Americas and the Middle East. Similarly, we have announced that beginning in 2025, Lenovo will be expanded to a global partner from their previous official partner sponsorship. We are also actively adding partnerships in the new verticals. Santander joined as our official retail banking partner in a multi-year agreement beginning in 2025. This partnership supports Santander's open bank product, their digital bank that is particularly focused on U.S. market expansion. Formula One's success in the U.S. market was a key factor in securing the Santander partnership. One other area of focus gaining momentum is licensing. We were thrilled to announce recent partnerships with both LEGO and Mattel, both of which bring the world of F1 into our fans' day-to-day lives and extend our brand to new audiences. The LEGO product range features all F1 teams engaging content across LEGO digital platforms and facets of the F1 races weekend, including a Fan Zone activation. Our Mattel partnership kicked off this season with the release of a one-of-a-kind F1 car and the full range of Hot Wheels products we release next year. Looking to the rest of the season, we are weeks away from the second Las Vegas Grand Prix. The Las Vegas race has continued to serve as a testbed of innovation that we can leverage across the broader F1 calendar, including opportunities in the hospitality, tailored sponsorship, and licensing. Just last week, we announced the first-of-its-kind special merchandise collection for Las Vegas, ranging from a streetwear collaboration with a Venus brand to one-of-a-kind Vegas Golden Knights and Raiders 4. Since posting this merchandise collaboration on LVGP social channels, we've gathered over 1.2 million organic impressions across the post, with more than 93,000 engagements and 86,000 likes. This year's Las Vegas Grand Prix leverages learnings from last year across the whole event, including hospitality, logistics, ticketing, and more. We will continue to test, learn, and innovate in this year ahead. We are proud of our sustainability strategy and continue to make progress throughout the organization on our environmental, social, and governance efforts. In September, we made our first investment in sustainable aviation fuels, working with our partner DHL. These purchases cover approximately 11% of the estimated carbon flight emissions across the 2024 season, and flights powered by sustainable aviation fuels have an estimated 80% reduction in carbon emissions per flight. We look forward to more progress through the end of this year and into 2025. In closing, Formula One is in a great position, with strong financial growth and incredible on-track action. It's looking like the three-way battle for the constructor will come down to the final races. We thank our fans, teams, and partners for their support in this record season and look forward to more action to come. [Non-English] Full speed ahead. And now, I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Thanks, Stefano and Brian. I want to clear up one thing I might have misspoken during our corporate upgrade. On the Braves, they are transitioning to a standalone public company. We look forward to seeing you on Thursday, November 14th for our Annual Investor Meeting. You can tune in virtually or join us in person at our new location, Jazz at Lincoln Center. If you plan to attend in person, please make sure to register by Monday, November 11th, as there will be no on-site registration. The link to register can be found on our website. John Mueller and I will be hosting our annual Q&A session. If you would like to submit questions in advance, you can email investorday@libertymedia.com. We appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media. And Operator, with that, I'd like to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hey, thanks for the question. First for Greg or Stefano, just on Concord, any potential updates you can provide there on progress, tone of talks, or expected timing? And then a second one for Brian. Just on the team payment accrual in the quarter or even year-to-date, the figures do imply a lower full-year figure relative to what you would give in a Q1 or Q2. I just wanted to see if there's anything specific to call out in your quarter that shifted as far as your assumptions on pre-team profit for the year. Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: Stefano, I'll let you take a first cut at the Concord.\nStefano Domenicali: Yeah, thank you, Greg. Thanks, David. I mean, as we said, first of all, it's very important to remember that we have still plenty of time under the existing Concord, so there is no urgent rush. Conversations are progressing very well. And as we said before, very, very positive, because at this moment the ecosystem is very solid. And also all the teams and all the levels to quarter have had a huge benefit from everyone in this moment. So the financial security for the future and stability that we have today it's underlining what we are preparing. And as soon as we have everything ready, of course, we will inform everyone. But as always, as I said, we want to do the right thing and consider there's no rush. Everything is progressing well, as we said, and looking forward to confirming to you when we're going to announce something concrete.\nGreg Maffei: So I would just add that, to Stefano's point, the most important thing for everybody, including ourselves and the teams, is to get it right. And so we're progressing at a good pace with the expectation that everyone will sign with glee on their face.\nBrian Wendling: Yeah, and David, on the team payments, as you rightly point out, they've come down just a little bit on a per race basis. I think that that represents some conservatism towards Vegas, because really that's the last remaining uncontracted revenue stream that we have for the year. And it largely reflects typical year two trends that promoters see. So that would be the primary reason.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kutgun Maral with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nKutgun Maral: Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Just on Formula One sponsorship, clearly there's a lot of momentum there. You've announced a number of new and expanded agreements. Seems like 2025 is going to be a banner year. And, Greg, I think you commented that you feel good about the pipeline for commercial activity in 2026 as well. Can you help us just think about how meaningful the sponsorship revenue growth outlook can be in the coming years? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: I'll take a first cut if it's okay, Stefano.\nStefano Domenicali: Yeah, absolutely.\nGreg Maffei: Look, you've seen the announcements here that are mostly \u201825 related. It's unusual. One would not expect to be making announcements yet about \u201826 related deals. But we have a lot of activity going on around potential sponsorship, around licensing and other activities. So it's very hard. You're still quite a ways out from those. But I feel good about the progress. I don't know if you have anything, Stefano.\nStefano Domenicali: No, I would say for sure. And, as always, we need to remember we were just a couple of years ago in terms of quantity and also quality of our partnership. Now we have grown significantly in terms of quantity. And, of course, now the time is really to check in terms of restructuring the deals in terms of global, regional, official partners, due to the fact that we have a strong interest in our market so far. So there are for sure other that we will exploit in the future. But the only thing that I can confirm, as Greg was mentioning, is really, we are really bringing in the interest that we are having from partners that are high, high, high value in the market. And that will be another leverage because through a B2B business growth within the relationship we can create with all the partners, we can create even more interest in our platform. So, as I said, look back and see where we were and look where we are. And I think that the future will be very positive again.\nGreg Maffei: Yeah, and one thing I would add, almost more towards David's question, that the sponsorship that we've announced for 2025, you've also seen, that's all moving into \u201825. So any expectations that we had for those new agreements for 2024 also have that impact on team payment.\nKutgun Maral: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Laszczyk: Hey, great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two on Formula 1, maybe first for Greg on Media rights, just curious for your latest thoughts on the sports media rights landscape heading into the U.S. renewal next year and maybe how you're approaching your negotiations with ESPN? And then second on Vegas, Brian, you mentioned the Las Vegas Grand Prix being the last uncontracted piece of the puzzle here. Just curious if there's anything more you can say on demand for Vegas heading into the final few weeks and any expectations around revenue and profitability for the event this year. Thank you.\nBrian Wendling: Stephen, thanks for the question. I'll start on the Media side. As I think is well known, we have a partnership with ESPN that runs to the end of \u201825. It would be not atypical that there is some negotiating period with them. I'm obviously not going to disclose the specifics. ESPN has been a great partner. We will look to see what we can do with them, but there's also a lot of other interest from partners, and we'll try and construct the deal that manages to bring both the best economic opportunity for F1, but even more importantly, perhaps, expose our fans the best experience in a logical way across as much breadth as possible. So, as always, we're going to play between economics and reach and hopefully come up with the best result for our F1 fans and ourselves. I'll let Renee talk a little bit about Las Vegas.\nRenee Wilm: Thanks, Greg. Maybe we can just take a step back, focus on what we've been working on here in year two. Obviously, year one, we were very much focused on the quality of the fan experience. Year two has been a lot of focus around cost structure and optimizing our product ladder. We do expect that to continue going into years three and beyond. We made a number of improvements coming into this year, which have allowed us to continue to be dynamic in adjusting products and pricing based on real-time feedback we're receiving from the market. We would note the all-in cost of a Vegas race weekend has come into line with the other U.S. races, and we would refer you to the commentary from our hotel partners, Wynn and Caesars, regarding the continued strength of F1. In terms of recent activity, as expected, we are seeing an uptick in traffic and conversion rates around ticket sales, and we expect that to continue as we get closer to the race weekend. We are, of course, benefiting from the very competitive championship this year, and we have seen success with our recent promotions, including the Lewis Hamilton package and some special offerings that we've run in partnership with our sponsors, Timo and AmEx. We still have room to grow on ticket sales, but we are very excited to see year two come together over the next couple of weeks. And, of course, we remain very positive on the benefits that Vegas is providing to the broader ecosystem of Formula One, including the LVMH deal, American Express, and getting back to the media rights renewal. We're looking to see the benefit of Vegas next year as well when Greg starts those discussions.\nStephen Laszczyk: That's great. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. I'm not sure, Greg, how much you would be willing to comment, but Live Nation stock has been quite strong the last few months, some of that, I think, in anticipation, correctly, I guess, of the election outcome. What do you think a Republican DOJ means for the range of outcomes for the lawsuit against Live Nation and its ability to navigate that successfully from a shareholder point of view? And then, at the risk of beating team payments to death, Brian, I think you've shown over 200 basis points of leverage year to date. How are you thinking about the full year versus that? And how much of a swing factor is Las Vegas? Is that sort of a larger than normal variable when you think about your business as we think about the full year? Thanks so much.\nGreg Maffei: Ben, it was nice of you to set up and acknowledge it would be very difficult for me to comment, and I think you caught that. But Live Nation continues to prosper as a business and continue to believe it serves customers well, and there is no basis for the lawsuit, and I don't think that's going to change. Their view is not going to change regardless of the administration. Brian?\nBrian Wendling: Yeah, on team payments, like we said last quarter, Ben, slight leverage, I think de minimis might have been the words I used when we were at 61.9% at year to date Q2, so we're going to stick with that. In terms of Vegas being a swing factor, I mean, if you think about our business, most of the revenues are contracted, most of the costs are contracted. The two big swing factors in any given year are the sponsorship go-get and then Vegas ticket sales because those have the highest volatility. So, yeah, as you get closer to the end of the year, you start to get more clarity on both of those, although Vegas being a last-minute market, as we've pointed out many times, there's lots of work to be done as you enter Q4. So it can be a swing factor, but we continue to be optimistic here.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Cardiff with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Cardiff: Great. Thank you. Not to look too far ahead, but I guess how are you thinking about the opportunity for race promotion and the race calendar in 2026? Is that a year when we could start to see some new venues added to the calendar and just more broadly how you're thinking about your positioning for renewals given the elevated attendance you've seen over the past few years? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: Stefano, do you want to take a cut?\nStefano Domenicali: Okay. Thanks, Greg. Of course, \u201826 race promotion, as you know, we have Madrid that will be part of the calendar. We have long-term deals on the other side, as you know, that is represented the vast majority of our situation today, and these allow us, of course, to work with them in order to promote better quality, to make sure that what we want to offer to our customers to level is the highest standard. In \u201826 and further beyond, of course, we have some news to share very, very soon with regard to the possibility in the midterm to have some rotational European Grand Prix and some other new options coming later. And this is something that, of course, we will clarify in the due course. It is true that we have a large demand of even new possible venues that want to come in, and our choice will be always balanced between the right economical benefits that we can have as a system and also to leverage in the growth of the market that we can see potential will be beneficial for us to grow even further our business. So it's something that we are managing in the right way. And thank God today, we have a quality problem to handle. That was not the case just a couple of years ago.\nRyan Cardiff: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Kraft: Hi. Good morning. And two, if I could, first on media rights. Are there other major markets in the Americas that have media rights contracts coming up for renewal around the same time as the U.S.? And might we consequently see in America's media rights deal rather than just the U.S. contract this time around? And then also related to that, how has what you value from your U.S. media partner changed since the renewal with ESPN given just how streaming has become such a larger part of the business now? And then just separately sort of a follow-up on Vegas, maybe to ask a little more bluntly, I mean, it sounds like promotion revenue is clearly going to be up, but ticket prices are going to be down. So probably overall ticket revenue is going to be down. Is that a fair interpretation of what Renee was going through before? Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: So if it's okay, Stefano, I'll take a cut on the media. Look, we would love to find a partner who would take on more markets. That's always very interesting and make ease of perhaps for them and us. There are no huge renewals in the Americas that make it logical, not to say it wouldn't happen, but I don't think it would be an enormous economic swing in any case if we bundled with somebody for all the Americas. We certainly have had rumors of larger deals, and in some cases we certainly do have regional deals, but I'm not sure that's going to work for the Americas that way, that there's some partner who is going to take all of it that way. As far as streaming, obviously we see the rise of streaming. We've noticed across a couple of our businesses, we certainly notice. The reality is we have a great stream product in F1 TV ourselves, which has shown tremendous growth, and we would look to consider whether a media partner how we interacted with them on both a linear side if it existed and the streaming side and how our F1 TV fit in. But clearly streaming is going to be a more major component of all sports rights packages going forward. Renee, do you want to comment?\nBryan Kraft: Thank you. And on Vegas, or sorry, go ahead.\nRenee Wilm: Sure, yes, happy to. So I guess just to reiterate, we generally do not give race-specific economics, but with regard to your question on ticket revenue, aggregate ticket revenue will be down from what we originally budgeted in Q1. However, throughout the course of \u201824, we have also continued to reduce costs from what we budgeted in Q1. So I would say that we're working hard to focus on getting the best profitability that we can from Vegas, and again we would refer you to the broader benefit that it does bring to the F1 ecosystem.\nBryan Kraft: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Joyce with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Joyce: Thank you. Two little questions, please. One was just a little bit more on the media rights. Just given that some of your recent deals have been extended beyond the typical kind of three-year period we used to see, and other sports leagues have done that as well, just wondering how you're thinking about your objectives with these upcoming rights deals? And then the second question is on just a little one on the accounting of how you'll be recognizing the F1 movie next year? Thanks.\nGreg Maffei: So I think on the media rights deals I outlined some of our goals in terms of growing reach and making it a great experience for our fans, as well as payments to us. So I think all of those goals remain the same. We've chosen market by market longer or shorter deals based on where we stood in the market, what our growth was, what our partners were doing, and what we wanted to go. And obviously one of the reasons we cut a shorter deal in the U.S. last time is we were confident and really betting on ourselves that we would get a larger renewal down the road. That did work the first time we did a three-year deal. I'm optimistic it will work again. I'm not projecting whether the deal will be shorter or longer. I would note it's likely, particularly if you went to another partner, which I'm not sure that's going to happen. You probably would cut a longer deal just because that partner would want to have some period to grow into it and work together. But that's just observing on the media market. That's not projecting what we will or will not do on the U.S. And on the F1 movie, we've been paid in 2023 and 2024 for their use of the paddock building and having access to certain races. I think going forward the revenues that you would expect there would be pretty small.\nDavid Joyce: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBarton Crockett: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. I guess a couple if I can. One is turning to Vegas, looking beyond the race. I know there's been some hope that the off-season could be monetized at Vegas and that could help maybe the margin profile. And I was just wondering if you could give us an update of your progress there. Are you really doing anything meaningful in the off-season? You mentioned the film. I'm just wondering if there's anything else meaningful happening.\nRenee Wilm: Sure. So we are working hard to launch the year-round business beyond just the event conference segment. Beginning in, I'd say, late Q1 of \u201825, it's going to be actually very much focused around educating new fans, bringing the new fans deeper into the sport. Obviously Las Vegas is a destination. And we want to try to leverage that and bring these visitors to learn more about Formula One, coming deeper into the U.S. culture. There will be a carding business there. There will also be a fun, interactive experience, sort of 3D, 4D type offering, which will also include a little bit of the legacy F1 exhibition type educational experience as well. And then we will be looking to package those experiences to enhance the event conference space. So a lot more to come, and we hope to be giving more specifics around that business during race week.\nBarton Crockett: Okay. And then, you know, if I could just follow up also on sponsorships. Just to be clear, with all these announcements starting in 2025, it sounds like 2025 is going to be a strong year for sponsorship. But I was just wondering if you could comment on that more directly. Is that what we're seeing?\nGreg Maffei: Yes.\nBarton Crockett: Okay, great. Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: It's going to be a good year, Barton, you called it correctly.\nBarton Crockett: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Jonathan Navarrete with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Navarrete: Hey, good morning. Just my question is around the new markets and expansion. Are there any plans to expand the race calendar, especially in emerging markets? And what I'm trying to get at is, I'm trying to get a sense of what your approach to balancing market expansion while maintaining the exclusivity or the allure of Formula 1?\nGreg Maffei: Stefano, do you want to talk about expanding race calendar? I think I know the answer, but I'll let you go off on it.\nStefano Domenicali: No, thanks, Greg, I would say. As we said, we believe that the balance we have in terms of numbers is the right one. So 24 is the balance number that we feel is the right to keep exactly what you say, Jonathan. And I do believe that all the propositions that are coming on our table is just giving us the possibility to make even the better choice for our future. So, as always, we need to be balanced, knowing that we cannot follow only the pure direct financial proposition because that is different from region to region, but it's up to us to propose to our stakeholders the right choice. And I think that we are in a good momentum to make sure that the strategy for the future is even stronger. And that's why we are so confident about the fact that this will help to enhance our platform on the sport, on social, and business perspective.\nJonathan Navarrete: Thank you.\nGreg Maffei: So I think that, operator, we're done on questions, and we're done with the conference today. As I mentioned, we look forward to seeing many of you either virtually or in person next week at our Investor Day. Thanks for joining and your interest in Liberty Media.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Greg Maffei",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning. Today speaking in the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali, and Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. So let me start with a couple of corporate updates. As you may recall, we completed the LSXM-Siri merger on the 9th of September. I look forward to remaining involved as Board Chair and a shareholder at Siri, but Liberty's ties are cut. We also announced updates to our voting and governance at the Atlanta Braves Holdings, and we are transitioning services directly to the Atlanta team. They held their earnings call yesterday. This is the next step in their evolution as a standalone private company, and I want to thank all the Braves management team for their partnership over the years. It's been so fruitful. Now let me turn to the underlying businesses, beginning with the Formula One group and looking at it from some corporate update perspective. We refinanced the F1 date. The Term Loan B was refinanced at SOFR plus 200 bps. We expect to step down to SOFR plus 175 bps upon the deleveraging post the MotoGP transaction. We raised an incremental 850 Term Loan B and 150 million Term Loan A, commitments to fund that MotoGP transaction. All of that is deal contingent. We also issued 949 million FWONK shares, replacing the equity consideration to the sellers in the transaction, so we'll directly pay them cash. We issued that stock at only a 4% discount to the market price, and it was placed with long-term holders. Those transactions complete the necessary funding for our MotoGP acquisition, and we expect F1 leverage to be between 3.5 to 4 times, assuming a year-end close on that MotoGP deal. The F1 season itself remains highly competitive. Both the constructors' and drivers' championships are coming down to the final races. We've seen also similarly incredible financial performance at Formula One year-to-date, with revenue up 15% and adjusted OIBDA up 21%. We've seen double-digit growth across all of our revenue streams, boosted by two additional races. And we've benefited from new partners signed, contractual uplifts in our contracts, and the performance of F1 TV and our hospitality products. I know we've signed several new commercial agreements, which we begin next year. LVMH and AmEx were introduced to F1 through LVGP in terms of their relationship, but now they've become broader partners with F1. We feel that partners continue to be attracted to the growth of the sport in the EOS and our younger demographic, which has also grown. And correspondingly, we feel good about the pipeline for commercial activity in 2026. We all look forward to the LVGP in the coming weeks. We expect there will be another great spectacle for fans attending and watching at home. We will have a free daytime fan experience, which will bring energy and welcome local Las Vegas fans to F1. And we expect great entertainment, including Ludacris, Alesso, and OneRepublic. Now let me turn briefly and give you a MotoGP transaction update. We are making progress with the European Commission, which is our only remaining regulatory jurisdictional hurdle, and we continue to expect a year-end close. And looking at the underlying MotoGP business, the Valencia race was canceled due to the tragic flooding in that region. Our thoughts were with the entire community. We give credit to Carmelo and the management team at MotoGP for their quick and thoughtful response. They will pivot since the final race will be in Barcelona. It will be hosted there in solidarity with Valencia. And that will be the final race of the season. Various initiatives are also underway there to support relief efforts for Valencia during that weekend. MotoGP racing has continued to be great, with only 24 points separating the title fight participants. Attendance is trending well, with 2.9 million attendees year-to-date, which is plus 9% on leg-for-leg races. And six races have set all-time attendance records this year. And looking at the business updates, MotoGP extended its rights agreement with FIM, their regulator, until 2060. They've announced their 2025 MotoGP calendar with 22 races across 18 countries. And they expect to release a new brand identity post-season. We look forward to more exciting racing and Liberty's involvement. Turning briefly to Quint, as you may recall, Q3 is a seasonally light quarter. We've seen strong F1 experiences during the quarter, and we are also seeing positive movement across MotoGP products that they are selling. Profitability in the quarter was partially offset by softness at a different sporting event. And there was an agreement with a rights holder, which was subsequently terminated by a mutual agreement, which impacted our third quarter results. And just touching on Live Nation, they've had strong performance through the first half, despite fewer stadium concerts. They are set up very well for 2025, which will be a monster stadium year. But I won't comment further on results because LYB did not release their earnings until Tuesday. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results. Thanks, Stefano and Brian. I want to clear up one thing I might have misspoken during our corporate upgrade. On the Braves, they are transitioning to a standalone public company. We look forward to seeing you on Thursday, November 14th for our Annual Investor Meeting. You can tune in virtually or join us in person at our new location, Jazz at Lincoln Center. If you plan to attend in person, please make sure to register by Monday, November 11th, as there will be no on-site registration. The link to register can be found on our website. John Mueller and I will be hosting our annual Q&A session. If you would like to submit questions in advance, you can email investorday@libertymedia.com. We appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media. And Operator, with that, I'd like to open the line for questions. Stefano, I'll let you take a first cut at the Concord. So I would just add that, to Stefano's point, the most important thing for everybody, including ourselves and the teams, is to get it right. And so we're progressing at a good pace with the expectation that everyone will sign with glee on their face. I'll take a first cut if it's okay, Stefano. Look, you've seen the announcements here that are mostly \u201825 related. It's unusual. One would not expect to be making announcements yet about \u201826 related deals. But we have a lot of activity going on around potential sponsorship, around licensing and other activities. So it's very hard. You're still quite a ways out from those. But I feel good about the progress. I don't know if you have anything, Stefano. Yeah, and one thing I would add, almost more towards David's question, that the sponsorship that we've announced for 2025, you've also seen, that's all moving into \u201825. So any expectations that we had for those new agreements for 2024 also have that impact on team payment. Ben, it was nice of you to set up and acknowledge it would be very difficult for me to comment, and I think you caught that. But Live Nation continues to prosper as a business and continue to believe it serves customers well, and there is no basis for the lawsuit, and I don't think that's going to change. Their view is not going to change regardless of the administration. Brian? Stefano, do you want to take a cut? So if it's okay, Stefano, I'll take a cut on the media. Look, we would love to find a partner who would take on more markets. That's always very interesting and make ease of perhaps for them and us. There are no huge renewals in the Americas that make it logical, not to say it wouldn't happen, but I don't think it would be an enormous economic swing in any case if we bundled with somebody for all the Americas. We certainly have had rumors of larger deals, and in some cases we certainly do have regional deals, but I'm not sure that's going to work for the Americas that way, that there's some partner who is going to take all of it that way. As far as streaming, obviously we see the rise of streaming. We've noticed across a couple of our businesses, we certainly notice. The reality is we have a great stream product in F1 TV ourselves, which has shown tremendous growth, and we would look to consider whether a media partner how we interacted with them on both a linear side if it existed and the streaming side and how our F1 TV fit in. But clearly streaming is going to be a more major component of all sports rights packages going forward. Renee, do you want to comment? So I think on the media rights deals I outlined some of our goals in terms of growing reach and making it a great experience for our fans, as well as payments to us. So I think all of those goals remain the same. We've chosen market by market longer or shorter deals based on where we stood in the market, what our growth was, what our partners were doing, and what we wanted to go. And obviously one of the reasons we cut a shorter deal in the U.S. last time is we were confident and really betting on ourselves that we would get a larger renewal down the road. That did work the first time we did a three-year deal. I'm optimistic it will work again. I'm not projecting whether the deal will be shorter or longer. I would note it's likely, particularly if you went to another partner, which I'm not sure that's going to happen. You probably would cut a longer deal just because that partner would want to have some period to grow into it and work together. But that's just observing on the media market.

I think going forward the revenues that you would expect there would be pretty small. Yes. It's going to be a good year, Barton, you called it correctly. Stefano, do you want to talk about expanding race calendar? I think I know the answer, but I'll let you go off on it. So I think that, operator, we're done on questions, and we're done with the conference today. As I mentioned, we look forward to seeing many of you either virtually or in person next week at our Investor Day. Thanks for joining and your interest in Liberty Media."

            "name": "Brian Wendling",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. The merger of Liberty SiriusXM with SiriusXM closed on September 9th. Please note that SiriusXM Holdings is presented as a discontinued operation in Liberty's consolidated financial statements. Please also note that due to the timing of the Live Nation release of their reported results, as Greg mentioned, Liberty does not expect to file its 10-Q until Tuesday, November 12th. At quarter end, Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments, and monetizable public holdings to $2.7 billion, which includes $1.4 billion of cash at F1 and $65 million of cash at Quint. Cash balance as of 930 also includes the proceeds from the previously mentioned FWONK share issuance. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $2.9 billion at quarter end, which includes $2.4 billion of debt at F1, leaving $530 million at the corporate level. F1's $500 million revolver is undrawn and their leverage at 930 was 1.1 times. During the quarter, Liberty entered into additional interest rate swaps, and as of quarter end, $2.2 billion of the $2.4 billion of F1 debt was at a fixed rate. In September, F1 refinanced its Term Loan B and extended the maturities of its debt facilities. The Term Loan A and revolving credit facility now mature in September 29, and the Term Loan B matures in September 2031. The margin on F1's Term Loan B was permanently reduced from 2.25% to 2% with a potential to step down to 1.75% if certain leverage is met after the MotoGP acquisition closes. In connection with the refinance, F1 secured incremental funding for the new MotoGP transaction, and all acquisition-related financing is now complete. Reminder that we also obtained commitments for an incremental \u20ac150 million Term Loan A and an upsized \u20ac100 million revolver at Dorna to be entered into subject to the transaction close. Turning to the F1 business, I'll make comments on Q3, but remind you that the business is best analyzed on an annual basis given the impact that both the race count and mix can have on quarterly results. During the third quarter, F1 recognized a lower proportion of season-based income with 7 out of 24 races for 29% occurring during the period compared to 8 out of 22 or 36% in the prior year period. Sponsorship revenue declined due to this lower pro rata revenue recognition. The recognition of sponsorship income varies based on the mix of races during the quarter, including the allocation of title sponsorship and other race-specific sponsorship packages. To a lesser extent, this also contributed to the sponsorship revenue decline for the third quarter. This was partially offset by revenue from new partners compared to the prior year period. The decline in pro rata recognition of Media rights revenue was partially offset by contractual fee increases and continued F1 TV growth. Race promotion revenue increased in the third quarter despite one less race being held due to the mix of events year over year with Azerbaijan this year compared to Austria and Japan last year. Other revenue increased due to the higher licensing revenue and revenue from third-party events at Grand Prix Plaza. Hospitality and experiences income decreased due to the mix of events in Q3, though note that the Paddock Club is seeing very strong growth year-to-date. Adjusted OIBDA grew in the quarter due to the lower pro rata recognition of team payments, partially offset by the expectation of increased team payments for the full year over 2023. Team payments represented 62.2% of pre-team adjusted OIBDA year-to-date through Q3 compared to 64.6% in the prior year. Reminder that Q2 and Q3 tend to have the highest percentage payout ratios based on the greater mix of European races. We continue to expect slight leverage on team payments for the full year \u201824 relative to our year-to-date payout as a percent of pre-team share OIBDA. It's consistent with the message we communicated on our Q2 call. Other costs of F1 revenue and SG&A should be viewed as a percent of total revenue. And looking on a year-to-date basis, the adjusted OIBDA margin improved from 24.4% to 25.8% through Q3 \u201824. Looking briefly at corporate and other results in the third quarter, corporate and other revenue was $70 million, which includes Quint results, and approximately $7 million of rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza. Corporate and other adjusted OIBDA loss was $14 million and includes Grand Prix Plaza rental income, Quint results, and corporate expenses. Quint results in the third quarter were primarily driven by F1 experiences across the seven races held. Note that Q3 is a seasonally light quarter for Quint. Turning to the Liberty Live group, there's attributed cash of $388 million. There's $400 million of undrawn marginal loan capacity related to our Live Nation marginal loan. As of November 6, the value of the Live Nation stock held at Liberty Live Group was $8.8 billion. We have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. In August, Liberty issued a redemption notice for all of its 0.5% Live Nation exchangeable debentures. Approximately $12 million of debentures were redeemed and settled in the third quarter, and the remainder were exchanged by holders in September but did not settle out until October. The $50 million remaining debentures that settled in October were funded with cash on hand. Liberty and F1 are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. And with that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One. Yeah, and David, on the team payments, as you rightly point out, they've come down just a little bit on a per race basis. I think that that represents some conservatism towards Vegas, because really that's the last remaining uncontracted revenue stream that we have for the year. And it largely reflects typical year two trends that promoters see. So that would be the primary reason. Stephen, thanks for the question. I'll start on the Media side. As I think is well known, we have a partnership with ESPN that runs to the end of \u201825. It would be not atypical that there is some negotiating period with them. I'm obviously not going to disclose the specifics. ESPN has been a great partner. We will look to see what we can do with them, but there's also a lot of other interest from partners, and we'll try and construct the deal that manages to bring both the best economic opportunity for F1, but even more importantly, perhaps, expose our fans the best experience in a logical way across as much breadth as possible. So, as always, we're going to play between economics and reach and hopefully come up with the best result for our F1 fans and ourselves. I'll let Renee talk a little bit about Las Vegas. Yeah, on team payments, like we said last quarter, Ben, slight leverage, I think de minimis might have been the words I used when we were at 61.9% at year to date Q2, so we're going to stick with that. In terms of Vegas being a swing factor, I mean, if you think about our business, most of the revenues are contracted, most of the costs are contracted. The two big swing factors in any given year are the sponsorship go-get and then Vegas ticket sales because those have the highest volatility. So, yeah, as you get closer to the end of the year, you start to get more clarity on both of those, although Vegas being a last-minute market, as we've pointed out many times, there's lots of work to be done as you enter Q4. So it can be a swing factor, but we continue to be optimistic here."

            "name": "Stefano Domenicali",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. It's been a fantastic season at F1. The competition across the grid is captivating odysseys in the stands and on the screen. We just completed a triple header in the Americas with amazing action exciting on and off the track. We have a three-way battle for the Constructor Championship between McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull. And the Driver's Championship is still very alive as we head into the final races between Verstappen and Norris, following three events in Austin, Mexico and Brazil, in front of huge crowds. It has been great to see the variety of winners this year. Something that is thrilling fans and raises excitement and the participation for a special season in 2025. Looking at our engagement across the season, 5.8 million fans have attended Grand Prix through Brazil. Attendance is up season to date, with sell-out crowds on many races and seven races setting new attendance records including the British Grand Prix, which welcomed 480,000 fans over the weekend, the largest crowd for the season. In the third quarter, we have massive crowds of over 300,000 at the Hungarian, Belgian, Dutch and Italian Grand Prix. We have also had a strong path to play Brazil this season, with attendance up across almost all races and four teams sold out. We have been expanding and innovating our hospitality products like the F1 Garage and the Monaco Yacht to continue to provide premium experience to our fans. Our promoter partners are investing in improved infrastructure and enhanced fan experience with live entertainment and on-site activation. Better fan experience benefits the promoters and the broader F1 brand. In Silverstone Castle with Kings of Lyon and Stormzy drew crowds on Thursday and Friday evenings. In Singapore, they had a festival-style lineup with over 100 hours of live entertainment in addition to the on-track action, including concerts with the Kylie Minogue and Lenny Kravitz. In Austin, over 100,000 fans attended Eminem's performance. The sprint races are also successfully drawing incremental audiences. Attendance on Friday of sprint weekends are up approximately 30% compared to non-sprint weekends. TV viewership on sprint weekends is also, on average, 10% greater than non-sprint weekends. This content offers incremental benefits for our promoters, broadcast partners and sponsors with increased exposure. Beyond sprints, average viewership for race weekends through Singapore averaged 65 million on leader TV channels, with around 20 million of incremental viewers on digital channels including YouTube and F1 TV. Viewership on digital channels continued to increase year over year. Looking at few races in particular, the British Grand Prix was the most viewed European race ever in the UK and drew record viewership in the U.S. for the event. F1 TV subscriber growth continued to be robust, with subscribers up 10% year over year and particularly strong in the US market. We continue to innovate on digital platforms with creative ways for fans to experience the world of F1 Worldwide. For example, this season we introduced video episodes for our F1 Beyond the Grid podcast and watch time is up over 30% since this format was introduced. Social media followers grew 38% year over year to 94 million, in part due to the new platform launches like Threads and WhatsApp. Our WhatsApp partnership enables a closer direct relationship with fans through the messaging platform. On the F1 app we registered 6 million unique users in the third quarter and we are seeing continued growth on the platform, contributed to a younger audience and higher engagement. F1 Arcade was thrilled to open their Washington DC location on October 13th, the second venue in the U.S. Their opening party on October 9th had nearly 1,000 guests. The DC location is hosting a number of Grand Prix watch parties this season, including one last month for the Austin Grand Prix, and it is inviting fans for other F1-inspired gatherings like the live recording of the F1 Explained podcast during the Mexico Grand Prix. F1 Arcade is on track to open its Las Vegas location in the third quarter of 2025. The F1 exhibition reached the first stop of its global tour in London, opening on August 23rd with great reviews from visitors. The location is already seeing incredible demand with 135,000 tickets sold and as a result the exhibition stays at the location as being extended through the first quarter of 2025. Turning to commercial updates, we have had incredible momentum in 2024 and that continues this quarter. Most notably, our new partnership with LDMH. For 2025, an expanded agreement with American Express and Lenovo demonstrates our ability to bring in iconic brands and scale our partnership into broader and larger deals. LDMH first partnered with Formula One for the last year's inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix with representation primarily from its Vulcan tequila brand. We will now welcome LDMH as a global partner under a groundbreaking 10-year deal beginning in 2025, which will see us partner with their iconic Maison Louis Vuitton, Moet NSC and Tag Heuer. We will provide additional details on specific activation by this brand early next year. American Express initially partnered with F1 in 2023 as a regional sponsor with branding and activation rights in the Americas. Beginning in 2025, we will expand our relationship globally, with American Express becoming an official partner encompassing Australia, Asia, Europe, the Americas and the Middle East. Similarly, we have announced that beginning in 2025, Lenovo will be expanded to a global partner from their previous official partner sponsorship. We are also actively adding partnerships in the new verticals. Santander joined as our official retail banking partner in a multi-year agreement beginning in 2025. This partnership supports Santander's open bank product, their digital bank that is particularly focused on U.S. market expansion. Formula One's success in the U.S. market was a key factor in securing the Santander partnership. One other area of focus gaining momentum is licensing. We were thrilled to announce recent partnerships with both LEGO and Mattel, both of which bring the world of F1 into our fans' day-to-day lives and extend our brand to new audiences. The LEGO product range features all F1 teams engaging content across LEGO digital platforms and facets of the F1 races weekend, including a Fan Zone activation. Our Mattel partnership kicked off this season with the release of a one-of-a-kind F1 car and the full range of Hot Wheels products we release next year. Looking to the rest of the season, we are weeks away from the second Las Vegas Grand Prix. The Las Vegas race has continued to serve as a testbed of innovation that we can leverage across the broader F1 calendar, including opportunities in the hospitality, tailored sponsorship, and licensing. Just last week, we announced the first-of-its-kind special merchandise collection for Las Vegas, ranging from a streetwear collaboration with a Venus brand to one-of-a-kind Vegas Golden Knights and Raiders 4. Since posting this merchandise collaboration on LVGP social channels, we've gathered over 1.2 million organic impressions across the post, with more than 93,000 engagements and 86,000 likes. This year's Las Vegas Grand Prix leverages learnings from last year across the whole event, including hospitality, logistics, ticketing, and more. We will continue to test, learn, and innovate in this year ahead. We are proud of our sustainability strategy and continue to make progress throughout the organization on our environmental, social, and governance efforts. In September, we made our first investment in sustainable aviation fuels, working with our partner DHL. These purchases cover approximately 11% of the estimated carbon flight emissions across the 2024 season, and flights powered by sustainable aviation fuels have an estimated 80% reduction in carbon emissions per flight. We look forward to more progress through the end of this year and into 2025. In closing, Formula One is in a great position, with strong financial growth and incredible on-track action. It's looking like the three-way battle for the constructor will come down to the final races. We thank our fans, teams, and partners for their support in this record season and look forward to more action to come. [Non-English] Full speed ahead. And now, I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Yeah, thank you, Greg. Thanks, David. I mean, as we said, first of all, it's very important to remember that we have still plenty of time under the existing Concord, so there is no urgent rush. Conversations are progressing very well. And as we said before, very, very positive, because at this moment the ecosystem is very solid. And also all the teams and all the levels to quarter have had a huge benefit from everyone in this moment. So the financial security for the future and stability that we have today it's underlining what we are preparing. And as soon as we have everything ready, of course, we will inform everyone. But as always, as I said, we want to do the right thing and consider there's no rush. Everything is progressing well, as we said, and looking forward to confirming to you when we're going to announce something concrete. Yeah, absolutely. No, I would say for sure. And, as always, we need to remember we were just a couple of years ago in terms of quantity and also quality of our partnership. Now we have grown significantly in terms of quantity. And, of course, now the time is really to check in terms of restructuring the deals in terms of global, regional, official partners, due to the fact that we have a strong interest in our market so far. So there are for sure other that we will exploit in the future. But the only thing that I can confirm, as Greg was mentioning, is really, we are really bringing in the interest that we are having from partners that are high, high, high value in the market. And that will be another leverage because through a B2B business growth within the relationship we can create with all the partners, we can create even more interest in our platform. So, as I said, look back and see where we were and look where we are. And I think that the future will be very positive again. Okay. Thanks, Greg. Of course, \u201826 race promotion, as you know, we have Madrid that will be part of the calendar. We have long-term deals on the other side, as you know, that is represented the vast majority of our situation today, and these allow us, of course, to work with them in order to promote better quality, to make sure that what we want to offer to our customers to level is the highest standard. In \u201826 and further beyond, of course, we have some news to share very, very soon with regard to the possibility in the midterm to have some rotational European Grand Prix and some other new options coming later. And this is something that, of course, we will clarify in the due course. It is true that we have a large demand of even new possible venues that want to come in, and our choice will be always balanced between the right economical benefits that we can have as a system and also to leverage in the growth of the market that we can see potential will be beneficial for us to grow even further our business. So it's something that we are managing in the right way. And thank God today, we have a quality problem to handle. That was not the case just a couple of years ago. No, thanks, Greg, I would say. As we said, we believe that the balance we have in terms of numbers is the right one. So 24 is the balance number that we feel is the right to keep exactly what you say, Jonathan. And I do believe that all the propositions that are coming on our table is just giving us the possibility to make even the better choice for our future. So, as always, we need to be balanced, knowing that we cannot follow only the pure direct financial proposition because that is different from region to region, but it's up to us to propose to our stakeholders the right choice. And I think that we are in a good momentum to make sure that the strategy for the future is even stronger. And that's why we are so confident about the fact that this will help to enhance our platform on the sport, on social, and business perspective."

            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Maybe we can just take a step back, focus on what we've been working on here in year two. Obviously, year one, we were very much focused on the quality of the fan experience. Year two has been a lot of focus around cost structure and optimizing our product ladder. We do expect that to continue going into years three and beyond. We made a number of improvements coming into this year, which have allowed us to continue to be dynamic in adjusting products and pricing based on real-time feedback we're receiving from the market. We would note the all-in cost of a Vegas race weekend has come into line with the other U.S. races, and we would refer you to the commentary from our hotel partners, Wynn and Caesars, regarding the continued strength of F1. In terms of recent activity, as expected, we are seeing an uptick in traffic and conversion rates around ticket sales, and we expect that to continue as we get closer to the race weekend. We are, of course, benefiting from the very competitive championship this year, and we have seen success with our recent promotions, including the Lewis Hamilton package and some special offerings that we've run in partnership with our sponsors, Timo and AmEx. We still have room to grow on ticket sales, but we are very excited to see year two come together over the next couple of weeks. And, of course, we remain very positive on the benefits that Vegas is providing to the broader ecosystem of Formula One, including the LVMH deal, American Express, and getting back to the media rights renewal. We're looking to see the benefit of Vegas next year as well when Greg starts those discussions. Sure, yes, happy to. So I guess just to reiterate, we generally do not give race-specific economics, but with regard to your question on ticket revenue, aggregate ticket revenue will be down from what we originally budgeted in Q1. However, throughout the course of \u201824, we have also continued to reduce costs from what we budgeted in Q1. So I would say that we're working hard to focus on getting the best profitability that we can from Vegas, and again we would refer you to the broader benefit that it does bring to the F1 ecosystem. Sure. So we are working hard to launch the year-round business beyond just the event conference segment. Beginning in, I'd say, late Q1 of \u201825, it's going to be actually very much focused around educating new fans, bringing the new fans deeper into the sport. Obviously Las Vegas is a destination. And we want to try to leverage that and bring these visitors to learn more about Formula One, coming deeper into the U.S. culture. There will be a carding business there. There will also be a fun, interactive experience, sort of 3D, 4D type offering, which will also include a little bit of the legacy F1 exhibition type educational experience as well. And then we will be looking to package those experiences to enhance the event conference space. So a lot more to come, and we hope to be giving more specifics around that business during race week."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Liberty Media Corporation 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference will be recorded today, August 8. I would now like to turn the call over to Clare Adams, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nClare Adams: Good morning. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed by Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call and Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media or Atlanta Braves Holdings' expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Media, SiriusXM and Atlanta Braves Holdings, including adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media, SiriusXM and Atlanta Braves Holdings Schedules 1 through 3 can be found at the end of the earnings press releases issued today, which are available on Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO.\nGreg Maffei: Thanks, Clare, and good morning to all. Today, speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali; Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling; and also during Q&A, we will answer questions related to Atlanta Braves Holdings and Braves management will be available to answer them as well. So, beginning with Liberty SiriusXM, the transaction is progressing towards close. We've received SEC and FCC approvals. We've set the shareholder meeting date for August 23 and we expect to close on September 9. You may note the adjusted merger exchange ratio has been reset to reduce the shares of new Sirius by 90%. We expect the New Sirius share price will be higher at close because of that and we expect enhanced trading dynamics, including each increased potential for index inclusion. I look forward to remaining Chairman and a meaningful shareholder. Turning now to SiriusXM itself, the company maintains its strong financial position. Self-pay net adds improved sequentially and year-over-year, driven primarily by a reduction in voluntary churn. EBITDA was flat versus the prior year, but plus 8% versus the first quarter. We expect solid margin and cash generation through the balance of 2024. 2024 is also going to be a peak CapEx year and we expect to return to free cash flow growth in the coming years. We believe SiriusXM is attractive on a free cash flow multiple basis. Sirius continues to pursue growth opportunities. Beginning in the car with a new three-year subscription with a new vehicle purchase at certain automakers, free access, the first free ad-supported platform, which aims to increase trials and win back listeners and 360L is continuing to drive improved share of listening in the car. Looking at streaming, Sirius is launching new features and updates every month, and we've seen early improvements in multi-day listening. We've also seen increased engagement in the trial period versus the first quarter and finally, by pursuing smart unique content. The SmartLess podcast is kicking off its partnership in August with an exclusive subscriber event featuring Howard Stern, Jelly Roll and many more. Turning to Formula One Group. Despite early questions, this is turning out to be one of the most competitive seasons certainly in the start back to 2012. Across the first 14 races, we've seen seven different race winners and eight drivers have been on the podium. This is on -- we're on track to have the closest Constructors Championship across the top four since 2012 as well. The difference in time from front to back of grid at this point in the season is the closest also since the start of the current qualifying system in 2010. Looking at the 2020 driver market, continues to provide interest and excitement with Carlos Sainz going to Williams, Haas announcing Ocon joining as a current and -- current Ferrari reserve driver Bearman as well. Bearman is showcasing the pipeline of support Sirius talent that it's delivering to Formula 1. And the biggest open question remains what will Mercedes do with its open seat. Looking now at the financial results for F1, we had a great first half. Year-to-date revenues up 29% and OIBDA was plus 35%, partially driven by three additional races in the period this year. We announced LVCVA as an official partner. They're going to activate across 25 races in 2024 and 10 in 2025, and we continue to successfully scale partners brought in through LVGP. We remain excited about our sponsorship pipeline. Let me turn briefly to MotoGP. The transaction is progressing well. Regulatory filings are progressing on track. We've received foreign investment control clearance in both jurisdictions needed, Italy and Spain, and we recently received merger clearance in Brazil and Australia. We continue to expect the transaction to close by year-end. At MotoGP, the racing has been awesome. Pecco Bagnaia quickly closed the gap with Jorge Martin, but Martin just took the lead back in Silverstone. We are seeing a very competitive title fight now separated by only three points. And at MotoGP, 12 riders across 18 have been on the podium this season. Attendance is up across our races with a new all-time attendance record set at Le Mans and Germany was at 253,000 was up 8% off an already record 2023 attendance number. Similar to F1, rider movements are fueling excitement. We've also seen interesting movements in the Constructors Championship. Constructors a category rather with Pramac switching from Ducati to Yamaha next season. The summer break ended last weekend in Silverstone. We're excited for more action in the second half. Turning briefly to Quint, some of the second quarter highlights. We have the 150th Kentucky Derby, which was an enormous success, the largest single event executed in Quint history, serving over 12,000 customers per day. F1 Experiences has seen meaningful growth across eight races this year and we've completed inaugural activations for several new partnerships, including the WNBA All-Star Game and the Men's and Women's U.S. Open for the USGA. Turning to Live Nation, saw another record quarter with no signs of slowdown. 2024 is a year of AOI, amphitheaters and arenas and in the second quarter despite stadium activity being lower, concert attendance was up 5%, AOI was up 21% with record concert segment profitability, and this was one of the top five quarters in history for ticket sales. Revenue from on-site spending is also up double-digits year-to-date and cancellation rates for North America are tracking lower than last year. The ticketing and artist pipeline continues to expand globally. New artists have increased touring by 130% year-to-date and two-thirds of all total new enterprise tickets signed year-to-date are from international. Turning briefly to Venue Nation, we're continuing to see the enhancements made generate incremental revenue. Major festival's average per fan spend is up double-digits year-to-date. The amphitheater average per fan spend is also expected to grow by $2 per fan and Live Nation plans to open 14 major global venues across 2024 and 2025. Turning to the Braves, we've had strong performance from key players this season through last weekend. Ozuna led the National League with 86 RBIs. Since April 12, Sale has had a 2.64 ERA and Fried has had a 2.71 ERA, which ranked second and third respectively in the National League. Ahead of the trade deadline, the Braves announced the return of Jorge Soler to fill a key position in the outfield and right-handed pitcher Luke Jackson. Both players were on the 2021 World Series winning team. Fan demand remains strong, per caps up in ticketing and concessions year-over-year. There are 18,000 on the season ticket waitlist and we've seen a 90% renewal to date on season tickets for 2025. Several of the master planning projects completed earlier this year are already adding value and enhancing the fan experience. The new 60-foot six-inch Jim Beam Bar concessions are up double-digits versus 2023 concessions in the same location. Recently, they've announced further upgrades ahead of the 2025 season, including a new seating product, the Bullpen, which includes access to exclusive lounge underneath seats, an extension of the Coors Light Chop House seating area. Also, the Braves recently involved the -- unveiled the logo to kick-off the 2025 All-Star Game. The Braves are thrilled to host the All-Star Game. It's an incredible opportunity to showcase the Truist and the Battery sections. Now, I'll turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results.\nBrian Wendling: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash of $88 million, excluding $100 million of cash held at SiriusXM. During the quarter, Liberty SiriusXM paid down $35 million under the margin loan using cash on hand. There's $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity as of quarter end. As of August 7, the value of our SiriusXM stock was $10 billion and we have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $10.9 billion, which includes $9.1 billion of debt at SiriusXM. As Greg mentioned, the transaction with SiriusXM is expected to close on September 9. In connection with the transaction close, the 3.75% Liberty SiriusXM convertible notes and the 2.75% Sirius exchangeable notes will be assumed by New Sirius and the margin loan will be retired. Following transaction close, holders of the 2.75% exchangeable notes will have the right to require New Sirius to repurchase the notes and we would expect a substantial majority of holders will exercise this right. Turning to the Formula One Group, at quarter end, Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $1.5 billion, which includes $1.2 billion of cash at F1 and $58 million of cash at Quint. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $2.9 billion, which includes $2.4 billion of debt at F1, leaving $530 million at the corporate level. F1's $500 million revolver is undrawn and their leverage at quarter end is 1.3 times. MotoGP transaction is progressing well. We have syndicated all bridge financing commitments and reduced the total commitment from $2 billion to $1.65 billion. Note that the $1.65 billion commitment is expected to be replaced with a combination of cash and debt financing at the F1 OpCo level. We also entered into commitments for $150 million incremental Term Loan A at Formula 1 conditioned on the transaction close. And we obtained commitments from banks to provide Dorna with a new EUR150 million Term Loan A and an upsized EUR100 million revolver to be entered into after and subject to transaction closed and to be used by Dorna for general corporate purposes. Looking at the F1 business, I will again remind you that the business is best analyzed on an annual basis given variability in year-over-year race calendar. With that said, I'll make a few brief remarks on the quarterly results, but would very much encourage you to focus on the year-to-date results. During the quarter, F1 recognized a higher proportion of season-based income with eight out of 24 races occurring during the period compared to six out of 22 in the prior year period. Media rights and sponsorship revenue also increased due to contractual increase in fees and revenue from new agreements. Growth in F1 TV continues to benefit media rights revenue. Race promotion revenue was relatively flat given the mix of races with Australia and Azerbaijan dropping out of Q2 compared to last year with Japan, China, and Austria being added in the current period. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher hospitality and freight revenue, driven by the additional races. Adjusted OIBDA grew in the quarter as revenue growth more than offset increased costs due to higher pro rata recognition of team payments and the expectation of increased team payments for the full-year over 2023, as well as increased costs due to the additional races held and cost supporting revenue growth. Team payments are best viewed on a year-to-date basis and represented 61.9% of pre-team OIBDA for the first half of the year compared to 62.6% in the prior year. I would note Q2 and Q3 tend to have the highest percentage payout ratios based on the greater mix of European races in these quarters. Other costs of F1 revenue and SG&A are best viewed as a percent of total revenue for the year. Again, looking at it on a year-to-date basis, the adjusted OIBDA margin improved from 24.6% through Q2 '23 to 25.8% through Q2 '24. Looking briefly at corporate and other results in the second quarter, corporate and other revenue was $141 million, which includes Quint results and approximately $6 million of rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza. Corporate and other adjusted OIBDA was $5 million in the second quarter and includes Quint results, Grand Prix Plaza rental income, offset by corporate expenses. Quint results in the second quarter were primarily driven by the Kentucky Derby and F1 Experiences across the eight races held. Reminder that Quint's business is seasonal with the largest and most profitable events taking place in Q2 and Q4. We expect corporate and other adjusted OIBDA will benefit from the rental income and the Quint results for the full-year. At the Liberty Live Group, there's attributed cash of $406 million and there's $400 million of undrawn margin loan capacity related to our Live Nation market loan. As of August 7, the value of the Live Nation stock -- our Live Nation stock was $6.3 billion and we have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. Turning briefly to the Atlanta Braves Holdings, revenue grew in the second quarter despite three fewer home games compared to the last year. Baseball event revenue growth was driven by new sponsorship agreements as well as contractual increases on season tickets and existing sponsorship contracts. Broadcasting revenue grew as there were more total games between home and away played in the second quarter. Baseball operating costs increased in the second quarter, primarily due to higher player payroll, increased payments under MOB's revenue-sharing plan and higher minor league team and player expenses. The Battery continues to perform very well with revenue up 11% and adjusted OIBDA up 13% in the second quarter. Looking at the capital improvement projects around the ballpark, a reminder that the Braves are spending approximately $15 million related to the projects completed ahead of the 2024 season across the back half of 2023 and early '24. The Braves recently announced additional improvement projects to open ahead of the '25 season, primarily related to new seating options and expect to spend approximately $20 million on these projects across the back half of '24 and early '25. These are all high-returning projects that will generate incremental revenue for the Braves in the 2025 season. At the Battery, the Truist headquarters is progressing ahead of schedule, and we'd expect to hand that building over to Truist in September. Now I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula 1.\nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Brian. The 2024 season is delivering incredible racing and action for our fans at home and our sold-out events. F1 continues to prove there is an incredible competition on track. Through 14 races this season, we have had seven different winners from four teams. The gaps between teams are getting closer both in qualifying and races. In Emilia, Max beat Lando by only seven-tenths of a second, following Lando's incredible win in Miami. In Monaco, we saw Charles Leclerc take his first home victory. In Canada, the gap between the top four in qualifying was one-tenth of a second and we have seen Mercedes return to the top step of the podium with George winning in Austria and Lewis setting his record ninth victory at Silverstone. Hungary saw another excellent race ending in Piastri's first F1 win with the McLaren 1 and 2 and Hamilton rounding out the podium. In Spa, we had an incredible race with very tight gaps throughout and the race led by being swapped multiple times. George Russell crossed the finish line first after a thrilling final lap battles against Lewis, but was disqualified after the race because the car did not meet the required weight, meaning Lewis took his second victory of the season, with Oscar Piastri second and Charles Leclerc third. By many measure, we have never had more competitive racing. I expect that the remainder of 2024 season will continue to deliver great racing for our fans. And as we look forward, the increasingly close racing offers very exciting prospect for 2025. The incredible competition on track is leading to even higher engagement as our diverse fan basis continues to grow. We have welcomed over 3.7 million attendees through the first 14 races of this season with the Canadian Grand Prix seeing record attendance of 350,000 and Silverstone matching its incredible 2023 record attendance of 480,000. We continue to see sold-out events and there is strong demand for the races still to come this season. On TV, we are seeing particularly strong numbers in key growth markets, including Australia, U.S., China, Canada, South Africa and the Middle East. Looking at the recent races, the Canadian Grand Prix was the most viewed live race ever in Canada. The British Grand Prix was impressively the most viewed live European races over on Sky U.K. and earned the largest overall weekend audience for the F1 in the U.K. since 2016. Looking at the U.S., five races this season have achieved record live viewership for their respective events, the Chinese, Miami, Monaco, Canadian and British Grand Prix. The Miami Grand Prix viewership peaked at 3.6 million on ABC and the 18 to 49 demographics averaged 1.3 million and the Sprint Races averaged 946,000 viewership on ESPN, the largest on the channel since we introduced the Sprint format in 2021. Our digital and social platform also continued to see very strong performance. We saw a 32% decrease in social media followers compared to 2023, driven by the success of the new channel, Threads and WhatsApp and accelerated growth on Instagram. We also have higher engagement with 4.1 billion video views and 880 million interaction on Instagram year-to-date. F1 TV continues to perform well. Total subscribers are up 11% year-over-year. And in the U.S. market, subscribers are up 16% year-over-year. As previously mentioned, we implemented F1 TV price increases for the first time across markets early this year, which have been well received with the limited upticks in churn. F1 TV continues to be an important and growing product. We also continue to see great results from our podcast this season. Total listens to all episodes of the F1 podcast, including Beyond the Great F1 Nation and F1 EXplain since launch in 2018 surpassed 125 million this quarter. The F1 EXplain podcast is engaging new and more diverse audience with 40% of the listeners in the U.S. market. A few weeks ago, we announced the 2025 spring calendar with races to take place at six events: China, Miami, Belgium, Austria, Brazil and Qatar. The spring continues to be a big success with the higher TV audience for the Friday sprint qualifying and Saturday sprint race compared to traditional practice session. The events also bring extra on-track action for our fans attending the events, providing additional values for promoters. 80% of fans surveyed after the Chinese Grand Prix said that they prefer the new sprint format and we look forward to maintaining the momentum in 2025. The F1 Academy season is also off to a strong start with the first three races completed in Saudi, Miami and Spain and the next race in Zandvoort. Abbi Pulling is leading the series with -- and recently become the first woman to win a British F4 races. American driver Chloe Chambers took first in race two in Barcelona with a dominant victory over Pulling. F1 Academy is growing engagement and attracting new fans. In the last 12 months, F1 Academy social media followers have increased by three times with a diverse follower base. 57% of the F1 Academy followers on Instagram are female, 57% are under 25 old and 83% are under 35 years old. Online coverage of F1 Academy across new sites and social reached almost 700 million Internet users. The Miami Grand Prix alone generated 14.7 million video views and 4 million interaction on social media with 2 million live viewers on broadcast TV. F1 Academy has also been engaging fans attending F1 events around the calendar. Given the success alongside F1 races weekend many of the promoter hosting F1 Academy events this year are lining up to the host again in 2025 and we've received interest from several other markets. Turning to commercial updates. On race promotion there continues to be significant demand from potential new race hosts. We do not currently intend to go above 24 races in a season as our duty is to ensure the right strategic balance for the long-term future of the sport. The added benefit of this demand with limited race slot creates increased incentives for promoters to innovate and improve the experience of races across the calendar. More promoters are committing to investments in their races. For example, Hungary has committed to significant refurbishment including a new pit building from 2026. We are also seeing example of great entertainment from promoters including the Barcelona Fan Event, Thursday Concert in Silvester and of course we look forward to returning to Las Vegas after an incredible show in 2023. We announced the 2025 calendar much earlier this year which gives the teams and promoters more time to prepare and market their events. We now continue to focus and optimize the calendar for 2026 and beyond. Our media rights we have some key renewal to address for 2026 including our deals across the Americas, U.S., Canada, Latin, Brazil and Mexico as well as across most of Asia including Japan. The continued growth of our diverse fan base around the world including the U.S. and demand from broadcasters means we are confident in the future of our media rights deals. We also continue to be excited about the amount of content F1 has to offer. Across race weekends, we have many events and lots of data provided by numerous cameras around the track and cars. We can offer our broadcast partners and the fans at home incredible access and insight into the weekend through all this content. Alongside this we are very pleased to once again deliver the F1 Kids program in this season for seven events. The feedback from 2023 was impressive and F1 Kids is providing to be a brilliant way to engage children in Formula 1 in a way that's accessible and fun for them. F1 Kids is available through broadcaster around the world via a live dedicated international feed of the Grand Prix. The feed features 3D graphics, child-friendly team radio transmission, technical explanation and a bespoke package of colorful graphics and animation including the cartoon driver's avatars and upgraded car delivery design. The production returned in Saudi followed by Monaco and Silverstone and will also be available for Dutch, Singapore, Sao Paolo, and Abu Dhabi Grand Prix later this season. Looking at sponsorship, we are confident in the pipeline with exciting conversation underway. We continue to have opportunities in categories such as financial services, consumer electronics, telco, and betting. We have also more closely integrated the sponsorship, licensing, hospitality, and marketing teams in a comprehensive strategy to optimize to grow the growth of our fandom and commercial opportunities. We are also continuing strong progress on fan engagement opportunities outside of race weekend. In partnership with Apple and Warner Brothers, we were delighted to recently confirm that the much-anticipated movie titled F1, starring Brad Pitt, directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, will be released on the 25th of June 2025. We were excited to release the movie teaser during the build-up of the British Grand Prix. The theme is unique in that it is being filmed authentically during our racing weekend, and it will be a great opportunity for our sport to reach new fans and engage audiences. The sixth season of Drive to Survive, after reaching the top 10 on Netflix in over 40 markets, has seen its global audience of over 100 million viewers in the first five months since release. Across all six seasons to date, the cumulative audience for the series is close to 800 million. F1 Arcade continues to perform well, with high numbers of booking during both race and non-race weeks. The new Boston location has seen 50,000 guests in the first two months since launch. All three F1 Arcade venues hosted a ticketed watch party during the three day Silverstone race, and all venues sold out, with the London venues welcoming almost 600 guests. The ongoing success of the project means that in addition to the venues in London, Birmingham and Boston, F1 Arcade is planning to open new venues in Washington, D.C. in late 2024 and Las Vegas in 2025, with more to come. Following successful runs in Madrid and Vienna, the F1 exhibition has continued its successful road show in Toronto, which has been extended to mid-September, and will open in London later this month, showcasing the incredible history of the sport in the U.K. Even though the London show is not yet open, 60,000 tickets have already been sold. These are great examples of bringing fans and future fans into our sport through different routes, with a mix of F1, entertainment and hospitality. Our ESG program remain an important focus for the business. Earlier this year, we published our first impact report showing the progress we are making on our Net Zero 2030 commitment, as well as our diversity and inclusivity initiatives, both within our business and wider sport. A key part of our plans will be to move to fully sustainable fuel in 2026, which we believe could provide huge benefit as an innovative solution to decarbonize existing and future cars for both the F1 ecosystem and the broader automotive industry. This has been a very important reason behind Ford and Audi joining the sport in 2026. We continue to work closely with the teams, the FIA, partners and promoters to deliver on our commitment, as highlighted by recent events. The Silverstone event was powered by renewable energy, including over 2,000 solar panels and has increased the recycling at the event. Following success in also last year, there have been further trials of a low carbon energy system deployed to support activity across the path pit lane and broadcast compound that has been shown to reduce related emissions by 90%. Trials this year has taken place in Austria and Hungary, with the first scheduled for Monza. On diversity and inclusion, we were delighted to recently confirm that as a part of our program to provide education opportunities to our represented groups, 20 engineering students in the U.K. and Italy will become the latest recipient of the Formula One Engineering Scholarship over 2024 and 2025. Founded in 2021, the scholarship program addressed some of the key barriers to higher education for our represented students, including financial burden and access. By '25, 50 students will have entered the program. As I mentioned earlier, F1 Academy continues to go from strength to strength and is critical to our goal of developing and preparing young female drivers to progress to higher levels of competition. Eight female drivers, including five F1 Academy drivers, raced in round six of the F4 British Championship, which was the highest ever level of female participation in the championship. We also have a talented driver, Sophia Floersch, racing in FIA Formula 3 for Van Amersfoort Racing. This shows the huge importance of the FIA F3 and FIA F2 Pyramid run by Bruno Michel that continues to develop and nurture young talent to reach the very top of our sport. Creating the right structure for these talented female drivers and ensuring we have the right system in place to nurture talent at a young age is incredibly important. That is why we continue to be excited about our grassroots program, Discover Your Drive, to encourage and nurture females as young as eight to try to go karting. We remain focused on the long term goal and building a sustainable increase in female participation in motorsport. It has been a fantastic season so far, with more to come after the summer break. The interest in and demand for our sport continues to be huge, and I'm confident in our future. Avanti tutta, full speed ahead. And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Ciao.\nGreg Maffei: Thanks, Stefano and Brian. Our Annual Investor Day will be Thursday, November 14 in New York City. Please note, we've moved to a new location. We'll look forward to seeing you at the Jazz at Lincoln Center. Save the date. Additional details will be provided soon. We hope to see many of you there. And with that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask what Formula 1 and its promoters are seeing in the coincident and leading indicators for F1 demand in terms of ticket sales, pricing, percentage sell-out, on-site spending or whatever metrics you look at. Has there been any moderation at all on the strength of demand? And maybe specifically if you could comment on what you're seeing since the Vegas tickets went on sale in late March? Thank you.\nGregMaffei: Stefano, why don't you start and then I'll ask Rene to comment on Vegas.\nStefano Domenicali: Yes. Thank you, Greg. Thank you, Bryan. I mean, for what we can see as we have already announced, we don't see any kind of significant backdrop of any interest. I mean, we have sold out even in the events we had in front of us and there is still a very, very, very high interest. We are, of course, monitoring the situation on the events side because we know that in other area there is a sort of drop of that request. But this is something that we don't see at all in our championship.\nBryan Kraft: Encouraging to hear. Thank you.\nRenee Wilm: And maybe just to focus a little bit on the Vegas portion of the question, I would say that what we're seeing in terms of ticket sales trends is consistent with what you would expect for a year two event. Also, U.S. is a last-minute market and Las Vegas is even more of a last-minute market. Year one is not necessarily the best comparison for a couple of reasons. First off, there was a longer sales cycle. We went on sale during our launch event, which was six months earlier than this year's on sale for year two. And there is just -- you cannot minimize just the excitement around the early demand that you see for a year one event. So, focusing directly onto year two, what we have done a little differently this year and a couple of our partners mentioned this earlier this week during their own earnings calls is really focus our marketing on the upcoming period. What we did last year was really market throughout the year. Again, it was a year-one event and we wanted to maintain the excitement and the momentum. But what we're seeing here is that leading three months up to an event, you're getting the most demand. So, we're putting our dry powder into the marketing spend that's upcoming and we're really excited about the demand that we're starting to see and expect to continue to see an uptick in.\nBryan Kraft: Thank you very much, Renee.\nGregMaffei: Thank you, Bryan. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Supino: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about promotion revenue at F1. It was relatively flat year-over-year despite the two additional races. And you cited event mix as the reason. I just wondered if you could give any more color on event mix specifically and how we should be thinking about those dynamics into 2024? And then I wanted to ask about the Concorde agreement and wondered if you have any fresh thoughts on that process? Thank you.\nGregMaffei: Stefano, why don't I let Brian talk about the about the mix and then let you comment on the Concorde agreement.\nStefano Domenicali: Okay.\nBrian Wendling: Yes. So, on the promoter mix, as we noted in our prepared remarks, you had Australia and Azerbaijan fall out, you had China, Austria, Japan and Emilia come back into the quarter for 2024. Obviously, each race has a different fee. So, when we say promoter mix, you're looking at different fees for each race, which has an impact there. As you look at the remainder of the year, you have pretty comparable quarters. As you look forward, Japan in -- in Q3, we'll have one less race with Japan basically falling out, but Azerbaijan coming back in and then Q4 looks pretty similar. So, again, we would just highlight that you look at the business on a year-to-date or full-year basis when available.\nStefano Domenicali: The second question on Concorde agreement. I would say, as we said the other time, I mean, it's all good because we have the right terms, the right relation with the team. And as you know, the Concorde is divided into three main pillars. One is financial, one is commercial, and one is related to governance. Everything is progressing very, very well. As you know, we are not in a rush to complete the long form, but everything is running smoothly as expected. And this is really great because the relation with the teams, with the FIA and with all the other stakeholders is very good in this moment. So, working and progressing in the right way. And of course, we are focusing to try to maximize the benefit to have the maximum joint commercial activities with all the teams and making sure that what we're going to sign up will be the right in term of division of the revenues between the team and the commercial right holder, but it's all great now.\nPeter Supino: Thanks, Stefano.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess two questions, probably for Greg. Live Nation continues to perform really well from a business perspective with the stock obviously limited given the DOJ overhang. Just curious from your perspective, is there's any appetite from Liberty's point of view to think about a breakup of the company kind of proactively? Obviously, that's not the desired outcome from the lawsuit, but to the extent these things can take years to play out and limit the equity, if there's any thought that you would share on potentially exploring something like that? And then I don't know if you or Stefano want to take this, but what prevented the Andretti from joining F1? And obviously, there's just some DOJ noise there, I guess, keeping on theme, which I'm imagining you're probably not too worried about, but just curious if that's something that might be revisited in the future, if you think team expansion is something that makes sense for the sport and any comment would be interesting and helpful. Thanks.\nGregMaffei: Okay. I'll take a cut. So, first on Live Nation, I think the business, as you heard and you noted, continues to operate very well. I think that the company operates fully within the law, has had a monitor in place for 14 years. And so any actions have been well known for a long time and we believe the charge of the DOJ are without merit, particularly the idea that somehow breaking it up with lower ticket prices. So, I don't think that remedy, which we don't think is in our interests or the interest of consumers is what the DOJ really wants if they actually understood what was wrong with the market. The fact is the market is driven by excess demand compared to supply that drives prices. So, I don't think a breakup is in the interest of Live Nation today or in the interest of the consumer, and we'll go forward. The plan at least as far as I understand is to go forward with the businesses we have. And the continued businesses what we believe will continue to operate very well through the base -- through 2024 and into 2025. Looking at Andretti, as you saw this morning, we announced that there is a DOJ investigation. We intend to fully cooperate with that investigation, including any related request for information. We believe our determination -- F1's determination was in compliance with all applicable U.S. antitrust laws and we've detailed the rationale for our decision vis-a-vis Andretti in prior statements. We are certainly not against the idea that any expansion is wrong. There is a methodology for expansion that requires approval of the FIA and the F1 and both groups have to meet -- find the criteria met. And we're certainly open to new entrants making applications and potentially being approved if those requirements are met.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Joyce with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Joyce: A question on Quint. If you could please help us understand how the relationship worked before you acquired it in terms of, would they buy tickets from you on a wholesale basis as part of their wholesale hospitality packages? But now that it's inside, what are the impacts on revenue, expenses and EBITDA in terms of any eliminations from your activities, specifically at F1 events? Thanks.\nGregMaffei: Maybe Renee is in a good position to take that.\nRenee Wilm: Thanks, Greg. Thanks for the question on Quint. So, I would say prior to the acquisition, Quint was obviously a third-party vendor. They would acquire inventory directly from the promoters, particularly around secondary hospitality offerings. And then the relationship back to Formula 1 would be essentially that of a profit share arrangement. They did also provide some reseller capabilities with regard to Paddock Club for the teams as well as for F1 directly. Now that Quint is a subsidiary of Liberty Media, we have looked to integrate those businesses in a more -- in a closer manner, but while also still being cautious around leakage under the Concorde agreement. So, keeping -- really do keeping those business relationships on kind of a third-party basis. With regard to LVGP, we have directly integrated them and we've outsourced our sales team to Quint. They are running our sales and ticketing program, obviously, in partnership with myself and with Emily Prazer. And then their results will be consolidated up through Liberty Media with commission-based arrangement being paid to Formula 1, which commission-based payments then goes into the prize fund. Going forward, we are also going to be looking for new ways to really prove out the thesis around the acquisition and enable Quint to be a closer partner to all the promoters and to F1, but that is all in process still. I'll refer to Brian on the accounting question.\nBrian Wendling: Yes. You can see on Page 3, the eliminations for the quarter that primarily represents the eliminations between Quint and Formula One. You also have the lease payment across from LVGP up to Liberty Corporate in there as well. But that largely represents Quint buying tickets from Formula 1 and then reselling them. But at the price that they're buying them from Formula 1.\nDavid Joyce: I appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nGregMaffei: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nVijay Jayant: Thanks. So, Greg, you've been now saying a few times that you're really excited about the sponsorship business. Obviously, that's probably the most opaque for us on the other side. Anything you could share on what it is and how meaningful is it going to be? There's obviously been some press reports that LVMH is going to be a new partner. So, anything on that would be really helpful. And then just also for Renee, on the Vegas race, just for clarity, your hotel partners that you sort of curate high in hospitality with rooms and everything, do they buy tickets from you directly and then do it or is it some other form of arrangement? Thanks.\nGregMaffei: Thanks, Vijay. So, I'll comment a little bit on sponsorship and let Stefano add anything he wishes. Look, I think very excited about the sponsorship pipeline, excited about what Emily Prazer and her team, Johnny are doing there. We've seen continued interest from blue-chip clients who want to be involved at prices which are more attractive for us than historical levels and filling out categories that we previously had not had an entry in the sponsorship world. So, obviously, I can't comment on any rumored or unannounced deals, but I feel very good about the pipeline, feel very good about where we both are on those new entrants and on renewals at attractive prices from some of our existing players. Stefano, anything you want to add?\nStefano Domenicali: I couldn't agree more, Greg. I think that the numbers is proving the interest that is there in our business. And I think that now if you look-back just four years ago, we had only four -- global four and now we're heading to 10 and there is a big interest now, but the real point is to keep the quality of our partners with the right price level that we want to engage together. So, it's -- we are in a very, very strong situation. I believe, as I said, we have an incredible opportunity for our partners to create partnership between also themselves. So, it's a B2B relation that is having a multiplier effect and this is really what is important for our business to develop in the future. So, nothing to add, but as I said, just stay tuned because everything is looking forward -- looking very good for our future.\nGregMaffei: Yes. And I think Stefano hit on some great points. I'll just add. It's not only the quality of the partners and what they're willing to pay, they're willing to pay because they are getting value out of it and they're finding ways to activate on -- at races, on the grid, on the -- around events in ways that are more meaningful for them and for us. So, all of those are very positive. Renee, what would you add?\nRenee Wilm: I think that's an excellent point, Greg. Just to pick up on the sponsorship piece for a second, we really use the LVGP as the test-bed for how we can bring these marquee sponsors more deeply into the activations on track and in the fan zones. And I think one of the most important impacts of the Vegas race beyond the financial side is just the increase in interest in the pipeline, including with some of these marquee companies with whom we're speaking. So, a lot of excitement around the sponsorship portion. And then, Vijay, to answer your question, we do sell tickets to our hotel partners, which they then package into their own deals for their customers or obviously their -- I'm sure there are some comp arrangements for the big spenders who come to town for gambling. And then they'll come to us later in the year as they need more inventory. So, year one, we -- I'd day, they bought a lot of tickets very early on, again, to address that early demand that everyone saw for year one. And now this year, we are working closely with them to again do the marketing push and start filling those hotel rooms now that people are back from school and back-to-school, back from vacation and looking at their fall calendars.\nVijay Jayant: Great. Thanks so much.\nGregMaffei: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi, thank you. Greg, as you noted, really tight performance in the constructor standings, which is great to see. You do have new car and regs coming in 2026 and historically that kind of change has been associated with a temporary period of one team dominance. What confidence do you have that the rules you have put in place or will put into place can prevent that kind of outcome? And then, Stefano, as you noted, I think nearly all of your Americas deals are expiring this year and next year. Interested to know if you see any prospect for a multi-country deal and whether there'd be any benefit financially or otherwise for that type of structure? Thank you.\nGregMaffei: I'll comment on the regs briefly, but I think Stefano could actually be -- articulate on them as well. We think the regs are designed to create more exciting racing, while also meeting many other goals around issues like sustainability and things that help our OEM partners drive innovation. So, we're trying to hit on multiple levels. I think people were doubtful about what these regs, how the regs would play out when we induced them last time. And by many measures, as we noted earlier, we've never had more competitive racing. Our hope is that the 2026 regs will do the same. But as you rightly note, somebody may figure out a way to get a jump and take an early lead, but we think they're designed to create more parity and more exciting racing and should over time. Stefano, what might you add?\nStefano Domenicali: I would say that this dilemma at the end of each cycle of regulation is there. And the things that F1 together with the FIA has always done, I totally believe so, has been to anticipate the need of that change. And we, of course, keep at the center the fact that we want to have a very good competition on track, give the possibility drivers to express themselves and making sure that with the budget cap combination and limitation development, teams can catch-up quicker to keep the gaps between the teams smaller. And -- but on the other side, we have the duty to anticipate the things that are relevant in terms of technology to keep at the center of our platform is so important. That's why two years ago, we had -- we took the decision of putting at the center the new power unit with sustainable fuel. There was the need to put that at the center because then in terms of technological challenges, this would appear at that moment to be the most important one. So, I do believe that -- I -- it's part of the game, teams are working already plan out for '26 because the regulation will be very, very different. But I'm sure that the ones that are very skeptical about what normally we try to anticipate, we will think differently as soon as we see the action on track. And as Greg was correctly saying before, I remember very clearly people without the experience thinking that the regulation that we are now in would have to slow down cash by more than six, seven seconds and not having this kind of situation. So, I think that we are doing the right thing and as always in life, you need to be brave to try to anticipate the thing the right way and that's what we did. On the second one, I think it's related to U.S. First of all, let me say that we are very happy with the ESPN, what they did for our sport and what they are doing since the beginning of our journey together. And we see now bigger interest for sure. And we see some other sport are trying to divide the package in a different way. But of course, that's a personal opinion. We're going to tackle that subject in the due course in the next couple of months. I do believe that, in U.S., we are still in a place where the awareness is very, very important. So, what I can say from a customer point of view, if you are not really on the spot on the sport, creating multiple offer is creating more confusion, let me put it this way. So, therefore, I would say, we need to make sure that the incredible demand that we have from different partners will be taken in the right way at the appropriate time. But for sure, yes, Martin will represent for us a big opportunity for the next years.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nGregMaffei: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBarton Crockett: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two. The first one, hopefully is quick. On the race promotion revenue discussion with Formula 1, you guys I think have 24 races this year, I think 22 last year. Normally, I would assume that there's growth in promotion revenue per race, but given what we can see from the mix and what you think this year, is there any reason to think differently about that for 2024? So that's on Formula 1. On the Braves, switching gears a little bit, I was curious, you've been off of Comcast for most of the season because of their dispute with Diamond. Has that had any meaningful impact on the business in terms of fan interest or sales of anything or not? And if not, does it -- what does that say about the value of the TV promotion?\nGregMaffei: So, I'll comment on the first one and I'll let, Derek, if you'd like to take the second. I think, Barton, your assumption that we get increases generally in race promotion fees is correct. Derek, do you want to take on the Braves impact of Diamond?\nDerek Schiller: Sure. Thanks, Greg. Yes, obviously, we were off for three months and you never like to see carriage disputes. We're thankful that the carriage dispute is resolved. What I can tell you is there's really no material impact on our business. We've certainly seen a reduction during that period of time in ratings that is somewhat commiserate with the reduction in the carriage. Now that that's back, we'd expect that those ratings to also go up. So, we're glad that it's done and glad that they got that all resolved.\nBarton Crockett: Did you guys try to do any type of additional streaming push to offset that? And if not, why not?\nDerek Schiller: Well, the streaming rights are held at the league level right now, so those don't belong necessarily to Diamond. There's a provision inside of the agreement that's rather complicated as it relates to the streaming. Of course, in the future, should all these rights come back to us, I think we're prepared to evaluate all the different options including streaming.\nGregMaffei: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Stephen Laszcyzk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Laszcyzk: Hi, great. Thank you. Two on Formula 1. You called out the strong demand for race promotion and the commitments you're seeing for improved hospitality from promoters. Maybe a longer-term question here, but I'm curious how you would encourage us to think about the financial opportunity from improved hospitality over the next few years. Any goals perhaps on the Paddock Club capacity side of the equation? And then just quickly on team payments for Brian, you called out some of the seasonal aspects around the payout this year. Curious if there's anything more you'd be willing to add on how the dynamic works and perhaps what that can mean for the pace of operating leverage on team payments the rest of this year? Thank you.\nGregMaffei: Stefano, do you want to take the Paddock Club issue and I will let Brian to add?\nStefano Domenicali: Yes. Thank you, Stephen. I mean, we have a quality problem to take on now for sure. That is the fact that we in almost all the events, we are sold out. And when we're talking about hospitality, what we were very good to do it is to try to maximize the different packages. Now the point is, if you want to add places with the right space and the right quality for the service that we're offering. There is the need, of course, to take a rate by rate situation to see what we can do with the promoters in terms of capacity, in terms of possible extension. And this is something that we are discussing. There are advanced situation, for example, with Australian promoters and with some others because for us, of course, it is a matter of experience. So, we cannot run the risk of overcrowding the hospitality area because the demand is very high. So, now we are seeing -- we are watching, as I said, with everyone what we can do in terms of having the possibility to expand this area to offer the right service for the ones that wants to have it.\nBrian Wendling: Yes, Stephen, on the team payments part, I would point you to the year-to-date results there. So, we are at 61.9% on a U.S. GAAP basis pre-team, team payments as a percent of pre-team share OIBDA compared to 62.6% last year. We would expect some very minimal leverage as you go throughout the year and look to the end of the year, but it's fairly de minimis. But definitely focus on the year-to-date number, not the quarter.\nStephen Laszcyzk: Great. Thank you for that.\nGreg Maffei: Operator, I believe that was our last question. Thank you to our listening audience for your interest in Liberty Media and the Atlanta Braves Holdings. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter, if not sooner.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Greg Maffei",
            "content": "Thanks, Clare, and good morning to all. Today, speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali; Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling; and also during Q&A, we will answer questions related to Atlanta Braves Holdings and Braves management will be available to answer them as well. So, beginning with Liberty SiriusXM, the transaction is progressing towards close. We've received SEC and FCC approvals. We've set the shareholder meeting date for August 23 and we expect to close on September 9. You may note the adjusted merger exchange ratio has been reset to reduce the shares of new Sirius by 90%. We expect the New Sirius share price will be higher at close because of that and we expect enhanced trading dynamics, including each increased potential for index inclusion. I look forward to remaining Chairman and a meaningful shareholder. Turning now to SiriusXM itself, the company maintains its strong financial position. Self-pay net adds improved sequentially and year-over-year, driven primarily by a reduction in voluntary churn. EBITDA was flat versus the prior year, but plus 8% versus the first quarter. We expect solid margin and cash generation through the balance of 2024. 2024 is also going to be a peak CapEx year and we expect to return to free cash flow growth in the coming years. We believe SiriusXM is attractive on a free cash flow multiple basis. Sirius continues to pursue growth opportunities. Beginning in the car with a new three-year subscription with a new vehicle purchase at certain automakers, free access, the first free ad-supported platform, which aims to increase trials and win back listeners and 360L is continuing to drive improved share of listening in the car. Looking at streaming, Sirius is launching new features and updates every month, and we've seen early improvements in multi-day listening. We've also seen increased engagement in the trial period versus the first quarter and finally, by pursuing smart unique content. The SmartLess podcast is kicking off its partnership in August with an exclusive subscriber event featuring Howard Stern, Jelly Roll and many more. Turning to Formula One Group. Despite early questions, this is turning out to be one of the most competitive seasons certainly in the start back to 2012. Across the first 14 races, we've seen seven different race winners and eight drivers have been on the podium. This is on -- we're on track to have the closest Constructors Championship across the top four since 2012 as well. The difference in time from front to back of grid at this point in the season is the closest also since the start of the current qualifying system in 2010. Looking at the 2020 driver market, continues to provide interest and excitement with Carlos Sainz going to Williams, Haas announcing Ocon joining as a current and -- current Ferrari reserve driver Bearman as well. Bearman is showcasing the pipeline of support Sirius talent that it's delivering to Formula 1. And the biggest open question remains what will Mercedes do with its open seat. Looking now at the financial results for F1, we had a great first half. Year-to-date revenues up 29% and OIBDA was plus 35%, partially driven by three additional races in the period this year. We announced LVCVA as an official partner. They're going to activate across 25 races in 2024 and 10 in 2025, and we continue to successfully scale partners brought in through LVGP. We remain excited about our sponsorship pipeline. Let me turn briefly to MotoGP. The transaction is progressing well. Regulatory filings are progressing on track. We've received foreign investment control clearance in both jurisdictions needed, Italy and Spain, and we recently received merger clearance in Brazil and Australia. We continue to expect the transaction to close by year-end. At MotoGP, the racing has been awesome. Pecco Bagnaia quickly closed the gap with Jorge Martin, but Martin just took the lead back in Silverstone. We are seeing a very competitive title fight now separated by only three points. And at MotoGP, 12 riders across 18 have been on the podium this season. Attendance is up across our races with a new all-time attendance record set at Le Mans and Germany was at 253,000 was up 8% off an already record 2023 attendance number. Similar to F1, rider movements are fueling excitement. We've also seen interesting movements in the Constructors Championship. Constructors a category rather with Pramac switching from Ducati to Yamaha next season. The summer break ended last weekend in Silverstone. We're excited for more action in the second half. Turning briefly to Quint, some of the second quarter highlights. We have the 150th Kentucky Derby, which was an enormous success, the largest single event executed in Quint history, serving over 12,000 customers per day. F1 Experiences has seen meaningful growth across eight races this year and we've completed inaugural activations for several new partnerships, including the WNBA All-Star Game and the Men's and Women's U.S. Open for the USGA. Turning to Live Nation, saw another record quarter with no signs of slowdown. 2024 is a year of AOI, amphitheaters and arenas and in the second quarter despite stadium activity being lower, concert attendance was up 5%, AOI was up 21% with record concert segment profitability, and this was one of the top five quarters in history for ticket sales. Revenue from on-site spending is also up double-digits year-to-date and cancellation rates for North America are tracking lower than last year. The ticketing and artist pipeline continues to expand globally. New artists have increased touring by 130% year-to-date and two-thirds of all total new enterprise tickets signed year-to-date are from international. Turning briefly to Venue Nation, we're continuing to see the enhancements made generate incremental revenue. Major festival's average per fan spend is up double-digits year-to-date. The amphitheater average per fan spend is also expected to grow by $2 per fan and Live Nation plans to open 14 major global venues across 2024 and 2025. Turning to the Braves, we've had strong performance from key players this season through last weekend. Ozuna led the National League with 86 RBIs. Since April 12, Sale has had a 2.64 ERA and Fried has had a 2.71 ERA, which ranked second and third respectively in the National League. Ahead of the trade deadline, the Braves announced the return of Jorge Soler to fill a key position in the outfield and right-handed pitcher Luke Jackson. Both players were on the 2021 World Series winning team. Fan demand remains strong, per caps up in ticketing and concessions year-over-year. There are 18,000 on the season ticket waitlist and we've seen a 90% renewal to date on season tickets for 2025. Several of the master planning projects completed earlier this year are already adding value and enhancing the fan experience. The new 60-foot six-inch Jim Beam Bar concessions are up double-digits versus 2023 concessions in the same location. Recently, they've announced further upgrades ahead of the 2025 season, including a new seating product, the Bullpen, which includes access to exclusive lounge underneath seats, an extension of the Coors Light Chop House seating area. Also, the Braves recently involved the -- unveiled the logo to kick-off the 2025 All-Star Game. The Braves are thrilled to host the All-Star Game. It's an incredible opportunity to showcase the Truist and the Battery sections. Now, I'll turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results. Thanks, Stefano and Brian. Our Annual Investor Day will be Thursday, November 14 in New York City. Please note, we've moved to a new location. We'll look forward to seeing you at the Jazz at Lincoln Center. Save the date. Additional details will be provided soon. We hope to see many of you there. And with that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Stefano, why don't you start and then I'll ask Rene to comment on Vegas. Thank you, Bryan. Next question, please. Stefano, why don't I let Brian talk about the about the mix and then let you comment on the Concorde agreement. Okay. I'll take a cut. So, first on Live Nation, I think the business, as you heard and you noted, continues to operate very well. I think that the company operates fully within the law, has had a monitor in place for 14 years. And so any actions have been well known for a long time and we believe the charge of the DOJ are without merit, particularly the idea that somehow breaking it up with lower ticket prices. So, I don't think that remedy, which we don't think is in our interests or the interest of consumers is what the DOJ really wants if they actually understood what was wrong with the market. The fact is the market is driven by excess demand compared to supply that drives prices. So, I don't think a breakup is in the interest of Live Nation today or in the interest of the consumer, and we'll go forward. The plan at least as far as I understand is to go forward with the businesses we have. And the continued businesses what we believe will continue to operate very well through the base -- through 2024 and into 2025. Looking at Andretti, as you saw this morning, we announced that there is a DOJ investigation. We intend to fully cooperate with that investigation, including any related request for information. We believe our determination -- F1's determination was in compliance with all applicable U.S. antitrust laws and we've detailed the rationale for our decision vis-a-vis Andretti in prior statements. We are certainly not against the idea that any expansion is wrong. There is a methodology for expansion that requires approval of the FIA and the F1 and both groups have to meet -- find the criteria met. And we're certainly open to new entrants making applications and potentially being approved if those requirements are met. Maybe Renee is in a good position to take that. Next question, please. Thanks, Vijay. So, I'll comment a little bit on sponsorship and let Stefano add anything he wishes. Look, I think very excited about the sponsorship pipeline, excited about what Emily Prazer and her team, Johnny are doing there. We've seen continued interest from blue-chip clients who want to be involved at prices which are more attractive for us than historical levels and filling out categories that we previously had not had an entry in the sponsorship world. So, obviously, I can't comment on any rumored or unannounced deals, but I feel very good about the pipeline, feel very good about where we both are on those new entrants and on renewals at attractive prices from some of our existing players. Stefano, anything you want to add? Yes. And I think Stefano hit on some great points. I'll just add. It's not only the quality of the partners and what they're willing to pay, they're willing to pay because they are getting value out of it and they're finding ways to activate on -- at races, on the grid, on the -- around events in ways that are more meaningful for them and for us. So, all of those are very positive. Renee, what would you add? Thank you. Next question. I'll comment on the regs briefly, but I think Stefano could actually be -- articulate on them as well. We think the regs are designed to create more exciting racing, while also meeting many other goals around issues like sustainability and things that help our OEM partners drive innovation. So, we're trying to hit on multiple levels. I think people were doubtful about what these regs, how the regs would play out when we induced them last time. And by many measures, as we noted earlier, we've never had more competitive racing. Our hope is that the 2026 regs will do the same. But as you rightly note, somebody may figure out a way to get a jump and take an early lead, but we think they're designed to create more parity and more exciting racing and should over time. Stefano, what might you add? Thank you. Next question, please. So, I'll comment on the first one and I'll let, Derek, if you'd like to take the second. I think, Barton, your assumption that we get increases generally in race promotion fees is correct. Derek, do you want to take on the Braves impact of Diamond? Thank you. Stefano, do you want to take the Paddock Club issue and I will let Brian to add? Operator, I believe that was our last question. Thank you to our listening audience for your interest in Liberty Media and the Atlanta Braves Holdings. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter, if not sooner."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. The 2024 season is delivering incredible racing and action for our fans at home and our sold-out events. F1 continues to prove there is an incredible competition on track. Through 14 races this season, we have had seven different winners from four teams. The gaps between teams are getting closer both in qualifying and races. In Emilia, Max beat Lando by only seven-tenths of a second, following Lando's incredible win in Miami. In Monaco, we saw Charles Leclerc take his first home victory. In Canada, the gap between the top four in qualifying was one-tenth of a second and we have seen Mercedes return to the top step of the podium with George winning in Austria and Lewis setting his record ninth victory at Silverstone. Hungary saw another excellent race ending in Piastri's first F1 win with the McLaren 1 and 2 and Hamilton rounding out the podium. In Spa, we had an incredible race with very tight gaps throughout and the race led by being swapped multiple times. George Russell crossed the finish line first after a thrilling final lap battles against Lewis, but was disqualified after the race because the car did not meet the required weight, meaning Lewis took his second victory of the season, with Oscar Piastri second and Charles Leclerc third. By many measure, we have never had more competitive racing. I expect that the remainder of 2024 season will continue to deliver great racing for our fans. And as we look forward, the increasingly close racing offers very exciting prospect for 2025. The incredible competition on track is leading to even higher engagement as our diverse fan basis continues to grow. We have welcomed over 3.7 million attendees through the first 14 races of this season with the Canadian Grand Prix seeing record attendance of 350,000 and Silverstone matching its incredible 2023 record attendance of 480,000. We continue to see sold-out events and there is strong demand for the races still to come this season. On TV, we are seeing particularly strong numbers in key growth markets, including Australia, U.S., China, Canada, South Africa and the Middle East. Looking at the recent races, the Canadian Grand Prix was the most viewed live race ever in Canada. The British Grand Prix was impressively the most viewed live European races over on Sky U.K. and earned the largest overall weekend audience for the F1 in the U.K. since 2016. Looking at the U.S., five races this season have achieved record live viewership for their respective events, the Chinese, Miami, Monaco, Canadian and British Grand Prix. The Miami Grand Prix viewership peaked at 3.6 million on ABC and the 18 to 49 demographics averaged 1.3 million and the Sprint Races averaged 946,000 viewership on ESPN, the largest on the channel since we introduced the Sprint format in 2021. Our digital and social platform also continued to see very strong performance. We saw a 32% decrease in social media followers compared to 2023, driven by the success of the new channel, Threads and WhatsApp and accelerated growth on Instagram. We also have higher engagement with 4.1 billion video views and 880 million interaction on Instagram year-to-date. F1 TV continues to perform well. Total subscribers are up 11% year-over-year. And in the U.S. market, subscribers are up 16% year-over-year. As previously mentioned, we implemented F1 TV price increases for the first time across markets early this year, which have been well received with the limited upticks in churn. F1 TV continues to be an important and growing product. We also continue to see great results from our podcast this season. Total listens to all episodes of the F1 podcast, including Beyond the Great F1 Nation and F1 EXplain since launch in 2018 surpassed 125 million this quarter. The F1 EXplain podcast is engaging new and more diverse audience with 40% of the listeners in the U.S. market. A few weeks ago, we announced the 2025 spring calendar with races to take place at six events: China, Miami, Belgium, Austria, Brazil and Qatar. The spring continues to be a big success with the higher TV audience for the Friday sprint qualifying and Saturday sprint race compared to traditional practice session. The events also bring extra on-track action for our fans attending the events, providing additional values for promoters. 80% of fans surveyed after the Chinese Grand Prix said that they prefer the new sprint format and we look forward to maintaining the momentum in 2025. The F1 Academy season is also off to a strong start with the first three races completed in Saudi, Miami and Spain and the next race in Zandvoort. Abbi Pulling is leading the series with -- and recently become the first woman to win a British F4 races. American driver Chloe Chambers took first in race two in Barcelona with a dominant victory over Pulling. F1 Academy is growing engagement and attracting new fans. In the last 12 months, F1 Academy social media followers have increased by three times with a diverse follower base. 57% of the F1 Academy followers on Instagram are female, 57% are under 25 old and 83% are under 35 years old. Online coverage of F1 Academy across new sites and social reached almost 700 million Internet users. The Miami Grand Prix alone generated 14.7 million video views and 4 million interaction on social media with 2 million live viewers on broadcast TV. F1 Academy has also been engaging fans attending F1 events around the calendar. Given the success alongside F1 races weekend many of the promoter hosting F1 Academy events this year are lining up to the host again in 2025 and we've received interest from several other markets. Turning to commercial updates. On race promotion there continues to be significant demand from potential new race hosts. We do not currently intend to go above 24 races in a season as our duty is to ensure the right strategic balance for the long-term future of the sport. The added benefit of this demand with limited race slot creates increased incentives for promoters to innovate and improve the experience of races across the calendar. More promoters are committing to investments in their races. For example, Hungary has committed to significant refurbishment including a new pit building from 2026. We are also seeing example of great entertainment from promoters including the Barcelona Fan Event, Thursday Concert in Silvester and of course we look forward to returning to Las Vegas after an incredible show in 2023. We announced the 2025 calendar much earlier this year which gives the teams and promoters more time to prepare and market their events. We now continue to focus and optimize the calendar for 2026 and beyond. Our media rights we have some key renewal to address for 2026 including our deals across the Americas, U.S., Canada, Latin, Brazil and Mexico as well as across most of Asia including Japan. The continued growth of our diverse fan base around the world including the U.S. and demand from broadcasters means we are confident in the future of our media rights deals. We also continue to be excited about the amount of content F1 has to offer. Across race weekends, we have many events and lots of data provided by numerous cameras around the track and cars. We can offer our broadcast partners and the fans at home incredible access and insight into the weekend through all this content. Alongside this we are very pleased to once again deliver the F1 Kids program in this season for seven events. The feedback from 2023 was impressive and F1 Kids is providing to be a brilliant way to engage children in Formula 1 in a way that's accessible and fun for them. F1 Kids is available through broadcaster around the world via a live dedicated international feed of the Grand Prix. The feed features 3D graphics, child-friendly team radio transmission, technical explanation and a bespoke package of colorful graphics and animation including the cartoon driver's avatars and upgraded car delivery design. The production returned in Saudi followed by Monaco and Silverstone and will also be available for Dutch, Singapore, Sao Paolo, and Abu Dhabi Grand Prix later this season. Looking at sponsorship, we are confident in the pipeline with exciting conversation underway. We continue to have opportunities in categories such as financial services, consumer electronics, telco, and betting. We have also more closely integrated the sponsorship, licensing, hospitality, and marketing teams in a comprehensive strategy to optimize to grow the growth of our fandom and commercial opportunities. We are also continuing strong progress on fan engagement opportunities outside of race weekend. In partnership with Apple and Warner Brothers, we were delighted to recently confirm that the much-anticipated movie titled F1, starring Brad Pitt, directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, will be released on the 25th of June 2025. We were excited to release the movie teaser during the build-up of the British Grand Prix. The theme is unique in that it is being filmed authentically during our racing weekend, and it will be a great opportunity for our sport to reach new fans and engage audiences. The sixth season of Drive to Survive, after reaching the top 10 on Netflix in over 40 markets, has seen its global audience of over 100 million viewers in the first five months since release. Across all six seasons to date, the cumulative audience for the series is close to 800 million. F1 Arcade continues to perform well, with high numbers of booking during both race and non-race weeks. The new Boston location has seen 50,000 guests in the first two months since launch. All three F1 Arcade venues hosted a ticketed watch party during the three day Silverstone race, and all venues sold out, with the London venues welcoming almost 600 guests. The ongoing success of the project means that in addition to the venues in London, Birmingham and Boston, F1 Arcade is planning to open new venues in Washington, D.C. in late 2024 and Las Vegas in 2025, with more to come. Following successful runs in Madrid and Vienna, the F1 exhibition has continued its successful road show in Toronto, which has been extended to mid-September, and will open in London later this month, showcasing the incredible history of the sport in the U.K. Even though the London show is not yet open, 60,000 tickets have already been sold. These are great examples of bringing fans and future fans into our sport through different routes, with a mix of F1, entertainment and hospitality. Our ESG program remain an important focus for the business. Earlier this year, we published our first impact report showing the progress we are making on our Net Zero 2030 commitment, as well as our diversity and inclusivity initiatives, both within our business and wider sport. A key part of our plans will be to move to fully sustainable fuel in 2026, which we believe could provide huge benefit as an innovative solution to decarbonize existing and future cars for both the F1 ecosystem and the broader automotive industry. This has been a very important reason behind Ford and Audi joining the sport in 2026. We continue to work closely with the teams, the FIA, partners and promoters to deliver on our commitment, as highlighted by recent events. The Silverstone event was powered by renewable energy, including over 2,000 solar panels and has increased the recycling at the event. Following success in also last year, there have been further trials of a low carbon energy system deployed to support activity across the path pit lane and broadcast compound that has been shown to reduce related emissions by 90%. Trials this year has taken place in Austria and Hungary, with the first scheduled for Monza. On diversity and inclusion, we were delighted to recently confirm that as a part of our program to provide education opportunities to our represented groups, 20 engineering students in the U.K. and Italy will become the latest recipient of the Formula One Engineering Scholarship over 2024 and 2025. Founded in 2021, the scholarship program addressed some of the key barriers to higher education for our represented students, including financial burden and access. By '25, 50 students will have entered the program. As I mentioned earlier, F1 Academy continues to go from strength to strength and is critical to our goal of developing and preparing young female drivers to progress to higher levels of competition. Eight female drivers, including five F1 Academy drivers, raced in round six of the F4 British Championship, which was the highest ever level of female participation in the championship. We also have a talented driver, Sophia Floersch, racing in FIA Formula 3 for Van Amersfoort Racing. This shows the huge importance of the FIA F3 and FIA F2 Pyramid run by Bruno Michel that continues to develop and nurture young talent to reach the very top of our sport. Creating the right structure for these talented female drivers and ensuring we have the right system in place to nurture talent at a young age is incredibly important. That is why we continue to be excited about our grassroots program, Discover Your Drive, to encourage and nurture females as young as eight to try to go karting. We remain focused on the long term goal and building a sustainable increase in female participation in motorsport. It has been a fantastic season so far, with more to come after the summer break. The interest in and demand for our sport continues to be huge, and I'm confident in our future. Avanti tutta, full speed ahead. And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you. Ciao. Yes. Thank you, Greg. Thank you, Bryan. I mean, for what we can see as we have already announced, we don't see any kind of significant backdrop of any interest. I mean, we have sold out even in the events we had in front of us and there is still a very, very, very high interest. We are, of course, monitoring the situation on the events side because we know that in other area there is a sort of drop of that request. But this is something that we don't see at all in our championship. Okay. The second question on Concorde agreement. I would say, as we said the other time, I mean, it's all good because we have the right terms, the right relation with the team. And as you know, the Concorde is divided into three main pillars. One is financial, one is commercial, and one is related to governance. Everything is progressing very, very well. As you know, we are not in a rush to complete the long form, but everything is running smoothly as expected. And this is really great because the relation with the teams, with the FIA and with all the other stakeholders is very good in this moment. So, working and progressing in the right way. And of course, we are focusing to try to maximize the benefit to have the maximum joint commercial activities with all the teams and making sure that what we're going to sign up will be the right in term of division of the revenues between the team and the commercial right holder, but it's all great now. I couldn't agree more, Greg. I think that the numbers is proving the interest that is there in our business. And I think that now if you look-back just four years ago, we had only four -- global four and now we're heading to 10 and there is a big interest now, but the real point is to keep the quality of our partners with the right price level that we want to engage together. So, it's -- we are in a very, very strong situation. I believe, as I said, we have an incredible opportunity for our partners to create partnership between also themselves. So, it's a B2B relation that is having a multiplier effect and this is really what is important for our business to develop in the future. So, nothing to add, but as I said, just stay tuned because everything is looking forward -- looking very good for our future. I would say that this dilemma at the end of each cycle of regulation is there. And the things that F1 together with the FIA has always done, I totally believe so, has been to anticipate the need of that change. And we, of course, keep at the center the fact that we want to have a very good competition on track, give the possibility drivers to express themselves and making sure that with the budget cap combination and limitation development, teams can catch-up quicker to keep the gaps between the teams smaller. And -- but on the other side, we have the duty to anticipate the things that are relevant in terms of technology to keep at the center of our platform is so important. That's why two years ago, we had -- we took the decision of putting at the center the new power unit with sustainable fuel. There was the need to put that at the center because then in terms of technological challenges, this would appear at that moment to be the most important one. So, I do believe that -- I -- it's part of the game, teams are working already plan out for '26 because the regulation will be very, very different. But I'm sure that the ones that are very skeptical about what normally we try to anticipate, we will think differently as soon as we see the action on track. And as Greg was correctly saying before, I remember very clearly people without the experience thinking that the regulation that we are now in would have to slow down cash by more than six, seven seconds and not having this kind of situation. So, I think that we are doing the right thing and as always in life, you need to be brave to try to anticipate the thing the right way and that's what we did. On the second one, I think it's related to U.S. First of all, let me say that we are very happy with the ESPN, what they did for our sport and what they are doing since the beginning of our journey together. And we see now bigger interest for sure. And we see some other sport are trying to divide the package in a different way. But of course, that's a personal opinion. We're going to tackle that subject in the due course in the next couple of months. I do believe that, in U.S., we are still in a place where the awareness is very, very important. So, what I can say from a customer point of view, if you are not really on the spot on the sport, creating multiple offer is creating more confusion, let me put it this way. So, therefore, I would say, we need to make sure that the incredible demand that we have from different partners will be taken in the right way at the appropriate time. But for sure, yes, Martin will represent for us a big opportunity for the next years. Yes. Thank you, Stephen. I mean, we have a quality problem to take on now for sure. That is the fact that we in almost all the events, we are sold out. And when we're talking about hospitality, what we were very good to do it is to try to maximize the different packages. Now the point is, if you want to add places with the right space and the right quality for the service that we're offering. There is the need, of course, to take a rate by rate situation to see what we can do with the promoters in terms of capacity, in terms of possible extension. And this is something that we are discussing. There are advanced situation, for example, with Australian promoters and with some others because for us, of course, it is a matter of experience. So, we cannot run the risk of overcrowding the hospitality area because the demand is very high. So, now we are seeing -- we are watching, as I said, with everyone what we can do in terms of having the possibility to expand this area to offer the right service for the ones that wants to have it."

            "name": "Brian Wendling",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash of $88 million, excluding $100 million of cash held at SiriusXM. During the quarter, Liberty SiriusXM paid down $35 million under the margin loan using cash on hand. There's $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity as of quarter end. As of August 7, the value of our SiriusXM stock was $10 billion and we have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $10.9 billion, which includes $9.1 billion of debt at SiriusXM. As Greg mentioned, the transaction with SiriusXM is expected to close on September 9. In connection with the transaction close, the 3.75% Liberty SiriusXM convertible notes and the 2.75% Sirius exchangeable notes will be assumed by New Sirius and the margin loan will be retired. Following transaction close, holders of the 2.75% exchangeable notes will have the right to require New Sirius to repurchase the notes and we would expect a substantial majority of holders will exercise this right. Turning to the Formula One Group, at quarter end, Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $1.5 billion, which includes $1.2 billion of cash at F1 and $58 million of cash at Quint. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $2.9 billion, which includes $2.4 billion of debt at F1, leaving $530 million at the corporate level. F1's $500 million revolver is undrawn and their leverage at quarter end is 1.3 times. MotoGP transaction is progressing well. We have syndicated all bridge financing commitments and reduced the total commitment from $2 billion to $1.65 billion. Note that the $1.65 billion commitment is expected to be replaced with a combination of cash and debt financing at the F1 OpCo level. We also entered into commitments for $150 million incremental Term Loan A at Formula 1 conditioned on the transaction close. And we obtained commitments from banks to provide Dorna with a new EUR150 million Term Loan A and an upsized EUR100 million revolver to be entered into after and subject to transaction closed and to be used by Dorna for general corporate purposes. Looking at the F1 business, I will again remind you that the business is best analyzed on an annual basis given variability in year-over-year race calendar. With that said, I'll make a few brief remarks on the quarterly results, but would very much encourage you to focus on the year-to-date results. During the quarter, F1 recognized a higher proportion of season-based income with eight out of 24 races occurring during the period compared to six out of 22 in the prior year period. Media rights and sponsorship revenue also increased due to contractual increase in fees and revenue from new agreements. Growth in F1 TV continues to benefit media rights revenue. Race promotion revenue was relatively flat given the mix of races with Australia and Azerbaijan dropping out of Q2 compared to last year with Japan, China, and Austria being added in the current period. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher hospitality and freight revenue, driven by the additional races. Adjusted OIBDA grew in the quarter as revenue growth more than offset increased costs due to higher pro rata recognition of team payments and the expectation of increased team payments for the full-year over 2023, as well as increased costs due to the additional races held and cost supporting revenue growth. Team payments are best viewed on a year-to-date basis and represented 61.9% of pre-team OIBDA for the first half of the year compared to 62.6% in the prior year. I would note Q2 and Q3 tend to have the highest percentage payout ratios based on the greater mix of European races in these quarters. Other costs of F1 revenue and SG&A are best viewed as a percent of total revenue for the year. Again, looking at it on a year-to-date basis, the adjusted OIBDA margin improved from 24.6% through Q2 '23 to 25.8% through Q2 '24. Looking briefly at corporate and other results in the second quarter, corporate and other revenue was $141 million, which includes Quint results and approximately $6 million of rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza. Corporate and other adjusted OIBDA was $5 million in the second quarter and includes Quint results, Grand Prix Plaza rental income, offset by corporate expenses. Quint results in the second quarter were primarily driven by the Kentucky Derby and F1 Experiences across the eight races held. Reminder that Quint's business is seasonal with the largest and most profitable events taking place in Q2 and Q4. We expect corporate and other adjusted OIBDA will benefit from the rental income and the Quint results for the full-year. At the Liberty Live Group, there's attributed cash of $406 million and there's $400 million of undrawn margin loan capacity related to our Live Nation market loan. As of August 7, the value of the Live Nation stock -- our Live Nation stock was $6.3 billion and we have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end. Turning briefly to the Atlanta Braves Holdings, revenue grew in the second quarter despite three fewer home games compared to the last year. Baseball event revenue growth was driven by new sponsorship agreements as well as contractual increases on season tickets and existing sponsorship contracts. Broadcasting revenue grew as there were more total games between home and away played in the second quarter. Baseball operating costs increased in the second quarter, primarily due to higher player payroll, increased payments under MOB's revenue-sharing plan and higher minor league team and player expenses. The Battery continues to perform very well with revenue up 11% and adjusted OIBDA up 13% in the second quarter. Looking at the capital improvement projects around the ballpark, a reminder that the Braves are spending approximately $15 million related to the projects completed ahead of the 2024 season across the back half of 2023 and early '24. The Braves recently announced additional improvement projects to open ahead of the '25 season, primarily related to new seating options and expect to spend approximately $20 million on these projects across the back half of '24 and early '25. These are all high-returning projects that will generate incremental revenue for the Braves in the 2025 season. At the Battery, the Truist headquarters is progressing ahead of schedule, and we'd expect to hand that building over to Truist in September. Now I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula 1. Yes. So, on the promoter mix, as we noted in our prepared remarks, you had Australia and Azerbaijan fall out, you had China, Austria, Japan and Emilia come back into the quarter for 2024. Obviously, each race has a different fee. So, when we say promoter mix, you're looking at different fees for each race, which has an impact there. As you look at the remainder of the year, you have pretty comparable quarters. As you look forward, Japan in -- in Q3, we'll have one less race with Japan basically falling out, but Azerbaijan coming back in and then Q4 looks pretty similar. So, again, we would just highlight that you look at the business on a year-to-date or full-year basis when available. Yes. You can see on Page 3, the eliminations for the quarter that primarily represents the eliminations between Quint and Formula One. You also have the lease payment across from LVGP up to Liberty Corporate in there as well. But that largely represents Quint buying tickets from Formula 1 and then reselling them. But at the price that they're buying them from Formula 1. Yes, Stephen, on the team payments part, I would point you to the year-to-date results there. So, we are at 61.9% on a U.S. GAAP basis pre-team, team payments as a percent of pre-team share OIBDA compared to 62.6% last year. We would expect some very minimal leverage as you go throughout the year and look to the end of the year, but it's fairly de minimis. But definitely focus on the year-to-date number, not the quarter."

            "name": "Renee Wilm",
            "content": "And maybe just to focus a little bit on the Vegas portion of the question, I would say that what we're seeing in terms of ticket sales trends is consistent with what you would expect for a year two event. Also, U.S. is a last-minute market and Las Vegas is even more of a last-minute market. Year one is not necessarily the best comparison for a couple of reasons. First off, there was a longer sales cycle. We went on sale during our launch event, which was six months earlier than this year's on sale for year two. And there is just -- you cannot minimize just the excitement around the early demand that you see for a year one event. So, focusing directly onto year two, what we have done a little differently this year and a couple of our partners mentioned this earlier this week during their own earnings calls is really focus our marketing on the upcoming period. What we did last year was really market throughout the year. Again, it was a year-one event and we wanted to maintain the excitement and the momentum. But what we're seeing here is that leading three months up to an event, you're getting the most demand. So, we're putting our dry powder into the marketing spend that's upcoming and we're really excited about the demand that we're starting to see and expect to continue to see an uptick in. Thanks, Greg. Thanks for the question on Quint. So, I would say prior to the acquisition, Quint was obviously a third-party vendor. They would acquire inventory directly from the promoters, particularly around secondary hospitality offerings. And then the relationship back to Formula 1 would be essentially that of a profit share arrangement. They did also provide some reseller capabilities with regard to Paddock Club for the teams as well as for F1 directly. Now that Quint is a subsidiary of Liberty Media, we have looked to integrate those businesses in a more -- in a closer manner, but while also still being cautious around leakage under the Concorde agreement. So, keeping -- really do keeping those business relationships on kind of a third-party basis. With regard to LVGP, we have directly integrated them and we've outsourced our sales team to Quint. They are running our sales and ticketing program, obviously, in partnership with myself and with Emily Prazer. And then their results will be consolidated up through Liberty Media with commission-based arrangement being paid to Formula 1, which commission-based payments then goes into the prize fund. Going forward, we are also going to be looking for new ways to really prove out the thesis around the acquisition and enable Quint to be a closer partner to all the promoters and to F1, but that is all in process still. I'll refer to Brian on the accounting question. I think that's an excellent point, Greg. Just to pick up on the sponsorship piece for a second, we really use the LVGP as the test-bed for how we can bring these marquee sponsors more deeply into the activations on track and in the fan zones. And I think one of the most important impacts of the Vegas race beyond the financial side is just the increase in interest in the pipeline, including with some of these marquee companies with whom we're speaking. So, a lot of excitement around the sponsorship portion. And then, Vijay, to answer your question, we do sell tickets to our hotel partners, which they then package into their own deals for their customers or obviously their -- I'm sure there are some comp arrangements for the big spenders who come to town for gambling. And then they'll come to us later in the year as they need more inventory. So, year one, we -- I'd day, they bought a lot of tickets very early on, again, to address that early demand that everyone saw for year one. And now this year, we are working closely with them to again do the marketing push and start filling those hotel rooms now that people are back from school and back-to-school, back from vacation and looking at their fall calendars."

            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Greg. Yes, obviously, we were off for three months and you never like to see carriage disputes. We're thankful that the carriage dispute is resolved. What I can tell you is there's really no material impact on our business. We've certainly seen a reduction during that period of time in ratings that is somewhat commiserate with the reduction in the carriage. Now that that's back, we'd expect that those ratings to also go up. So, we're glad that it's done and glad that they got that all resolved. Well, the streaming rights are held at the league level right now, so those don't belong necessarily to Diamond. There's a provision inside of the agreement that's rather complicated as it relates to the streaming. Of course, in the future, should all these rights come back to us, I think we're prepared to evaluate all the different options including streaming."

I would now like to turn the call over to Clare Adams, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nUnknown Executive: Good morning. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed by Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call, and Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media or Atlanta Braves Holdings' expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. \n On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Media, SiriusXM and Atlanta Braves Holdings, including adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. The required definitions and reconciliations for Liberty Media, SiriusXM and Atlanta Braves Holdings Schedules 1 through 3, can be found at the end of the earnings press releases issued today, which are available on Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings' websites.\n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO. \nGregory Maffei: Thank you, Clare, and good morning to all. Today, speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali, Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. Also during Q&A, we will answer questions related to Atlanta Braves Holdings and Braves' management will be available as well. So beginning with Liberty SiriusXM, the LSXM SIRI transaction is progressing well. The regulatory process is on track, and we still expect a close by the -- early in the third quarter. Turning to SiriusXM itself, had a solid first quarter performance, revenue up 1%, EBITDA up 4%. They are continuing to benefit from cost optimization across the org. They expect to pay net adds, improvements in the second half and in fiscal '24 versus '23.\n They did, also on their call, reiterate the 2024 guidance. They are maintaining margins while investing to support future growth.\n Management is focused on a couple of key strategic initiatives, and we've seen some still early, but promising metrics on the new app. We continue to move engagement for lower listening cohorts to higher listening levels, and we've been able to adapt to consumer feedback more quickly utilizing this application.\n SIRI exclusive content continues to attract new customers. James Corden, series recently -- which was recently initiated, quickly moved into the top 3 talk shows. Notably, we're also progressing with the rollout of 360L. There was an expanded Hyundai Genesis partnership, which will integrate 360L, and adoption of 360L leads to better consumer trends, including higher conversion.\n Now turning to Formula One Group. We were thrilled to announce in April the acquisition of MotoGP. I want to reiterate the attractive qualities of this asset, a global league-level sport with incredible racing. For example, across the first 4 races, we've had 10 riders across 7 teams reach the podium and the average time to decide the race winner has been about a second. Monday, the new technical regulations for the sport were announced for the 2027 time frame. They expect even closer racing and more overtaking utilizing these new technical rigs.\n Attendance at the races is performing very well, for example, the Portuguese GP at Portimao is up 41% versus the prior year. And the Spanish GP at [indiscernible] had the highest attendance since 2015. The sport is awesome, and Liberty has experienced to help them hopefully grow the exposure across the world.\n A couple of deal updates here. We're also progressing on required regulatory filings. We have syndicated the financing commitments and hedged our foreign exchange exposure, and we still expect to close by year-end.\n Turning now to F1. We've had successful races in several key growth markets. We returned to China for the first time since 2019, and the first time with a Chinese driver. It was a sold-out race and live viewership on CCTV was up 50% versus 2019. Miami was an exciting and very competitive race. I want to congratulate Lando on winning his first GP after 15 podiums. And McLaren upgrades are working well and we expect more competitive racing from that going forward. \n We continue to see growth in the U.S. engagement. Miami was sold out with a new attendance record of 275,000. F1 achieved its largest live U.S. TV audience at 3.1 million, with a peak of 3.6 million. We also had our largest audience for a Sprint race since the format was introduced in 2021. We also hosted the second F1 Academy event of the season in Miami. We are excited that we are contributed to in promoting continued momentum in women's sports. We are attracting more diverse audiences that are exciting and relevant to all. At F1 Academy, Instagram followers are 55% female, but also 45% male. Everyone watches women's sports.\n We recently announced new docuseries with Netflix and Reese Witherspoon's Production Company, Hello Sunshine, about F1 Academy, and we look forward to seeing the series growth.\n Turning now to LVGP, a few updates. We redefined the product ladder to reach a greater range of fan base. We are now integrating the commercial and marketing functions across F1, LVGP and [indiscernible] more closely to achieve better harmony and cost savings. We think this will allow us to have aligned sponsorship and sales efforts across the org, and as I mentioned, it will be more cost effective.\n We kicked off the events business at Grand Prix Plaza in Las Vegas, hosting some exciting brands, including a Super Bowl media party, Autodesk, CrowdStrike and our own QVC's Age of Possibility. Now touching briefly on Quint. We closed the acquisition in early January. Some of the first quarter highlights were the 2024 All-Star game, which was NBA Experience's largest event ever for ticket packages and revenue, and F1 Experiences saw solid demand across the first 3 races of F1, including a [indiscernible] across all products in Australia. We do believe there is strategic value in having Quint and F1 under the same roof. The data sharing across companies allows us to know the fan better and improve our touch points and leveraging Quint sales and marketing will create efficiencies and leverage the sales process, including at LGVP, as I mentioned.\n I want to reiterate, we expect Quint to be adjusted OIBDA accretive to F1.\n Turning on -- touching on Live Nation briefly. Global fan demand continues to surge. First quarter revenue was up 21% and AOI was up 15%. They had a record first quarter for sponsorship, also up 24%. Indicators will point to another record year. Over 85% of the large shows were booked versus 75% at this time in the prior year, and concert ticket sales for arena and amphitheaters are pacing up double-digit levels. We also see continued success in international markets and in the Venue Nation strategy. Ticket sales for the Latin packs were up double digits in the U.S. And at venues, we're opening at least 12 major global venues in the 2024 time frame, and we have capacity for 8 million additional fans, and we think we can enhance the consumer experience and generate strong returns.\n Finally, touching on the Braves, off to another great start to the season despite early injuries in a tough Dodger series last weekend, a great win last night in the ninth inning as usual with us. Strong demand continues. We've seen multiple sellouts already this season. We're trending #4 in average attendance per game across MLB, and we have sold 93% of our ticket capacity season to date.\n We've completed the renovations at Truist Park ahead of the season. There's a new Lexus level premium boxes. There's an expanded retail store capacity. We have the Jim Beam Bourbon Decks with bars replicating the length between the pitcher's mound plate. And these upgrades are already generating incremental revenue this season.\n We announced several new sponsors this season early, including Ball Corp and Lexus, and we are creating more inventory around the ballpark, including LED signage, and we are leveraging the demand for renewals on our existing partnerships. The Braves are positioned for another great year on and off the field.\n So with that, I'll turn it over to you, Brian, for more on our financial results. \nBrian Wendling: Thank you, Greg, and good morning. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $64 million, excluding $71 million of cash held at SiriusXM. During the quarter, Liberty SiriusXM paid down $65 million under the SiriusXM margin loan using cash on hand. There's $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity related to our SiriusXM margin loan as of quarter end.\n As of May 7, the value of our SiriusXM stock was $10 billion, and we have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings.\n Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $11.1 billion, which includes $9.3 billion of debt at SiriusXM.\n Turning to the Formula One Group. At quarter end, Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $1.3 billion, which includes $1 billion of cash at Formula one. Quint acquisition closed in January and was funded with $205 million of Formula One Group cash on hand, net of the Quint cash that was acquired. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $2.9 billion, which includes $2.4 billion of debt at Formula One, leaving $531 million at the corporate level.\n F1's $500 million revolver is undrawn and their leverage at quarter end was 1.7x. Looking at the F1 operating business. As we've reiterated multiple times, it is best analyzed on an annual basis giving variability in the year-over-year [indiscernible] calendar. With that said, however, I will make some brief remarks on the first quarter. There were 3 races held in the first quarter compared to 2 races in the prior year period. F1 recognized an additional race promotion fee this year as well as a higher proportion of season-based income due to 3 out of 24 races occurring during Q1 '24 compared to 2 out of 23 in the prior year, which was ahead of the Imola race cancellation in Q2 '23.\n Other revenue increased due to the start of the F2 vehicle cycle, which is largely offset within other cost of F1 revenue as well as higher hospitality revenue and freight income. F1 also recognized revenue and costs related to the F1 Academy due to the earlier start of the season compared to last year.\n Adjusted OIBDA grew alongside revenue in the quarter. Team payments were higher due to the higher pro rata recognition as well as the expectation of increased team payments for the full year. A reminder that team payments should be analyzed on a full year basis. The revenue recognized based on the mix of flyaway and European races impacts how team payments appear as a percentage of pre-team share EBIT when looking on a quarterly basis. As F1 has grown EBIT over the past several years, the percentage payout has shifted, with F1 recognizing a greater proportion of the economic upside as pre-team share EBIT has reached certain thresholds.\n We expect to continue to realize leverage on the team payment -- team payout going forward. To note that the incremental payout percentage on pre-team shared EBIT growth recognized in 2023 should not be applied to future growth. Other costs of F1 revenue and SG&A continue to be best viewed as a percent of total revenue for the year.\n Looking at corporate and other results, which as of this quarter includes the consolidation of Quint, corporate and other revenue includes Quint results and approximately $7 million of rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza. Corporate and other adjusted OIBDA was a loss of $6 million in the quarter. This includes the rental income, Quint results and other corporate overhead. Note at the start of the year seasonally live for Quint with modest event activity, while the business still incurs ordinary course fixed operating expenses, which largest and most profitable events take place in the second quarter and fourth quarter with the Kentucky Derby in May and larger and more frequent -- or an increased quantity of F1 hospitality events held in the fourth quarter. We expect corporate and other adjusted OIBDA will benefit from rental income and Quint results through the rest of the year.  \n At the Liberty Live Group, there's attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $423 million, which includes ETF assets. There's a $400 million -- or there's $400 million of undrawn margin loan capacity related to our Live Nation margin loan. And as of May 7, the value of our Live Nation stock held at Liberty Live Group was $6.7 billion. We have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end.\n And I will turn quickly with that to AVH. There were no regular season home games played in either the first quarter of '23 or -- '24 or '23. Revenue growth primarily reflects higher broadcasting with more away games in the current year held due to the earlier start of the regular season as well as higher game day related revenue from increased demand and attendance at spring training home games.\n Braves continue to invest in payroll, which is reflected in increased baseball operating costs, and the Battery grew revenue 13% and adjusted OIBDA 9% in the quarter.\n CapEx related to the capital improvement projects completed at Truist Park ahead of the '24 season will total approximately $15 million across Q4 of '23 and early '24. These projects are generating incremental revenue, as Greg said, for the Braves already. And at the Battery, the Triust headquarter remains -- headquarters project remains on budget and on schedule. With that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One. \nStefano Domenicali: Thanks, Brian. The 2024 season is off to a great start with lots of action on the track and the gaps between the teams across the grid getting closer. While Red Bull and Max Verstappen continue to show their strength, we have seen regular [ produce ] from Ferrari, including 1 and 2 in Melbourne, showing their ongoing improvement as well as increasingly strong performance from McLaren including a great first race win by Lando Norris in Miami in front of a sellout crowd.\n The battle in the midfield is the closest it has been for many years, and we look forward to this continuing as the season progresses. We have 24 races this year with 6 Sprints events and are also delighted to have the F1 Academy alongside us at 7 F1 events.\n The return to China after full year break was incredible, and it was great to see a sold-out event, with over 200,000 weekend attendees. Interest in the events underline a growing younger fan base in the country, with all our Chinese fans cheering on their home hero [ Zhou Guanyu ]. Over 1.5 million viewers watched the race live on CCTV-5, far beyond the $1 million when we last visited in 2019. China was also host to our first sprint of the season, won by Max Verstappen and Red Bull with Lewis Hamilton taking second place. The sprint continues to deliver great action for our fans, broadcasters, sponsors and promoters.\n There has been plenty of drivers news of the track at the start of 2024. We have the exciting announcement that Lewis Hamilton will join Ferrari in 2025. Fernando Alonso has committed to remain with Aston Martin. Hulkenberg will go to Sauber in 2025, and we have yet to see where Carlos Sainz will be next year. This continues to create huge excitement and anticipation for our fans with 10 drivers still left to confirm their seat for the next year.\n We have seen records being broken for attendances at our races for the start of 2024 and expect very strong figures throughout the season. Bahrain saw record race day attendance. And in Melbourne, we had a huge crowd of 452,000 beating last year record attendance of 445,000. We also saw good growth in Japan, welcoming 229,000 funds, up 3% on 2023. Alongside this, we continue to see very strong demands for the Paddock Club with over 11,000 tickets sold for the first 4 races of the season where we operate the Paddock Club. We had a sellout in Bahrain and Saudi for the second year running and 2,500 race-day guest in China compared to just 1,100 when we last raced there in 2019. \n F1 continues to grow our overall engagement and fan bases. We are evolving our view data methodology to ensure we are capturing all our audiences globally and are working with Nielsen to build the model that capture a fuller scope. We had over 70 million cumulative TV viewers for the opening Grand Prix weekend in Bahrain, with 12 million in Germany, thanks to extensive free-to-air coverage on RTL. Through the first 3 races, we've seen particularly strong viewership in growth markets such as China and the Middle East. \n We now have 79 million total social media followers, up 24% year-on-year, with new followers growth also boosted by the introduction of new platforms like Threads and WhatsApp. On Instagram, our most popular social platform, 75% of our followers are under 35, 40% are under 25 and 30% of our under-25 followers are female. The U.S. has gained 500,000 new followers in 2024, up to the Chinese Grand Prix, which is up 90% over the follower growth for the same period last year. We also have a year's worth of follower growth in 1 week in the Chinese market surrounding the Chinese Grand Prix.\n In the U.S., we've also seen year-on-year growth across other digital platforms. U.S. F1 TV subscribers are up 16%, page view across f1.com, and up to 28% registered users or those who sign up for an account on F1 platforms are up 32%. Globally, unique digital to F1 com and app are up 4% year-on-year with page viewers up 29% and registered users up 28%. The total number of F1 TV subscribers has seen strong growth, with lower churn rates at all times high customer satisfaction. Season 6 of Drive to Survive premiered February 23. We reached the top 10 on [ letters ] in over 40 markets and continues to have among the highest completion rates or the numbers of people who watch more than 90% of the series on the platform when compared to both unscripted and scripted content.\n Production continues for the Apple [ thin ], which is on pace for the expected release in summer 2025.\n On the commercial side of the business, we had a very strong first quarter. We had growth across all revenue stream, benefiting from 1 additional race held compared to last year as well as growth from new sponsorship and media rights agreement and underlying escalators. We continue to see our business and partners benefiting from growth in overall fandom and the value F1 brings to partners.\n Especially on our sponsorship last week, we announced the world-leading software provider and digital consultant global has joined as an official partner in a new multiyear agreement. Also, in March, we have announced McDonald's as regional partner of Formula One in Latin America. This is the first of its kind for F1 in the region as the sport audience continues to grow in Latin America.\n On media rights, we continue to see strong demand and impressive work by all our broadcasters to bring our support to millions of fans around the world. We recently announced 5 years renewal with the Viaplay in the Netherlands and across the northern markets. The deal retains our partnership structure in the region, creating a strong position for our F1 TV Pro product that will continue to generate substantial additional fee. We also announced a new 2-year agreement with FanCode that sees the sports streaming platform become the exclusive broadcaster partner to Formula One in India until the end of 2025 season. This is a huge opportunity in a market with a growing fan base, especially among younger and female supporter. Our estimate shows that we have 60 million fans in India, with 1 in 2 having started following F1 in the last 4 years.\n F1 TV Pro would also remain in market in India. 2024 results are also benefiting from the new beIN SPORT agreement in the Middle East, which we referenced on our fourth quarter earnings call. We recently announced a subscription free streaming channel FAST, for the fans in the U.S. to watch F1, F2, F3 and F1 academy race replays and highlights, fully rounds of Classic Grand Prix and popular racing documentaries. The new channel will be distributed for FAST to watch on leading platforms, including Samsung TV Plus, Amazon TV and Pluto TV. In addition to generating revenue, we also expect it to push more fans to both ESPN and F1 TV Pro.\n We are confident heading into our U.S. media rights renewal for 2026 with strong growth in our U.S. tandem, sports content remaining highly attractive to the broadcasters and newer players continue to beat for sport rights. In addition to the U.S., key media rights renewal up after 2025 season include Latin America, Brazil, Canada and most of Asia, including Japan. Also on media rights, following its successful first season, F1 Kids will return in 2024. The program is providing to be an effective way to engage children in Formula One in a way that's accessible and fun for them. So I'm delighted it's back for a second season.\n Turning to race promotion. We announced our 2025 race calendar in April for what will be the Formula One 75 anniversary year. We expect to announce details of the 6 2025 Sprint venues in due course. The calendar feature in 24 races and will commence in Australia on 16 March and conclude in Abu Dhabi on 7 December. We will have just 1 Saturday night race in Las Vegas as Saudi and Behrain will return to the traditional Sunday race days. Announcing the calendar earlier than we ever had allowed us to focus on optimizing the schedule for the future years and plan logistics more efficiently for 2025. It also makes our promoter more sustainable partners by giving them greater certainty around planning their races and other events for next year.\n There continues to be huge interest and demand for our races around the world, and our focus is to maintain the right strategic balance of location and opportunities while being clear. We currently believe that '24 race schedule is the optimal number of events.\n Turning to Vegas. We are looking forward to year 2 of the race building on success of last year event. LVGP continues to generate great demand on the sponsorship site, both locally and for the sport more broadly. For example, we could not be more excited about our partnership with American Express and their engaging activation on site across the F1 ecosystem as well as their support for F1 Academy. In March, we enjoyed a successful American Express pre sales to kick off ticket sales for 2024 Vegas race, and we look forward to the continued growth of our partnership.\n We also continue to see progress on off-track action for fans. Our F1 Sim Racing series got underway recently and continues to provide exciting action for fans and all competitors. F1 Arcade recently opened the first of several planned U.S. venues in Boston as the arcade seeks to take advantage of F1 continued momentum in the U.S. Boston is off to a strong start and have the great launch in hosting 672 guests with a ton of media coverage. F1 Arcade London saw a 14% increase in attendance this quarter compared to the same period of last year. And the Birmingham Venue is also performing very, very well.\n F1 exhibition is now moving to other venues around the world, having opened in Vienna in February in Toronto last week, this follows the successful opening residency in Madrid, where it was Spain biggest selling temporary exhibition of 2023.\n Turning to sustainability and diversity and inclusion initiatives. In April, we were pleased to publish our first F1 impact report, providing an update on all the world delivered on our journey to net zero by 2030. We are on track to meet our targets. We achieved a [ 13% ] reduction through increasing our remote operation using renewable energy in factories, offices and events and from reducing the volume of freight.\n We have a strong pipeline of action to deliver the remaining 37% reduction target by 2030. On [DNI], our first group of students from Formula One engineering scholarship took placement with the F1 teams. And by 2025, we'll have founded the studies of 50 students from the unrepresented groups to undertake the studies in mechanical engineering. F1 academy started its second season in Saudi and joined us for their second event in Miami with exciting racing and great driving across the field.\n In Miami, American racer Courtney Crone joined the grid as the wildcard entry in a deal with reigning team championship PREMA racing and the QVC. The F1 Academy series will be shown live in over 160 international territories will be on F1 TV Pro and streamed live on F1 Academy's social channels. We have also been delighted to announce Charlotte Tilbury, Puma, Tommy Hilfiger and American Express as official partner of the series. We have also launched the F1 Academy Discover Your Drive aimed at [indiscernible] young female karters the opportunity to get into grass-roots level of our sport. Its first initiative was launched by MotoSport U.K. to identify and nurture U.K. karting talent from the age of 8. The number of female participate in age 11, 16 qualified for the British Indoor Karting Championship has more than tripled, and engaging programs will run alongside the all 7 F1 academy events in 2024.\n We are proud of this work and remain very focused on making the sport more open, diverse and sustainable place. 2024 will continue to be an exciting time for our sport, and I'm looking forward to the on-track action and opportunities we have as a business as we continue to go from strength to strength.\n Avanti tutta! \"Full speed ahead\". And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Bye-bye. [Foreign Language] \nGregory Maffei: Thanks, Stefano and Brian. And to the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and the Atlanta Braves Holdings. And now operator, I'd like to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. \nVijay Jayant: Can you talk about the trajectory of team payments as a percentage of pre-team EBITDA? Over the last couple of years, that's sort of declined about 300 basis points. I know there's structures in the splits of the teams that we're not aware of, but could we assume that kind of operating leverage again in 2024?\n And then anything you could say about the sponsorship pipeline at Formula One. It seems to be that revenue stream is slowing down a bit. Obviously, we can't really know what's happening there. \nBrian Wendling: Yes, Vijay, this is Brian. I'll take the team payment one. We'll try to give you the most information we can here without giving you the full model. But over the past few years, as F1 has grown pre-team share EBITDA and EBIT under the current Concorde Agreement, we've moved through various brand -- bands of pre-team share EBITDA, where the payout to the teams has decreased as a percentage for each band. We're now at a point where the percentage to the teams is fixed for incremental EBITDA and EBIT through the end of this current Concorde Agreement. We do expect to continue to have leverage in the team payments as a percent of pre-team share EBIT this year or adjusted OIBDA on our reported results, but not at that incremental rate that you noted that we saw from '22 to '23. \nGregory Maffei: Stefano, do you want to touch on sponsorship? \nStefano Domenicali: Yes. Thank you, Greg. I would say, Vijay, just to talk about our sponsorship pipeline. I would say the situation is very positive because I think that if you just look back just a couple of years ago, we had the only 4 global sponsors. Now we have 10 global sponsors, a lot of regional partnership, and the pipeline is very strong. And I would say, as you know, we are not giving here any kind of expectation but the situation is very solid. And today, it's not only a problem of quantity of sponsorship is really related to the quality, and we need to ensure that everyone is investing in Formula One has the right quality in terms of exposure, in terms of experience, in terms of what we can offer. So I would say that's really a very, very positive trend that we will see together with our partners who believes in Formula One. \nGregory Maffei: If I could just add, I agree with everything Stefano said. I feel very good about where we are recognizing sponsorship revenue for the balance of this year and into 2025, and are working hard at building that pipeline for '26 and beyond. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group. \nJeffrey Wlodarczak: First of all, congrats on Lando, winning in Miami GP. It's always good to get a new face top of the podium. I've actually got 2 questions not related to F1, one on Live Nation, one SIRI. Greg, on Live Nation, you comment on the pending any trust case against Live Nation? \n And then also, Greg, you mentioned the car app and seeing some sort of early positive signs when are we going to know if that was successful? Is that sort of a second half thing we should be looking for? And then looking forward, do you feel comfortable, I guess, all else being equal economically that SIRI can get back to positive subscriber growth? \nGregory Maffei: Hold on, app and economic growth. Okay. So look, I think on the discussion around Live Nation and the trust issues, the management team led by Joe summarized it well on their call last Thursday. The DOJ investigation appears focused on specific business practices within divisions of the company, not the merger or the business structure. Live doesn't believe the breakup of Live Nation Ticketmaster would be legally defensible remedy. And beyond that, we're kind of limited to what was said on that live earnings call if you listen to that.\n Turning to SIRI. Look, I think it's early days. We certainly would hope during the balance of this year to see a positive impact and greater learnings from the new app. The way the app is being rolled because of the app as a platform, you'll see us continue to roll out, at SIRI, new modules and new opportunities, which will help us get benefit. So I think you'll see some learnings early and hopefully more growing over time. But the exact timing of those and how the consumer -- both how we release them and how the consumer takes them up are still open to question.\n On economic growth, I do believe that we can start driving. We'll see better numbers in '24 versus '23 on SP&A. And I do think, over time, this app will be critical to helping us grow and getting back to a growth path at Sirius. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. \nDavid Karnovsky: First Stephano or Greg, can you talk to F1 TV and how we should think of this as a possible growth driver for media rights this year. I wanted to understand better how the price increases have been received so far along with the new user experience? And then on Quint, I appreciate the commentary and the strategic value to F1, but maybe you can also discuss Quint on a stand-alone basis, the market for premium hospitality? What's the kind of growth drivers over the long term? And just for Brian, on this, anything to note on the seasonality for Quint with revenue or margin? \nGregory Maffei: Do you want to start [indiscernible]. \nStefano Domenicali: Yes, Greg, if it's fine for you. Absolutely. I would say, first of all, F1 TV, as [indiscernible] said, is an additional entertainment fab for our fans and offer to fans that some of them are very, very expert. They can analyze all the data we're putting on the screen. And the good thing is that the numbers that we have seen so far are very encouraging because actually, even in Miami, there has been almost a record subscribers that we see. So it's a very, very important element that is related to the future of the media evolution that we want to offer to our customers.\n We didn't receive any negative comment on price increase. You may say maybe because it was too low before, that would be a good point, but so far, no one has said anything. And I would say for us, it's really relevant to keep up in terms of quality of the product, in terms of content of the product, and this is something that we'll develop even further with the artificial intelligence that will be -- that will play a very important part of our development with our future. \nGregory Maffei: Great. Thank you, Stefano. And I'll touch briefly on the Quint business drivers and let Brian, as you now, to touch on some seasonality, which I expect his comments will be fairly limited, but I don't want to cut him down. Look, on the drivers of the business, I think there are several. One is, and we mentioned -- I mentioned one already. The opportunity to help us be a better sales arm and be more effective for Formula One itself, particularly around LVGP. And you've seen us do more integration of that sales arm and utilize their customer knowledge, their customer strengths, the things that they do well to help us sell better, particularly at the high end at LVGP.\n Another driver of the business, though, is their ability to help other F1 promoters and elements sell their products. So they work with both teams and promoters, for example, Qatar to help sell tickets to their events, not just our event and to help sell out the things that they do and do ancillary services and ancillary events around the GPs.\n Third driver is obviously adding new sports and new events. And you've seen them grow that and expect that they will continue to do that over time. And hopefully, that's a place where Liberty may be able to help them open the door to new sports. \nBrian Wendling: David, on seasonality, we can't give you the very specific details, but what I'll say is that Q1 is probably the lowest quarter for Quint, followed by Q3. Q\t2 and Q4 really ramp up because you have the Kentucky Derby and you have a lot more of the larger F1 events that Quint participates in. So you'll see that Q2 and Q4 definitely vary materially from what you see in Q1. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Greg, now that you've had at least the public announcement with MotoGP, I'm just wondering if you had any update on opportunities that may have emerged or conversations you've had in terms of what you can do with that business now that you're -- all the partners of MotoGP know that Liberty is going to be acquiring most of the company. Anything that you would add from the call you did a couple of months ago?\n And then, Stefano, I think last quarter, you said sort of conquered agreement. The next one would be something you guys could maybe finish up pretty quickly, not a lot of controversy. I wanted to see if there was an update there, particularly as it relates to Brian's point about team splits being fixed going forward for this deal, any thoughts on how we might want to think about what that might look like in the next one? \nGregory Maffei: Thanks, Ben. So on MotoGP, when we -- after the announcement, we had an outpouring of interest from both potential broadcast partners, OEMs, potential sites, all of which are very interesting.\n Unfortunately, due to the nature of the regulatory process, we will be formulating those amongst ourselves and our plans, but we really can't reach out and do anything concrete with the MotoGP management team to avoid gun jumping until we have regulatory approval. So we are conjuring plans. We have some really good ideas, I think, I hope, and we hope to get permission to execute on those sooner rather than later. \nStefano Domenicali: On my side, Ben, with regard to the update on [ Coke ] agreement. As we always said, the situation, as you know, very well, this will expire on 2025. Now we are in the process of discussion with the teams. The most important point is to keep the situation as stable as possible. These are the points of discussion. And as you can imagine, we cannot go into details of it, but as soon as we can, we will share what we can do. \n As I said, the situation is optimal to keep discussing with the teams with all the relevant parts is the best way to finalize everything for a stronger future up to a longer term. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. \nStephen Laszczyk: Maybe for Greg on F1 media rights, I'm curious if you could talk more about the strategy and some of the renewals you called out? In the release, it looks like you took a bit good bit of duration in MENA, maybe align the Nordics with Sky. I know some of the Americas and Asian contracts are up in '25. Anything more to add to that conversation or that strategy on media rights would be helpful. \nGregory Maffei: Thanks for the question, Stephen. I think in general, on media rights, we've been very happy with the renewals and interest we've seen. We -- as you noted, some of the good renewals we've had that have been very attractive. We continue to see strong demand. And we continue to see -- as we talked about F1 TV, we continue to see interesting ways in which F1 TV can be an asset working with our media partners.\n The U.S. renewal is obviously out ahead. It's been interesting to watch some of the most recent renewals around either other motor sports or other sports in general in the U.S. And hopefully, those give us some confidence about given where the demand we've seen both among broadcasters and the like and the level of interest in races like I've obviously mentioned already the Miami one, what that will lead to. \nStephen Laszczyk: Got it. And then just on race promotion, have, I think, 10 races up for renewal over the next 2 years. Stefano, you called out the 11 interested cities being serious contenders for GPs this past weekend. Could you add a little bit more context just around the supply-demand dynamic you're seeing right now? And what you think that can mean for things like promotion step-ups, investments in hospitality, fan experience, that would be helpful. \nStefano Domenicali: Well, for sure, what we have seen and what we have seen happening in the course of the last years because of the strong demand of our product. And because of the standard, we are, let's say, asking and worked together with our promoters. We have seen everything going up in terms of quality of demand, of course, economical impact for both the promoter and our side. And the strong demand we are seeing just shows really the strategy well. Now the point is to keep the balance between the different continents that are requesting the different Grand Prix. And of course, what is important is to [Technical difficulty]. \nGregory Maffei: I think we may have lost Stefano or maybe we're off. Operator? \nOperator: The line is still connected. \nGregory Maffei: So just to check, is Stefano on mute or is our line is still connected to the greater audience just checking on the logistics? \nOperator: Correct. It is, yes. \nGregory Maffei: So we'll assume that we'll get Stefano back. Maybe we can move to the next question, and we'll come back and answer and either we'll try it again without Stefano or we'll hopefully get Stefano to answer. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities. \nBarton Crockett: Okay. Great. I guess I wanted to switch gears a little bit and just get Greg, your thoughts on baseball on the Braves and TV and Diamond Sports, now some question about the viability of the emergence with block out of Comcast. What can you tell us about what the Braves could do if Diamond isn't viable? And what are your thoughts longer term about what should happen there with the TV rights situation there for the Braves? \nGregory Maffei: Well, I'll give one cursory comment and then let Derek perhaps if you want to contribute, happy have you take over. I think we have some visibility into the Diamond Holdings, not only from our experience with the Braves, but our experience with Charter. And we watch the situation, obviously, very carefully. We have that benefit, as we've mentioned before, of an enormously attractive territory, and think we have options in the event that they are unable to complete their successful emergence from Chapter 11. But I'll let Derek touch on that a little more if he would like. \nDerek Schiller: Thanks, Greg. Yes, to the first point, obviously, carriage disputes are sort of commonplace, unfortunately, and we don't like the fact that this carriage dispute is going on, we're not a party to it, and we're hoping that Comcast and  Bally get together. To Greg's point, we're obviously monitoring the whole bankruptcy proceedings and doing our part to protect our rights. At this point in time, Diamond Bally is fulfilling their terms with us, including full payment. But if the rights come back to us, we are very optimistic. Because, as Greg noted, we have a very large territory, one of the largest in sports. There's huge demand on the team, and we believe there's more optimism than pessimism with the future of Braves' television rights in that marketplace. \nBarton Crockett: That's great. If I could just follow up. I mean, the precedent at some of the other baseball teams has been if they lose their RSN carriage that they're having to move to a lower revenue model where perhaps they get broader exposure on broadcast, but less revenue. It sounds like you don't think that, that's what the Braves would face if they came to it. Am I hearing you correctly? \nDerek Schiller: Yes, I think you are hearing me correctly, partly because the other situations that we've seen around in particular, baseball, the marketplaces are just vastly different. And their situations, I don't think are necessarily analogous to us. We have about 6 states that are in our territory and about 35 million people in that territory. So one way to look at this is, to the extent that we can unlock the opportunity to offer the Braves content to a wider stretch of that territory to more of those 35 million people, we think that the revenue should follow. And we've been modeling that and feel like we're in a good position should those rights come back to us.\n But again, at this point in time, we're still operating under the terms of the Bally's agreement, and they are as well. So we'll continue that to the extent that, that stays the case. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. \nBryan Kraft: I had one for Greg on Sirius and one on F1 for Stefano if he's back or for Greg. Greg, sorry to ask this question again this quarter, but a lot of people want to know. I know you stated that the Sirius transaction is on track to close in early 3Q. But can you just walk us through the sequence of steps to close and just comment on whether it might -- closing might get pulled into early June. It seems like it could from someone on the outside looking in. And then on F1, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of race promotion contract renewals as far as step-ups on renewals and escalators within the contracts. I think pre-COVID race promotion didn't seem like much of a growth opportunity. But with growth in demand over the past few years and improving promoters economics, wondering if you think that race promotion is now more of a growth opportunity over the medium to long term, even outside of Vegas, which is kind of its own thing. And then separately, can you talk about what you've seen with Las Vegas ticket sales since they went on sale in late March? \nGregory Maffei: Well, I'm going to let Renee walk you through the regulatory steps that we anticipate. And then Stefano, I think you're back on so after we'll let you talk about race promotion. \nRenee Wilm: So with regard to the SIRI closing, we're making very good progress with the SEC as well as on the FCC front. And we are still on target. I think as we mentioned earlier this year that we'd be looking to close sometime during the summer. \nGregory Maffei: Stefano, do you want to touch on the rate promotion? \nStefano Domenicali: Yes. Yes, I would say following to what I was trying to say before, I don't know whether it was captured, but for Brian information, the race promotions, before COVID, everyone was worried about the fact in terms of revenue stream, this could have been a very [ fatal ]. And actually, the fact that we have a lot of demand, of course, is pushing up also the possibility of having or maximizing in the best way that we can at the racing promotion fees. Connected, of course, that this is, of course, a relevant point, but has to be connected to our strategic development in different markets. So everything is progressing very, very well. And I would say, in the next couple of years, I'm expecting to see and we are expecting to announce also some new venues that could be very attractive to grow the business of Formula One. \nGregory Maffei: So if I could just add to that to Stefano's point. I think for a long time, it was perceived that the growth in promotion would come from incremental races. And we obviously went from 18-or-something up to this 24 level, which is where we do not anticipate growing any more races. But as I think we talked about at the Investor Day back in November, it actually creates a great incentive scarcity to be able to play promoters off against each other and not to try and take advantage of them. But just given the amount of demand we have, both among fans to attend and among promoters to host an event, we've been able to find attractive pricing and good uplifts, and we continue to find new venues and new locations, which find it very attractive given the amount of demand we have and given the opportunities they've seen others pursue. So, so far, so good on promotion, and I do think it continues tremendous growth area.\n And we'll go back to Renee and let you touch on Vegas tickets. \nRenee Wilm: Sure, Thanks, Greg. We were very happy with the results of our presale with our partner, American Express. But overall, we are seeing a trend towards ticket purchases closer to the event particularly in the U.S. And I would say even more so in Vegas, which is known as the last-minute market. That being said, we are working very hard on our product ladder this year. We have looked to really differentiate those products creating about 10,000 new GA tickets available, which will be very much, I think, appealing to that last-minute market. We have now 3 different zones at tiered pricing. We will have the T-Mobile Sphere Zone continuing to focus on the news and entertainment as well as the racing phenomenon on the Sphere Zone. We have a new entry-level price point in Flamingo, which will have a viewing structure for fans to watch the racing on Cobalt. And then a third new product offering, which is going to be announced very soon, which will focus on viewing in the heart of the DRS zone along Cobalt Straight.\n This is allowing us to continue to really reach out to those individual consumers and the new F1 fans who want to come and watch really on track, the incredible races we had as well as enjoying the unique Vegas-style entertainment that we'll continue to offer throughout the tracks. \nBryan Kraft: And if I could just follow up on your comments on the SIRI closing. You mentioned very good progress with the SEC. I mean, my understanding is that you had SEC approval already for the proxy, but you have to update basically for the March quarter numbers. So I was just curious as to like what's the timing for updating the filing? And it seemed like that would be sort of a rubber stamp approval from the SEC since they already approved it. And then so you should be able to get to a shareholder vote probably within the next 30 days. I was just looking for a little more color if there's anything that you can share. \nRenee Wilm: Sure. Well, I think we'll be ready to file within the next few weeks now that we've gotten through our quarterly audits. And then I would never say the SEC is going to rubber stamp anything, but we have at least cleared our financial and legal comments, which is great progress. It's hard to say exactly when we'll be ready to close, but I do think we're looking at end of Q2 early Q3 once we get everything in order for the shareholder meeting. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Joyce with Seaport Research Partners. \nDavid Joyce: In thinking about the other factors outside of the pre-team share EBIT calculation, are there any other significant expenses that are either straight line or variable? And sort of related to that, with Quint, just wondering how we would be accounting for that with the Quint F1 related revenue? Is that going to be within Formula One, and therefore, in pre-team share EBIT? And then their other events are going to be outside of that. Just wanted to verify that there would be that split of Quint activities that way. \nGregory Maffei: Bryan, do you want to take this? \nBrian Wendling: Yes. So I'll start with the Quint piece first. Yes. So revenue that Formula One generates from Quint related to those ticket sales do flow through the team payment calculation. So those are included just like they've been beforehand. And then on your first question. \nGregory Maffei: Sorry, just to add there, but you're correct, David, that non-FI related events like Kentucky Durbin and all those flow through F1, but not the F1 team. So just... \nBrian Wendling: That's correct. Sorry. And then on your question about straight-line expenses, team payments is really the largest expense that is straight lined. Other things are more along when they're incurred. So think about hospitality when the event actually happens, same with freight, those types of things. Obviously, there's a bunch of fixed expenses related to payroll and the like that are relatively smooth throughout the year, but team payments would be the largest example of a per race kind of amortization. \nOperator: Our final question is from Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark Company. \nMatthew Harrigan: My last dangling MLP question might be more for Derek. What's your present view on how the change -- rule changes are fostering interest in the game. I think Greg's next great investment might be a surgical clinic doing Tommy John surgery, if you look at what's coming off the pitch clock changes. Just kind of where are we midstream in terms of what's doing for the popularity of the sport? And are there any downside to what's happening? \nGregory Maffei: They're overwhelmingly popular, but I'll let Derek go ahead. No, I'm going to tee you up. Go ahead, please. \nDerek Schiller: Yes. I mean, I think, obviously, the bulk of the rule changes took place last season. So we saw the results of those and have been able to study all of last season as well as the first part of the season. I think the overwhelming viewpoint from fans, media, players, teams is that the rule changes were successful and have been embraced, and we're excited to continue with those. Primarily, the idea that you're creating a game that is a little bit shorter, a little bit more action inside of that game with some of those changes, including the elimination of the shift, things like that. But as we've seen some of the small little changes that have taken place from last year to this year, some a couple of seconds taken off of the pitch clock is one example, I think it's really hard to correlate those changes to some of the things that you might be seeing and whether it be our pitchers or others. I think that the sample size is just too small and we're going to rely a little bit on MLB to do a full study with the Players Association on that. But I think, overall, I would tell you the rule changes have been from our vantage point, fan's vantage point, very successful and have continued to make a great game even better. \nGregory Maffei: Thank you to our listening audience for all of your questions and your interest in Liberty Media and the Atlanta Braves Holdings. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, if not sooner. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Stefano Domenicali",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. The 2024 season is off to a great start with lots of action on the track and the gaps between the teams across the grid getting closer. While Red Bull and Max Verstappen continue to show their strength, we have seen regular [ produce ] from Ferrari, including 1 and 2 in Melbourne, showing their ongoing improvement as well as increasingly strong performance from McLaren including a great first race win by Lando Norris in Miami in front of a sellout crowd.\n The battle in the midfield is the closest it has been for many years, and we look forward to this continuing as the season progresses. We have 24 races this year with 6 Sprints events and are also delighted to have the F1 Academy alongside us at 7 F1 events.\n The return to China after full year break was incredible, and it was great to see a sold-out event, with over 200,000 weekend attendees. Interest in the events underline a growing younger fan base in the country, with all our Chinese fans cheering on their home hero [ Zhou Guanyu ]. Over 1.5 million viewers watched the race live on CCTV-5, far beyond the $1 million when we last visited in 2019. China was also host to our first sprint of the season, won by Max Verstappen and Red Bull with Lewis Hamilton taking second place. The sprint continues to deliver great action for our fans, broadcasters, sponsors and promoters.\n There has been plenty of drivers news of the track at the start of 2024. We have the exciting announcement that Lewis Hamilton will join Ferrari in 2025. Fernando Alonso has committed to remain with Aston Martin. Hulkenberg will go to Sauber in 2025, and we have yet to see where Carlos Sainz will be next year. This continues to create huge excitement and anticipation for our fans with 10 drivers still left to confirm their seat for the next year.\n We have seen records being broken for attendances at our races for the start of 2024 and expect very strong figures throughout the season. Bahrain saw record race day attendance. And in Melbourne, we had a huge crowd of 452,000 beating last year record attendance of 445,000. We also saw good growth in Japan, welcoming 229,000 funds, up 3% on 2023. Alongside this, we continue to see very strong demands for the Paddock Club with over 11,000 tickets sold for the first 4 races of the season where we operate the Paddock Club. We had a sellout in Bahrain and Saudi for the second year running and 2,500 race-day guest in China compared to just 1,100 when we last raced there in 2019. \n F1 continues to grow our overall engagement and fan bases. We are evolving our view data methodology to ensure we are capturing all our audiences globally and are working with Nielsen to build the model that capture a fuller scope. We had over 70 million cumulative TV viewers for the opening Grand Prix weekend in Bahrain, with 12 million in Germany, thanks to extensive free-to-air coverage on RTL. Through the first 3 races, we've seen particularly strong viewership in growth markets such as China and the Middle East. \n We now have 79 million total social media followers, up 24% year-on-year, with new followers growth also boosted by the introduction of new platforms like Threads and WhatsApp. On Instagram, our most popular social platform, 75% of our followers are under 35, 40% are under 25 and 30% of our under-25 followers are female. The U.S. has gained 500,000 new followers in 2024, up to the Chinese Grand Prix, which is up 90% over the follower growth for the same period last year. We also have a year's worth of follower growth in 1 week in the Chinese market surrounding the Chinese Grand Prix.\n In the U.S., we've also seen year-on-year growth across other digital platforms. U.S. F1 TV subscribers are up 16%, page view across f1.com, and up to 28% registered users or those who sign up for an account on F1 platforms are up 32%. Globally, unique digital to F1 com and app are up 4% year-on-year with page viewers up 29% and registered users up 28%. The total number of F1 TV subscribers has seen strong growth, with lower churn rates at all times high customer satisfaction. Season 6 of Drive to Survive premiered February 23. We reached the top 10 on [ letters ] in over 40 markets and continues to have among the highest completion rates or the numbers of people who watch more than 90% of the series on the platform when compared to both unscripted and scripted content.\n Production continues for the Apple [ thin ], which is on pace for the expected release in summer 2025.\n On the commercial side of the business, we had a very strong first quarter. We had growth across all revenue stream, benefiting from 1 additional race held compared to last year as well as growth from new sponsorship and media rights agreement and underlying escalators. We continue to see our business and partners benefiting from growth in overall fandom and the value F1 brings to partners.\n Especially on our sponsorship last week, we announced the world-leading software provider and digital consultant global has joined as an official partner in a new multiyear agreement. Also, in March, we have announced McDonald's as regional partner of Formula One in Latin America. This is the first of its kind for F1 in the region as the sport audience continues to grow in Latin America.\n On media rights, we continue to see strong demand and impressive work by all our broadcasters to bring our support to millions of fans around the world. We recently announced 5 years renewal with the Viaplay in the Netherlands and across the northern markets. The deal retains our partnership structure in the region, creating a strong position for our F1 TV Pro product that will continue to generate substantial additional fee. We also announced a new 2-year agreement with FanCode that sees the sports streaming platform become the exclusive broadcaster partner to Formula One in India until the end of 2025 season. This is a huge opportunity in a market with a growing fan base, especially among younger and female supporter. Our estimate shows that we have 60 million fans in India, with 1 in 2 having started following F1 in the last 4 years.\n F1 TV Pro would also remain in market in India. 2024 results are also benefiting from the new beIN SPORT agreement in the Middle East, which we referenced on our fourth quarter earnings call. We recently announced a subscription free streaming channel FAST, for the fans in the U.S. to watch F1, F2, F3 and F1 academy race replays and highlights, fully rounds of Classic Grand Prix and popular racing documentaries. The new channel will be distributed for FAST to watch on leading platforms, including Samsung TV Plus, Amazon TV and Pluto TV. In addition to generating revenue, we also expect it to push more fans to both ESPN and F1 TV Pro.\n We are confident heading into our U.S. media rights renewal for 2026 with strong growth in our U.S. tandem, sports content remaining highly attractive to the broadcasters and newer players continue to beat for sport rights. In addition to the U.S., key media rights renewal up after 2025 season include Latin America, Brazil, Canada and most of Asia, including Japan. Also on media rights, following its successful first season, F1 Kids will return in 2024. The program is providing to be an effective way to engage children in Formula One in a way that's accessible and fun for them. So I'm delighted it's back for a second season.\n Turning to race promotion. We announced our 2025 race calendar in April for what will be the Formula One 75 anniversary year. We expect to announce details of the 6 2025 Sprint venues in due course. The calendar feature in 24 races and will commence in Australia on 16 March and conclude in Abu Dhabi on 7 December. We will have just 1 Saturday night race in Las Vegas as Saudi and Behrain will return to the traditional Sunday race days. Announcing the calendar earlier than we ever had allowed us to focus on optimizing the schedule for the future years and plan logistics more efficiently for 2025. It also makes our promoter more sustainable partners by giving them greater certainty around planning their races and other events for next year.\n There continues to be huge interest and demand for our races around the world, and our focus is to maintain the right strategic balance of location and opportunities while being clear. We currently believe that '24 race schedule is the optimal number of events.\n Turning to Vegas. We are looking forward to year 2 of the race building on success of last year event. LVGP continues to generate great demand on the sponsorship site, both locally and for the sport more broadly. For example, we could not be more excited about our partnership with American Express and their engaging activation on site across the F1 ecosystem as well as their support for F1 Academy. In March, we enjoyed a successful American Express pre sales to kick off ticket sales for 2024 Vegas race, and we look forward to the continued growth of our partnership.\n We also continue to see progress on off-track action for fans. Our F1 Sim Racing series got underway recently and continues to provide exciting action for fans and all competitors. F1 Arcade recently opened the first of several planned U.S. venues in Boston as the arcade seeks to take advantage of F1 continued momentum in the U.S. Boston is off to a strong start and have the great launch in hosting 672 guests with a ton of media coverage. F1 Arcade London saw a 14% increase in attendance this quarter compared to the same period of last year. And the Birmingham Venue is also performing very, very well.\n F1 exhibition is now moving to other venues around the world, having opened in Vienna in February in Toronto last week, this follows the successful opening residency in Madrid, where it was Spain biggest selling temporary exhibition of 2023.\n Turning to sustainability and diversity and inclusion initiatives. In April, we were pleased to publish our first F1 impact report, providing an update on all the world delivered on our journey to net zero by 2030. We are on track to meet our targets. We achieved a [ 13% ] reduction through increasing our remote operation using renewable energy in factories, offices and events and from reducing the volume of freight.\n We have a strong pipeline of action to deliver the remaining 37% reduction target by 2030. On [DNI], our first group of students from Formula One engineering scholarship took placement with the F1 teams. And by 2025, we'll have founded the studies of 50 students from the unrepresented groups to undertake the studies in mechanical engineering. F1 academy started its second season in Saudi and joined us for their second event in Miami with exciting racing and great driving across the field.\n In Miami, American racer Courtney Crone joined the grid as the wildcard entry in a deal with reigning team championship PREMA racing and the QVC. The F1 Academy series will be shown live in over 160 international territories will be on F1 TV Pro and streamed live on F1 Academy's social channels. We have also been delighted to announce Charlotte Tilbury, Puma, Tommy Hilfiger and American Express as official partner of the series. We have also launched the F1 Academy Discover Your Drive aimed at [indiscernible] young female karters the opportunity to get into grass-roots level of our sport. Its first initiative was launched by MotoSport U.K. to identify and nurture U.K. karting talent from the age of 8. The number of female participate in age 11, 16 qualified for the British Indoor Karting Championship has more than tripled, and engaging programs will run alongside the all 7 F1 academy events in 2024.\n We are proud of this work and remain very focused on making the sport more open, diverse and sustainable place. 2024 will continue to be an exciting time for our sport, and I'm looking forward to the on-track action and opportunities we have as a business as we continue to go from strength to strength.\n Avanti tutta! \"Full speed ahead\". And now I will turn the call back over to Greg. Bye-bye. [Foreign Language] Yes. Thank you, Greg. I would say, Vijay, just to talk about our sponsorship pipeline. I would say the situation is very positive because I think that if you just look back just a couple of years ago, we had the only 4 global sponsors. Now we have 10 global sponsors, a lot of regional partnership, and the pipeline is very strong. And I would say, as you know, we are not giving here any kind of expectation but the situation is very solid. And today, it's not only a problem of quantity of sponsorship is really related to the quality, and we need to ensure that everyone is investing in Formula One has the right quality in terms of exposure, in terms of experience, in terms of what we can offer. So I would say that's really a very, very positive trend that we will see together with our partners who believes in Formula One. Yes, Greg, if it's fine for you. Absolutely. I would say, first of all, F1 TV, as [indiscernible] said, is an additional entertainment fab for our fans and offer to fans that some of them are very, very expert. They can analyze all the data we're putting on the screen. And the good thing is that the numbers that we have seen so far are very encouraging because actually, even in Miami, there has been almost a record subscribers that we see. So it's a very, very important element that is related to the future of the media evolution that we want to offer to our customers.\n We didn't receive any negative comment on price increase. You may say maybe because it was too low before, that would be a good point, but so far, no one has said anything. And I would say for us, it's really relevant to keep up in terms of quality of the product, in terms of content of the product, and this is something that we'll develop even further with the artificial intelligence that will be -- that will play a very important part of our development with our future. On my side, Ben, with regard to the update on [ Coke ] agreement. As we always said, the situation, as you know, very well, this will expire on 2025. Now we are in the process of discussion with the teams. The most important point is to keep the situation as stable as possible. These are the points of discussion. And as you can imagine, we cannot go into details of it, but as soon as we can, we will share what we can do. \n As I said, the situation is optimal to keep discussing with the teams with all the relevant parts is the best way to finalize everything for a stronger future up to a longer term. Well, for sure, what we have seen and what we have seen happening in the course of the last years because of the strong demand of our product. And because of the standard, we are, let's say, asking and worked together with our promoters. We have seen everything going up in terms of quality of demand, of course, economical impact for both the promoter and our side. And the strong demand we are seeing just shows really the strategy well. Now the point is to keep the balance between the different continents that are requesting the different Grand Prix. And of course, what is important is to [Technical difficulty]. Yes. Yes, I would say following to what I was trying to say before, I don't know whether it was captured, but for Brian information, the race promotions, before COVID, everyone was worried about the fact in terms of revenue stream, this could have been a very [ fatal ]. And actually, the fact that we have a lot of demand, of course, is pushing up also the possibility of having or maximizing in the best way that we can at the racing promotion fees. Connected, of course, that this is, of course, a relevant point, but has to be connected to our strategic development in different markets. So everything is progressing very, very well. And I would say, in the next couple of years, I'm expecting to see and we are expecting to announce also some new venues that could be very attractive to grow the business of Formula One."

            "name": "Gregory Maffei",
            "content": "Thank you, Clare, and good morning to all. Today, speaking on the call, we will also have Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali, Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling. Also during Q&A, we will answer questions related to Atlanta Braves Holdings and Braves' management will be available as well. So beginning with Liberty SiriusXM, the LSXM SIRI transaction is progressing well. The regulatory process is on track, and we still expect a close by the -- early in the third quarter. Turning to SiriusXM itself, had a solid first quarter performance, revenue up 1%, EBITDA up 4%. They are continuing to benefit from cost optimization across the org. They expect to pay net adds, improvements in the second half and in fiscal '24 versus '23.\n They did, also on their call, reiterate the 2024 guidance. They are maintaining margins while investing to support future growth.\n Management is focused on a couple of key strategic initiatives, and we've seen some still early, but promising metrics on the new app. We continue to move engagement for lower listening cohorts to higher listening levels, and we've been able to adapt to consumer feedback more quickly utilizing this application.\n SIRI exclusive content continues to attract new customers. James Corden, series recently -- which was recently initiated, quickly moved into the top 3 talk shows. Notably, we're also progressing with the rollout of 360L. There was an expanded Hyundai Genesis partnership, which will integrate 360L, and adoption of 360L leads to better consumer trends, including higher conversion.\n Now turning to Formula One Group. We were thrilled to announce in April the acquisition of MotoGP. I want to reiterate the attractive qualities of this asset, a global league-level sport with incredible racing. For example, across the first 4 races, we've had 10 riders across 7 teams reach the podium and the average time to decide the race winner has been about a second. Monday, the new technical regulations for the sport were announced for the 2027 time frame. They expect even closer racing and more overtaking utilizing these new technical rigs.\n Attendance at the races is performing very well, for example, the Portuguese GP at Portimao is up 41% versus the prior year. And the Spanish GP at [indiscernible] had the highest attendance since 2015. The sport is awesome, and Liberty has experienced to help them hopefully grow the exposure across the world.\n A couple of deal updates here. We're also progressing on required regulatory filings. We have syndicated the financing commitments and hedged our foreign exchange exposure, and we still expect to close by year-end.\n Turning now to F1. We've had successful races in several key growth markets. We returned to China for the first time since 2019, and the first time with a Chinese driver. It was a sold-out race and live viewership on CCTV was up 50% versus 2019. Miami was an exciting and very competitive race. I want to congratulate Lando on winning his first GP after 15 podiums. And McLaren upgrades are working well and we expect more competitive racing from that going forward. \n We continue to see growth in the U.S. engagement. Miami was sold out with a new attendance record of 275,000. F1 achieved its largest live U.S. TV audience at 3.1 million, with a peak of 3.6 million. We also had our largest audience for a Sprint race since the format was introduced in 2021. We also hosted the second F1 Academy event of the season in Miami. We are excited that we are contributed to in promoting continued momentum in women's sports. We are attracting more diverse audiences that are exciting and relevant to all. At F1 Academy, Instagram followers are 55% female, but also 45% male. Everyone watches women's sports.\n We recently announced new docuseries with Netflix and Reese Witherspoon's Production Company, Hello Sunshine, about F1 Academy, and we look forward to seeing the series growth.\n Turning now to LVGP, a few updates. We redefined the product ladder to reach a greater range of fan base. We are now integrating the commercial and marketing functions across F1, LVGP and [indiscernible] more closely to achieve better harmony and cost savings. We think this will allow us to have aligned sponsorship and sales efforts across the org, and as I mentioned, it will be more cost effective.\n We kicked off the events business at Grand Prix Plaza in Las Vegas, hosting some exciting brands, including a Super Bowl media party, Autodesk, CrowdStrike and our own QVC's Age of Possibility. Now touching briefly on Quint. We closed the acquisition in early January. Some of the first quarter highlights were the 2024 All-Star game, which was NBA Experience's largest event ever for ticket packages and revenue, and F1 Experiences saw solid demand across the first 3 races of F1, including a [indiscernible] across all products in Australia. We do believe there is strategic value in having Quint and F1 under the same roof. The data sharing across companies allows us to know the fan better and improve our touch points and leveraging Quint sales and marketing will create efficiencies and leverage the sales process, including at LGVP, as I mentioned.\n I want to reiterate, we expect Quint to be adjusted OIBDA accretive to F1.\n Turning on -- touching on Live Nation briefly. Global fan demand continues to surge. First quarter revenue was up 21% and AOI was up 15%. They had a record first quarter for sponsorship, also up 24%. Indicators will point to another record year. Over 85% of the large shows were booked versus 75% at this time in the prior year, and concert ticket sales for arena and amphitheaters are pacing up double-digit levels. We also see continued success in international markets and in the Venue Nation strategy. Ticket sales for the Latin packs were up double digits in the U.S. And at venues, we're opening at least 12 major global venues in the 2024 time frame, and we have capacity for 8 million additional fans, and we think we can enhance the consumer experience and generate strong returns.\n Finally, touching on the Braves, off to another great start to the season despite early injuries in a tough Dodger series last weekend, a great win last night in the ninth inning as usual with us. Strong demand continues. We've seen multiple sellouts already this season. We're trending #4 in average attendance per game across MLB, and we have sold 93% of our ticket capacity season to date.\n We've completed the renovations at Truist Park ahead of the season. There's a new Lexus level premium boxes. There's an expanded retail store capacity. We have the Jim Beam Bourbon Decks with bars replicating the length between the pitcher's mound plate. And these upgrades are already generating incremental revenue this season.\n We announced several new sponsors this season early, including Ball Corp and Lexus, and we are creating more inventory around the ballpark, including LED signage, and we are leveraging the demand for renewals on our existing partnerships. The Braves are positioned for another great year on and off the field.\n So with that, I'll turn it over to you, Brian, for more on our financial results. Thanks, Stefano and Brian. And to the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and the Atlanta Braves Holdings. And now operator, I'd like to open the line for questions. Stefano, do you want to touch on sponsorship? If I could just add, I agree with everything Stefano said. I feel very good about where we are recognizing sponsorship revenue for the balance of this year and into 2025, and are working hard at building that pipeline for '26 and beyond. Hold on, app and economic growth. Okay. So look, I think on the discussion around Live Nation and the trust issues, the management team led by Joe summarized it well on their call last Thursday. The DOJ investigation appears focused on specific business practices within divisions of the company, not the merger or the business structure. Live doesn't believe the breakup of Live Nation Ticketmaster would be legally defensible remedy. And beyond that, we're kind of limited to what was said on that live earnings call if you listen to that.\n Turning to SIRI. Look, I think it's early days. We certainly would hope during the balance of this year to see a positive impact and greater learnings from the new app. The way the app is being rolled because of the app as a platform, you'll see us continue to roll out, at SIRI, new modules and new opportunities, which will help us get benefit. So I think you'll see some learnings early and hopefully more growing over time. But the exact timing of those and how the consumer -- both how we release them and how the consumer takes them up are still open to question.\n On economic growth, I do believe that we can start driving. We'll see better numbers in '24 versus '23 on SP&A. And I do think, over time, this app will be critical to helping us grow and getting back to a growth path at Sirius. Do you want to start [indiscernible]. Great. Thank you, Stefano. And I'll touch briefly on the Quint business drivers and let Brian, as you now, to touch on some seasonality, which I expect his comments will be fairly limited, but I don't want to cut him down. Look, on the drivers of the business, I think there are several. One is, and we mentioned -- I mentioned one already. The opportunity to help us be a better sales arm and be more effective for Formula One itself, particularly around LVGP. And you've seen us do more integration of that sales arm and utilize their customer knowledge, their customer strengths, the things that they do well to help us sell better, particularly at the high end at LVGP.\n Another driver of the business, though, is their ability to help other F1 promoters and elements sell their products. So they work with both teams and promoters, for example, Qatar to help sell tickets to their events, not just our event and to help sell out the things that they do and do ancillary services and ancillary events around the GPs.\n Third driver is obviously adding new sports and new events. And you've seen them grow that and expect that they will continue to do that over time. And hopefully, that's a place where Liberty may be able to help them open the door to new sports. Thanks, Ben. So on MotoGP, when we -- after the announcement, we had an outpouring of interest from both potential broadcast partners, OEMs, potential sites, all of which are very interesting.\n Unfortunately, due to the nature of the regulatory process, we will be formulating those amongst ourselves and our plans, but we really can't reach out and do anything concrete with the MotoGP management team to avoid gun jumping until we have regulatory approval. So we are conjuring plans. We have some really good ideas, I think, I hope, and we hope to get permission to execute on those sooner rather than later. Thanks for the question, Stephen. I think in general, on media rights, we've been very happy with the renewals and interest we've seen. We -- as you noted, some of the good renewals we've had that have been very attractive. We continue to see strong demand. And we continue to see -- as we talked about F1 TV, we continue to see interesting ways in which F1 TV can be an asset working with our media partners.\n The U.S. renewal is obviously out ahead. It's been interesting to watch some of the most recent renewals around either other motor sports or other sports in general in the U.S. And hopefully, those give us some confidence about given where the demand we've seen both among broadcasters and the like and the level of interest in races like I've obviously mentioned already the Miami one, what that will lead to. I think we may have lost Stefano or maybe we're off. Operator? So just to check, is Stefano on mute or is our line is still connected to the greater audience just checking on the logistics? So we'll assume that we'll get Stefano back. Maybe we can move to the next question, and we'll come back and answer and either we'll try it again without Stefano or we'll hopefully get Stefano to answer. Well, I'll give one cursory comment and then let Derek perhaps if you want to contribute, happy have you take over. I think we have some visibility into the Diamond Holdings, not only from our experience with the Braves, but our experience with Charter. And we watch the situation, obviously, very carefully. We have that benefit, as we've mentioned before, of an enormously attractive territory, and think we have options in the event that they are unable to complete their successful emergence from Chapter 11. But I'll let Derek touch on that a little more if he would like. Well, I'm going to let Renee walk you through the regulatory steps that we anticipate. And then Stefano, I think you're back on so after we'll let you talk about race promotion. Stefano, do you want to touch on the rate promotion? So if I could just add to that to Stefano's point. I think for a long time, it was perceived that the growth in promotion would come from incremental races. And we obviously went from 18-or-something up to this 24 level, which is where we do not anticipate growing any more races. But as I think we talked about at the Investor Day back in November, it actually creates a great incentive scarcity to be able to play promoters off against each other and not to try and take advantage of them. But just given the amount of demand we have, both among fans to attend and among promoters to host an event, we've been able to find attractive pricing and good uplifts, and we continue to find new venues and new locations, which find it very attractive given the amount of demand we have and given the opportunities they've seen others pursue. So, so far, so good on promotion, and I do think it continues tremendous growth area.\n And we'll go back to Renee and let you touch on Vegas tickets. Bryan, do you want to take this? Sorry, just to add there, but you're correct, David, that non-FI related events like Kentucky Durbin and all those flow through F1, but not the F1 team. So just... They're overwhelmingly popular, but I'll let Derek go ahead. No, I'm going to tee you up. Go ahead, please. Thank you to our listening audience for all of your questions and your interest in Liberty Media and the Atlanta Braves Holdings. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, if not sooner."

            "name": "Brian Wendling",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning. At quarter end, Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $64 million, excluding $71 million of cash held at SiriusXM. During the quarter, Liberty SiriusXM paid down $65 million under the SiriusXM margin loan using cash on hand. There's $1.1 billion of undrawn margin loan capacity related to our SiriusXM margin loan as of quarter end.\n As of May 7, the value of our SiriusXM stock was $10 billion, and we have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings.\n Total Liberty SiriusXM Group attributed principal amount of debt is $11.1 billion, which includes $9.3 billion of debt at SiriusXM.\n Turning to the Formula One Group. At quarter end, Formula One Group had attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $1.3 billion, which includes $1 billion of cash at Formula one. Quint acquisition closed in January and was funded with $205 million of Formula One Group cash on hand, net of the Quint cash that was acquired. Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $2.9 billion, which includes $2.4 billion of debt at Formula One, leaving $531 million at the corporate level.\n F1's $500 million revolver is undrawn and their leverage at quarter end was 1.7x. Looking at the F1 operating business. As we've reiterated multiple times, it is best analyzed on an annual basis giving variability in the year-over-year [indiscernible] calendar. With that said, however, I will make some brief remarks on the first quarter. There were 3 races held in the first quarter compared to 2 races in the prior year period. F1 recognized an additional race promotion fee this year as well as a higher proportion of season-based income due to 3 out of 24 races occurring during Q1 '24 compared to 2 out of 23 in the prior year, which was ahead of the Imola race cancellation in Q2 '23.\n Other revenue increased due to the start of the F2 vehicle cycle, which is largely offset within other cost of F1 revenue as well as higher hospitality revenue and freight income. F1 also recognized revenue and costs related to the F1 Academy due to the earlier start of the season compared to last year.\n Adjusted OIBDA grew alongside revenue in the quarter. Team payments were higher due to the higher pro rata recognition as well as the expectation of increased team payments for the full year. A reminder that team payments should be analyzed on a full year basis. The revenue recognized based on the mix of flyaway and European races impacts how team payments appear as a percentage of pre-team share EBIT when looking on a quarterly basis. As F1 has grown EBIT over the past several years, the percentage payout has shifted, with F1 recognizing a greater proportion of the economic upside as pre-team share EBIT has reached certain thresholds.\n We expect to continue to realize leverage on the team payment -- team payout going forward. To note that the incremental payout percentage on pre-team shared EBIT growth recognized in 2023 should not be applied to future growth. Other costs of F1 revenue and SG&A continue to be best viewed as a percent of total revenue for the year.\n Looking at corporate and other results, which as of this quarter includes the consolidation of Quint, corporate and other revenue includes Quint results and approximately $7 million of rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza. Corporate and other adjusted OIBDA was a loss of $6 million in the quarter. This includes the rental income, Quint results and other corporate overhead. Note at the start of the year seasonally live for Quint with modest event activity, while the business still incurs ordinary course fixed operating expenses, which largest and most profitable events take place in the second quarter and fourth quarter with the Kentucky Derby in May and larger and more frequent -- or an increased quantity of F1 hospitality events held in the fourth quarter. We expect corporate and other adjusted OIBDA will benefit from rental income and Quint results through the rest of the year.  \n At the Liberty Live Group, there's attributed cash, liquid investments and monetizable public holdings of $423 million, which includes ETF assets. There's a $400 million -- or there's $400 million of undrawn margin loan capacity related to our Live Nation margin loan. And as of May 7, the value of our Live Nation stock held at Liberty Live Group was $6.7 billion. We have $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Liberty and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end.\n And I will turn quickly with that to AVH. There were no regular season home games played in either the first quarter of '23 or -- '24 or '23. Revenue growth primarily reflects higher broadcasting with more away games in the current year held due to the earlier start of the regular season as well as higher game day related revenue from increased demand and attendance at spring training home games.\n Braves continue to invest in payroll, which is reflected in increased baseball operating costs, and the Battery grew revenue 13% and adjusted OIBDA 9% in the quarter.\n CapEx related to the capital improvement projects completed at Truist Park ahead of the '24 season will total approximately $15 million across Q4 of '23 and early '24. These projects are generating incremental revenue, as Greg said, for the Braves already. And at the Battery, the Triust headquarter remains -- headquarters project remains on budget and on schedule. With that, I'll turn it over to Stefano to discuss Formula One. Yes, Vijay, this is Brian. I'll take the team payment one. We'll try to give you the most information we can here without giving you the full model. But over the past few years, as F1 has grown pre-team share EBITDA and EBIT under the current Concorde Agreement, we've moved through various brand -- bands of pre-team share EBITDA, where the payout to the teams has decreased as a percentage for each band. We're now at a point where the percentage to the teams is fixed for incremental EBITDA and EBIT through the end of this current Concorde Agreement. We do expect to continue to have leverage in the team payments as a percent of pre-team share EBIT this year or adjusted OIBDA on our reported results, but not at that incremental rate that you noted that we saw from '22 to '23. David, on seasonality, we can't give you the very specific details, but what I'll say is that Q1 is probably the lowest quarter for Quint, followed by Q3. Q\t2 and Q4 really ramp up because you have the Kentucky Derby and you have a lot more of the larger F1 events that Quint participates in. So you'll see that Q2 and Q4 definitely vary materially from what you see in Q1. Yes. So I'll start with the Quint piece first. Yes. So revenue that Formula One generates from Quint related to those ticket sales do flow through the team payment calculation. So those are included just like they've been beforehand. And then on your first question. That's correct. Sorry. And then on your question about straight-line expenses, team payments is really the largest expense that is straight lined. Other things are more along when they're incurred. So think about hospitality when the event actually happens, same with freight, those types of things. Obviously, there's a bunch of fixed expenses related to payroll and the like that are relatively smooth throughout the year, but team payments would be the largest example of a per race kind of amortization."

            "name": "Renee Wilm",
            "content": "So with regard to the SIRI closing, we're making very good progress with the SEC as well as on the FCC front. And we are still on target. I think as we mentioned earlier this year that we'd be looking to close sometime during the summer. Sure, Thanks, Greg. We were very happy with the results of our presale with our partner, American Express. But overall, we are seeing a trend towards ticket purchases closer to the event particularly in the U.S. And I would say even more so in Vegas, which is known as the last-minute market. That being said, we are working very hard on our product ladder this year. We have looked to really differentiate those products creating about 10,000 new GA tickets available, which will be very much, I think, appealing to that last-minute market. We have now 3 different zones at tiered pricing. We will have the T-Mobile Sphere Zone continuing to focus on the news and entertainment as well as the racing phenomenon on the Sphere Zone. We have a new entry-level price point in Flamingo, which will have a viewing structure for fans to watch the racing on Cobalt. And then a third new product offering, which is going to be announced very soon, which will focus on viewing in the heart of the DRS zone along Cobalt Straight.\n This is allowing us to continue to really reach out to those individual consumers and the new F1 fans who want to come and watch really on track, the incredible races we had as well as enjoying the unique Vegas-style entertainment that we'll continue to offer throughout the tracks. Sure. Well, I think we'll be ready to file within the next few weeks now that we've gotten through our quarterly audits. And then I would never say the SEC is going to rubber stamp anything, but we have at least cleared our financial and legal comments, which is great progress. It's hard to say exactly when we'll be ready to close, but I do think we're looking at end of Q2 early Q3 once we get everything in order for the shareholder meeting."

            "name": "Derek Schiller",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Yes, to the first point, obviously, carriage disputes are sort of commonplace, unfortunately, and we don't like the fact that this carriage dispute is going on, we're not a party to it, and we're hoping that Comcast and  Bally get together. To Greg's point, we're obviously monitoring the whole bankruptcy proceedings and doing our part to protect our rights. At this point in time, Diamond Bally is fulfilling their terms with us, including full payment. But if the rights come back to us, we are very optimistic. Because, as Greg noted, we have a very large territory, one of the largest in sports. There's huge demand on the team, and we believe there's more optimism than pessimism with the future of Braves' television rights in that marketplace. Yes, I think you are hearing me correctly, partly because the other situations that we've seen around in particular, baseball, the marketplaces are just vastly different. And their situations, I don't think are necessarily analogous to us. We have about 6 states that are in our territory and about 35 million people in that territory. So one way to look at this is, to the extent that we can unlock the opportunity to offer the Braves content to a wider stretch of that territory to more of those 35 million people, we think that the revenue should follow. And we've been modeling that and feel like we're in a good position should those rights come back to us.\n But again, at this point in time, we're still operating under the terms of the Bally's agreement, and they are as well. So we'll continue that to the extent that, that stays the case. Yes. I mean, I think, obviously, the bulk of the rule changes took place last season. So we saw the results of those and have been able to study all of last season as well as the first part of the season. I think the overwhelming viewpoint from fans, media, players, teams is that the rule changes were successful and have been embraced, and we're excited to continue with those. Primarily, the idea that you're creating a game that is a little bit shorter, a little bit more action inside of that game with some of those changes, including the elimination of the shift, things like that. But as we've seen some of the small little changes that have taken place from last year to this year, some a couple of seconds taken off of the pitch clock is one example, I think it's really hard to correlate those changes to some of the things that you might be seeing and whether it be our pitchers or others. I think that the sample size is just too small and we're going to rely a little bit on MLB to do a full study with the Players Association on that. But I think, overall, I would tell you the rule changes have been from our vantage point, fan's vantage point, very successful and have continued to make a great game even better."
