At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies' Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Giannakouros, Carlisle\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Jim, go ahead.\nJim Giannakouros: Thank you, Annie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Carlisle\u2019s fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We released our fourth quarter financial results after the market closed today. And you can find both our press release and earnings call slide presentation on our website at www.carlisle.com in the Investor Relations section. On the call with me today are Chris Koch, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Roche, our Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call will begin with Chris discussing business trends experienced during the fourth quarter of 2020, views of what's to come in 2021, and context around our continued confidence in achieving Vision 2025. Bob will discuss Carlisle\u2019s fourth quarter performance and current financial position. Following Chris and Bob\u2019s remarks, we will open up the line for questions. Before we begin, please refer to slide two of our presentation, where we note that comments made on this call may include forward-looking based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainty which would cause actual results to be materially different. A discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties are provided in our press release and in our SEC filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Those considering investing in Carlisle should read these statements carefully and review reports we file with the SEC before making an investment decision. With that, I will turn over the call to Chris.\nChris Koch: Thanks Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Entering what is now the second year of operating in this COVID-19 pandemic, I hope everyone is healthy and staying safe. Like to open by saying how proud I am of the global Carlisle team for their perseverance and ability to execute in these uncertain times. Our COVID statistics reflect the strong compliance to the CDC guidelines and safety measures all Carlisle employees have followed in 2020. We suffered 470 infections, 15 hospitalizations, and sadly three deaths. We continue to do our part to combat the spread of the virus. In combination with further progress on the vaccination rollout, we anticipate that we will continue to show our safety measures are working because at Carlisle, maintaining health and safety is always our first priority. Vision 2025 provided clear direction and consistency of mission during a tumultuous 2020 and will continue to guide our efforts as we accelerate into the recovery. As we pass the mid-year mark and entered the third quarter, we continue to build on the momentum started in late Q2 when our employees, customers, and supply chain partners increasingly were able to work safely and efficiently and begin to get back to contributing to economic growth. As the global community returned to work, strong underlying deferred demand became more evident, especially in our building products business. While we expect this momentum to continue as vaccines help decrease risks, the construction industry is still contending with uneven regional disruptions due to COVID restrictions, severe weather in certain areas, and tight labor dynamics, which is resulting in deferred demand continuing to build the backlog of work. Turning to slide four, 2020 demonstrated yet again the exceptional and sustainable earnings power of the Carlisle business model. Over the past several decades, Carlisle has been categorized as a diversified industrial company and rightly so, as evidenced by our portfolio contact -- our content, multiple acquisitions in a variety of segments ranging from fluid handling to medical technologies, and our legacy strategic goals. However, since CCM introduced the first Single-Ply EPDM Roofing membranes to the market in the early 1960s, Carlisle's growth and earnings have increasingly been powered by our construction materials business. With over a half century of outstanding performance, CCM's influence on our overall performance has consistently expanded despite our diversification efforts, peaking in 2021 when it accounted for over 70% of revenues and over 90% of earnings. In the past three years, CCM has accelerated their world-class performance leveraging consistent organic growth focused on providing the ultimate customer service, the Carlisle Experience and instituting greater price discipline, developing sophisticated sourcing and purchasing capabilities, and maintaining a continuous improvement culture, all aiming to drive increased profitability and shareholder value. In 2017, when we first contemplate a Vision 2025, we turned a critical eye to our capital deployment efforts and started a pivot to a more disciplined ROI focus. It was that critical assessment and objective view of value creation that drove our focus under Vision 2025 to apply a greater investment spotlight onto CCM. A consistent 30% plus returns business CCM's performance warranted and earned the right to share the majority of investment dollars that were allocated to portfolio diversification, at that time, a key strategy of Carlisle's legacy approach to building out higher growth and presumably higher margin platforms as a path to sustainable value creation. With the official rollout of Vision 2025 in February of 2018, our evolution was actualized evidenced by our recent extensive M&A capital investments at CCM. As shown on slide five, CCM has continued to evolve from its roots in the early 1960s of a simple Single-Ply Roofing membrane division to today, where we deliver innovative, easy to install and energy-efficient solutions throughout -- through the Carlisle experience for customers who are creating the sustainable building of the future. With our extensive line of building envelope product, CCM offers a complete set of solutions and systems to aid in the design of efficient building envelope construction projects, backed by industry leading warranties and a focus on green principles. On slide six, you can see how this building envelope concept can deliver substantial energy savings for building owners. CCM products provide a substantial offset to the estimated 40% of greenhouse gases globally generated from the construction and maintenance of buildings. And our teams are focused on continuing to support the growing efforts in global energy efficiency It's because of this history of innovation, investment, and continuous improvement that we have more conviction than ever the CCM's future success is secure. We believe the extensive planning of Vision 2025 identified the strengths of CCM's core markets, demonstrated the consistent reroofing revenue stream, and elevated the power of CCM sustainable business model. 2020 only serve to crystallize our confidence. Turning to slide seven, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking in more detail about CCM's future and what drives our confidence in the CCM business model. First, as you've heard us speak about it like CCM's core business is predominantly driven by replacement roofing demand. Non-residential buildings built 10 to 20 years ago make up over 25% of current infrastructure and those roofs will need replacing in the next decade. As a reminder, roof replacements are not discretionary. Aided by the Carlisle experience and our market position, CCM should continue to capture placement of installed roofing systems and grow share with new energy efficient, labor reducing, and cost effective productive solutions in the $6 billion and growing market. While the majority of our core CCM business revenue comes from reroofing. Past construction cycles evidence residential construction as a strong leading indicator of new commercial construction, which augments core CCM growth. Growing residential construction demand which accelerated in 2020 coinciding with urban relocation due to COVID, will require increased commercial infrastructure including big box retailers, hospitals, warehouses, and educational buildings to support a growing population of suburban families and workers. Second, as shown in slide eight, the recent addition of our polyurethane platform to CCM included spray foam insulation, which is a sustainable high single-digit growth market. Our top performing formulations provide unmatched energy efficiency in both residential and non-residential applications. Driven by our industry-first concept of a combined material and equipment solution, which we call IntelliSpray, it was developed and introduced with engineering support from Carlisle fluid technologies. Carlisle CCM is uniquely positioned to grow at above market levels in spray polyurethane foam insulation. This innovative new system will allow us to provide the contractor, builder, and homeowner with greater application efficiency and control, savings from application efficiency improvements, and ultimately, a better foam insulation product. Third, like polyurethane, architectural metals is an exciting new platform for CCM. This billion dollar market growing at approximately two times GDP provides an attractive opportunity to diversify into the sloped roof market with a highly sustainable product. Our metals platform is seeing healthy organic growth, as it offers a lasting high ROI system solution to building owners, generating solid pull-through sales of CCM insulation and underlayment products. To support our regional growth strategy, we're expanding our metals footprint in 2021 by opening three new locations in the U.S. Metal roofing systems also complement our drive to deliver solutions to support the construction of an efficient building envelope. Metal roofs are 100% recyclable, increase energy efficiency of building up to 20% versus traditional materials, and reduce waste in the manufacturing process. Fourth, we're committed to accelerating growth in Europe, a $10 billion -- \u20ac10 billion addressable market. To drive this growth, we recently changed leadership in the region and announced the investment of over $25 million to expand capacity in our German manufacturing facility. Increasing demand and regulations for improved thermal performance along with integrated roofing systems are driving a shift to single-ply membranes in Europe. CCM's leading environmental and energy efficient solutions lend themselves well to trends in the European market. Recent industry dynamics reinforce our belief that increasing our focus on our building products platform is the right strategy. The new ownership of a recently acquired competitor and an announced management edition at another competitor shows the widespread belief of the strong prospects for the non-residential building products space. The industry dynamics also support our strategy to accelerate growth in Europe. And finally, as was widely discussed after the recent acquisition, our increased focus on delivering the Carlisle experience for the sustainable building of the future is in line with macro industry trends. Before moving to our three other businesses, I want to reiterate how remarkable our CCM business performed in 2020. CCM was largely the story for Carlisle in 2020 and we expect that to continue into 2021 and beyond. Regarding our other three businesses on slide nine, 2020 was obviously a difficult years due to the pandemic. In the face of significant declines, the teams did a commendable job managing through the crisis, taking actions to reduce costs, and position their businesses for the future including leveraging COS, investing in new product development, and right-sizing footprints. While the results did not meet our expectations, these remain good -- very good businesses with solid management teams committed to weathering the current macroeconomic challenges. We are optimistic that the actions taken in 2020 to improve CIT, CFT, and CBF will position these businesses for a solid recovery, especially in 2021 for CFT and CBF where markets have signaled the bottom. And while we believe CIT will recover over a longer timeline, we are confident that there will be a recovery. With higher inoculation rates for rapid vaccine rollouts, easing of COVID travel restrictions, and an improved outlook for both aerospace and hospital capital spending, CIT will drive exceptional leverage with a resumption of growth. Before Bob gives the financial details of the quarter, I'd like to touch on a few other notable achievements of 2020. Please turn to slide 10. We've generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow over the last six years and recently accelerating significantly, with almost half that was generated in 2019 and 2020. This track record of success supports our confidence in this team's ability to execute on our capital allocation strategy and to create value. While 2020 was a subdued year for M&A, we are managing an active pipeline for accretive and synergistic acquisitions to rapidly scale our high returning businesses. As always, our financial strength and cash flow generating capabilities afford us flexibility and we intend to remain opportunistic. Notably, and as we've discussed in the past, when acquisition activity is subdued, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. This is evidenced by our deployment of more than $380 million in share repurchases in 2020, totaling approximately $1.5 billion in share repurchases since 2017. And at our latest Board meeting, our Board approved an incremental 5 million share repurchase authorization for Carlisle. We also returned over $112 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in 2020, raising our dividend in August for the 44th consecutive year. Finally, we spent $96 million of CapEx in 2020 and have plans to significantly increase that in 2021. On slide 11, we touch on our continued unexpanded actions around ESG where Carlisle remains steadfast in our commitment. Supported by CLS, we are continually examining ways to improve the design and manufacture of our products, seeking to better engage our employees and communities, and improve an already strong regulatory framework. In 2020, we also made progress in diversity and inclusion exiting 2020 with 50% of our Board of Director's identifying as gender, racially, or ethnically diverse, and meeting our 2020 target for percent of females and senior leadership positions. As we've stated many times before, ESG is part of Carlisle's culture of continuous improvement and we look forward to sharing more progress with you in the future. I would also encourage you to read more about Carlisle's ESG efforts on the sustainability pages of our website. Please turn to slide 12, where we cover the Carlisle operating system. In 2020, CLS delivered savings of 1.3% of sales, while within our vision 2025 annual target of 1% to 2%, a remarkable feat considering 2020's challenging conditions and proving the Carlisle employees truly embody and live our continuous improvement culture every day. Another major milestone in 2020 was the launch of the Path to Zero, which represents our commitment to creating the safest possible work environment, and features the goal of zero accidents and zero injuries. COS will continue to be a unifying cultural imperative for our businesses to rely on as they seek new opportunities to make our operations and business processes more efficient. Bob will now provide operational and financial details about our fourth quarter and review our balance sheet and cash flow. Bob?\nBob Roche: Thank you, Chris. Please turn to the revenue bridge on slide 13 of the presentation. Revenue decreased 7% to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, organic revenue declined 9%, acquisitions contributed 1.4% of sales growth for the quarter, and FX was a 60 basis point tailwind. Turning to our margin bridge on slide 14. Q4 operating margin declined 180 basis points. Pricing and volume headwinds combined for 320 basis point declined and acquisitions were 40 basis point tailwind. Offsetting these declines freight, labor, raw material, other operating costs netted to a 60 basis point improvement. COS benefits added 120 basis points. On slide 15, we have provided an EPS bridge, where you can see the fourth quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.57, which compares to $1.81 last year. Volume, price, and mix combined were a 74% year-over-year decrease, partially offsetting, interest and tax contributed $0.09 and raw material, freight, and labor costs netted to a $0.16 benefit. Share repurchases contributed nine $0.09. OLS contributed $0.19, and finally, operating expenses were $0.03 headwind. While COVID-related volume declines clearly represented the most significant headwind during the quarter, our teams around the world did a commendable job managing costs, leveraging COS to improve efficiencies, and taking actions to both position Carlisle for the recovery while mitigating the pandemic impact on earnings. Now, let's turn to slide 16 to review the fourth quarter performance by segment in more detail. At CCM, the team again delivered outstanding results with revenues increasing 1%, driven by volume and 30 basis point of foreign currency translation tailwind. CCM continued to exhibit its resilience with solid U.S. commercial roofing performance, despite the continued COVID-related restrictions in some areas, restraining the recovery. Our newer platforms of architectural metals and polyurethanes were solid contributors to the quarter's revenue performance. Operating margin at CCM was a record 20.4% for the fourth quarter, a 350 basis improvement over last year driven by CCM team's superb cost management and COS, partially offset by wage inflation. CCM executed well in delivering approximately $15 million of net price cost realization in the quarter. Please now turn slide 17 to review CIT's results. CIT's revenue declined 35.4% in the fourth quarter. As well publicized, this decline was driven by the crisis in commercial aerospace markets. While a recovery in aerospace could be prolonged, we are confident that there will be a resumption of growth with the continued rollout of the COVID vaccine and airlines returning to profitability. And other positive recent news the 737MAX-8 has been cleared for return to flight in the U.S., Europe, and South America, while TSA passenger daily checkpoint data continues to improve. In our medical platform, sales continue to be impacted by COVID-related delays in hospital CapEx and postponed elective surgeries. However, our project pipeline is robust and long-term trends remain attractive, including increasing preference for minimally invasive surgeries and OEM strategies consolidate supply chain partners. CIT's operating margin declined significantly year-over-year to a negative 8.6% driven by commercial aerospace, volume declines and accelerated restructuring actions. These declines were partially offset by savings from COS; lower SG&A, and price increases. While the actions taken by CIT in 2020 to right-size our footprint, reduce our workforce were difficult, we are positioned to deliver improved operating income performance when the volumes returned. Turning now to slide 18, CFT sales declined 8.3% year-over-year, organic revenue declined 16.1%, and additionally, acquisitions added 5% in the quarter FX contributed 280 basis points. Stabilization in key end markets driven by an improved industrial capital spending outlook in 2021, coupled with recent management additions, new product introductions, pricing resolve, and CFT's efforts to upgrade the customer experience and position CFT well as we enter 2021. Operating income of 4.5% was an 820 basis point decline year-on-year. This decline was driven by lower volumes, restructuring in raw material costs, partially offset by price and efficiencies from COS and lower SG&A. Turning the CBF on slide 19. CBF's fourth quarter organic revenue grew 2.8% and FX had a positive 2.6% impact, driving CBF growth of 5.4% in the quarter. Demand for agriculture and construction equipment were the primary drivers, while orders in region improved throughout the second half of 2020. Operating income was $8 million or 1.1% operating margin, flat to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven primarily by unfavorable mix in aerospace markets, wage inflation, offset by COS efficiencies, increased volumes, and tight cost controls. On slides 20 and 21, we show selected balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with $902 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit line. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner, investing organic growth through CapEx and opportunistically repurchasing shares, while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. Free cash flow for 2020 was an exceptional $601 million consistent with 2019 results on lower sales volumes. Turning to slide 22, you can see the outlook for 2021 on items affecting comparability and corporate items. Corporate expense is expected to be approximately $105 million for the year. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $225 million. For the full year, we will continue to invest in our businesses and now expect capital expenditures of $100 million to $175 million. Net interest expense is approximately -- is expected to be approximately $75 million for the year and we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris.\nChris Koch: Thanks Bob. In closing, I want to once again express my thanks to our dedicated employees, their families, our business partners, and all those associated with Carlisle's success. Without you, we could not have weathered and overcome the significant challenges of 2020. Entering 2021, we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for Carlisle. We will continue to benefit from the strength of the Carlisle business model and enhance our strong earnings power by investing in our high returning businesses. We will continue to deploy capital into strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends, all the while maintaining our commitment to delivering returns on invested capital in excess of 15% and ultimately, driving $15 of earnings per share. While there are clearly many uncertainties around the pandemic, including the effectiveness of the rollout of the vaccines, we want to keep investors informed on our views of our businesses and markets. As such, we offer 2021 guidance based upon where we are today, while fully acknowledging that we are in uncertain and turbulent times. For full year 2021, we anticipate the following; CCM supported by reroofing project deferrals that occurred in 2020, positive momentum in our newer businesses of architectural metals, polyurethanes, expansion of our European businesses, and a decrease in complexity to complete jobs as COVID restrictions ease, we anticipate revenue growth of high single-digits in 2021. At CIT, we believe that rapid COVID inoculation will drive an improvement in business and leisure travel exiting 2021. Aircraft manufacturers are indicating production rates will rise towards the end of 2021. These trends are coupled with an improved order book for medical products and solutions as hospital capital, investments in elective surgeries resumed. That said we anticipate pressures remain near-term and given a different -- very difficult year-over-year comparison in the first quarter, we expect CIT revenue will decline in the mid to high single-digit range in full year 2021. With order book strengthening for both CFT and CBS and end market stabilizing, we anticipate low double-digit growth for both businesses. On behalf of the approximately 13,000 employees at Carlisle, thank you again for the trust you place in us. This concludes our formal comments. Annie, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We have a first question from the line of Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. You may ask your question, please.\nBryan Blair: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.\nChris Koch: Hi Bryan.\nBryan Blair: Chris, you briefly mentioned the major developments in the commercial roofing industry about a month ago with the large CCM competitor changing hands. Obviously, very early days here, but just wondering if you could share a little more color and how your team thinks about the high level implications of that deal? And balances -- thoughts on competitive risks and opportunities looking forward?\nChris Koch: I think, in general, we view the entrance of the European group into the market is being positive. I think, obviously, well run organization with solid margin expectations for their other businesses. And also, I think operating in a -- perhaps more ESG-focused environment in Europe, which should bring good things to the industry as a whole. So, I think, in general, it brings attention to the great business model we have here in CCM and in the industry, I think it brings attention to the good things that our products are doing and solutions are doing globally. And so I would say the team obviously, is highly competitive and will be highly competitive with any entrant. But I think it's a neutral at worst.\nBryan Blair: Okay. Makes sense. And sticking with CCM, how are volumes trending to start the year? I believe you still face a reasonably tough comp through February. Just curious about momentum ahead of the lower bar in March and honestly through the second and third quarters?\nChris Koch: Yes, I think as your -- you see how we came out of the fourth quarter. And obviously, it wasn't huge growth, but it was growth. And I think it was very consistent with what we felt about the model and kind of thought would happen and talked about as the year went on. So, obviously, things got better sequentially. Obviously, Q1 is a difficult comp. I would say that we just see the trends in Q4 continuing and it likely it'll be something to like you saw in Q4.\nBryan Blair: Got it. And investors are obviously focused on inflationary trends right now and particularly oil and gas based with you guys. We know there was pricing in 4Q and you put out a reasonably aggressive increase that I believe kicks in a little later this quarter. How confident are you in price sticking in this environment? And how should we think about the cadence of price cost impact for the year?\nChris Koch: From my perspective, it was very satisfying to see that the price increases that occurred were quickly embraced by a lot of parties and we also see widespread support and other construction related products for price increases. So, my belief is that we will see traction on price as you said becomes effective in full -- but later on especially as volumes rise, it becomes more impactful as we get further into the end of the year. And I think on the raw material side, our team obviously sees that there is some inflationary pressures. But we have done a lot, as I mentioned in the call on our sourcing approaching initiatives to set up what we think is a good situation for us vis-\u00e0-vis raw material increases. And so we think it'll be relatively neutral as we sit here today for the year with respect to price in raw materials. But again, its early days, and you know, the first quarter is sometimes no indicator of the future, as we saw last year when first quarter was good, and then COVID hit. Bob, you want to add anything to that?\nBob Roche: Yes, I think Brian, we've talked about this every year that pricing traction usually doesn't happen until we see volume starting to pick up in the second quarter. So we would expect, while Chris mentioned, we expect to be flat for the year, we expect a little pressure in the first half and then that recovering in the second half as prices get fully up to the speed with volumes pick up.\nBryan Blair: Understood. Thanks again.\nBob Roche: Yes. Thanks, Bryan.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We do have another question from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is open. You may ask your question, please.\nTim Wojs: Hey. Hey, guys. Thanks. Nice job. Thanks for the good color that you guys provided in the slides, it\u2019s very helpful. I guess on Europe in metal and polyurethane, is there a way just to kind of square up how big those businesses are today, and kind of maybe where the margins are maybe in aggregate, and if they can kind of get to parity with the overall single-ply business overtime?\nChris Koch: Yes. I\u2019ll let Bob get an obviously Europe, polyurethanes and metals compared to our core roofing materials are smaller. The growth rates at least in polyurethanes and metals is higher, we would think with conversion in Europe, that Europe growth rates would be higher than our core growth rates as well. And then on margin, they have been as you are well aware, Tim both acquisitions, the margins weren't where we wanted them to be, we're making progress against that. But we ultimately think they can be in that range we've talked about for CCM and contribute positively. So Bob, do you want to add anything to that?\nBob Roche: Yes, Tim, I mean, we talked about this before with our your European business being in the $150 million range polyurethanes in the low 300s, and then architectural metals as when we bought them and put them together and then grew them since then a little over 250. And margins are approaching that combined on the 10% range as we get the more efficient; grow those businesses, put COS in focus on pricing, they improve every quarter. So we're positive on them. And again, as volumes accelerate, we expect the margins to increase rapidly.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then on the medical business within CIT. Could you just kind of level set us there in terms of where you are in terms of growth and margins? Because I think that's a pretty sizable contributor to 2025 to get that business to a $1 billion in kind of 2020, 20% margin. So, just trying to think through where that business is today and kind of levers you need to pull to be able to reach those targets?\nChris Koch: Yes, I think, Tim, Bob's going want to jump in on this a little more detail. But I think you're absolutely right that medical is going to be a big contributor. We've talked about in the past; unfortunately, it didn't get there prior to the aerospace decline here with COVID. But medicals highly that MedTech segment has strong margins in excess of what we have expected for CIT core aerospace business. So it'll be definitely be a contributor. And I think we've got to continue to build out the new products work with the OEs, which we're doing, and in fact, COVID really set that back, I think we had -- last time we really discussed projects, I think we had 70 plus new projects with medical OEMs, that really when we were forced to do the deal with the work-from-home situation for a lot of them, it slowed things down. So, Bob do you want to get some more commentary on?\nBob Roche: Yes, Tim. I mean, overall, the business is give or take a little over $200 million, $225 million for 2020 the total medical business, including Providien and the core. The core medical business, before we did the acquisition, approaching mid-teens, so we're very happy once we get these things integrated, get them running well, put COS in that their valuable businesses, obviously, with Providien coming in the purchase accounting and everything going on, that's closer to breakeven. But we're very positive in the margins going forward, as volumes start picking up. And we're able to get the efficiencies that we contemplated as the deal model.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay. Great. And then just on the pace of growth with an Interconnect. You do have a pretty tough Q1 in terms of a comp. How would you think about that business kind of building through the year? What's I guess based -- kind of baked into the mid to high single-digit declines forecast?\nBob Roche: Yes. We'd expect the first quarter to be tough. I know, I think in the fourth quarter recall, and that probably is the bottom. We expect a $5 million decline from Q4 to Q1, and then growing from there a little bit of decline year-on-year in Q2, because remember Q2 was even a little bit strong for our CIT business overall with aerospace not fully being out yet. And then growing nicely in Q3 and Q4 back as build rates start up again.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay. Appreciate it. Have a good rest of the week, and good luck on the year guys.\nBob Roche: Hey, thanks Tim.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We do have another question from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Your line is open. You may answer your question.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks. So building on the last question on CIT. Could you just aggregate what you saw on the aerospace side versus medical in the quarter and then within your outlook for 2021?\nChris Koch: So what are we seeing in aerospace?\nSaree Boroditsky: Versus medical in the fourth quarter and then in your outlook?\nChris Koch: Yes, I mean, fourth quarter, we're down in aerospace over 50%.\nBob Roche: Yes.\nChris Koch: So it's continuing to be down. And then the difference made up is test and measurement in medical. So medical is still not overall growing great due to the CapEx in the hospitals, but aerospace is down significantly, as you know.\nBob Roche: It overwhelmed medical part is just so big aerospace.\nJim Giannakouros : Yes, Yes. So, yes, you have -- hey, this is Jim. Medical flattish in the quarter and other areas typically down. So, hopefully that helps you get there.\nSaree Boroditsky: Okay. And then it looks like you're going to continue to have restructuring charges in that segment. Can you just talk about some of the costs tasks you\u2019re taking and expected savings going forward?\nChris Koch: Yes. Those are largely carryover costs from this year from what we announced in Kent, Washington closure. Because as you know and we've talked about before the moving in aerospace facility takes a long time, we expect that not to be fully moved and shut until the second half of this year, and all those charges related to the Kent closure.\nSaree Boroditsky: Okay. And then just for me, there's great color on your ESG positioning and the impact of roofing on energy savings in the slides, in your comments. I was just wondering, are you seeing any customers pull ahead reroofing projects in order to increase energy efficiency? And outside of Europe, are you seeing any government policies help spread that demand? Thank you.\nChris Koch: Yes, I think on the pulling forward, we've always said this, it's really difficult to pull anything forward in this environment with the tight labor that we've got in the United States here. So I wouldn't say anybody's pulled anything forward from an order perspective. Obviously, they can get things done quicker, they'll do that. I think, just in general, there's an overall movement that as we continue to evolve each year, we get new products and solutions out there immediately applied to those projects where they can be. So I think the speed with which people are putting in new innovation and helping is moving at a good pace. From the legislative perspective, I don't think there's any doubt that when we see a letter like we did from Larry Fink, and we see the actions like the California instructions on Board of Directors and female content, I think we know that there is definite concrete action it is occurring. We've been very pleased that we like to think in some ways, we've been at least on the curve with others and we want to hope to accelerate that. And so we appointed new Vice President of Sustainability this year. It's obviously a focus for our Board of Directors and for our management team. And as we've said all along, we don't do it in response to legislative mandates. Of course, we comply with them, but really, we want to get ahead of it because for Carlisle being more energy efficient in our plants facility saves money and benefits the shareholder with higher returns, and applying innovative products that help our customers use less and recycle and make their operations more energy efficient, is just good business for us. And certainly, diversity and inclusion we know benefits the entire workplace for better decision making and things like that. So while there is legislative movement, we think there's also just solid common sense movement from an economic perspective to do these things.\nSaree Boroditsky: Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nChris Koch: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. We do have another question from the line of Adam Baumgarten from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe to start out on CCM sales guidance, high single-digits, does that contemplate declines in new construction, as you guys lag that from last year?\nChris Koch: Yes, I mean, it's our best guess right now as to what's going to happen. When we talk about forecasting something like new construction declines for the year, I think obviously, we put that into the equation, we also put in things in an equation like the restocking that did not occur. Last year, we put into that our new products growth in our different platforms. And so I would say that, yes, we've contemplated any modulation and new construction that would occur in 2021.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. Got you. And then just switching gears and TCM to input costs, I mean, how should we think about the relationship between sort of the more publicized spot prices for raw materials like MDI, and how it sort of translates to your buyers? And maybe what kind of visibility you have and sort of maybe some of the changes you've made, and how you buy MDI over the last couple years?\nChris Koch: Well, the way I think about it is a little bit more, well, more stability, let's say a little bit, but more stability, more certainty and ability to extend the timeframe on those modulations and pricing that may occur on the spot market on a day to day or week to week or month to month basis. We are a very big consumer of these products we have over the last couple of years. Our team at CCM along with our legal team and our central lead sourcing team have done a great job of going back and leveraging our volumes as well as our long-term relationships and the prospects for new products to put ourselves we think in a better position to have a long-term view as well as setting our pricing parameters around that 90 day target where we have stability through the quarter. And we're as you know -- we're very familiar with what can happen in the spot market. When you reflect back to when we bought a sell, I think we closed and it wasn't a month or two later that forced matures were declared. And while our CCM business and I think this is actually a good comparison, our CCM business, whether those force was yours and didn't see a spike due to the purchasing strategies and contracts we had in place, the SL business got absolutely hammered by that spot price. And I think that's a great example of the difference between how we're buying and the spot price market. Obviously, since then, a sell is now on our type of contract. But I think that's a good example of how CCMs, purchasing strategies, and purchasing and sourcing actions really mitigate a lot of that up and down and fluctuation. That doesn't mean that we're not going to see changes in raw material pricing when they occur, it's just going to be I think, more modulated and we're going to have better control more stability and see it in advance.\nAdam Baumgarten: Great. Thanks a lot.\nChris Koch: You bet.\nAdam Baumgarten: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We do have another question from the line of Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. You can ask your question.\nKevin Hocevar: Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.\nChris Koch: Hey, Kevin.\nKevin Hocevar: Quick one on the tax rate, you're guiding to 25%, it looks like the last three years, it's been basically right around 20%. So wondering why you expect such a big step up in the tax rate this year?\nChris Koch: Yes, Adam, Kevin, first of all, it's discrete items, right? That's driving our tax rate down in a couple of years, different items coming through and tax planning things that have been done to drive the rate down. The reason it's up in 2021. A couple things going on, you got to remember are a lot of a lot of our international businesses where you might have a lower tax rate relate to the CIT businesses that shrinking and essentially unprofitable now. So, if you just think about most of the profits generated in the US, the US has a 20% 21%, statutory federal rate, you got 3% to 4% of state and local taxes. There's how you got to 25 and that's kind of where most our profit is right now. And we're always going to do our best to bring that down, but based on the visibility we have and what's going on in the world, we think 25 is a good starting point.\nKevin Hocevar: Yes. Okay, makes sense. And then you got a great color in terms of the expectations for sales growth in 2021. Wondering if you could help not just a little bit on margins to either that the type of incremental margins you're expecting out of the different segments or because it looks like you should see nice, your sales growth and three of the four segments. There's some inflation, though you kind of address that expecting kind of neutral ish and CCM. But, whatever color, if you could help us on the margin front how to think of that in the business, that'd be helpful?\nChris Koch: Yes. Kevin, I don't think anything on the incremental. We talked about our incremental margins on volume upside for a long time, if price costs were guiding flat increment margins are going to be based on the volume and then the same thing for CFT and CBF, we're looking at volume upside, and then CIT it's its way down even lower than it was on breakeven. So expect that to be a tough year for CIT.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We do have another question from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Your line is open. You may ask your question please.\nGarik Shmois: Hi, this is Jeff Stevenson. I'm for Gary, thanks for taking my questions. My first one is just on what you're seeing from a backlog and bidding perspective in CCM and which end markets are performing well are expected to perform well this year?\nChris Koch: Yes, I think we laid out some of the markets that we think are going to perform well, when we laid out that idea of more suburbanization, if I can call it that. And I think we'll continue to see that I think the Biden administration in their talks about infrastructure. And obviously, we saw that from the previous administration to the America First, I think there's some ideas that we'll see more infrastructure projects. So when we look to your other question, I'll turn that to Bob.\nBob Roche: On where it's coming from. This is the other question, sorry.\nChris Koch: Jeff, what was your first question for Bob again?\nGarik Shmois: I'm sorry, it was just some backlogs and bidding, right?\nBob Roche: Yes. Yes. All right. I'll just take it. Sorry about the confusion. On backlogs the quoting process is interesting, especially as we get into the first quarter. We've always had I think a pretty strong despite what we read in the newspapers, a pretty strong backlog there. It is held relatively consistent through the year dipping a little bit from our traditional levels coming back, and so we come into the fourth quarter. Obviously, there's the weather has an impact, but I would say quoting is good, but we also have a big backlog. And so in the reroofing side, as we talked about 70% of our business there, I think it's ongoing and really doesn't slow down because obviously, with the backlog there in the labor situations, as you know you're just trying to get someone to give you a quote. On the new construction side, yes, it has a little bit of a decline there. And I think people are cautious, and they want to see what's going to happen with the COVID restrictions that have been placed on them, as well as things like rents and in business prosperity, and whether people will continue to expand. But for the most part, we're still seeing strong activity tight labor markets across the across the construction base. And then when we see things like the weather happen, or other things that differ that reroofing, it just adds to the backlog and obviously makes it a good situation for us.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. That's great. And then just wanted an update on kind of balance sheet priorities now. And then with the M&A pipeline, just kind of what you're seeing how helpful is it, and any updates on other priorities? I know, you mentioned some on CCM side, but any update there would be great?\nChris Koch: Yes, balance sheet priorities are always first CapEx and we have some big projects coming in 2021 going up to over $150 million of projects we see coming in most of those being in CCM. So we're pretty happy about that continue to fund our R&D, increase our dividend which we've been doing all along, we would expect to do that again this year for the 45th year. And then finally, we want to have a nice balance between M&A and share repurchases. Synergistic M&A being our priority out of those two. I think the pipeline clearly weakened with 2020 going on and COVID and the disruption we saw, but the pipeline starting to grow again, we see opportunities out there. We're working every day to try make sure we get some good synergistic opportunities. We looked at a lot in 2020 just didn't get a lot closed. So, we're going to continue to be balanced between the two.\nGarik Shmois: Thanks. And best of luck moving forward.\nOperator: Thank you. We do have another question from the lineup of Joel Tiss from BMO. Your line is open.\nJoel Tiss: Hey, guys, I was jumping in on your acquisition commentary. Can any of the deals get through the much tighter goalposts you guys have set up in terms of returns and all that? Or is private equity still pushing the price a little too hard?\nChris Koch: No, Joel, I think it depends on you know, the segment, I mean, we're still seeing some good opportunities in construction materials. I think maybe even aerospace, we could find a deal, you might find some -- some good deals there in the aerospace business. So we'd still be interested in expanding our content for clients. So we see this down market as an opportunity to perhaps pick up some assets there that ultimately would have some pretty high return for our profiles, and we get them in into the, CIT business and let the team go to work there. I think when you look at things like med tech. Obviously, you have to be a little bit more discriminating. And they have to make sure they're good fits, and we can leverage, you know, infrastructure that we put in place with Providien and that, but I think we could find deals to do for sure.\nJoel Tiss: And bigger versus smaller or the valuation, is there enough of a difference? Like maybe if you go a little bit bigger? Can you find things that are a little cheaper, or not necessarily?\nChris Koch: Well, the last deal we saw that was close to our construction materials business had a pretty good multiple on it. So I don't know that size to -- make a difference as just what the asset is, and what the prospects are for the business and the management team and what they've done. So, I tried to give you an answer like that, but I think it just depends, I would say our preference would be for things that were a little bit bigger. We think they bring perhaps more market presence. They integrate better, we could pick up some management talent and things like that. And hopefully, they have some innovative products and maybe some access to Europe or things like that. So there are some definite specific things we're looking for that we think we can leverage, and we'd be willing to pay for.\nJoel Tiss: Okay. My last one is just -- you mentioned a bunch of new kind of, niches you're going after, or end market extensions, and you're nice enough to give us the size of the architectural metal business, can you give us any sort of a framework on how big some of these polyurethane, and some of these other initiatives you have are is or they're not really distinctive opportunities that you can break out, it's more just like, additive to what you're already doing?\nChris Koch: We can break out some of the products, I mean, we can and maybe not on this call, but maybe it's better for a longer conversation around things like new products, we know that IntelliSpray just from the equipment perspective, we think that globally might be $150 million market. We know it's dominated for the most part by one player. We think we offer an alternative there. So, that's a in one product line a 10s of millions of dollar opportunity over a five to seven year time horizon, when we look at what IntelliSpray does for our polyurethane spray foam, that business is more the spray foam business is more than the $100 market. And we think you know that a Carlisle has a very strong market position and can build on that certainly with the combination with equipment can do better. Metals has opportunities that are, architectural metals, insulated panels is an interesting one. There's some other architectural things that you can do on a building that are new from screens and things like that. And we think those are tens of millions of dollar opportunities. The three new locations we put in have had significant market sizes attached to them, again, definitely above $10 million, $20 million there each so. But we'll -- we'll we could follow-up with you. And maybe even on the next call, try to characterize some of those -- \nBob Roche : Europe's a massive opportunity, $10 billion. So with the roofing space,\nJoel Tiss: And is that for your kind of roofing, or is that the total roofing? That was my last little clarification question?\nChris Koch: Yes. No, it's not all single -- it's not all single ply roofing membranes like we traditionally have here. Joel. Our product line actually in Europe is this resorts its product which is growing at double digits and is a combination of bitumen with EPDM and it's it has a really unique function to it. So that's the roofing space, maybe our total available market and we look at things like sealants and adhesives. We look at our fasteners, we look at edge metals, we look at metal roofing, things like that. So this whole move that CCM made over the last, 5 to 10 years to become, you know more in the building envelope. That's what that opportunity really represents. It's a much bigger opportunity set than just a single ply roofing membrane solution like we would have had back in the 80s.\nJoel Tiss: Okay. Well, thank you very much. I don't want to take up all the time. Thank you.\nChris Koch: You bet. Joe. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. So we do have another question from the lineup Mr. David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Just to build on this most recent conversation around M&A, I guess, what is your best guess on the level of acquisition activity you'll need to complete to achieve your vision 2025 goals?\nChris Koch: I think we contemplated in vision 2025, somewhere $2 billion to $3 billion of acquisitions. I think that's good. We put out the $8 billion of sales. And Bob and I even at the time, thought we could do more than that, from a growth perspective. With acquisition, we still feel that way. There's more opportunities that continue to present themselves, I think the bigger focus for us to complete our vision 2025 goal is really to hit that $15 of VPS. And I'm not sure we need to do the same level of acquisitions to get to the $15 VPS. In fact, I think our preference would be to drive our internal organic projects and fund capital expenditures to get that because we know those, as we've seen with CCM over the years, when you do it internally, and you do it organically, and you build that infrastructure, your ROIC gets to those CCM levels of 30%. So I know that maybe confused. But our primary goal and vision 2025 was to $15 a share. And I think, you know, we could probably do less on the maybe the lower end of our original acquisition framework to get there.\nBob Roche: And we're always focused on returns. So yes, if we can get the returns on the acquisitions, we're going to do them.\nDavid MacGregor: That makes sense. And then I guess, Chris, I wanted to just circle back and ask you pretty much the same question I asked you last quarter. And that was the extent to which you thought business had been pushed out from 2020 to 2021. And if there was any way to kind of size that and at the time, you thought it might be anywhere from 200 million to 300 million, but I thought I'd circle back and just get maybe an update in terms of your thinking on just how much business got pushed forward and how that might contribute to growth in 2021?\nChris Koch: Yes. I think it's going to be a good -- on the reroofing, I think it's a good story that we still see tight labor markets. We still see a strong demand in the reroofing. Obviously, the inventory build out that didn't occur last year, we characterize that, and that number I gave you, and now we have a year of heightened COVID restrictions. And I'm not even sure any of us really understand how much was delayed because of the protocols in the second quarter and third quarter that a lot of our roofing contractors had to deal with, I know, I'd been out to some job sites where there were, hand sanitizing stations, and social distancing, and masks and which a lot of more worrying anyway, but -- you wonder how much that took out of the productivity of a roofer? And so, I think you just have to think it's got to be something, north of 20% decrease in productivity. And so I think he can figure that it's that that is added to the backlog. And again, as we said, earlier, too, there's just a limited supply of people that can do this, and the demand is there. And so what doesn't get done, you can't defer it you try to get by, but ultimately, you have to do it. I know, here and in Phoenix, the ability to get projects done or even quoted is it's I've never seen anything like it before. I mean, it's just really hard to get a contract or even quote something. So I think it's, as we said, it depends on where you're in the region, it depends on, obviously, in the northern regions, there's more weather and there's less work being done so. It's probably the best they -- \nDavid MacGregor: Yes. I guess it's kind of hard to put in the spot for a number. So maybe the way to ask the question is just, are you feeling like that number might be a little bit bigger than what I asked you a quarter ago or just, I guess, directionally how are you thinking about it?\nChris Koch: Yes. Definitely. And I think it's just supported by we keep referring to some of the graphs, we've shown on reroofing and, and we know the projects that are coming do we referenced the buildings that are 10 to 20 years old, we saw that build out, we got that on the front end, as did our competitors as we built up, and expanded and now these roofs are, coming down and they need to be replaced. And so I would say anything that slows that down, whether it was COVID, or it's whether it adds to the backlog simply because of the constraint on labor. We're just -- can't get through.\nBob Roche: And simple way to look at it right CCM sales were down 7% for the year in 2020 and every roofing demand based on everything you know should have grown 3%.\nDavid MacGregor: Got it. Thanks very much. Good luck.\nChris Koch: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. There are no further questions from the line presenters. You may continue please.\nChris Koch: Thanks, Annie. This concludes our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. I want to thank everybody for your participation, great questions. We appreciate you taking the time. Stay healthy and we look forward to speaking with you at our next earnings call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Roche",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Please turn to the revenue bridge on slide 13 of the presentation. Revenue decreased 7% to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, organic revenue declined 9%, acquisitions contributed 1.4% of sales growth for the quarter, and FX was a 60 basis point tailwind. Turning to our margin bridge on slide 14. Q4 operating margin declined 180 basis points. Pricing and volume headwinds combined for 320 basis point declined and acquisitions were 40 basis point tailwind. Offsetting these declines freight, labor, raw material, other operating costs netted to a 60 basis point improvement. COS benefits added 120 basis points. On slide 15, we have provided an EPS bridge, where you can see the fourth quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.57, which compares to $1.81 last year. Volume, price, and mix combined were a 74% year-over-year decrease, partially offsetting, interest and tax contributed $0.09 and raw material, freight, and labor costs netted to a $0.16 benefit. Share repurchases contributed nine $0.09. OLS contributed $0.19, and finally, operating expenses were $0.03 headwind. While COVID-related volume declines clearly represented the most significant headwind during the quarter, our teams around the world did a commendable job managing costs, leveraging COS to improve efficiencies, and taking actions to both position Carlisle for the recovery while mitigating the pandemic impact on earnings. Now, let's turn to slide 16 to review the fourth quarter performance by segment in more detail. At CCM, the team again delivered outstanding results with revenues increasing 1%, driven by volume and 30 basis point of foreign currency translation tailwind. CCM continued to exhibit its resilience with solid U.S. commercial roofing performance, despite the continued COVID-related restrictions in some areas, restraining the recovery. Our newer platforms of architectural metals and polyurethanes were solid contributors to the quarter's revenue performance. Operating margin at CCM was a record 20.4% for the fourth quarter, a 350 basis improvement over last year driven by CCM team's superb cost management and COS, partially offset by wage inflation. CCM executed well in delivering approximately $15 million of net price cost realization in the quarter. Please now turn slide 17 to review CIT's results. CIT's revenue declined 35.4% in the fourth quarter. As well publicized, this decline was driven by the crisis in commercial aerospace markets. While a recovery in aerospace could be prolonged, we are confident that there will be a resumption of growth with the continued rollout of the COVID vaccine and airlines returning to profitability. And other positive recent news the 737MAX-8 has been cleared for return to flight in the U.S., Europe, and South America, while TSA passenger daily checkpoint data continues to improve. In our medical platform, sales continue to be impacted by COVID-related delays in hospital CapEx and postponed elective surgeries. However, our project pipeline is robust and long-term trends remain attractive, including increasing preference for minimally invasive surgeries and OEM strategies consolidate supply chain partners. CIT's operating margin declined significantly year-over-year to a negative 8.6% driven by commercial aerospace, volume declines and accelerated restructuring actions. These declines were partially offset by savings from COS; lower SG&A, and price increases. While the actions taken by CIT in 2020 to right-size our footprint, reduce our workforce were difficult, we are positioned to deliver improved operating income performance when the volumes returned. Turning now to slide 18, CFT sales declined 8.3% year-over-year, organic revenue declined 16.1%, and additionally, acquisitions added 5% in the quarter FX contributed 280 basis points. Stabilization in key end markets driven by an improved industrial capital spending outlook in 2021, coupled with recent management additions, new product introductions, pricing resolve, and CFT's efforts to upgrade the customer experience and position CFT well as we enter 2021. Operating income of 4.5% was an 820 basis point decline year-on-year. This decline was driven by lower volumes, restructuring in raw material costs, partially offset by price and efficiencies from COS and lower SG&A. Turning the CBF on slide 19. CBF's fourth quarter organic revenue grew 2.8% and FX had a positive 2.6% impact, driving CBF growth of 5.4% in the quarter. Demand for agriculture and construction equipment were the primary drivers, while orders in region improved throughout the second half of 2020. Operating income was $8 million or 1.1% operating margin, flat to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven primarily by unfavorable mix in aerospace markets, wage inflation, offset by COS efficiencies, increased volumes, and tight cost controls. On slides 20 and 21, we show selected balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with $902 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit line. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner, investing organic growth through CapEx and opportunistically repurchasing shares, while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. Free cash flow for 2020 was an exceptional $601 million consistent with 2019 results on lower sales volumes. Turning to slide 22, you can see the outlook for 2021 on items affecting comparability and corporate items. Corporate expense is expected to be approximately $105 million for the year. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $225 million. For the full year, we will continue to invest in our businesses and now expect capital expenditures of $100 million to $175 million. Net interest expense is approximately -- is expected to be approximately $75 million for the year and we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris. Yes, I think Brian, we've talked about this every year that pricing traction usually doesn't happen until we see volume starting to pick up in the second quarter. So we would expect, while Chris mentioned, we expect to be flat for the year, we expect a little pressure in the first half and then that recovering in the second half as prices get fully up to the speed with volumes pick up. Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, Tim, I mean, we talked about this before with our your European business being in the $150 million range polyurethanes in the low 300s, and then architectural metals as when we bought them and put them together and then grew them since then a little over 250. And margins are approaching that combined on the 10% range as we get the more efficient; grow those businesses, put COS in focus on pricing, they improve every quarter. So we're positive on them. And again, as volumes accelerate, we expect the margins to increase rapidly. Yes, Tim. I mean, overall, the business is give or take a little over $200 million, $225 million for 2020 the total medical business, including Providien and the core. The core medical business, before we did the acquisition, approaching mid-teens, so we're very happy once we get these things integrated, get them running well, put COS in that their valuable businesses, obviously, with Providien coming in the purchase accounting and everything going on, that's closer to breakeven. But we're very positive in the margins going forward, as volumes start picking up. And we're able to get the efficiencies that we contemplated as the deal model. Yes. We'd expect the first quarter to be tough. I know, I think in the fourth quarter recall, and that probably is the bottom. We expect a $5 million decline from Q4 to Q1, and then growing from there a little bit of decline year-on-year in Q2, because remember Q2 was even a little bit strong for our CIT business overall with aerospace not fully being out yet. And then growing nicely in Q3 and Q4 back as build rates start up again. Hey, thanks Tim. Yes. It overwhelmed medical part is just so big aerospace. On where it's coming from. This is the other question, sorry. Yes. Yes. All right. I'll just take it. Sorry about the confusion. On backlogs the quoting process is interesting, especially as we get into the first quarter. We've always had I think a pretty strong despite what we read in the newspapers, a pretty strong backlog there. It is held relatively consistent through the year dipping a little bit from our traditional levels coming back, and so we come into the fourth quarter. Obviously, there's the weather has an impact, but I would say quoting is good, but we also have a big backlog. And so in the reroofing side, as we talked about 70% of our business there, I think it's ongoing and really doesn't slow down because obviously, with the backlog there in the labor situations, as you know you're just trying to get someone to give you a quote. On the new construction side, yes, it has a little bit of a decline there. And I think people are cautious, and they want to see what's going to happen with the COVID restrictions that have been placed on them, as well as things like rents and in business prosperity, and whether people will continue to expand. But for the most part, we're still seeing strong activity tight labor markets across the across the construction base. And then when we see things like the weather happen, or other things that differ that reroofing, it just adds to the backlog and obviously makes it a good situation for us. Europe's a massive opportunity, $10 billion. So with the roofing space, And we're always focused on returns. So yes, if we can get the returns on the acquisitions, we're going to do them. And simple way to look at it right CCM sales were down 7% for the year in 2020 and every roofing demand based on everything you know should have grown 3%."

            "name": "Chris Koch",
            "content": "Thanks Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Entering what is now the second year of operating in this COVID-19 pandemic, I hope everyone is healthy and staying safe. Like to open by saying how proud I am of the global Carlisle team for their perseverance and ability to execute in these uncertain times. Our COVID statistics reflect the strong compliance to the CDC guidelines and safety measures all Carlisle employees have followed in 2020. We suffered 470 infections, 15 hospitalizations, and sadly three deaths. We continue to do our part to combat the spread of the virus. In combination with further progress on the vaccination rollout, we anticipate that we will continue to show our safety measures are working because at Carlisle, maintaining health and safety is always our first priority. Vision 2025 provided clear direction and consistency of mission during a tumultuous 2020 and will continue to guide our efforts as we accelerate into the recovery. As we pass the mid-year mark and entered the third quarter, we continue to build on the momentum started in late Q2 when our employees, customers, and supply chain partners increasingly were able to work safely and efficiently and begin to get back to contributing to economic growth. As the global community returned to work, strong underlying deferred demand became more evident, especially in our building products business. While we expect this momentum to continue as vaccines help decrease risks, the construction industry is still contending with uneven regional disruptions due to COVID restrictions, severe weather in certain areas, and tight labor dynamics, which is resulting in deferred demand continuing to build the backlog of work. Turning to slide four, 2020 demonstrated yet again the exceptional and sustainable earnings power of the Carlisle business model. Over the past several decades, Carlisle has been categorized as a diversified industrial company and rightly so, as evidenced by our portfolio contact -- our content, multiple acquisitions in a variety of segments ranging from fluid handling to medical technologies, and our legacy strategic goals. However, since CCM introduced the first Single-Ply EPDM Roofing membranes to the market in the early 1960s, Carlisle's growth and earnings have increasingly been powered by our construction materials business. With over a half century of outstanding performance, CCM's influence on our overall performance has consistently expanded despite our diversification efforts, peaking in 2021 when it accounted for over 70% of revenues and over 90% of earnings. In the past three years, CCM has accelerated their world-class performance leveraging consistent organic growth focused on providing the ultimate customer service, the Carlisle Experience and instituting greater price discipline, developing sophisticated sourcing and purchasing capabilities, and maintaining a continuous improvement culture, all aiming to drive increased profitability and shareholder value. In 2017, when we first contemplate a Vision 2025, we turned a critical eye to our capital deployment efforts and started a pivot to a more disciplined ROI focus. It was that critical assessment and objective view of value creation that drove our focus under Vision 2025 to apply a greater investment spotlight onto CCM. A consistent 30% plus returns business CCM's performance warranted and earned the right to share the majority of investment dollars that were allocated to portfolio diversification, at that time, a key strategy of Carlisle's legacy approach to building out higher growth and presumably higher margin platforms as a path to sustainable value creation. With the official rollout of Vision 2025 in February of 2018, our evolution was actualized evidenced by our recent extensive M&A capital investments at CCM. As shown on slide five, CCM has continued to evolve from its roots in the early 1960s of a simple Single-Ply Roofing membrane division to today, where we deliver innovative, easy to install and energy-efficient solutions throughout -- through the Carlisle experience for customers who are creating the sustainable building of the future. With our extensive line of building envelope product, CCM offers a complete set of solutions and systems to aid in the design of efficient building envelope construction projects, backed by industry leading warranties and a focus on green principles. On slide six, you can see how this building envelope concept can deliver substantial energy savings for building owners. CCM products provide a substantial offset to the estimated 40% of greenhouse gases globally generated from the construction and maintenance of buildings. And our teams are focused on continuing to support the growing efforts in global energy efficiency It's because of this history of innovation, investment, and continuous improvement that we have more conviction than ever the CCM's future success is secure. We believe the extensive planning of Vision 2025 identified the strengths of CCM's core markets, demonstrated the consistent reroofing revenue stream, and elevated the power of CCM sustainable business model. 2020 only serve to crystallize our confidence. Turning to slide seven, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking in more detail about CCM's future and what drives our confidence in the CCM business model. First, as you've heard us speak about it like CCM's core business is predominantly driven by replacement roofing demand. Non-residential buildings built 10 to 20 years ago make up over 25% of current infrastructure and those roofs will need replacing in the next decade. As a reminder, roof replacements are not discretionary. Aided by the Carlisle experience and our market position, CCM should continue to capture placement of installed roofing systems and grow share with new energy efficient, labor reducing, and cost effective productive solutions in the $6 billion and growing market. While the majority of our core CCM business revenue comes from reroofing. Past construction cycles evidence residential construction as a strong leading indicator of new commercial construction, which augments core CCM growth. Growing residential construction demand which accelerated in 2020 coinciding with urban relocation due to COVID, will require increased commercial infrastructure including big box retailers, hospitals, warehouses, and educational buildings to support a growing population of suburban families and workers. Second, as shown in slide eight, the recent addition of our polyurethane platform to CCM included spray foam insulation, which is a sustainable high single-digit growth market. Our top performing formulations provide unmatched energy efficiency in both residential and non-residential applications. Driven by our industry-first concept of a combined material and equipment solution, which we call IntelliSpray, it was developed and introduced with engineering support from Carlisle fluid technologies. Carlisle CCM is uniquely positioned to grow at above market levels in spray polyurethane foam insulation. This innovative new system will allow us to provide the contractor, builder, and homeowner with greater application efficiency and control, savings from application efficiency improvements, and ultimately, a better foam insulation product. Third, like polyurethane, architectural metals is an exciting new platform for CCM. This billion dollar market growing at approximately two times GDP provides an attractive opportunity to diversify into the sloped roof market with a highly sustainable product. Our metals platform is seeing healthy organic growth, as it offers a lasting high ROI system solution to building owners, generating solid pull-through sales of CCM insulation and underlayment products. To support our regional growth strategy, we're expanding our metals footprint in 2021 by opening three new locations in the U.S. Metal roofing systems also complement our drive to deliver solutions to support the construction of an efficient building envelope. Metal roofs are 100% recyclable, increase energy efficiency of building up to 20% versus traditional materials, and reduce waste in the manufacturing process. Fourth, we're committed to accelerating growth in Europe, a $10 billion -- \u20ac10 billion addressable market. To drive this growth, we recently changed leadership in the region and announced the investment of over $25 million to expand capacity in our German manufacturing facility. Increasing demand and regulations for improved thermal performance along with integrated roofing systems are driving a shift to single-ply membranes in Europe. CCM's leading environmental and energy efficient solutions lend themselves well to trends in the European market. Recent industry dynamics reinforce our belief that increasing our focus on our building products platform is the right strategy. The new ownership of a recently acquired competitor and an announced management edition at another competitor shows the widespread belief of the strong prospects for the non-residential building products space. The industry dynamics also support our strategy to accelerate growth in Europe. And finally, as was widely discussed after the recent acquisition, our increased focus on delivering the Carlisle experience for the sustainable building of the future is in line with macro industry trends. Before moving to our three other businesses, I want to reiterate how remarkable our CCM business performed in 2020. CCM was largely the story for Carlisle in 2020 and we expect that to continue into 2021 and beyond. Regarding our other three businesses on slide nine, 2020 was obviously a difficult years due to the pandemic. In the face of significant declines, the teams did a commendable job managing through the crisis, taking actions to reduce costs, and position their businesses for the future including leveraging COS, investing in new product development, and right-sizing footprints. While the results did not meet our expectations, these remain good -- very good businesses with solid management teams committed to weathering the current macroeconomic challenges. We are optimistic that the actions taken in 2020 to improve CIT, CFT, and CBF will position these businesses for a solid recovery, especially in 2021 for CFT and CBF where markets have signaled the bottom. And while we believe CIT will recover over a longer timeline, we are confident that there will be a recovery. With higher inoculation rates for rapid vaccine rollouts, easing of COVID travel restrictions, and an improved outlook for both aerospace and hospital capital spending, CIT will drive exceptional leverage with a resumption of growth. Before Bob gives the financial details of the quarter, I'd like to touch on a few other notable achievements of 2020. Please turn to slide 10. We've generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow over the last six years and recently accelerating significantly, with almost half that was generated in 2019 and 2020. This track record of success supports our confidence in this team's ability to execute on our capital allocation strategy and to create value. While 2020 was a subdued year for M&A, we are managing an active pipeline for accretive and synergistic acquisitions to rapidly scale our high returning businesses. As always, our financial strength and cash flow generating capabilities afford us flexibility and we intend to remain opportunistic. Notably, and as we've discussed in the past, when acquisition activity is subdued, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. This is evidenced by our deployment of more than $380 million in share repurchases in 2020, totaling approximately $1.5 billion in share repurchases since 2017. And at our latest Board meeting, our Board approved an incremental 5 million share repurchase authorization for Carlisle. We also returned over $112 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in 2020, raising our dividend in August for the 44th consecutive year. Finally, we spent $96 million of CapEx in 2020 and have plans to significantly increase that in 2021. On slide 11, we touch on our continued unexpanded actions around ESG where Carlisle remains steadfast in our commitment. Supported by CLS, we are continually examining ways to improve the design and manufacture of our products, seeking to better engage our employees and communities, and improve an already strong regulatory framework. In 2020, we also made progress in diversity and inclusion exiting 2020 with 50% of our Board of Director's identifying as gender, racially, or ethnically diverse, and meeting our 2020 target for percent of females and senior leadership positions. As we've stated many times before, ESG is part of Carlisle's culture of continuous improvement and we look forward to sharing more progress with you in the future. I would also encourage you to read more about Carlisle's ESG efforts on the sustainability pages of our website. Please turn to slide 12, where we cover the Carlisle operating system. In 2020, CLS delivered savings of 1.3% of sales, while within our vision 2025 annual target of 1% to 2%, a remarkable feat considering 2020's challenging conditions and proving the Carlisle employees truly embody and live our continuous improvement culture every day. Another major milestone in 2020 was the launch of the Path to Zero, which represents our commitment to creating the safest possible work environment, and features the goal of zero accidents and zero injuries. COS will continue to be a unifying cultural imperative for our businesses to rely on as they seek new opportunities to make our operations and business processes more efficient. Bob will now provide operational and financial details about our fourth quarter and review our balance sheet and cash flow. Bob? Thanks Bob. In closing, I want to once again express my thanks to our dedicated employees, their families, our business partners, and all those associated with Carlisle's success. Without you, we could not have weathered and overcome the significant challenges of 2020. Entering 2021, we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for Carlisle. We will continue to benefit from the strength of the Carlisle business model and enhance our strong earnings power by investing in our high returning businesses. We will continue to deploy capital into strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends, all the while maintaining our commitment to delivering returns on invested capital in excess of 15% and ultimately, driving $15 of earnings per share. While there are clearly many uncertainties around the pandemic, including the effectiveness of the rollout of the vaccines, we want to keep investors informed on our views of our businesses and markets. As such, we offer 2021 guidance based upon where we are today, while fully acknowledging that we are in uncertain and turbulent times. For full year 2021, we anticipate the following; CCM supported by reroofing project deferrals that occurred in 2020, positive momentum in our newer businesses of architectural metals, polyurethanes, expansion of our European businesses, and a decrease in complexity to complete jobs as COVID restrictions ease, we anticipate revenue growth of high single-digits in 2021. At CIT, we believe that rapid COVID inoculation will drive an improvement in business and leisure travel exiting 2021. Aircraft manufacturers are indicating production rates will rise towards the end of 2021. These trends are coupled with an improved order book for medical products and solutions as hospital capital, investments in elective surgeries resumed. That said we anticipate pressures remain near-term and given a different -- very difficult year-over-year comparison in the first quarter, we expect CIT revenue will decline in the mid to high single-digit range in full year 2021. With order book strengthening for both CFT and CBS and end market stabilizing, we anticipate low double-digit growth for both businesses. On behalf of the approximately 13,000 employees at Carlisle, thank you again for the trust you place in us. This concludes our formal comments. Annie, we're now ready for questions. Hi Bryan. I think, in general, we view the entrance of the European group into the market is being positive. I think, obviously, well run organization with solid margin expectations for their other businesses. And also, I think operating in a -- perhaps more ESG-focused environment in Europe, which should bring good things to the industry as a whole. So, I think, in general, it brings attention to the great business model we have here in CCM and in the industry, I think it brings attention to the good things that our products are doing and solutions are doing globally. And so I would say the team obviously, is highly competitive and will be highly competitive with any entrant. But I think it's a neutral at worst. Yes, I think as your -- you see how we came out of the fourth quarter. And obviously, it wasn't huge growth, but it was growth. And I think it was very consistent with what we felt about the model and kind of thought would happen and talked about as the year went on. So, obviously, things got better sequentially. Obviously, Q1 is a difficult comp. I would say that we just see the trends in Q4 continuing and it likely it'll be something to like you saw in Q4. From my perspective, it was very satisfying to see that the price increases that occurred were quickly embraced by a lot of parties and we also see widespread support and other construction related products for price increases. So, my belief is that we will see traction on price as you said becomes effective in full -- but later on especially as volumes rise, it becomes more impactful as we get further into the end of the year. And I think on the raw material side, our team obviously sees that there is some inflationary pressures. But we have done a lot, as I mentioned in the call on our sourcing approaching initiatives to set up what we think is a good situation for us vis-a\u0300-vis raw material increases. And so we think it'll be relatively neutral as we sit here today for the year with respect to price in raw materials. But again, its early days, and you know, the first quarter is sometimes no indicator of the future, as we saw last year when first quarter was good, and then COVID hit. Bob, you want to add anything to that? Yes. I'll let Bob get an obviously Europe, polyurethanes and metals compared to our core roofing materials are smaller. The growth rates at least in polyurethanes and metals is higher, we would think with conversion in Europe, that Europe growth rates would be higher than our core growth rates as well. And then on margin, they have been as you are well aware, Tim both acquisitions, the margins weren't where we wanted them to be, we're making progress against that. But we ultimately think they can be in that range we've talked about for CCM and contribute positively. So Bob, do you want to add anything to that? Yes, I think, Tim, Bob's going want to jump in on this a little more detail. But I think you're absolutely right that medical is going to be a big contributor. We've talked about in the past; unfortunately, it didn't get there prior to the aerospace decline here with COVID. But medicals highly that MedTech segment has strong margins in excess of what we have expected for CIT core aerospace business. So it'll be definitely be a contributor. And I think we've got to continue to build out the new products work with the OEs, which we're doing, and in fact, COVID really set that back, I think we had -- last time we really discussed projects, I think we had 70 plus new projects with medical OEMs, that really when we were forced to do the deal with the work-from-home situation for a lot of them, it slowed things down. So, Bob do you want to get some more commentary on? So what are we seeing in aerospace? Yes, I mean, fourth quarter, we're down in aerospace over 50%. So it's continuing to be down. And then the difference made up is test and measurement in medical. So medical is still not overall growing great due to the CapEx in the hospitals, but aerospace is down significantly, as you know. Yes. Those are largely carryover costs from this year from what we announced in Kent, Washington closure. Because as you know and we've talked about before the moving in aerospace facility takes a long time, we expect that not to be fully moved and shut until the second half of this year, and all those charges related to the Kent closure. Yes, I think on the pulling forward, we've always said this, it's really difficult to pull anything forward in this environment with the tight labor that we've got in the United States here. So I wouldn't say anybody's pulled anything forward from an order perspective. Obviously, they can get things done quicker, they'll do that. I think, just in general, there's an overall movement that as we continue to evolve each year, we get new products and solutions out there immediately applied to those projects where they can be. So I think the speed with which people are putting in new innovation and helping is moving at a good pace. From the legislative perspective, I don't think there's any doubt that when we see a letter like we did from Larry Fink, and we see the actions like the California instructions on Board of Directors and female content, I think we know that there is definite concrete action it is occurring. We've been very pleased that we like to think in some ways, we've been at least on the curve with others and we want to hope to accelerate that. And so we appointed new Vice President of Sustainability this year. It's obviously a focus for our Board of Directors and for our management team. And as we've said all along, we don't do it in response to legislative mandates. Of course, we comply with them, but really, we want to get ahead of it because for Carlisle being more energy efficient in our plants facility saves money and benefits the shareholder with higher returns, and applying innovative products that help our customers use less and recycle and make their operations more energy efficient, is just good business for us. And certainly, diversity and inclusion we know benefits the entire workplace for better decision making and things like that. So while there is legislative movement, we think there's also just solid common sense movement from an economic perspective to do these things. You bet. Yes, I mean, it's our best guess right now as to what's going to happen. When we talk about forecasting something like new construction declines for the year, I think obviously, we put that into the equation, we also put in things in an equation like the restocking that did not occur. Last year, we put into that our new products growth in our different platforms. And so I would say that, yes, we've contemplated any modulation and new construction that would occur in 2021. Well, the way I think about it is a little bit more, well, more stability, let's say a little bit, but more stability, more certainty and ability to extend the timeframe on those modulations and pricing that may occur on the spot market on a day to day or week to week or month to month basis. We are a very big consumer of these products we have over the last couple of years. Our team at CCM along with our legal team and our central lead sourcing team have done a great job of going back and leveraging our volumes as well as our long-term relationships and the prospects for new products to put ourselves we think in a better position to have a long-term view as well as setting our pricing parameters around that 90 day target where we have stability through the quarter. And we're as you know -- we're very familiar with what can happen in the spot market. When you reflect back to when we bought a sell, I think we closed and it wasn't a month or two later that forced matures were declared. And while our CCM business and I think this is actually a good comparison, our CCM business, whether those force was yours and didn't see a spike due to the purchasing strategies and contracts we had in place, the SL business got absolutely hammered by that spot price. And I think that's a great example of the difference between how we're buying and the spot price market. Obviously, since then, a sell is now on our type of contract. But I think that's a good example of how CCMs, purchasing strategies, and purchasing and sourcing actions really mitigate a lot of that up and down and fluctuation. That doesn't mean that we're not going to see changes in raw material pricing when they occur, it's just going to be I think, more modulated and we're going to have better control more stability and see it in advance. You bet. Hey, Kevin. Yes, Adam, Kevin, first of all, it's discrete items, right? That's driving our tax rate down in a couple of years, different items coming through and tax planning things that have been done to drive the rate down. The reason it's up in 2021. A couple things going on, you got to remember are a lot of a lot of our international businesses where you might have a lower tax rate relate to the CIT businesses that shrinking and essentially unprofitable now. So, if you just think about most of the profits generated in the US, the US has a 20% 21%, statutory federal rate, you got 3% to 4% of state and local taxes. There's how you got to 25 and that's kind of where most our profit is right now. And we're always going to do our best to bring that down, but based on the visibility we have and what's going on in the world, we think 25 is a good starting point. Yes. Kevin, I don't think anything on the incremental. We talked about our incremental margins on volume upside for a long time, if price costs were guiding flat increment margins are going to be based on the volume and then the same thing for CFT and CBF, we're looking at volume upside, and then CIT it's its way down even lower than it was on breakeven. So expect that to be a tough year for CIT. Yes, I think we laid out some of the markets that we think are going to perform well, when we laid out that idea of more suburbanization, if I can call it that. And I think we'll continue to see that I think the Biden administration in their talks about infrastructure. And obviously, we saw that from the previous administration to the America First, I think there's some ideas that we'll see more infrastructure projects. So when we look to your other question, I'll turn that to Bob. Jeff, what was your first question for Bob again? Yes, balance sheet priorities are always first CapEx and we have some big projects coming in 2021 going up to over $150 million of projects we see coming in most of those being in CCM. So we're pretty happy about that continue to fund our R&D, increase our dividend which we've been doing all along, we would expect to do that again this year for the 45th year. And then finally, we want to have a nice balance between M&A and share repurchases. Synergistic M&A being our priority out of those two. I think the pipeline clearly weakened with 2020 going on and COVID and the disruption we saw, but the pipeline starting to grow again, we see opportunities out there. We're working every day to try make sure we get some good synergistic opportunities. We looked at a lot in 2020 just didn't get a lot closed. So, we're going to continue to be balanced between the two. No, Joel, I think it depends on you know, the segment, I mean, we're still seeing some good opportunities in construction materials. I think maybe even aerospace, we could find a deal, you might find some -- some good deals there in the aerospace business. So we'd still be interested in expanding our content for clients. So we see this down market as an opportunity to perhaps pick up some assets there that ultimately would have some pretty high return for our profiles, and we get them in into the, CIT business and let the team go to work there. I think when you look at things like med tech. Obviously, you have to be a little bit more discriminating. And they have to make sure they're good fits, and we can leverage, you know, infrastructure that we put in place with Providien and that, but I think we could find deals to do for sure. Well, the last deal we saw that was close to our construction materials business had a pretty good multiple on it. So I don't know that size to -- make a difference as just what the asset is, and what the prospects are for the business and the management team and what they've done. So, I tried to give you an answer like that, but I think it just depends, I would say our preference would be for things that were a little bit bigger. We think they bring perhaps more market presence. They integrate better, we could pick up some management talent and things like that. And hopefully, they have some innovative products and maybe some access to Europe or things like that. So there are some definite specific things we're looking for that we think we can leverage, and we'd be willing to pay for. We can break out some of the products, I mean, we can and maybe not on this call, but maybe it's better for a longer conversation around things like new products, we know that IntelliSpray just from the equipment perspective, we think that globally might be $150 million market. We know it's dominated for the most part by one player. We think we offer an alternative there. So, that's a in one product line a 10s of millions of dollar opportunity over a five to seven year time horizon, when we look at what IntelliSpray does for our polyurethane spray foam, that business is more the spray foam business is more than the $100 market. And we think you know that a Carlisle has a very strong market position and can build on that certainly with the combination with equipment can do better. Metals has opportunities that are, architectural metals, insulated panels is an interesting one. There's some other architectural things that you can do on a building that are new from screens and things like that. And we think those are tens of millions of dollar opportunities. The three new locations we put in have had significant market sizes attached to them, again, definitely above $10 million, $20 million there each so. But we'll -- we'll we could follow-up with you. And maybe even on the next call, try to characterize some of those -- Yes. No, it's not all single -- it's not all single ply roofing membranes like we traditionally have here. Joel. Our product line actually in Europe is this resorts its product which is growing at double digits and is a combination of bitumen with EPDM and it's it has a really unique function to it. So that's the roofing space, maybe our total available market and we look at things like sealants and adhesives. We look at our fasteners, we look at edge metals, we look at metal roofing, things like that. So this whole move that CCM made over the last, 5 to 10 years to become, you know more in the building envelope. That's what that opportunity really represents. It's a much bigger opportunity set than just a single ply roofing membrane solution like we would have had back in the 80s. You bet. Joe. Thank you. I think we contemplated in vision 2025, somewhere $2 billion to $3 billion of acquisitions. I think that's good. We put out the $8 billion of sales. And Bob and I even at the time, thought we could do more than that, from a growth perspective. With acquisition, we still feel that way. There's more opportunities that continue to present themselves, I think the bigger focus for us to complete our vision 2025 goal is really to hit that $15 of VPS. And I'm not sure we need to do the same level of acquisitions to get to the $15 VPS. In fact, I think our preference would be to drive our internal organic projects and fund capital expenditures to get that because we know those, as we've seen with CCM over the years, when you do it internally, and you do it organically, and you build that infrastructure, your ROIC gets to those CCM levels of 30%. So I know that maybe confused. But our primary goal and vision 2025 was to $15 a share. And I think, you know, we could probably do less on the maybe the lower end of our original acquisition framework to get there. Yes. I think it's going to be a good -- on the reroofing, I think it's a good story that we still see tight labor markets. We still see a strong demand in the reroofing. Obviously, the inventory build out that didn't occur last year, we characterize that, and that number I gave you, and now we have a year of heightened COVID restrictions. And I'm not even sure any of us really understand how much was delayed because of the protocols in the second quarter and third quarter that a lot of our roofing contractors had to deal with, I know, I'd been out to some job sites where there were, hand sanitizing stations, and social distancing, and masks and which a lot of more worrying anyway, but -- you wonder how much that took out of the productivity of a roofer? And so, I think you just have to think it's got to be something, north of 20% decrease in productivity. And so I think he can figure that it's that that is added to the backlog. And again, as we said, earlier, too, there's just a limited supply of people that can do this, and the demand is there. And so what doesn't get done, you can't defer it you try to get by, but ultimately, you have to do it. I know, here and in Phoenix, the ability to get projects done or even quoted is it's I've never seen anything like it before. I mean, it's just really hard to get a contract or even quote something. So I think it's, as we said, it depends on where you're in the region, it depends on, obviously, in the northern regions, there's more weather and there's less work being done so. It's probably the best they -- Yes. Definitely. And I think it's just supported by we keep referring to some of the graphs, we've shown on reroofing and, and we know the projects that are coming do we referenced the buildings that are 10 to 20 years old, we saw that build out, we got that on the front end, as did our competitors as we built up, and expanded and now these roofs are, coming down and they need to be replaced. And so I would say anything that slows that down, whether it was COVID, or it's whether it adds to the backlog simply because of the constraint on labor. We're just -- can't get through. You bet. Thank you. Thanks, Annie. This concludes our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. I want to thank everybody for your participation, great questions. We appreciate you taking the time. Stay healthy and we look forward to speaking with you at our next earnings call."

With that, I will turn over the call to Chris.\nChris Koch: Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. As we enter the 10th month of operating in this COVID-19 pandemic, I hope everyone out there is healthy and staying safe. I\u2019d like to first say, how proud I am with the Carlisle team and how grateful I am for their continued passion, dedication and commitment to serving our customers, to protect each other that is supporting our communities through these uncertain times. We all know that this virus continues to be a threat to our health and economy and want to assure everyone that safety has and always will be the number one priority at Carlisle. And protecting ourselves and each other against this virus is at the forefront of our thoughts, even more so as the winter and flu seasons approach. If we all do our part, we can help manage this pandemic and get us all back to a healthy and productive state, both in our professional and personal lives. And while being safe and healthy is always our first priority, we also have the commitment to keep all our stakeholders in mind and to deliver on our key objectives, including Vision 2025 and our ESG initiatives. By doing this, we ensure that we will continue to be a positive contributor and long serving member of our communities. Now let\u2019s turn to Sides 3 and 4. While the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our 2020 results, our proactive approach has allowed us to continue to operate at a high level of efficiency and capacity. Our operating income generation and cash position at the end of the third quarter, speak to the hard work, discipline and perseverance of the entire Carlisle team. The same attributes will allow us to further improve the efficiency of our businesses through the Carlisle Operating System to continue to make the investments necessary to deliver a world class Carlisle Experience well into the future and ensure we maintain discipline and rigor in our capital allocation process. When taken with our other initiatives, these actions will provide the horsepower to drive our success in achieving our Vision 2025 goal of $15 of earnings per share. Reinforcing and demonstrating our ability to deliver on this commitment, we have generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow and a 25% CAGR over the last five years ending in 2019 were basically the pre-pandemic period. This track record of success supports our confidence in this team\u2019s ability and capability to execute on the components of Vision 2025, including our capital allocation strategy and to create value through our business model. Our confidence is built on first, the significant and proven annuity contained in the U.S. non-residential reroofing market segment, which is estimated between $5 billion to $6 billion per year today, and growing to approximately $8 billion in the next decade; two, we\u2019re reframing our pricing approach, which since mid-2017 has delivered a new paradigm tied to our enhanced value proposition in the marketplace; three, the financial flexibility to access up to $3 billion for acquisitions; four, operational efficiencies from our culture of continuous improvement; and lastly, the revenue growth opportunities in several key areas, including European construction markets, our medical technologies platform within CIT, highly-engineered fluid technology solutions and aerospace markets returning to pre-COVID levels of demand. Most of all, it\u2019s our belief and our employee\u2019s ability to deliver for Carlisle customers as they have for over 100 years to the improving Carlisle experience that allows us to accelerate through the recovery. Transitioning to our third quarter results. We believe the third quarter reflects the remarkable strength and resilience of the CCM business model and Carlisle\u2019s balance sheet. Carlisle\u2019s cash generating ability ensures that we can continue to invest organically and via acquisitions, particularly in our high growth platforms and building envelope solutions, medical technologies and fluid technologies. Coupled with returning capital to shareholders via dividend increases, which we increased 5% in September the 44th consecutive year of increases and share repurchases, we continue to demonstrate a strong underlying foundation. In the face of the pandemic, our team has taken many proactive steps across our businesses to position Carlisle for an improved 2021 and beyond. We have taken tough but necessary restructuring actions at CIT, including the announced closures of our Mobile, Alabama and Kent, Washington facilities. We also took the difficult actions of reducing head count by approximately 550 employees in our Nogales, Mexico factory and by over 100 employees in our Dunhuang, China aerospace factory. In our other businesses, we continue to optimize our footprint and drive efficiencies to manage costs through the pandemic. At CCM, we reduced shifts starting early in the second quarter. At CBF, we consolidated our Solon, Ohio headquarters into our Medina, Ohio manufacturing facility, and made a lot of other cost reductions at CBF around the globe. Despite challenging dynamics across several markets, I want to be direct in saying, we are facing them head on and absolutely remain committed to and focused on achieving $15 in earnings per share by the end of 2025. Our conviction and our ability to deliver on Vision 2025 is supported by several factors. I\u2019ll start with CCM, which continues to exhibit resilience, and we believe it\u2019s set up extremely well to continue on its path, both attractive, sustainable top line growth and margin improvement. We continue to see sequential improvement in daily sales volumes throughout the third quarter at CCM with September sales ending slightly positive year-over-year for the first time, since the pandemic began. We still foresee a robust and growing reroofing market with positive trends continuing well through 2025, driven by the need for maintaining and aging and continuous cycle of replacement of U.S. roofing infrastructure. This distinction is important as most of CCM sales are largely driven by replacement demand, not new construction. And importantly at times of financial stress are not canceled, but deferred as maintaining a commercial roof is not a discretionary item. Year to date, we have benefited from CCM\u2019s variable cost structure and notably lower input cost versus last year. Due to our size and scale, we believe we have the lowest cost structure in the industry that we create significant value through the Carlisle Experience. And we continue to demonstrate price leadership, connecting pricing to our value proposition. In summary, our commitment is to deliver the right product at the right place at the right time, every time. We\u2019re very pleased with the progress we continue to make on our newer platforms of polyurethane and architectural metals, as well as our specialty roofing materials produced and sold in Europe. Within polyurethane spray foam continues to regain market share notably by a refocus on core customer relationships and launching new differentiated products, all under a new consolidated brand structure. These improvements helped to drive year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter and year-to-date. Architectural metal was a bright spot in the quarter, delivering relatively flat sales in a challenging environment. Architectural metal margins continue to improve with solid progress on integration initiatives. And in Europe, the small to medium-sized roofing market remain steady, supporting overall year-over-year growth in the quarter and year to date. Profitability in Europe continues to improve as well. And we continue to believe that Europe provides an opportunity for meaningful expansion for CCM, and we are committed to taking the necessary steps to ensure that growth potential is realized, despite the headwinds of COVID. We anticipate fourth quarter sales at CCM will grow low single digits barring any weather or COVID related disruptions. Turning to our Interconnect business, as it has been well publicized and as you are all aware, global air travel and aerospace financial health have both been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact on aircraft manufacturers, such as Boeing and Airbus at the momentous, with build rates continuing to decline substantially this quarter. Since the beginning of March, the CIT team has been focused on dealing with the rapid declines and fallout that all suppliers in the area of aerospace industry have felt. Our focus has been on taking actions that will position CIT aerospace to support the strong recovery we anticipate will occur as global air travel returns in the coming years. Despite aggressive action and minimize losses in the near term to right-size our footprint, we continue to invest in new products and capabilities that will enable us to maintain our industry-leading position and exceed our customer expectations, when growth in aircraft production rates resumed. We are maintaining a close eye on our aerospace competitors and remain positioned to be opportunistic, should a strategic and appropriate asset become available. While we all know that the aerospace markets have been significantly impacted by the pandemic, we do remain confident that over time passengers will become comfortable with the safety measures airlines are implementing, and supportive of this TSA passenger screenings have increased dramatically since March, and we believe, it will continue to rise in the fourth quarter. Additionally, recent data show that the risk of transmission of COVID-19 on an aircraft is quite low. We\u2019re also encouraged by the global efforts and progress towards the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, which once deployed should drive passenger confidence and safe travel and accelerate to return to higher levels of passenger miles. And additionally, on a bright note, Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX 8 has been approved for a return to flight by European regulatory bodies and is moving closer to FAA approval. Transitioning to our medical platform within CIT, we entered medical technologies several years ago through the acquisition of LHI, with the concept of leveraging our core wire and cable expertise into the MedTech markets. The acquisitions of MicroConnex, RedGroup and Providien over the last few years contributed significantly to our platform and MedTech remains a key area of focus for both organic investment and bolt-on acquisitions. CIT medical technologies has proven stable in this uncertain environment benefiting from increased demand for COVID-19 related patient monitoring equipment, partially offset by deferred hospital capital investment. Recently acquired Providien, which expanded our component and vertically integrated device solutions capabilities continue to perform well, and integration is on track. In addition, product rationalization actions taken in legacy medical product lines in 2018 and 2019 have improved CIT medical technologies margin profile. Our long-term bullishness on MedTech remains intact and we see CIT revenues trending toward a better balanced and more profitable mix over time. Near term, while CIT medical technologies remains a positive offset to CIT aerospace weakness, we remain watchful of key MedTech demand drivers, such as capital spending in hospitals, elective surgery, and procedure deferrals, particularly in the United States. Taken together, we expect CIT\u2019s revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 to decline approximately 35% versus the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting significant inventories of aircraft in the channel, limited new orders and reduced production rates. At CFT, operating income grew 5% due to solid pricing gains, operational improvements and cost discipline, despite revenues declining 5%. All the pressures from subdued industrial capital expenditures remain. CFT continues to execute on internal initiatives laid out in Vision 2025. Our new technology initiatives can be highlighted by the launch of our market differentiated premium solution for spray foam applications, which gained traction throughout the third quarter. We\u2019re proud to be delivering a spray foam insulation industry first, the combination of application equipment with polyurethane foam material. This combination will allow us to provide the spray foam contractor, builder and homeowner with greater application efficiency, tighter ratio tolerances, and ultimately a better foam insulation product in the wall. We\u2019re also encouraged by our latest strategic acquisitions in sealants and adhesives within CFT, including Ecco, Shinhang, and IDS. This combination of market leaders in specific niche products, coupled with CFT\u2019s legacy products, bring CFT closer to offering a comprehensive sealants and adhesives product portfolio for our global customer base. We\u2019re also extremely proud of the progress CFT made in third quarter, continuing to upgrade the customer experience from our order entry capabilities to our quality and deliver the improvements in all our global locations. We are beginning to see positive signs at CFT end markets, particularly in Asia and Europe, and we\u2019re optimistic. We are past the worst of the COVID-19 impact to our industrial customers. We remain committed to our original long-term margin goal of 20% plus percent for CFT and are confident the multifaceted plans we\u2019ve put in place, including developing and introducing innovative new products, capturing the value of these products and enhanced pricing, applying COS rigorously and maintaining hyper-focus on plant safety, quality, delivery and cost management will result in significant improvements in 2021. We currently expect fourth quarter revenue to decline mid-teens year-over-year, reflecting sequential improvement over the third quarter of 2020, but up against a relatively strong fourth quarter 2019. Turning to CBF. CBF sales were down 9% in the quarter, reflecting the additional impact of the pandemic on top of the multi-year downturn. CBF was already experiencing in the global off-highway vehicle markets and especially expectable COVID related contributing factor to CBS results was similar to CIT, it\u2019s exposure to the aerospace industry where it supplies high margin metallic and carbon aircraft braking products. Significant progress and business improvement actions taken in the past few years in this business, including the Tulsa and Medina plant consolidation, and many new product introductions have not been enough to offset volume declines, especially in the high margin aerospace business. CBF has made substantial progress in lowering its cost base, refining its production processes and reducing its footprint. All actions that will help us reach our targeted margins as demand improves. We believe global demand for CBF products will continue to be pressured in the fourth quarter of 2020. And as such, we expect fourth quarter sales 2020 to be down low single digits. Reflecting on capital deployment, accretive and synergistic acquisitions remain a key pillar of Vision 2025. Despite the temporary impacts of COVID-19, we continue to aggressively track opportunities to deploy capital into our strategic segments of CCM, CIT and CFT with returns in excess of cost of capital as our guide. Our financial strength and cash flow generating capabilities afford us flexibility, and we intend to remain opportunistic. Notably, and as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, when acquisition activity is subdued, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. This is evidenced by our deployment of more than $340 million in share repurchases year-to-date in 2020. And finally, we continue to be relentless in the expansion of our decade plus Carlisle-wide operating system based on the principles of Lean and Six Sigma or COS. COS or the Carlisle Operating System will continue to be a unifying cultural imperative providing an essential tool kit for our businesses to rely on as they seek new opportunities to make our operations and businesses more efficient. In the third quarter, COS once again delivered savings and efficiency gains, this time approximately 1% of sales. This result was a remarkable feat given our very challenging volume environment. And COS has proven to be more than a cost savings program, providing the tools, the training and the clear goals and objectives for our teams to remain focused on quality, safety and delivery in their operations. Bob now will provide operational and financial detail about the third quarter and review the balance sheet and cash flow. Bob?\nBob Roche: Thanks, Chris. Please turn to the revenue bridge on Slide 5 of the presentation. Revenue decreased 12% to $1.1 billion in the third quarter. Organic revenue declined 14.3% and acquisitions contributed 1.9% of sales growth of the quarter and in fact it was about a 40 basis point tailwind. Turning to the margin bridge on Slide 6, Q3 operating margin declined 110 basis points. Pricing and volume headwinds combined for minus 360 basis points and acquisitions were minus 60 basis points, offsetting these freight, labor and raw material and other operating costs netted to a 230 basis point improvement, and COS added 100 basis points, net restructuring and rationalization costs were an additional 20 basis point headwind. On Slide 7, as we do every quarter we provided an EPS bridge. As Chris mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.87, which compares to $2.42 from last year. Volume, price and mix combined were $1.04 year-over-year decrease while tax and interest combined for $0.13 headwind. Restructuring was another $0.04 headwind. Partially offsetting these raw material, freight and labor costs netted to a $0.29 benefit. Share repurchases contributed $0.09 and COS contributed an additional $0.18, lower operating expenditures contributed $0.10. While COVID related volume declines clearly represented the most significant headwind during the quarter, our teams around the world did a commendable job managing costs to help mitigate its impact on bottom line earnings. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 to review the third quarter performance by segment in a little more detail. At CCM, revenues decreased 7.8% driven by volume and net of 30 basis points foreign exchange \u2013 foreign currency translation tailwind. Operating margin at CCM was 22% in the quarter, a 260 basis point improvement over last year, driven by favorable raw materials, lower SG&A and COS, partially offsetting this were volume declines and wage inflation. CCM executed well in delivering approximately $25 million of net price cost realization in the quarter. And we now anticipate full year net price cost realization of approximately $70 million for 2020. Turn now to Slide 9 to review CIT\u2019s results, CIT revenue declined 30.3% in the quarter. As Chris talked about earlier, this decline was driven by the crisis in commercial aerospace markets partially offset by positive trends in our Medical Technologies platform. CIT\u2019s operating margin declined significantly year-over-year to negative 2.2% driven by commercial aerospace volume declines and accelerated restructuring actions. These were offset partially by savings from COS, lower SG&A and some price increases. Turning to Slide 10, CFT sales declined 5.1% year-over-year. Organic revenue declined 10.8% and acquisitions added 4.4% in the quarter. Despite the sales decline and related deleverage, operating income at CFT increased 5% year-over-year with operating margin improving 70 basis points to 6.8%. This was driven by price realization, efficiencies from COS and lower SG&A. Turning now to Slide 11 for CBS, CBS third quarter organic revenue declined 10.8%, FX had a positive 1.7% impact, operating income was $0.9 million or 1.3% operating margin, driven primarily by volume declines and unfavorable mix in aerospace markets, partially offsetting this was COS efficiencies. On Slide 12 and 13, we show selected balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong and we ended the quarter with $719 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of available \u2013 availability under our revolving credit line. We deployed approximately $150 million in the second quarter, repurchasing 1.2 million shares. And additionally, we increased our dividend in the third quarter, the 44th consecutive year of increases and paid out $28.5 million in September. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner, investing in organic growth through capital expenditures and opportunistically repurchasing shares while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2020 was a solid $367.5 million and we expect Carlisle overall to generate free cash flow conversion in excess of 150% for the full year. Turning to Slide 14, Chris earlier gave fourth quarter revenue guidance referenced here and you can see the items affecting comparability in corporate items. Corporate expense is expected to be approximately $95 million for the full year. We continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $230 million, and for the full year, we continue to invest in our business and now expect CapEx to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $75 million for the year and we expect the tax rate to be approximately 23%. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Chris.\nChris Koch: All right. Thanks, Bob. In closing, I want to once again express my thanks to our dedicated employees, their families and our business partners and all those associated with Carlisle\u2019s success. Simply put, we can\u2019t do without you. With over a century of history, Carlisle has proven to be a resourceful, resilient and stable organization in times of diversity and uncertainty, and remain confident in Carlisle\u2019s outlook supported by our strong financial foundation, cash generating capabilities and unwavering commitment to our Vision 2025 strategic plan. This concludes our formal comments, Rob, we\u2019re now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey, good afternoon, everyone.\nChris Koch: Good afternoon.\nAdam Baumgarten: Just a question on freight, costs have despite pretty meaningfully at least in the spot market and it seems like contract rates are expected to be up in 2021. Can you walk through your exposure to spot versus kind of more contracted rates?\nChris Koch: Yes. Most are freight, most are freight in CCM and a lot of that is contracted. It\u2019s flatbed from our factories out to the job sites. So, we don\u2019t really play that much in the contracted market and it takes time for our contracted folks to get up as quick as the others do. So, we\u2019re not seeing a ton of inflation quite yet, but we expect it to come a little bit next year. And then we\u2019ll...\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay.\nChris Koch: Of course we pass that on in price when we see it go up too much.\nAdam Baumgarten: Got it. Okay. Helpful. And then just in CCM you talked about slightly positive growth on a year-over-year basis in September. Can you give a sense for how that\u2019s kind of trended into October and maybe that forming your 4Q guidance?\nChris Koch: Yes. I think, you\u2019re right on there. I think, we saw things build in the third quarter, September obviously was good considering everything that\u2019s been going on and then we see that carrying into October.\nAdam Baumgarten: Great. Thanks guys.\nChris Koch: Yes.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks for taking my question. So, CCM has not really seen any benefit yet from pent-up demand. So, could you just talk through how we should think about the re-roofing activity that didn\u2019t get done this year? How long can this activity be delayed for?\nChris Koch: Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Saree. I think, it\u2019s one of the great tensions it\u2019s been out there that\u2019s helped us for the last really 10 years drive some big almost close to 10% CAGR in our sales, obviously that includes the acquisition, but the \u2013 we\u2019re really running up against the big stress on the contractor base that we were before which is there are just so many contractors out there that are trained and qualified, I know prior to COVID that was \u2013 in 2019 that was still a big push it was around having these jobs and many delays with weather and anything else that was occurring, how do you get them done and kind of create extra demand and really the constraint is around that contractor base. And now I would say we\u2019re adding into it the whole idea of getting business permits or getting construction permits and things like that through the government agencies that may be adding time by working from home. So, it does continue to build, obviously, you\u2019re going to continue to try to do, what you can to get by. But I think that there is some pressure on getting these things done obviously before the winter season comes in the north and then \u2013 and the spring season with rain in the South and in the East. So, I think, they will be trying everything they can do to get it done and work as much over time as possible. But that demand just will build until we see a break there on construction workers are getting more trained, which I think had some delay here with COVID. So, hopefully, they\u2019ll get through it quickly and we\u2019ll see people want to return to work.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks. And then can you just talk about the outlook for aerospace and how we should think about your growth as the MAX production volumes pick up but maybe there is some headwinds from widebody production.\nChris Koch: Yes. Bob, could talk about the production levels. I\u2019ll just talk about our forecast. We\u2019re still very, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. I saw the CEO of Delta on today talking about the need to be a connected world and the people\u2019s natural tendencies are to wanting to return to business travel to be connected to do things in person to visit family and friends, and I mean we buy and all of that and we believe it, we have seen, as I said in the call or the script there, TSA checkpoint traffic increasing. And I\u2019d say, we\u2019re optimistic that some of the news we\u2019ve seen recently is going to reinforce the fact that airline travel is very safe. I think, I saw something today that the air is changed in the plane every six minutes through HEPA filters and other type of filtration devices. So, I think, it\u2019s just a question of passengers getting comfortable and once we get over that tipping point it should pick up pretty rapidly. And I think also there have been some interesting deals that have been done with different airlines maybe in Europe where regulations are on being a much cleaner airline have occurred or having energy efficiency and we think the new planes that are out there will likely displace some of the old planes that have them be retired. So, again, we\u2019re optimistic about what\u2019s going to start to occur in 2021 and beyond. And then, Bob, you want to talk about production rates on?\nBob Roche: Yes, I mean, from everything we\u2019re seeing and hearing from the two big OEMs, 4Q of 2020 is going to be the lowest build rate period that we\u2019ve seen in a long time. And then that all projected growing from there, including wide bodies. The question comes how quickly does the MAX airplanes that are grounded get put into production and then they need to refill those. We continue to produce them and that\u2019s \u2013 we got a keen eye on that and seeing when that starts coming through and the build rates for the MAX start up again.\nSaree Boroditsky: Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions.\nBob Roche: Yes. You bet, Saree. Thanks.\nChris Koch: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird and the line is open.\nTim Wojs: Hey, gentlemen. Good afternoon.\nChris Koch: Hi, good afternoon.\nTim Wojs: Maybe just on price, how should we think about the potential and I guess your confidence around realizing price next year and volumes here if kind of turned up a little bit, we don\u2019t really have capacity coming on and we are starting to see some cost inflation kind of run through the system. So, I mean, do you think that\u2019s enough for the industry to meaningfully realize price as you look into 2021?\nChris Koch: Well, I think, just looking at the fourth quarter, Tim, I think everything you said is absolutely correct. And we\u2019ve seen with the actions of our competitors and ourselves that the prices are going up and I think that\u2019s actually the organizations getting a little bit ahead of where they would have been usually on price. So that makes me believe we might be flat on price in the fourth quarter. And then I think if demand continues to pick up and we see some \u2013 the increases in costs and rise like we anticipate then I would anticipate there could be at least it sets the stage for what could be a positive price environment in 2021.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay. So, it\u2019s really relying on kind of where volumes trend as we go through the years is...\nChris Koch: Yes, I think so, and I think it depends on \u2013 yes, absolutely, volumes. And as I said, Saree, the whole idea of contractor availability and obviously for us and it\u2019s a little bit different maybe for others, but for us, the value proposition, the Carlisle experience is a premium service people pay for and when demand is high and volumes are high and they need to get at the right place right product right time, obviously it gives us more pricing ability than it does when volumes are down.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay. And then the non-resi roofing market, the $5 billion to $6 billion kind of growing to $8 billion over the intermediate term, I mean, how would you think about the composition there between kind of a reroofing kind of cycle and new construction. I\u2019m just trying to kind of think about how much of that kind of $2 billion to \u2013 call it $2 billion to $3 billion of improvement is really just replacing stuff that\u2019s already in the ground.\nChris Koch: Well, I think it\u2019s all based on that \u2013 if you look at the square footage charts that Bob has put out there, we continue to see square footage rising. I think it\u2019s out there, if anybody who needs it, we can get it to him. So you coupled that, I think you leave the structure the same way with the percentage of new construction related to the reroofing parts. So reroofing is really growing. New construction, we do think will pick up a little bit from where it is. And then there\u2019s a little bit of price in there as well that we think it will be a modest inflation as we go forward over that period. Maybe somewhere \u2013 price out of that might be somewhere in the 1%, 1.5% something like that.\nBob Roche: Yes. Tim, that was largely around all reroofing that we\u2019re commenting on is that\u2019s the annuity that Chris always talked about around the reroofing cycle that\u2019s coming forward. And that chart that\u2019s in our Vision 2025 that shows the next 10 years and I\u2019ll call it the bubble from the Elliott 2000 build cycle that\u2019s going to come through at 2.5% to 3% growth over the next 10 years.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay. Well, appreciate the help guys. Good luck on the rest of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nBryan Blair: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.\nChris Koch: Hey, good afternoon, Bryan.\nBryan Blair: Nice performance from CCM in the third quarter and great to see that business back to at least modest growth in the fourth quarter. I understand \u2013 absolutely, a lot remains fluid in terms of the pandemic and its impact. But assuming we don\u2019t have a crippling second wave following up on some of the other questions here. Is it fair to assume that CCM volume kind of snaps back next year? That seems to the set up today.\nChris Koch: Yes, I think that\u2019s somewhat fair to say. I mean, as Saree pointed out, there\u2019s building demand due to the \u2013 at least in the second quarter, the inability to get on the roofs and some confusion there over what the health practices were and then government offices shutdown and remote working. So I would say that we set up nicely to pick up some of that, if we can. And again, I always say it, but really for us, the constraint is not supplying the materials, it\u2019s the ability for people to get on the roof and put it on. And that\u2019s why weather and these governmental delays around building permits and things like that are so impactful for the people out there in the field. They\u2019re really the ones that set the pace of the work.\nBryan Blair: Understood. And then secondly a simple math, Bob you\u2019re expecting about $10 million in price cost benefits in the fourth quarter. Is that correct?\nBob Roche: Yes. Yes, and remember, volumes are a little lower and we are seeing some cost pressure that\u2019s well publicized in the oil and MDI markets.\nBryan Blair: Got it. And given current visibility, you walked through some of the moving parts here, the offsets. It sounds like a reasonable expectation for early 2021 would be kind of neutral press cost. Is that fair or am I \u2013 you\u2019re not appropriately.\nChris Koch: I think early 2021, we probably won\u2019t want to project out further than that. But I think, yes, as far as, we\u2019re looking here at first Q of 2021 from what we can see, I think that\u2019s fair.\nBob Roche: Everybody announced the pricing thesis and the cost that we have is close as we can see.\nBryan Blair: Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then thinking about CIT conservatively, if we were to assume that third quarter run rate volumes were aerospace launch where the \u2013 go forward for the foreseeable future, given the restructuring that\u2019s ongoing, when you get to the back end of that, what kind of margins could CIT aerospace generate?\nChris Koch: Let me defer that and we\u2019ll get that answer for you. I don\u2019t know that we want to take a quick swig at that. That\u2019s an impactful meaning.\nBob Roche: Yes. And Bryan, we\u2019ve been looking at it in total business rather than the pieces. And clearly, when aerospace even comes back a little, this thing\u2019s going to accelerate because of the costs we took out and the leverage you get off of the sales, but I don\u2019t have it broken out in front of me.\nBryan Blair: Okay. Got it. Then last one, can you walk through CFT\u2019s monthly order or sales? The third quarter result was certainly better than what I was modeling and then the rate that I had early in the quarter. So I\u2019m guessing there was some acceleration but then there seems to not be as much of a seasonal lift as has been there in the past going into the fourth quarter.\nChris Koch: Yes. I think you read it the right way. I\u2019m not going to break down \u2013 yes, I\u2019m not going to break down each month in the third quarter, but I think you\u2019ve got the thing, right. That as you got out of the summer and just like at CCM, as you went into September, you saw things starting to come together from a sales perspective. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unrealistic for anybody considering we were emerging out of this terrible second quarter with a lot of uncertainty and things like that. I think people started to jump back into CapEx purchases and things like that. And then going into the fourth quarter, yes, I mean, last year we had a really robust fourth quarter project driven. And so those projects, as you can imagine with COVID in that they do take some time to put together and to get organized and they just haven\u2019t materialized in the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s really where the impact is as we go into the fourth quarter.\nBryan Blair: Okay. Appreciate all the color.\nChris Koch: You bet. Thanks, Bryan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nGarik Shmois: Hi. Thanks. Just to follow up on the $10 million in price cost benefits in the fourth quarter. Is it fair to assume that it contemplates some of the disruptions that some of the MDI suppliers have announced?\nBob Roche: Yes. We are assuming some price or some costs headwinds falling into there from like I said, the well-publicized increases that have taken.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. Got it. And then just on the SG&A savings that you called out is helping on CCM. Is it possible to quantify how much that\u2019s been and how much is permanent versus how much could come back when demand improves more materially?\nBob Roche: Yes. Yes and I think we talked about this little bit on prior calls. In CCM, while the volumes were down in the second quarter, it was almost all temporary. We didn\u2019t adjust any kind of structural cost in that business. And it goes to the variable cost of that business. Salesforce is variable. A lot of the costs we can get out quickly, but then when volume comes back, you got to put them back. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any structural adjustment to the cost of the business.\nChris Koch: Other than what Bob would say would be the ongoing COS efficiency gains and raw material purchasing gains and things that we do on a normal basis.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. And then just lastly, just on CIT. Just looking at it sequentially, just with the revenue drop of about $15 million from the second quarter to the third quarter, but EBIT was only down about $2 million, so a pretty good sequential profit control. I\u2019m just wondering how to think of that moving into the fourth quarter, not to get too granular, but how should we think about margins in CIT just given the projected revenue drop again in Q4.\nChris Koch: Yes, Garik, we got to remember that there was $3 million less restructuring in Q4 than Q3. So the GAAP dropped, if you factor that and it was bigger than that due to the volume drop through. But also the cost management is coming in, and we expect that to continue and we announced the factory closures and things like that. And those take some time, especially the Washington want to come through. So I mean, again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change drastically and the normal drop through margins will be there on the decline. And then when it comes back, it\u2019ll come back quickly.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. Thanks. And as soon as possible, just to touch on restructuring notes early, but just given the pace of restructuring that you had pulled forward here in 2020, anyway to, to handicap the amount of restructure that we might be looking on 2021?\nChris Koch: Yes. I mean, I\u2019ve been saying for years, it\u2019s probably around $15 million a year, $15 million to $20 million, and we do have that kind of carryover. And as you know, from prior discussions, it is take a long time to close down an aerospace factory because of the approvals of both the FAA and the OEM. So it takes a while to move these things. So that will carry into 2021. So we\u2019d expect to carryover, but somewhere in the $15 million to $20 million range is what we think to that.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. Helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from BMO. Your line is open.\nJoel Tiss: You see a little more sort of the tone in your voice sound a little more positive on European TCM. I wonder if we can just take a minute and get a sense of what\u2019s going on there, because everything else we hear from Europe is a little more muted.\nChris Koch: Yes. It\u2019s been surprising. I\u2019ve been in touch with the CFT teams there. And although, they\u2019re a smaller business, our group in Europe has been somewhat positive and what\u2019s happened and maybe that\u2019s a reflection of coming out of the bad Q2 and what was going on there with the people in Italy and their homes and the Spanish impact from COVID was tough. So maybe it\u2019s just \u2013 they\u2019re out of that, and restaurants are reopened, things like that, but they were upbeat. And then with CCM, we\u2019ve had good sales, which as I said, the underlying demand there has been really good, which has been a little bit of a surprise, but positive. And then we also have made some leadership changes over there that we think are going to really get us onto more of a track that we\u2019ve been in the United States, where we\u2019re looking at filling in some of the niche markets, filling out the portfolio of products we offer to the market and perhaps getting more active in the acquisition space within Europe. So now I think you\u2019re right to pick that up, all the thanks. We do. And I think we\u2019ve always seen Europe is that frontier that was a little bit untapped for Carlisle. And given some of the initiatives we\u2019ve done on energy savings in green and things like that, we\u2019ve been a little bit like getting to that market, where I really think our message will be well received and I think we can build on the good demand we\u2019ve got going on right now.\nJoel Tiss: That\u2019s really good. And then can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment? It sounds like your competitors in CCM are raising prices a little bit and any sense. I know you can never know what everyone else is going to do, but any sense that kind of that environment is going to stay favorable through 2021.\nChris Koch: Well, for sure, for us to see a relatively quick and uniform response to the raw material price increases by all competitors coming out with their price increases really quickly as a group kind of independent, not thinking that it was a reaction to what others were doing, that\u2019s really hardening. And then I do think the pressures on raw materials are going to bolster their resolve to go into 2021, protecting their margins and things like that. And I think that\u2019s understandable, because obviously we\u2019ve got we looked over the resi side and the shingle market is on back order and people are seeing great demand in resi. And I think non-resi when it picks up, is going to be \u2013 have some of the same pricing pressures on labor and things like that too. So I think I do have some confidence that we\u2019ll get some good pricing traction going into 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Just to go back to it earlier, a couple of questions around just the deferral business from 2020 and to 2021. What\u2019s your best estimate of the 2020 dollar value, volume that\u2019s been pushed out into 2021?\nChris Koch: All right, David. I know this is going to be a cop out. I really don\u2019t have an idea because we were really \u2013 I mean, we had a strong 2019, I went into first quarter of or we went into the first quarter of 2020 thinking it might be another record year. And so when you look at how quickly that dropped off and the impact in Q2, I don\u2019t know that I have an estimate for you. I think that when the reroofing side, you can look at Bob\u2019s projections and maybe parse one of that \u2013 one of those years out. But maybe let me \u2013 just big picture $200 million, $300 million maybe. But I mean that\u2019s a guess.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. No, that\u2019s helpful though. Thank you. And then I want you to get to talk about, what you\u2019re seeing in distribution right now, in terms of inventory levels and out the door sales patterns?\nChris Koch: Well, we have seats of breeze of hope with \u2013 I won\u2019t give specific, but with a few distributors having some confidence to put some inventory back in, we did talk in the second quarter, at the end of the second quarter call about the destocking that had occurred there. So I do think there\u2019s a little bit of demand left there that if we went into 2021 with some confidence, we\u2019d see distribution, maybe in the back in the spring usual stocking season, we\u2019ll go back to normal and that\u2019ll certainly help 2021, but we haven\u2019t seen a lot of stock go back into distribution right now. And I think people are obviously, you\u2019re through most of the heavy season here when you start to get into October. And I don\u2019t know anybody that wants to put a lot of inventory and going into Q4 in the winter months. So again, I think we look through the spring and then look to get back on a more normal schedule and add in that inventory that needs to be there.\nBob Roche: Yes. And as you know, most of our products go from our factories to the roof, even if they\u2019re sold through distribution. So they\u2019re not holding a lot of product for us.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. And then what can you say about out the door sales patterns right now? What kind of comp growth you\u2019ve seeing there?\nChris Koch: Probably at distribution?\nDavid MacGregor: Yes.\nChris Koch: Yes. I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t really measure that. I mean to be honest with you, we \u2013 I suppose, you went and talked to our CCM reps, they would might have some idea of that. But we don\u2019t track that at our level. Apologize.\nDavid MacGregor: It\u2019s okay.\nChris Koch: No, from our perspective, though, we\u2019re focused on the slight growth in September and then our few percent growth in Q4, which is consistent with what the market\u2019s taking so.\nBob Roche: And I think, if you think that there\u2019s no inventory in the channel and sales were up in there, a little bit up in September that implies, then that the pass through and the out the door sales are higher.\nDavid MacGregor: All right. Okay. Thanks very much.\nBob Roche: Yes. You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Chris Koch, I turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks.\nChris Koch: Well, thanks Rob. That concludes our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Again, we really appreciate everyone being on the call and your participation. We thank you for all the questions. We hope everybody stays safe and healthy as a journey through this fourth quarter. And we\u2019ll look forward to speaking with you at our next earnings call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bob Roche",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Please turn to the revenue bridge on Slide 5 of the presentation. Revenue decreased 12% to $1.1 billion in the third quarter. Organic revenue declined 14.3% and acquisitions contributed 1.9% of sales growth of the quarter and in fact it was about a 40 basis point tailwind. Turning to the margin bridge on Slide 6, Q3 operating margin declined 110 basis points. Pricing and volume headwinds combined for minus 360 basis points and acquisitions were minus 60 basis points, offsetting these freight, labor and raw material and other operating costs netted to a 230 basis point improvement, and COS added 100 basis points, net restructuring and rationalization costs were an additional 20 basis point headwind. On Slide 7, as we do every quarter we provided an EPS bridge. As Chris mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.87, which compares to $2.42 from last year. Volume, price and mix combined were $1.04 year-over-year decrease while tax and interest combined for $0.13 headwind. Restructuring was another $0.04 headwind. Partially offsetting these raw material, freight and labor costs netted to a $0.29 benefit. Share repurchases contributed $0.09 and COS contributed an additional $0.18, lower operating expenditures contributed $0.10. While COVID related volume declines clearly represented the most significant headwind during the quarter, our teams around the world did a commendable job managing costs to help mitigate its impact on bottom line earnings. Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review the third quarter performance by segment in a little more detail. At CCM, revenues decreased 7.8% driven by volume and net of 30 basis points foreign exchange \u2013 foreign currency translation tailwind. Operating margin at CCM was 22% in the quarter, a 260 basis point improvement over last year, driven by favorable raw materials, lower SG&A and COS, partially offsetting this were volume declines and wage inflation. CCM executed well in delivering approximately $25 million of net price cost realization in the quarter. And we now anticipate full year net price cost realization of approximately $70 million for 2020. Turn now to Slide 9 to review CIT's results, CIT revenue declined 30.3% in the quarter. As Chris talked about earlier, this decline was driven by the crisis in commercial aerospace markets partially offset by positive trends in our Medical Technologies platform. CIT's operating margin declined significantly year-over-year to negative 2.2% driven by commercial aerospace volume declines and accelerated restructuring actions. These were offset partially by savings from COS, lower SG&A and some price increases. Turning to Slide 10, CFT sales declined 5.1% year-over-year. Organic revenue declined 10.8% and acquisitions added 4.4% in the quarter. Despite the sales decline and related deleverage, operating income at CFT increased 5% year-over-year with operating margin improving 70 basis points to 6.8%. This was driven by price realization, efficiencies from COS and lower SG&A. Turning now to Slide 11 for CBS, CBS third quarter organic revenue declined 10.8%, FX had a positive 1.7% impact, operating income was $0.9 million or 1.3% operating margin, driven primarily by volume declines and unfavorable mix in aerospace markets, partially offsetting this was COS efficiencies. On Slide 12 and 13, we show selected balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong and we ended the quarter with $719 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of available \u2013 availability under our revolving credit line. We deployed approximately $150 million in the second quarter, repurchasing 1.2 million shares. And additionally, we increased our dividend in the third quarter, the 44th consecutive year of increases and paid out $28.5 million in September. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner, investing in organic growth through capital expenditures and opportunistically repurchasing shares while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2020 was a solid $367.5 million and we expect Carlisle overall to generate free cash flow conversion in excess of 150% for the full year. Turning to Slide 14, Chris earlier gave fourth quarter revenue guidance referenced here and you can see the items affecting comparability in corporate items. Corporate expense is expected to be approximately $95 million for the full year. We continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $230 million, and for the full year, we continue to invest in our business and now expect CapEx to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $75 million for the year and we expect the tax rate to be approximately 23%. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Chris. Yes, I mean, from everything we're seeing and hearing from the two big OEMs, 4Q of 2020 is going to be the lowest build rate period that we've seen in a long time. And then that all projected growing from there, including wide bodies. The question comes how quickly does the MAX airplanes that are grounded get put into production and then they need to refill those. We continue to produce them and that's \u2013 we got a keen eye on that and seeing when that starts coming through and the build rates for the MAX start up again. Yes. You bet, Saree. Thanks. Yes. Tim, that was largely around all reroofing that we're commenting on is that's the annuity that Chris always talked about around the reroofing cycle that's coming forward. And that chart that's in our Vision 2025 that shows the next 10 years and I'll call it the bubble from the Elliott 2000 build cycle that's going to come through at 2.5% to 3% growth over the next 10 years. Yes. Yes, and remember, volumes are a little lower and we are seeing some cost pressure that's well publicized in the oil and MDI markets. Everybody announced the pricing thesis and the cost that we have is close as we can see. Yes. And Bryan, we've been looking at it in total business rather than the pieces. And clearly, when aerospace even comes back a little, this thing's going to accelerate because of the costs we took out and the leverage you get off of the sales, but I don't have it broken out in front of me. Yes. We are assuming some price or some costs headwinds falling into there from like I said, the well-publicized increases that have taken. Yes. Yes and I think we talked about this little bit on prior calls. In CCM, while the volumes were down in the second quarter, it was almost all temporary. We didn't adjust any kind of structural cost in that business. And it goes to the variable cost of that business. Salesforce is variable. A lot of the costs we can get out quickly, but then when volume comes back, you got to put them back. So I don't think there's been any structural adjustment to the cost of the business. Yes. And as you know, most of our products go from our factories to the roof, even if they're sold through distribution. So they're not holding a lot of product for us. And I think, if you think that there's no inventory in the channel and sales were up in there, a little bit up in September that implies, then that the pass through and the out the door sales are higher. Yes. You're welcome."

            "name": "Chris Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. As we enter the 10th month of operating in this COVID-19 pandemic, I hope everyone out there is healthy and staying safe. I'd like to first say, how proud I am with the Carlisle team and how grateful I am for their continued passion, dedication and commitment to serving our customers, to protect each other that is supporting our communities through these uncertain times. We all know that this virus continues to be a threat to our health and economy and want to assure everyone that safety has and always will be the number one priority at Carlisle. And protecting ourselves and each other against this virus is at the forefront of our thoughts, even more so as the winter and flu seasons approach. If we all do our part, we can help manage this pandemic and get us all back to a healthy and productive state, both in our professional and personal lives. And while being safe and healthy is always our first priority, we also have the commitment to keep all our stakeholders in mind and to deliver on our key objectives, including Vision 2025 and our ESG initiatives. By doing this, we ensure that we will continue to be a positive contributor and long serving member of our communities. Now let's turn to Sides 3 and 4. While the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our 2020 results, our proactive approach has allowed us to continue to operate at a high level of efficiency and capacity. Our operating income generation and cash position at the end of the third quarter, speak to the hard work, discipline and perseverance of the entire Carlisle team. The same attributes will allow us to further improve the efficiency of our businesses through the Carlisle Operating System to continue to make the investments necessary to deliver a world class Carlisle Experience well into the future and ensure we maintain discipline and rigor in our capital allocation process. When taken with our other initiatives, these actions will provide the horsepower to drive our success in achieving our Vision 2025 goal of $15 of earnings per share. Reinforcing and demonstrating our ability to deliver on this commitment, we have generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow and a 25% CAGR over the last five years ending in 2019 were basically the pre-pandemic period. This track record of success supports our confidence in this team's ability and capability to execute on the components of Vision 2025, including our capital allocation strategy and to create value through our business model. Our confidence is built on first, the significant and proven annuity contained in the U.S. non-residential reroofing market segment, which is estimated between $5 billion to $6 billion per year today, and growing to approximately $8 billion in the next decade; two, we're reframing our pricing approach, which since mid-2017 has delivered a new paradigm tied to our enhanced value proposition in the marketplace; three, the financial flexibility to access up to $3 billion for acquisitions; four, operational efficiencies from our culture of continuous improvement; and lastly, the revenue growth opportunities in several key areas, including European construction markets, our medical technologies platform within CIT, highly-engineered fluid technology solutions and aerospace markets returning to pre-COVID levels of demand. Most of all, it's our belief and our employee's ability to deliver for Carlisle customers as they have for over 100 years to the improving Carlisle experience that allows us to accelerate through the recovery. Transitioning to our third quarter results. We believe the third quarter reflects the remarkable strength and resilience of the CCM business model and Carlisle's balance sheet. Carlisle's cash generating ability ensures that we can continue to invest organically and via acquisitions, particularly in our high growth platforms and building envelope solutions, medical technologies and fluid technologies. Coupled with returning capital to shareholders via dividend increases, which we increased 5% in September the 44th consecutive year of increases and share repurchases, we continue to demonstrate a strong underlying foundation. In the face of the pandemic, our team has taken many proactive steps across our businesses to position Carlisle for an improved 2021 and beyond. We have taken tough but necessary restructuring actions at CIT, including the announced closures of our Mobile, Alabama and Kent, Washington facilities. We also took the difficult actions of reducing head count by approximately 550 employees in our Nogales, Mexico factory and by over 100 employees in our Dunhuang, China aerospace factory. In our other businesses, we continue to optimize our footprint and drive efficiencies to manage costs through the pandemic. At CCM, we reduced shifts starting early in the second quarter. At CBF, we consolidated our Solon, Ohio headquarters into our Medina, Ohio manufacturing facility, and made a lot of other cost reductions at CBF around the globe. Despite challenging dynamics across several markets, I want to be direct in saying, we are facing them head on and absolutely remain committed to and focused on achieving $15 in earnings per share by the end of 2025. Our conviction and our ability to deliver on Vision 2025 is supported by several factors. I'll start with CCM, which continues to exhibit resilience, and we believe it's set up extremely well to continue on its path, both attractive, sustainable top line growth and margin improvement. We continue to see sequential improvement in daily sales volumes throughout the third quarter at CCM with September sales ending slightly positive year-over-year for the first time, since the pandemic began. We still foresee a robust and growing reroofing market with positive trends continuing well through 2025, driven by the need for maintaining and aging and continuous cycle of replacement of U.S. roofing infrastructure. This distinction is important as most of CCM sales are largely driven by replacement demand, not new construction. And importantly at times of financial stress are not canceled, but deferred as maintaining a commercial roof is not a discretionary item. Year to date, we have benefited from CCM's variable cost structure and notably lower input cost versus last year. Due to our size and scale, we believe we have the lowest cost structure in the industry that we create significant value through the Carlisle Experience. And we continue to demonstrate price leadership, connecting pricing to our value proposition. In summary, our commitment is to deliver the right product at the right place at the right time, every time. We're very pleased with the progress we continue to make on our newer platforms of polyurethane and architectural metals, as well as our specialty roofing materials produced and sold in Europe. Within polyurethane spray foam continues to regain market share notably by a refocus on core customer relationships and launching new differentiated products, all under a new consolidated brand structure. These improvements helped to drive year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter and year-to-date. Architectural metal was a bright spot in the quarter, delivering relatively flat sales in a challenging environment. Architectural metal margins continue to improve with solid progress on integration initiatives. And in Europe, the small to medium-sized roofing market remain steady, supporting overall year-over-year growth in the quarter and year to date. Profitability in Europe continues to improve as well. And we continue to believe that Europe provides an opportunity for meaningful expansion for CCM, and we are committed to taking the necessary steps to ensure that growth potential is realized, despite the headwinds of COVID. We anticipate fourth quarter sales at CCM will grow low single digits barring any weather or COVID related disruptions. Turning to our Interconnect business, as it has been well publicized and as you are all aware, global air travel and aerospace financial health have both been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact on aircraft manufacturers, such as Boeing and Airbus at the momentous, with build rates continuing to decline substantially this quarter. Since the beginning of March, the CIT team has been focused on dealing with the rapid declines and fallout that all suppliers in the area of aerospace industry have felt. Our focus has been on taking actions that will position CIT aerospace to support the strong recovery we anticipate will occur as global air travel returns in the coming years. Despite aggressive action and minimize losses in the near term to right-size our footprint, we continue to invest in new products and capabilities that will enable us to maintain our industry-leading position and exceed our customer expectations, when growth in aircraft production rates resumed. We are maintaining a close eye on our aerospace competitors and remain positioned to be opportunistic, should a strategic and appropriate asset become available. While we all know that the aerospace markets have been significantly impacted by the pandemic, we do remain confident that over time passengers will become comfortable with the safety measures airlines are implementing, and supportive of this TSA passenger screenings have increased dramatically since March, and we believe, it will continue to rise in the fourth quarter. Additionally, recent data show that the risk of transmission of COVID-19 on an aircraft is quite low. We're also encouraged by the global efforts and progress towards the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, which once deployed should drive passenger confidence and safe travel and accelerate to return to higher levels of passenger miles. And additionally, on a bright note, Boeing's 737 MAX 8 has been approved for a return to flight by European regulatory bodies and is moving closer to FAA approval. Transitioning to our medical platform within CIT, we entered medical technologies several years ago through the acquisition of LHI, with the concept of leveraging our core wire and cable expertise into the MedTech markets. The acquisitions of MicroConnex, RedGroup and Providien over the last few years contributed significantly to our platform and MedTech remains a key area of focus for both organic investment and bolt-on acquisitions. CIT medical technologies has proven stable in this uncertain environment benefiting from increased demand for COVID-19 related patient monitoring equipment, partially offset by deferred hospital capital investment. Recently acquired Providien, which expanded our component and vertically integrated device solutions capabilities continue to perform well, and integration is on track. In addition, product rationalization actions taken in legacy medical product lines in 2018 and 2019 have improved CIT medical technologies margin profile. Our long-term bullishness on MedTech remains intact and we see CIT revenues trending toward a better balanced and more profitable mix over time. Near term, while CIT medical technologies remains a positive offset to CIT aerospace weakness, we remain watchful of key MedTech demand drivers, such as capital spending in hospitals, elective surgery, and procedure deferrals, particularly in the United States. Taken together, we expect CIT's revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 to decline approximately 35% versus the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting significant inventories of aircraft in the channel, limited new orders and reduced production rates. At CFT, operating income grew 5% due to solid pricing gains, operational improvements and cost discipline, despite revenues declining 5%. All the pressures from subdued industrial capital expenditures remain. CFT continues to execute on internal initiatives laid out in Vision 2025. Our new technology initiatives can be highlighted by the launch of our market differentiated premium solution for spray foam applications, which gained traction throughout the third quarter. We're proud to be delivering a spray foam insulation industry first, the combination of application equipment with polyurethane foam material. This combination will allow us to provide the spray foam contractor, builder and homeowner with greater application efficiency, tighter ratio tolerances, and ultimately a better foam insulation product in the wall. We're also encouraged by our latest strategic acquisitions in sealants and adhesives within CFT, including Ecco, Shinhang, and IDS. This combination of market leaders in specific niche products, coupled with CFT's legacy products, bring CFT closer to offering a comprehensive sealants and adhesives product portfolio for our global customer base. We're also extremely proud of the progress CFT made in third quarter, continuing to upgrade the customer experience from our order entry capabilities to our quality and deliver the improvements in all our global locations. We are beginning to see positive signs at CFT end markets, particularly in Asia and Europe, and we're optimistic. We are past the worst of the COVID-19 impact to our industrial customers. We remain committed to our original long-term margin goal of 20% plus percent for CFT and are confident the multifaceted plans we've put in place, including developing and introducing innovative new products, capturing the value of these products and enhanced pricing, applying COS rigorously and maintaining hyper-focus on plant safety, quality, delivery and cost management will result in significant improvements in 2021. We currently expect fourth quarter revenue to decline mid-teens year-over-year, reflecting sequential improvement over the third quarter of 2020, but up against a relatively strong fourth quarter 2019. Turning to CBF. CBF sales were down 9% in the quarter, reflecting the additional impact of the pandemic on top of the multi-year downturn. CBF was already experiencing in the global off-highway vehicle markets and especially expectable COVID related contributing factor to CBS results was similar to CIT, it's exposure to the aerospace industry where it supplies high margin metallic and carbon aircraft braking products. Significant progress and business improvement actions taken in the past few years in this business, including the Tulsa and Medina plant consolidation, and many new product introductions have not been enough to offset volume declines, especially in the high margin aerospace business. CBF has made substantial progress in lowering its cost base, refining its production processes and reducing its footprint. All actions that will help us reach our targeted margins as demand improves. We believe global demand for CBF products will continue to be pressured in the fourth quarter of 2020. And as such, we expect fourth quarter sales 2020 to be down low single digits. Reflecting on capital deployment, accretive and synergistic acquisitions remain a key pillar of Vision 2025. Despite the temporary impacts of COVID-19, we continue to aggressively track opportunities to deploy capital into our strategic segments of CCM, CIT and CFT with returns in excess of cost of capital as our guide. Our financial strength and cash flow generating capabilities afford us flexibility, and we intend to remain opportunistic. Notably, and as we've discussed in the past, when acquisition activity is subdued, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. This is evidenced by our deployment of more than $340 million in share repurchases year-to-date in 2020. And finally, we continue to be relentless in the expansion of our decade plus Carlisle-wide operating system based on the principles of Lean and Six Sigma or COS. COS or the Carlisle Operating System will continue to be a unifying cultural imperative providing an essential tool kit for our businesses to rely on as they seek new opportunities to make our operations and businesses more efficient. In the third quarter, COS once again delivered savings and efficiency gains, this time approximately 1% of sales. This result was a remarkable feat given our very challenging volume environment. And COS has proven to be more than a cost savings program, providing the tools, the training and the clear goals and objectives for our teams to remain focused on quality, safety and delivery in their operations. Bob now will provide operational and financial detail about the third quarter and review the balance sheet and cash flow. Bob? All right. Thanks, Bob. In closing, I want to once again express my thanks to our dedicated employees, their families and our business partners and all those associated with Carlisle's success. Simply put, we can't do without you. With over a century of history, Carlisle has proven to be a resourceful, resilient and stable organization in times of diversity and uncertainty, and remain confident in Carlisle's outlook supported by our strong financial foundation, cash generating capabilities and unwavering commitment to our Vision 2025 strategic plan. This concludes our formal comments, Rob, we're now ready for questions. Good afternoon. Yes. Most are freight, most are freight in CCM and a lot of that is contracted. It's flatbed from our factories out to the job sites. So, we don't really play that much in the contracted market and it takes time for our contracted folks to get up as quick as the others do. So, we're not seeing a ton of inflation quite yet, but we expect it to come a little bit next year. And then we'll... Of course we pass that on in price when we see it go up too much. Yes. I think, you're right on there. I think, we saw things build in the third quarter, September obviously was good considering everything that's been going on and then we see that carrying into October. Yes. Yes, it's a good question, Saree. I think, it's one of the great tensions it's been out there that's helped us for the last really 10 years drive some big almost close to 10% CAGR in our sales, obviously that includes the acquisition, but the \u2013 we're really running up against the big stress on the contractor base that we were before which is there are just so many contractors out there that are trained and qualified, I know prior to COVID that was \u2013 in 2019 that was still a big push it was around having these jobs and many delays with weather and anything else that was occurring, how do you get them done and kind of create extra demand and really the constraint is around that contractor base. And now I would say we're adding into it the whole idea of getting business permits or getting construction permits and things like that through the government agencies that may be adding time by working from home. So, it does continue to build, obviously, you're going to continue to try to do, what you can to get by. But I think that there is some pressure on getting these things done obviously before the winter season comes in the north and then \u2013 and the spring season with rain in the South and in the East. So, I think, they will be trying everything they can do to get it done and work as much over time as possible. But that demand just will build until we see a break there on construction workers are getting more trained, which I think had some delay here with COVID. So, hopefully, they'll get through it quickly and we'll see people want to return to work. Yes. Bob, could talk about the production levels. I'll just talk about our forecast. We're still very, I'd say, we're cautiously optimistic. I saw the CEO of Delta on today talking about the need to be a connected world and the people's natural tendencies are to wanting to return to business travel to be connected to do things in person to visit family and friends, and I mean we buy and all of that and we believe it, we have seen, as I said in the call or the script there, TSA checkpoint traffic increasing. And I'd say, we're optimistic that some of the news we've seen recently is going to reinforce the fact that airline travel is very safe. I think, I saw something today that the air is changed in the plane every six minutes through HEPA filters and other type of filtration devices. So, I think, it's just a question of passengers getting comfortable and once we get over that tipping point it should pick up pretty rapidly. And I think also there have been some interesting deals that have been done with different airlines maybe in Europe where regulations are on being a much cleaner airline have occurred or having energy efficiency and we think the new planes that are out there will likely displace some of the old planes that have them be retired. So, again, we're optimistic about what's going to start to occur in 2021 and beyond. And then, Bob, you want to talk about production rates on? Thank you. Hi, good afternoon. Well, I think, just looking at the fourth quarter, Tim, I think everything you said is absolutely correct. And we've seen with the actions of our competitors and ourselves that the prices are going up and I think that's actually the organizations getting a little bit ahead of where they would have been usually on price. So that makes me believe we might be flat on price in the fourth quarter. And then I think if demand continues to pick up and we see some \u2013 the increases in costs and rise like we anticipate then I would anticipate there could be at least it sets the stage for what could be a positive price environment in 2021. Yes, I think so, and I think it depends on \u2013 yes, absolutely, volumes. And as I said, Saree, the whole idea of contractor availability and obviously for us and it's a little bit different maybe for others, but for us, the value proposition, the Carlisle experience is a premium service people pay for and when demand is high and volumes are high and they need to get at the right place right product right time, obviously it gives us more pricing ability than it does when volumes are down. Well, I think it's all based on that \u2013 if you look at the square footage charts that Bob has put out there, we continue to see square footage rising. I think it's out there, if anybody who needs it, we can get it to him. So you coupled that, I think you leave the structure the same way with the percentage of new construction related to the reroofing parts. So reroofing is really growing. New construction, we do think will pick up a little bit from where it is. And then there's a little bit of price in there as well that we think it will be a modest inflation as we go forward over that period. Maybe somewhere \u2013 price out of that might be somewhere in the 1%, 1.5% something like that. Hey, good afternoon, Bryan. Yes, I think that's somewhat fair to say. I mean, as Saree pointed out, there's building demand due to the \u2013 at least in the second quarter, the inability to get on the roofs and some confusion there over what the health practices were and then government offices shutdown and remote working. So I would say that we set up nicely to pick up some of that, if we can. And again, I always say it, but really for us, the constraint is not supplying the materials, it's the ability for people to get on the roof and put it on. And that's why weather and these governmental delays around building permits and things like that are so impactful for the people out there in the field. They're really the ones that set the pace of the work. I think early 2021, we probably won't want to project out further than that. But I think, yes, as far as, we're looking here at first Q of 2021 from what we can see, I think that's fair. Let me defer that and we'll get that answer for you. I don't know that we want to take a quick swig at that. That's an impactful meaning. Yes. I think you read it the right way. I'm not going to break down \u2013 yes, I'm not going to break down each month in the third quarter, but I think you've got the thing, right. That as you got out of the summer and just like at CCM, as you went into September, you saw things starting to come together from a sales perspective. And I don't think that's unrealistic for anybody considering we were emerging out of this terrible second quarter with a lot of uncertainty and things like that. I think people started to jump back into CapEx purchases and things like that. And then going into the fourth quarter, yes, I mean, last year we had a really robust fourth quarter project driven. And so those projects, as you can imagine with COVID in that they do take some time to put together and to get organized and they just haven't materialized in the fourth quarter. And that's really where the impact is as we go into the fourth quarter. You bet. Thanks, Bryan. Other than what Bob would say would be the ongoing COS efficiency gains and raw material purchasing gains and things that we do on a normal basis. Yes, Garik, we got to remember that there was $3 million less restructuring in Q4 than Q3. So the GAAP dropped, if you factor that and it was bigger than that due to the volume drop through. But also the cost management is coming in, and we expect that to continue and we announced the factory closures and things like that. And those take some time, especially the Washington want to come through. So I mean, again, I don't think it's going to change drastically and the normal drop through margins will be there on the decline. And then when it comes back, it'll come back quickly. Yes. I mean, I've been saying for years, it's probably around $15 million a year, $15 million to $20 million, and we do have that kind of carryover. And as you know, from prior discussions, it is take a long time to close down an aerospace factory because of the approvals of both the FAA and the OEM. So it takes a while to move these things. So that will carry into 2021. So we'd expect to carryover, but somewhere in the $15 million to $20 million range is what we think to that. Yes. It's been surprising. I've been in touch with the CFT teams there. And although, they're a smaller business, our group in Europe has been somewhat positive and what's happened and maybe that's a reflection of coming out of the bad Q2 and what was going on there with the people in Italy and their homes and the Spanish impact from COVID was tough. So maybe it's just \u2013 they're out of that, and restaurants are reopened, things like that, but they were upbeat. And then with CCM, we've had good sales, which as I said, the underlying demand there has been really good, which has been a little bit of a surprise, but positive. And then we also have made some leadership changes over there that we think are going to really get us onto more of a track that we've been in the United States, where we're looking at filling in some of the niche markets, filling out the portfolio of products we offer to the market and perhaps getting more active in the acquisition space within Europe. So now I think you're right to pick that up, all the thanks. We do. And I think we've always seen Europe is that frontier that was a little bit untapped for Carlisle. And given some of the initiatives we've done on energy savings in green and things like that, we've been a little bit like getting to that market, where I really think our message will be well received and I think we can build on the good demand we've got going on right now. Well, for sure, for us to see a relatively quick and uniform response to the raw material price increases by all competitors coming out with their price increases really quickly as a group kind of independent, not thinking that it was a reaction to what others were doing, that's really hardening. And then I do think the pressures on raw materials are going to bolster their resolve to go into 2021, protecting their margins and things like that. And I think that's understandable, because obviously we've got we looked over the resi side and the shingle market is on back order and people are seeing great demand in resi. And I think non-resi when it picks up, is going to be \u2013 have some of the same pricing pressures on labor and things like that too. So I think I do have some confidence that we'll get some good pricing traction going into 2021. All right, David. I know this is going to be a cop out. I really don't have an idea because we were really \u2013 I mean, we had a strong 2019, I went into first quarter of or we went into the first quarter of 2020 thinking it might be another record year. And so when you look at how quickly that dropped off and the impact in Q2, I don't know that I have an estimate for you. I think that when the reroofing side, you can look at Bob's projections and maybe parse one of that \u2013 one of those years out. But maybe let me \u2013 just big picture $200 million, $300 million maybe. But I mean that's a guess. Well, we have seats of breeze of hope with \u2013 I won't give specific, but with a few distributors having some confidence to put some inventory back in, we did talk in the second quarter, at the end of the second quarter call about the destocking that had occurred there. So I do think there's a little bit of demand left there that if we went into 2021 with some confidence, we'd see distribution, maybe in the back in the spring usual stocking season, we'll go back to normal and that'll certainly help 2021, but we haven't seen a lot of stock go back into distribution right now. And I think people are obviously, you're through most of the heavy season here when you start to get into October. And I don't know anybody that wants to put a lot of inventory and going into Q4 in the winter months. So again, I think we look through the spring and then look to get back on a more normal schedule and add in that inventory that needs to be there. Probably at distribution? Yes. I don't \u2013 we don't really measure that. I mean to be honest with you, we \u2013 I suppose, you went and talked to our CCM reps, they would might have some idea of that. But we don't track that at our level. Apologize. No, from our perspective, though, we're focused on the slight growth in September and then our few percent growth in Q4, which is consistent with what the market's taking so. Well, thanks Rob. That concludes our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Again, we really appreciate everyone being on the call and your participation. We thank you for all the questions. We hope everybody stays safe and healthy as a journey through this fourth quarter. And we'll look forward to speaking with you at our next earnings call. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Giannakouros, Carlisle's Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Jim, please go ahead.\nJames Giannakouros: Thank you, Josh. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Carlisle's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We released our second quarter financial results after the market closed today. And you can find both our press release and earnings call slide presentation on our website at www.carlisle.com in the Investor Relations section. On the call with me today are Chris Koch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Roche, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will begin with Chris discussing business trends experienced during the second quarter and provide context around our confidence in achieving Vision 2025. Bob will discuss Carlisle's second quarter performance and current financial position. Following Chris and Bob's remarks, we will open up the line for questions. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that certain statements made during this call may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from our expectations due to a number of factors, including impacts from COVID-19. A discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our results are provided in our press release, and in our SEC filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Those considering investing in Carlisle should read these statements carefully and review reports we file with the SEC before making an investment decision. With that, I turn over the call to Chris.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Please refer to Slides 3, 4, and 5 for these opening comments. I'd like to begin by saying how proud I am of Carlisle's global team and their perseverance and ability to execute in these uncertain times. Carlisle's employees have rallied around each other, our customers and their communities by supporting critical infrastructure, continuing to operate our factories and distribution centers at a high level despite limitations, borne out of adherence to rigorous global health and safety guidelines, all the while remaining supportive and positive contributors to their families and local communities. Their dedication to a safe work and home environment is commendable. As I mentioned in the press release, while overall infections in our global organization have remained low, we are saddened as we reflect on the loss of three Carlisle family members to the virus. Maria, Roy, Gilberto, they will be missed. And as with any loss at Carlisle, we are all affected, and we all wish their families the best as they grieve their loss. I cannot leave this subject without also stating as I have done through my weekly correspondence with our global employees since the start of the pandemic that the reality is that this virus is a serious threat to our health and our economy, and that our efforts to protect ourselves and each other must have the highest of priorities. I would like to now transition to the second quarter results. As we review the results, I want to reiterate that Carlisle has been deeply impacted by the virus in many ways, but we are fortunate to have a strong and solid foundation as a company. Throughout the second quarter, our businesses remained in operation as they were deemed essential, which we view as evidence of the importance of our products and the employees who design and produce them. We took pride in keeping layoffs and reduced hours to a minimum, which helped provide the uninterrupted service to our customers that they have come to rely on and allowed us to continue our progress on key initiatives related to Vision 2025. However, we did take actions that resulted in reductions to our global workforce in the quarter, most particularly in the United States. While the second quarter certainly was challenging, we are pleased with the resilience of the CCM business model, enabling Carlisle to weather a potentially prolonged economic downturn and allowing us to continue to invest in our high growth platforms of architectural metals, polyurethanes, medical technologies and fluid technologies, which will enable us to emerge out of the pandemic with strong growth prospects. We remain committed to emerging from the current market challenges in a strong financial position enable to leverage that financial position into future growth and earnings in our core businesses. Bob will provide more details later in the call, but I want to touch on some important areas of our current financial position. As of the end of the second quarter, we have $738 million of cash coupled with an untapped $1 billion credit facility. We expect strong free cash flow in 2020 with a conversion rate greater than 125% and fully expect to increase our dividend in September for the 44th consecutive year. Despite the unknown impacts and challenging dynamics of this current situation, I want to be direct in saying we remain absolutely committed to and focused on $15 in earnings per share as contemplated in Vision 2025. Some of the things that reinforced our conviction and our ability to deliver Vision 2025 include the following. CCM is well positioned to exhibit resilience during this global market downturn. We still foresee a robust and growing reroofing market with positive trends continuing well through 2025, driven by the need for maintaining an aging U.S. roofing infrastructure. This distinction is important as most of CCM sales are driven by replacement demand, not new construction. We also anticipate benefiting from CCM's variable cost structure and lower input costs near-term. Due to our size and scale, we believe we have the lowest cost structure in the industry, create the most value through our Carlisle experience and remain the disciplined price leader in the market. CCM status is a best-in-class building envelope solution provider continues to be evidenced through price and market leadership, superior products and service, industry-leading innovation, a strong reroofing backdrop and an operating income profile approaching Vision 2025's targeted 20%. Over 60% of CCM's product is typically shipped directly to the job site and in the second quarter, this percentage increased. As the industry came out of lockdown, the smaller window the contractors had to work with made the efficiency of the Carlisle experience that much more important. We reinforced our commitment to our customers of never failing to deliver the right product at the right place at the right time every time. We remain very pleased with the progress we continue to make on our newer platforms of polyurethane and architectural metals within CCM. Within polyurethanes, spray foam continue to regain significant market share, helping to drive flat year-over-year revenue in the quarter despite the challenging conditions. Architectural metals revenue exceeded overall CCM average percentage sales declines in the quarter. Architectural metals continues to progress on post-acquisition profitability improvements, including significant integration initiatives. Through June and into July at CCM, we continue to see improvement in daily sales volumes that began in May. Provided this trend continues, we anticipate third quarter sales at CCM will decline high-single digits year-over-year, significantly better than the 20% decline during the second quarter of 2020. As expected, CCM's operating income margins of 18.7% during a very challenging second quarter exemplified its profitability resilience and importantly, Carlisle's position in the market-driven by the valued Carlisle experience. As for our interconnect business, coming into the year, 2020 was already forecasted to be significantly burdened by ongoing issue surrounding Boeing 737 MAX, in addition to lower production of other Boeing and Airbus platforms. The emergence of COVID-19 and its impact on airline travel had an almost immediate and substantial effect on both aircraft production and airline investment in existing fleets. In response, our CIT team initiated an acceleration of restructuring actions that will right-size our manufacturing footprint in line with expected demand over the next few years. While CIT's commercial aerospace business as expected declined approximately 50% in the quarter, the team took actions to manage costs, which assisted greatly in delivering only a slight reported operating income loss for the overall division, despite restructuring costs incurred in the quarter. Ongoing actions to restructure and improve the efficiency of our manufacturing footprint over the past few years, combined with the accelerated actions we are currently taking positioned CIT well to suffer minimal losses in the remainder of 2020, despite restructuring costs and once-in-a-lifetime declines in aerospace end markets. Despite aggressive action to maintain profitability, we continue to invest in new products, into talent and into our manufacturing operations to ensure we are maintaining our industry-leading position and are able to execute our customer expectations when production of aircraft resumes. We expect similar year-over-year revenue declines in CIT aerospace for the third quarter as experienced in the second quarter as inventory in the supply chain continues to be worked down and forecast for a recovery in global passenger travel remained muted. Recently, some positive signs have emerged in the aerospace markets. While we all know that the aerospace markets have been significantly impacted by the pandemic, we do remain confident that over time passengers will become comfortable with the safety measures airlines are implementing. And we are also encouraged by recent announcements of the progress towards the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, which once deployed, should accelerate a return to higher levels of air travel. Additionally, Boeing's 737 MAX moved closer to FAA approval with the completion of certification flights on July 1, a key step in returning the aircraft to service. We remain a supplier-of-choice and we will continue to invest in our assets that support the aerospace market. Despite the fact that the agreement with Prysmian to purchase their Fileca business expired in June, we remain committed to strategic acquisitions that broaden our product in geographic breadth, and ultimately will benefit from a resumption of growth in both aircraft build rates and airline spending. To offset commercial aerospace declines, we are seeking new opportunities with space and defense customers, positioning CIT to take advantage of opportunities created by market disruption. The largest offsetting driver at CIT is, however, clearly, its medical technologies platform. We entered the medical technology space several years ago through the acquisition of LHi with the concept of leveraging our core wire and cable expertise into the MedTech markets. We added MicroConnex, RedGroup and Providien in the last two years and MedTech remains a key area of focus for both organic investment and bolt-on acquisitions. Organically, CIT medical technologies grew 15% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by increased demand for COVID-19-related patient monitoring equipment. Recently acquired Providien, which expanded our component and vertically integrated device solution capabilities and along with that new market adjacencies and customers continue to perform well. In addition, product rationalization actions taken in legacy medical product lines in 2018 and 2019 coupled with ongoing COS efforts have improved CIT medical technology margin profiles, which as anticipated will help CIT's overall margin as contemplated in Vision 2025. Our long-term bullishness on MedTech remains intact, and we see CIT's revenues trending towards a better balanced and more profitable mix. Near-term, while CIT medical technologies remains a positive offset to CIT aerospace weakness, we remain watchful of key MedTech demand drivers, such as hospital CapEx, elective surgery and procedure deferrals continue, and particularly in the U.S., they continue. Taken together, we expect third quarter revenue year-over-year declines for CIT overall to be of similar magnitude as reported in the second quarter. Turning to CFT. The impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter exacerbated an already challenging end market demand environment that had been impacted for the past several quarters by the U.S./China trade negotiations and subsequent industrial production slowdowns. While year-over-year revenue declines of over 30% were greater than anticipated and weighed heavily on operating income results, CFT saw improvement each month throughout the second quarter as we continued our steady progress on the initiatives laid out in Vision 2025. We remain committed to the margin enhancing actions including pricing, market share gains and new technology. Our new technology initiatives can be highlighted by the launch of our market differentiated premium solution for spray foam applications launched in the second quarter. We are pleased to begin the third quarter with an industry-first combining CFT's spray foam equipment with CCM's spray foam insulation polyurethane products. We are also encouraged by the strategic acquisitions in Sealants and Adhesives, we made in 2019 and the progress we are making to complete this product lineup. CFT also continues its focus on upgrading the customer experience through quality and delivery improvements in all our global locations. Notably, we are beginning to see positive signs in CFT's end markets, particularly in Asia and are cautiously optimistic for an improved second half of 2020. We currently expect third quarter revenues to decline roughly 20% year-over-year, an improvement versus second quarter 2020 results. Coupling of stabilization in market demand with our internal initiatives, we will deliver significant leverage once volume returns. Turning to CBF. The pandemic crisis extended the pressure CBF was already experiencing in the global off-highway vehicle markets, offsetting the significant actions taken the past few years in this business, including the Tulsa to Medina plant consolidation and the launching of new products. An excellent example of CBF's investment in innovation is our recent obtaining of FAA Parts Manufacturer Approvals or PMAs for carbon aircraft brakes. The benefit of these actions, which positioned CBF to meet our revenue and profitability expectations in the future are less visible given the current severe demand downturn, which drove sales down over 30% year-over-year in the second quarter. We anticipate CBF's third quarter sales to improve over second quarter declining mid-teens. Moving away from our business segments. M&A remains a key pillar of Vision 2025, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy capital into strategic and synergistic acquisitions across CCM, CIT, and CFT. Our financial strength and cash flow generating capabilities afforded us flexibility, and we intend to remain opportunistic. Notably, and as discussed in the past, when acquisition activity is subdued, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. This is evidenced by our deployment of more than $190 million in share repurchases in the first half of 2020. And finally, we continue to focus on deployment of the Carlisle operating system. COS will continue to be an essential tool for our businesses to rely on as they seek new opportunities to make our operations and business processes more efficient in this challenging environment. COS remained on track in the second quarter, generating savings and efficiency gains exceeding 1% of sales well within our projected 1% to 2% planned for Vision 2025. Bob will now provide operational and financial detail about our second quarter and review our balance sheet and cash flow. Bob?\nRobert Roche: Thanks. As Chris mentioned earlier, we had a challenging revenue and earnings quarter, but I'm pleased with the resilience of our cash flow, the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity position, with $738 million of cash on hand and $1 billion undrawn under our revolving credit facility. As a reminder, late in the first quarter, we drew $500 million from our revolving credit facility due to the instability of the financial markets at that time. This was fully repaid in the second quarter as credit market stabilized. Please now turn to the revenue bridge on Slide 7 of the presentation. Revenue decreased 22.1% in the quarter to $1 billion. Organic revenue declined 23.8%. Acquisitions contributed 1.9% of sales growth for the quarter and FX was a 20 basis point headwind. Turning to our margin bridge on Slide 8. Q2 operating margin declined 470 basis points. Pricing and volume headwinds combined were minus 730 basis points, and acquisitions were a minus 90 basis points. Offsetting those, COS added 100 basis points, net restructuring and rationalization costs were additional 50 basis point headwind, freight, labor, raw material, other operating costs netted to a 300 basis point improvement. On Slide 9, as always, we have provided an EPS bridge. We reported second quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.36, which compares to $2.65 last year. Volume price and mix combined were $1.63 year-over-year decrease, while tax and interest combined for a $0.11 headwind. Restructuring was a $0.09 headwind, while COVID-related and acquisition-related costs were both $0.05 headwinds. Partially offsetting these, raw material, freight and labor costs netted to a $0.15 benefit, COS contributed $0.18 and lower operating expenses contributed $0.25. While volume declines clearly represented the most significant headwind during the quarter, our teams around the world did a commendable job managing cost to help mitigate its impact on earnings. Now let's turn to Slide 10 to review the second quarter performance by segment in more detail. At CCM, revenues decreased 19.7%. Acquisitions contributed 0.1% of the growth. Organic revenue was 19.7%, while foreign currency translation was a 10 basis point headwind. Operating margin at CCM was 18.7% in the quarter, a 120 basis point decline over last year, driven by volume, partially offset by raw material savings in COS. CCM executed well in delivering approximately $16 million of net price cost realization in the quarter. We now anticipate full-year net price cost realization of approximately $60 million for the full-year 2020. Please turn to Slide 11 where you see CIT's results. CIT revenue declined 25% in the second quarter. This decline was driven by the crisis in commercial aerospace markets, partially offset by a positive trend in our medical technologies platform. CIT's operating margin declined 1,540 basis points year-over-year to negative 0.8%, driven by commercial aerospace volume declines and accelerated restructuring actions. These were partially offset by savings from COS and price. Turning to Slide 12. CFT's sales declined 30.9% year-over-year, organic revenue declined 34.2% and acquisitions added 4.3% in the quarter. CFT was still experiencing the lingering effects of Brexit, U.S./China trade negotiations and automotive market declines, which is now exacerbated by COVID-19. Operating margins declined 1,610 basis points year-over-year to a negative 11.2% as significant volume declines and related deleverage were partially offset by lower SG&A and efficiencies from COS. CBF's results are outlined on Slide 13. Organic revenue declined 31.1% due to an accelerated COVID-19-related decline in all regions made more acute by temporary plant closures in Europe and Asia. FX also had a negative 1.4% impact. Operating loss was $1.6 million in the quarter or a negative 2.7% operating margin driven primarily by volume declines and higher restructuring costs. On Slides 14 and 15, we show selected balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $738 million cash in hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolver credit line. We have deployed approximately $71 million in the second quarter repurchasing 556,000 shares. We paid our second quarter dividend totaling $28 million on June 1 and anticipate increasing our dividend in September for the 44th consecutive year. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner, investing in organic growth through capital expenditures, opportunistically repurchasing shares, while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. Cash flow for the first six months of 2020 was a solid $177.8 million. And as a reminder, CCM typically generates stronger cash flow in the second half of the year. We expect overall Carlisle to generate free cash flow conversion in excess of 125% for the full-year. Turning to Slide 16, our outlook for 2020. Chris earlier gave third quarter revenue guidance referenced here. And as you can see, our items affecting comparability in corporate items. As we move through the second quarter, we refined our restructuring plans and tightened our estimates around the future costs. Corporate expense is expected to be approximately $85 million for the year, slightly higher than our previous estimate, primarily due to higher transaction costs. We continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $230 million. For the full-year, we continue to invest in our business and now expect capital expenditures of $100 million to $110 million. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $75 million for the year, and we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 23%. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Chris.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Bob. At Carlisle, we remain committed to our Vision 2025 objectives, ultimately driving to $15 in earnings per share. The foundations of Vision 2025 success rest on driving organic growth with leverage, utilizing COS consistently to drive efficiencies, building scale with synergistic acquisitions and over $3 billion in capital deployment. When coupled with our long-standing and defining management approach of combining continuous improvement and entrepreneurial spirit and decentralization with an increasingly center-led framework, we created a unique culture, which assures that the day-to-day energy, focus and efforts of our employees are directed towards actions that drive results and support the key initiatives within the context of Vision 2025. In closing, I want to again express my thanks to our dedicated employees, their families, our business partners and all those associated with Carlisle's success. Given our 100-year history and the resilience this company has shown in times of adversity and uncertainty, we remain confident in Carlisle's outlook, our strong financial foundation, cash generating capabilities, unwavering commitment to our Vision 2025 strategic plan and to providing products and services essential to the world's needs. This concludes our formal comments. Josh, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBryan Blair: Good afternoon, guys. Hope everyone is doing well.\nChristian Koch: Hi, Bryan.\nRobert Roche: Thank you.\nBryan Blair: I was hoping you could provide a little more detail on CCM volume by month. We know April was tough, down over 30%. And then there is some recovery from there. So any numbers you could offer on May, June and July to date would be helpful.\nChristian Koch: Bryan, I wouldn't want to give any specifics, but definitely, it was worse in April and then improved straight through June and has improved into July as well.\nBryan Blair: Okay. So there is some momentum going into the third quarter?\nRobert Roche: Definitely some momentum going into the third quarter.\nBryan Blair: Got it. And then on price cost, you've realized about $36 million for the first half. So updated guide implies about $24 million in the back half. How should we think about that cadence? Is it reasonable to assume most of that comes through in the third quarter?\nRobert Roche: Yes. It's going to be more heavily weighted to the third quarter and then probably about five, I'd say in the fourth quarter as we are sitting here today.\nBryan Blair: Got it. Okay. And then Chris, you mentioned confidence in your prepared remarks about the health of the reroofing cycle. If we take that as is and think about the growth prospects of your newer growth platforms, what kind of declines would there have to be in the smaller new construction revenue that you have in CCM to offset the drivers that will likely be there the next year or two?\nChristian Koch: Bryan, I am going to have to defer that one. Can I get back to you? I'd hate to give you a number without significant thought into that. All our focus right now has really been focused on 2020 here and getting through and being happy with what we've seen. But let me get back to you on that one.\nBryan Blair: Okay. That's fair. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Wojs: Yes. Hey guys. Good afternoon.\nChristian Koch: Hey, Tim.\nTimothy Wojs: Maybe just \u2013 I guess dovetail on the last question there. I mean, how are you thinking about just the underlying reroof dynamics in CCM, I guess has anything really changed your view? And I guess, as you look at your contractor base and some of the backlogs, how would you kind of talk about reroof today versus maybe new construction and just the visibility to that as you go into 2021?\nChristian Koch: Well, I think we start with the information, and I think Bob has been pretty good about providing relative to reroofing demand as we look at the roofing cycle, we look at the 20-year roof as typical, and then we look at how that builds certainly through the end of this decade and a little bit into the next decade. I hate to look any further out in \u2013 than that time period that would be speculative. I think there'll be some product developments that change things, obviously, as we get into the 30s. I think if you look at the backlog, it's been relatively flat, maybe a little bit decline in the second quarter in contractor backlogs. But I think the work is still out there. And obviously the delays that occurred in April and May, as people work through this the requirements and the shutdowns and all that that impacted the reroofing market only in the sense that it just added to the back. We still have the same amount of roofs. They still have to be done. They just keep getting prolonged and hopefully we can get through those. I think on the new construction side, you'll see some variability. There\u2019s been a lot of talk across the country about different working habits, more working from home. We know that suburban environments provide better opportunities for flat roof constructions than, let's say, Downtown Manhattan. So I think it's a little bit early to tell on the new construction side and what's going to happen. Obviously, that's impacted as it can be deferred, and new construction can be challenged. It has to go through the CapEx process, where I think on the reroofing side, as we've said in many cases, even I'll give you the example of old KMarts or Sears or buildings like that, that are being repurposed. The roof still has to be done. So I think we're just still on the same track we were on for reroofing. We're still bullish on reroofing. Obviously, COVID in the second quarter impacted us. That will linger into Q3, but we don't see any reduction in our backlog of reroofing projects as we go through into 2021 and 2022 and on from there.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. And I guess if you guys had to guess, how much do you think destock costs you in the quarter?\nChristian Koch: It was significant. Bob, can probably give you a better answer for that than me. But what I would say is, it was significant. And I think that was \u2013 people were pretty public about not wanting to load up and that really we would have started that right end of March, and we carried through, and it was impactful. Bob, any thoughts on that?\nRobert Roche: Yes. I mean, we're down 20% overall, Tim. So you can think maybe 5% of that could have been destocking from the data we're seeing. But it's hard to judge because you don't know what that would have been sold through the end customers in the time we sold. As Chris mentioned on the call, we shipped more direct this quarter than we did last quarter or last year this quarter. So it was really hard for us to quantify that exactly.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. I got you. And then I guess on the cost savings, so let's, sort of, have just the cost savings, the $35 million to $45 million of charges this year. What would you think the cost savings or the annualized cost savings would be around those charges? So you get the charges back to some extent next year and what would be kind of the associated cost savings of that?\nRobert Roche: Yes. Tim, the big issue there is a lot of this is not infrastructure related. It's not like the Medina \u2013 it's all sort of Medina move where you're taking our fixed costs. The quick stuff we did, I mean, we did take out one factory in CIT, but a lot of it is reducing capacity and capability with the massive reduction in aerospace and in our other plant. So it will be down as long as it will go on, but as soon as volumes come back, we're going to have to add some of these costs back.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. That makes sense. All right. Thanks guys. Good luck on second half.\nChristian Koch: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Adam Baumgarten with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the net price. Our net raw benefit, that obviously contemplates price. Is the outlook today worked for price alone within that, just more qualitatively better than it was when you last guided in April, given volume outlook's a little bit better and just oil is up a ton?\nRobert Roche: Yes. Hi, Adam. I mean, I think our outlook on prices is \u2013 and cost is obviously weighted to where we are in the cycle, right. We had a point a quarter ago where oil was down to \u2013 I don't know, I think it was $15 a barrel. It's gone up since then. So we're feeling more confident in the cost side, but we also don't know how much further that's going to run, and those who followed us for a long time, we usually conservative on the out two quarters of cost because these things have a tendency to spike pretty quickly if they do spike. And on the price side, price is \u2013 we're maintaining price for the first half of the year essentially flat. And then the second half, price is all going to be tied to volumes. So if we're able to maintain volumes and have volumes flat or growing, we feel we can maintain our price. If things get tough and volumes remain down, people will be chasing some share, and we'll going to have to play along a little bit. So we're trying to balance those two together of what's going on, on one side with the other, and they aren't mutually exclusive.\nAdam Baumgarten: I guess then just secondly, just back to the contractor backlogs, anything that's jumping out, whether it's regionally or even by commercial vertical at this point? Or is it all pretty consistent what you're seeing?\nChristian Koch: No, there's been some deviation between some of the verticals. I think we've seen some pretty consistent and maybe even a little bit of acceleration around educational spending. Some of the retail has been down. Obviously, everyone understands the impacts there and what's happening. So I think on the Dodge reports, in that, you would see that kind of thing. Again, within most of our business on the reroofing side, again, it's spread across those verticals and we don't see that same impact because again, you've got to fix that roof or replace it when it occurs. But I think on the new construction side, you would see some differences in the verticals.\nAdam Baumgarten: Great. Thank you.\nChristian Koch: Yes. Thanks Adam.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nGarik Shmois: Hi, thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on the destocking question. Do you think that restocking is going to normalize here by the end of the third quarter? Or do you think that maybe this shift to direct-to-jobs-site shipping could end up being a permanent phenomenon?\nChristian Koch: Well, I'll take the first one. I don't think it's going to be a permanent phenomenon. We are set up to do that. We do it because of the size of the jobs and the packaging of the material and the efficiency to deliver it, but our distributors play a very key role in a lot of the business that we do that\u2019s smaller, stuff they can store on site. And I do think we will see some resumption of restocking as confidence returns in some normalcy. I mean, I think the thing that on that side that really hurts you is, if you're a distributor, you don't want to all of a sudden get a mandate that we're not doing construction anymore. There's some restrictions. People can't come into your distributorship or that. And then you're sitting on inventory that's costing you dollars and you're not moving it. So I do think as things stabilize and we'll see some restocking there. I don't think we'll see the big restocking we would've seen pre the season. I think we've dealt with that and getting into the third quarter, we're done with that. So on the first question, Bob, you want to handle that.\nRobert Roche: Hi, Garik. Maybe you can rephrase your first question again?\nGarik Shmois: No. I think you answered it. I mean it was really a question, I guess one question, two parts just around the timing of any restock and if the phenomenon is going to be sustainable long-term. So I'm good there. Thank you. Second question is just on any regional trends that stood out in the quarter in CCM, you had some of the shutdowns in the Northeast impacted April. Did you see those markets come back? And then I guess conversely, as we've gotten into late June and July with the virus spreading more into South, is there any change to demand in some of those regions that are newly impacted by the virus?\nChristian Koch: I think it's a little bit early to be picking up any real significant changes in these new hot areas, Florida, Texas, and, Arizona in that. I mean, those have been good states for us. Texas though has been good. Florida is good. In the first part of this crisis, City of Boston was shut down. That impacted things. We had New York shut down. We had Pennsylvania shut down. We had Washington shut down. Those states were obviously affected. I think Pennsylvania had some retrenchment last week around further restrictions. I'm not sure they extended into the construction industry in terms of shutting down job sites, but they did impact our employees at our Carlisle facilities within Pennsylvania. So there were a few states that were more heavily impacted and I think I stated who those are, and then I think we'll have to watch and see what happens. I can tell you that the contractors that I've talked to have done a really good job of implementing CDC guidelines at the workplace. You're finding hand sanitizers out on a job site, a specific mask wearing. If they're not wearing them already for the jobs they're doing, social distancing, and it has put a little bit of a damper on the work and the efficiency there. But I think the contractors and distributors are doing a lot to at their locations to make sure that we don't shut down again and we could keep that revenue flow and get these jobs done and keep people employed.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. Thanks. And just last question, just on CIT. It looks like just from a sequential standpoint, you're looking for relatively flat revenues in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. And I was wondering if you're looking out into the end of the year, would you expect any sort of sequential improvement in CIT as you kind of look out in your order book at this point?\nChristian Koch: I don't think so. I think like you, we're looking out in the future. We hear a lot of different forecasts, everything from things coming back in 2022 to \u2013 I saw something on TV the other day, no one will ever fly again, now that they can do a Zoom meeting. So somewhere in between the two, we're probably or there's some version of the truth out there that hasn't really unfolded. I know Airbus did not have any new orders in June or so far in July. I think Boeing struggling with the 737 MAX issues to get that up. We did see some issues around the 787. I think it would be overly optimistic to think anything great is going to occur in the fourth quarter. So I think we'll probably just be looking at more of the same through the end of the year.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. Thanks for the help.\nChristian Koch: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKevin Hocevar: Hey everybody.\nChristian Koch: Hey.\nKevin Hocevar: Curious on \u2013 I was impressed with pricing remaining flat in CCM is pretty impressive given the volume declines that we've seen in the period and similarly the expectation that we're going to continue to see volume decline at least into the third quarter. So what do you attribute that to \u2013 I'm just curious your thoughts on the ability to hold price in that environment.\nChristian Koch: Yes. I mean, Kevin I go right back to the Carlisle experience, the team at Carlisle, and what a great job they do around making sure people understand the value that Carlisle is providing. And that's really what it comes down to our teams. And I was on a weekly Zoom call with our sales leaders. And I can tell you that they're not selling a commodity. They're not selling a product that is out there and everybody else has the same thing. Products are similar, but our service levels, our committed to the contractors, the systems we put in place, the ability to solve difficult problems. Some of our new products are creating a lot of excitement around CAF group too, our APEEL systems, things like that, they really are differentiators out with our contractors and distributors. And I think, I just \u2013 that we keep summing up in the Carlisle experience. That's what people, once they get on board and they start working with CCM, they see and they want that, and they don't want crews standing around waiting for shipments to arrive. They don't want product that fails in the field. They don't want to be short shipped. And our team is able to successfully quantify that value for them and show them why it is better for their businesses to pay a little bit more for CCM to save costs and others later.\nKevin Hocevar: And then I think in the prepared remarks and definitely in the press release, you talked about, many roofing participants, sounding like maybe they took a little bit harsher actions during the downturn, which might have created an opportunity for you guys to show your value and everything. So did that lead to \u2013 are you \u2013 do you believe that you're gaining share, more share, I guess as a result of maybe some of those actions that you've taken at least in the second quarter? Or just curious of your thoughts?\nChristian Koch: No. I think that we \u2013 the pricing we held on to, we did walk away from a few jobs. I mean, there were a lot of people that threw some prices out there that were just unacceptable and didn't adequately capture the value we provide. I think will be interesting to see is if the actions taken in the second quarter cause any material shortages as we move into Q3 and into Q4. Remember, if we couple the destocking efforts with other cost savings measures, those wouldn't have shown up in the second quarter. Those will typically show up as people work through their jobs. And obviously, we highlighted that we've been putting an inventory and we're still working and we're there to support the contractors and distributors. So we'll see how that unfolds in the third quarter. If people were too aggressive and there's a shortage of their products, obviously, we'll be able to step in and fill that void. And at that point then we'd probably gained some share and we're prepared to do that, but right now, I haven't seen any of that.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay, got you. And last one for me. Just given the environment, sticking with CCM, are you noticing any customers doing more like patch and repair work or something where they can kick the can down the road a couple of years before needing to replace it? Or are you not seeing that? Just curious if you're seeing that at all.\nChristian Koch: Yes. I mean my limited exposure here would tell me that the only reason they would be doing a patch and repair rather than a full replacement, if it was needed was only because they weren't able to have access to the building for very long because of restrictions let's say in Boston or something, it could only do an emergency or that. But I mean the contractors we're dealing with are the \u2013 they're the best in the industry. They follow the best practices. I mean, nobody's going to go up and do a patch and repair when a full replacement is needed. They're just not going to do that. So if we did see any of that, it was really, I think just to get them through the restrictions that were there and then people that we associated with and sell Carlisle and work with Carlisle only do good jobs. And so I don't think you'd see any short drifting on a job or trying to get by for a couple of years. They're just going to do the right job for the customer.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay. Makes sense. Thank you.\nChristian Koch: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone.\nChristian Koch: Good afternoon.\nRobert Roche: Hey, David.\nDavid MacGregor: To what extent do you feel that any of your products \u2013 I'm thinking like maybe the TPO or that group, but any of these products could benefit from an energy reform agenda or legislation if Biden wins the elections this fall? And what would increased energy efficiency standards mean for your commercial roofing in your business?\nChristian Koch: Well, I'll tell you what. I don't know about Biden being elected, and I don't know what he would do for our business. But what I can tell you is if we look back, you can see the growth in our polyiso insulation that was related to two things. One was a local building code reform where people understood that doing the simple thing of adding another layer of polyiso insulation dramatically affected the energy savings in those buildings. And so we saw that run through the United States. I'm going to say starting maybe six, seven years ago it was codified in a lot of areas, it continues to be. It has become kind of standard industry practice. And if you look at our polyiso sales over the last seven years, you can see that that growth in polyiso has corresponded nicely to that. And so we think that's one of the good stories around energy efficiency savings and the Carlisle experience, and really putting together systems that can benefit from that. We've also sold a lot of, what we call, green roofs, where we have people planting kind of different things and putting ponds and things on roofs with our membranes and creating a more, I'd say, sustainable environmentally friendly roof. So I think whatever administrations there, I know our customers are looking for different ways to reduce energy expense to create a more green environment. And I think a lot of that has gained some much momentum that I don't know that you need a political agenda to do that. People are doing, because it's the right thing to do in it, and it saves them money in the long-term.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. Thanks for that. And then the secondly, is there any way you can just comment on what you're seeing in terms of bidding patterns right now. And just, I guess to a question asked earlier on the call, is there any way to quantify the volume of business that you think is maybe being pushed out to 2021? I'm guessing your sales guys are coming back and saying that project is going to be done, but it's going to be done next year rather than this year. And I'm just wondering if there's any way to put a magnitude or to quantify the extent of that push out?\nChristian Koch: I guess, and Bob can jump in on this. Give him a minute to think about it. But I think from my perspective, it goes back to that idea that we look out and I think probably Bob showed you his chart on roofs that are coming due after 20 years of life. And I think we would just say anything that wasn't done this year that fit our 70% to 80% reroofing is going to be done next year. And so I don't think there's anything that's lost there. I think that will move forward into next year. I think the biggest question again is, are we going to be facing a different work environment that's more difficult for contractors to operate, it's more difficult for them to be efficient. And if that happens, then that actually, obviously, will have an impact on how many of those projects we can get caught up in. But I think pretty much for our reroofing, it just carries over as we've seen in many situations with winters. When we have a tough winter, we pick it up the next year, or it gets added to backlog. Bob, do you want to add anything?\nRobert Roche: No, I think that's exactly it, Chris. And with the second quarter being down 20%, we expect that to get kicked out, as Chris said, into a future quarter within the near-term. Also, the other thing we didn't talk about is, the ability to get jobs done is built around the ability to get permits and the fact that people aren't in offices sometimes today. So that's having a little effect on delaying as well as the restrictions on the roof. So \u2013 and we expect that to come back as we get to the end of the year.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. Great. Thanks very much, and good luck.\nRobert Roche: Thanks.\nChristian Koch: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJoel Tiss: Hey guys. How is it going?\nChristian Koch: We're all good. You?\nJoel Tiss: All right. I wonder if you can just talk \u2013 any sense that you can give us between the structural cost savings that you guys are working on for 2020 versus more of just reactive is not the right word, but sort of adjusting to the current environment.\nChristian Koch: Yes. Joel, most of the cost, I mean the large restructuring is being directed towards CIT and largely the aerospace environment as we sit here today. I mean, there was some at CCM, some at corporate, some of the other businesses, but they're smaller in magnitude. And most of those are of the what user was reactionary to bring infrastructure down with demand. On CIT, we did close one factory early in the quarter, which is a structural cost change. But a lot of it, I would say 75% of the cost reductions at CIT even are just bringing workforce both direct and indirect down with the volumes we're seeing across the aerospace business, so not a lot of structural change right now.\nJoel Tiss: Okay. And then do you think that $2 billion roughly capacity you guys have for acquisitions plus whatever kind of recovery we have is enough to get in the ballpark of your $8 billion of 2025 revenue goals?\nChristian Koch: For share.\nRobert Roche: Yes, absolutely.\nJoel Tiss: Okay. Well, that's great. Thank you so much.\nChristian Koch: You bet, Joel. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Daniel Wang with Berenberg Capital. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Wang: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just have a quick question on the Q2 operating cash flow. Pretty sizable improvement versus last year, obviously off a lower net income base. I was just wondering what primarily drove this? Perhaps some of it was a reversal of working capital headwinds experienced in Q1, but is there anything else worth highlighting?\nRobert Roche: Yes, a lot of it's good working capital, Daniel. As sales reduced, our teams did a good job of reducing inventory, collecting receivables. The one thing I, as a CFO, we\u2019re really impressed with throughout this quarter in this tough environment that our receivable days did not increase. So that means our receivable balances came down. And the teams did a good job of managing inventory. While inventory is hard to take out quickly, we did a good job of managing it and pushing out as much as we can. So a lot of its working capital related. You'll see also that on the CapEx, we continue to invest in CapEx. We're not starving the business. We're looking to invest for the future. So it's working capital that we're able to manage.\nDaniel Wang: Perfect. And just one follow-on. You might have briefly alluded to this already, but just any updates on the current M&A environment. Has activity in the pipeline improved since the end of last quarter? Are we still seeing, I suppose, sellers hesitant to monetize assets?\nChristian Koch: Yes. There's a bit of a delay, I think, in the second quarter, pretty much everybody was focused on the existential threat that appeared in April. And I think then we've seen some changes. We're seeing a little bit of deal flow come back. Certainly there are some assets that are out there. But I think the big thing for us is, again, we've always tried to be very judicious in our use of funds and how much we pay and making sure that we can get the \u2013 our hurdles to be covered in our cost of capital in that. And so I think right now, when you look at the uncertainty going forward, it makes it more difficult to get a value that both seller and buyer can kind of reach and agree and think it's reasonable for both, let's say.\nDaniel Wang: Perfect. Thank you and good luck.\nChristian Koch: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.\nChristian Koch: Well, thanks Josh. Thanks to everyone. This concludes our second quarter 2020 earnings call. We want to, again, thank you for your participation, your interest in Carlisle. I hope everybody stays healthy, and we look forward to speaking with you at the third quarter call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Roche",
            "content": "Thanks. As Chris mentioned earlier, we had a challenging revenue and earnings quarter, but I'm pleased with the resilience of our cash flow, the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity position, with $738 million of cash on hand and $1 billion undrawn under our revolving credit facility. As a reminder, late in the first quarter, we drew $500 million from our revolving credit facility due to the instability of the financial markets at that time. This was fully repaid in the second quarter as credit market stabilized. Please now turn to the revenue bridge on Slide 7 of the presentation. Revenue decreased 22.1% in the quarter to $1 billion. Organic revenue declined 23.8%. Acquisitions contributed 1.9% of sales growth for the quarter and FX was a 20 basis point headwind. Turning to our margin bridge on Slide 8. Q2 operating margin declined 470 basis points. Pricing and volume headwinds combined were minus 730 basis points, and acquisitions were a minus 90 basis points. Offsetting those, COS added 100 basis points, net restructuring and rationalization costs were additional 50 basis point headwind, freight, labor, raw material, other operating costs netted to a 300 basis point improvement. On Slide 9, as always, we have provided an EPS bridge. We reported second quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.36, which compares to $2.65 last year. Volume price and mix combined were $1.63 year-over-year decrease, while tax and interest combined for a $0.11 headwind. Restructuring was a $0.09 headwind, while COVID-related and acquisition-related costs were both $0.05 headwinds. Partially offsetting these, raw material, freight and labor costs netted to a $0.15 benefit, COS contributed $0.18 and lower operating expenses contributed $0.25. While volume declines clearly represented the most significant headwind during the quarter, our teams around the world did a commendable job managing cost to help mitigate its impact on earnings. Now let's turn to Slide 10 to review the second quarter performance by segment in more detail. At CCM, revenues decreased 19.7%. Acquisitions contributed 0.1% of the growth. Organic revenue was 19.7%, while foreign currency translation was a 10 basis point headwind. Operating margin at CCM was 18.7% in the quarter, a 120 basis point decline over last year, driven by volume, partially offset by raw material savings in COS. CCM executed well in delivering approximately $16 million of net price cost realization in the quarter. We now anticipate full-year net price cost realization of approximately $60 million for the full-year 2020. Please turn to Slide 11 where you see CIT's results. CIT revenue declined 25% in the second quarter. This decline was driven by the crisis in commercial aerospace markets, partially offset by a positive trend in our medical technologies platform. CIT's operating margin declined 1,540 basis points year-over-year to negative 0.8%, driven by commercial aerospace volume declines and accelerated restructuring actions. These were partially offset by savings from COS and price. Turning to Slide 12. CFT's sales declined 30.9% year-over-year, organic revenue declined 34.2% and acquisitions added 4.3% in the quarter. CFT was still experiencing the lingering effects of Brexit, U.S./China trade negotiations and automotive market declines, which is now exacerbated by COVID-19. Operating margins declined 1,610 basis points year-over-year to a negative 11.2% as significant volume declines and related deleverage were partially offset by lower SG&A and efficiencies from COS. CBF's results are outlined on Slide 13. Organic revenue declined 31.1% due to an accelerated COVID-19-related decline in all regions made more acute by temporary plant closures in Europe and Asia. FX also had a negative 1.4% impact. Operating loss was $1.6 million in the quarter or a negative 2.7% operating margin driven primarily by volume declines and higher restructuring costs. On Slides 14 and 15, we show selected balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $738 million cash in hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolver credit line. We have deployed approximately $71 million in the second quarter repurchasing 556,000 shares. We paid our second quarter dividend totaling $28 million on June 1 and anticipate increasing our dividend in September for the 44th consecutive year. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner, investing in organic growth through capital expenditures, opportunistically repurchasing shares, while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. Cash flow for the first six months of 2020 was a solid $177.8 million. And as a reminder, CCM typically generates stronger cash flow in the second half of the year. We expect overall Carlisle to generate free cash flow conversion in excess of 125% for the full-year. Turning to Slide 16, our outlook for 2020. Chris earlier gave third quarter revenue guidance referenced here. And as you can see, our items affecting comparability in corporate items. As we move through the second quarter, we refined our restructuring plans and tightened our estimates around the future costs. Corporate expense is expected to be approximately $85 million for the year, slightly higher than our previous estimate, primarily due to higher transaction costs. We continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $230 million. For the full-year, we continue to invest in our business and now expect capital expenditures of $100 million to $110 million. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $75 million for the year, and we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 23%. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Chris. Thank you. Definitely some momentum going into the third quarter. Yes. It's going to be more heavily weighted to the third quarter and then probably about five, I'd say in the fourth quarter as we are sitting here today. Yes. I mean, we're down 20% overall, Tim. So you can think maybe 5% of that could have been destocking from the data we're seeing. But it's hard to judge because you don't know what that would have been sold through the end customers in the time we sold. As Chris mentioned on the call, we shipped more direct this quarter than we did last quarter or last year this quarter. So it was really hard for us to quantify that exactly. Yes. Tim, the big issue there is a lot of this is not infrastructure related. It's not like the Medina \u2013 it's all sort of Medina move where you're taking our fixed costs. The quick stuff we did, I mean, we did take out one factory in CIT, but a lot of it is reducing capacity and capability with the massive reduction in aerospace and in our other plant. So it will be down as long as it will go on, but as soon as volumes come back, we're going to have to add some of these costs back. Yes. Hi, Adam. I mean, I think our outlook on prices is \u2013 and cost is obviously weighted to where we are in the cycle, right. We had a point a quarter ago where oil was down to \u2013 I don't know, I think it was $15 a barrel. It's gone up since then. So we're feeling more confident in the cost side, but we also don't know how much further that's going to run, and those who followed us for a long time, we usually conservative on the out two quarters of cost because these things have a tendency to spike pretty quickly if they do spike. And on the price side, price is \u2013 we're maintaining price for the first half of the year essentially flat. And then the second half, price is all going to be tied to volumes. So if we're able to maintain volumes and have volumes flat or growing, we feel we can maintain our price. If things get tough and volumes remain down, people will be chasing some share, and we'll going to have to play along a little bit. So we're trying to balance those two together of what's going on, on one side with the other, and they aren't mutually exclusive. Hi, Garik. Maybe you can rephrase your first question again? Hey, David. No, I think that's exactly it, Chris. And with the second quarter being down 20%, we expect that to get kicked out, as Chris said, into a future quarter within the near-term. Also, the other thing we didn't talk about is, the ability to get jobs done is built around the ability to get permits and the fact that people aren't in offices sometimes today. So that's having a little effect on delaying as well as the restrictions on the roof. So \u2013 and we expect that to come back as we get to the end of the year. Thanks. Yes, absolutely. Yes, a lot of it's good working capital, Daniel. As sales reduced, our teams did a good job of reducing inventory, collecting receivables. The one thing I, as a CFO, we're really impressed with throughout this quarter in this tough environment that our receivable days did not increase. So that means our receivable balances came down. And the teams did a good job of managing inventory. While inventory is hard to take out quickly, we did a good job of managing it and pushing out as much as we can. So a lot of its working capital related. You'll see also that on the CapEx, we continue to invest in CapEx. We're not starving the business. We're looking to invest for the future. So it's working capital that we're able to manage."

            "name": "Christian Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Please refer to Slides 3, 4, and 5 for these opening comments. I'd like to begin by saying how proud I am of Carlisle's global team and their perseverance and ability to execute in these uncertain times. Carlisle's employees have rallied around each other, our customers and their communities by supporting critical infrastructure, continuing to operate our factories and distribution centers at a high level despite limitations, borne out of adherence to rigorous global health and safety guidelines, all the while remaining supportive and positive contributors to their families and local communities. Their dedication to a safe work and home environment is commendable. As I mentioned in the press release, while overall infections in our global organization have remained low, we are saddened as we reflect on the loss of three Carlisle family members to the virus. Maria, Roy, Gilberto, they will be missed. And as with any loss at Carlisle, we are all affected, and we all wish their families the best as they grieve their loss. I cannot leave this subject without also stating as I have done through my weekly correspondence with our global employees since the start of the pandemic that the reality is that this virus is a serious threat to our health and our economy, and that our efforts to protect ourselves and each other must have the highest of priorities. I would like to now transition to the second quarter results. As we review the results, I want to reiterate that Carlisle has been deeply impacted by the virus in many ways, but we are fortunate to have a strong and solid foundation as a company. Throughout the second quarter, our businesses remained in operation as they were deemed essential, which we view as evidence of the importance of our products and the employees who design and produce them. We took pride in keeping layoffs and reduced hours to a minimum, which helped provide the uninterrupted service to our customers that they have come to rely on and allowed us to continue our progress on key initiatives related to Vision 2025. However, we did take actions that resulted in reductions to our global workforce in the quarter, most particularly in the United States. While the second quarter certainly was challenging, we are pleased with the resilience of the CCM business model, enabling Carlisle to weather a potentially prolonged economic downturn and allowing us to continue to invest in our high growth platforms of architectural metals, polyurethanes, medical technologies and fluid technologies, which will enable us to emerge out of the pandemic with strong growth prospects. We remain committed to emerging from the current market challenges in a strong financial position enable to leverage that financial position into future growth and earnings in our core businesses. Bob will provide more details later in the call, but I want to touch on some important areas of our current financial position. As of the end of the second quarter, we have $738 million of cash coupled with an untapped $1 billion credit facility. We expect strong free cash flow in 2020 with a conversion rate greater than 125% and fully expect to increase our dividend in September for the 44th consecutive year. Despite the unknown impacts and challenging dynamics of this current situation, I want to be direct in saying we remain absolutely committed to and focused on $15 in earnings per share as contemplated in Vision 2025. Some of the things that reinforced our conviction and our ability to deliver Vision 2025 include the following. CCM is well positioned to exhibit resilience during this global market downturn. We still foresee a robust and growing reroofing market with positive trends continuing well through 2025, driven by the need for maintaining an aging U.S. roofing infrastructure. This distinction is important as most of CCM sales are driven by replacement demand, not new construction. We also anticipate benefiting from CCM's variable cost structure and lower input costs near-term. Due to our size and scale, we believe we have the lowest cost structure in the industry, create the most value through our Carlisle experience and remain the disciplined price leader in the market. CCM status is a best-in-class building envelope solution provider continues to be evidenced through price and market leadership, superior products and service, industry-leading innovation, a strong reroofing backdrop and an operating income profile approaching Vision 2025's targeted 20%. Over 60% of CCM's product is typically shipped directly to the job site and in the second quarter, this percentage increased. As the industry came out of lockdown, the smaller window the contractors had to work with made the efficiency of the Carlisle experience that much more important. We reinforced our commitment to our customers of never failing to deliver the right product at the right place at the right time every time. We remain very pleased with the progress we continue to make on our newer platforms of polyurethane and architectural metals within CCM. Within polyurethanes, spray foam continue to regain significant market share, helping to drive flat year-over-year revenue in the quarter despite the challenging conditions. Architectural metals revenue exceeded overall CCM average percentage sales declines in the quarter. Architectural metals continues to progress on post-acquisition profitability improvements, including significant integration initiatives. Through June and into July at CCM, we continue to see improvement in daily sales volumes that began in May. Provided this trend continues, we anticipate third quarter sales at CCM will decline high-single digits year-over-year, significantly better than the 20% decline during the second quarter of 2020. As expected, CCM's operating income margins of 18.7% during a very challenging second quarter exemplified its profitability resilience and importantly, Carlisle's position in the market-driven by the valued Carlisle experience. As for our interconnect business, coming into the year, 2020 was already forecasted to be significantly burdened by ongoing issue surrounding Boeing 737 MAX, in addition to lower production of other Boeing and Airbus platforms. The emergence of COVID-19 and its impact on airline travel had an almost immediate and substantial effect on both aircraft production and airline investment in existing fleets. In response, our CIT team initiated an acceleration of restructuring actions that will right-size our manufacturing footprint in line with expected demand over the next few years. While CIT's commercial aerospace business as expected declined approximately 50% in the quarter, the team took actions to manage costs, which assisted greatly in delivering only a slight reported operating income loss for the overall division, despite restructuring costs incurred in the quarter. Ongoing actions to restructure and improve the efficiency of our manufacturing footprint over the past few years, combined with the accelerated actions we are currently taking positioned CIT well to suffer minimal losses in the remainder of 2020, despite restructuring costs and once-in-a-lifetime declines in aerospace end markets. Despite aggressive action to maintain profitability, we continue to invest in new products, into talent and into our manufacturing operations to ensure we are maintaining our industry-leading position and are able to execute our customer expectations when production of aircraft resumes. We expect similar year-over-year revenue declines in CIT aerospace for the third quarter as experienced in the second quarter as inventory in the supply chain continues to be worked down and forecast for a recovery in global passenger travel remained muted. Recently, some positive signs have emerged in the aerospace markets. While we all know that the aerospace markets have been significantly impacted by the pandemic, we do remain confident that over time passengers will become comfortable with the safety measures airlines are implementing. And we are also encouraged by recent announcements of the progress towards the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, which once deployed, should accelerate a return to higher levels of air travel. Additionally, Boeing's 737 MAX moved closer to FAA approval with the completion of certification flights on July 1, a key step in returning the aircraft to service. We remain a supplier-of-choice and we will continue to invest in our assets that support the aerospace market. Despite the fact that the agreement with Prysmian to purchase their Fileca business expired in June, we remain committed to strategic acquisitions that broaden our product in geographic breadth, and ultimately will benefit from a resumption of growth in both aircraft build rates and airline spending. To offset commercial aerospace declines, we are seeking new opportunities with space and defense customers, positioning CIT to take advantage of opportunities created by market disruption. The largest offsetting driver at CIT is, however, clearly, its medical technologies platform. We entered the medical technology space several years ago through the acquisition of LHi with the concept of leveraging our core wire and cable expertise into the MedTech markets. We added MicroConnex, RedGroup and Providien in the last two years and MedTech remains a key area of focus for both organic investment and bolt-on acquisitions. Organically, CIT medical technologies grew 15% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by increased demand for COVID-19-related patient monitoring equipment. Recently acquired Providien, which expanded our component and vertically integrated device solution capabilities and along with that new market adjacencies and customers continue to perform well. In addition, product rationalization actions taken in legacy medical product lines in 2018 and 2019 coupled with ongoing COS efforts have improved CIT medical technology margin profiles, which as anticipated will help CIT's overall margin as contemplated in Vision 2025. Our long-term bullishness on MedTech remains intact, and we see CIT's revenues trending towards a better balanced and more profitable mix. Near-term, while CIT medical technologies remains a positive offset to CIT aerospace weakness, we remain watchful of key MedTech demand drivers, such as hospital CapEx, elective surgery and procedure deferrals continue, and particularly in the U.S., they continue. Taken together, we expect third quarter revenue year-over-year declines for CIT overall to be of similar magnitude as reported in the second quarter. Turning to CFT. The impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter exacerbated an already challenging end market demand environment that had been impacted for the past several quarters by the U.S./China trade negotiations and subsequent industrial production slowdowns. While year-over-year revenue declines of over 30% were greater than anticipated and weighed heavily on operating income results, CFT saw improvement each month throughout the second quarter as we continued our steady progress on the initiatives laid out in Vision 2025. We remain committed to the margin enhancing actions including pricing, market share gains and new technology. Our new technology initiatives can be highlighted by the launch of our market differentiated premium solution for spray foam applications launched in the second quarter. We are pleased to begin the third quarter with an industry-first combining CFT's spray foam equipment with CCM's spray foam insulation polyurethane products. We are also encouraged by the strategic acquisitions in Sealants and Adhesives, we made in 2019 and the progress we are making to complete this product lineup. CFT also continues its focus on upgrading the customer experience through quality and delivery improvements in all our global locations. Notably, we are beginning to see positive signs in CFT's end markets, particularly in Asia and are cautiously optimistic for an improved second half of 2020. We currently expect third quarter revenues to decline roughly 20% year-over-year, an improvement versus second quarter 2020 results. Coupling of stabilization in market demand with our internal initiatives, we will deliver significant leverage once volume returns. Turning to CBF. The pandemic crisis extended the pressure CBF was already experiencing in the global off-highway vehicle markets, offsetting the significant actions taken the past few years in this business, including the Tulsa to Medina plant consolidation and the launching of new products. An excellent example of CBF's investment in innovation is our recent obtaining of FAA Parts Manufacturer Approvals or PMAs for carbon aircraft brakes. The benefit of these actions, which positioned CBF to meet our revenue and profitability expectations in the future are less visible given the current severe demand downturn, which drove sales down over 30% year-over-year in the second quarter. We anticipate CBF's third quarter sales to improve over second quarter declining mid-teens. Moving away from our business segments. M&A remains a key pillar of Vision 2025, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy capital into strategic and synergistic acquisitions across CCM, CIT, and CFT. Our financial strength and cash flow generating capabilities afforded us flexibility, and we intend to remain opportunistic. Notably, and as discussed in the past, when acquisition activity is subdued, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. This is evidenced by our deployment of more than $190 million in share repurchases in the first half of 2020. And finally, we continue to focus on deployment of the Carlisle operating system. COS will continue to be an essential tool for our businesses to rely on as they seek new opportunities to make our operations and business processes more efficient in this challenging environment. COS remained on track in the second quarter, generating savings and efficiency gains exceeding 1% of sales well within our projected 1% to 2% planned for Vision 2025. Bob will now provide operational and financial detail about our second quarter and review our balance sheet and cash flow. Bob? Thanks, Bob. At Carlisle, we remain committed to our Vision 2025 objectives, ultimately driving to $15 in earnings per share. The foundations of Vision 2025 success rest on driving organic growth with leverage, utilizing COS consistently to drive efficiencies, building scale with synergistic acquisitions and over $3 billion in capital deployment. When coupled with our long-standing and defining management approach of combining continuous improvement and entrepreneurial spirit and decentralization with an increasingly center-led framework, we created a unique culture, which assures that the day-to-day energy, focus and efforts of our employees are directed towards actions that drive results and support the key initiatives within the context of Vision 2025. In closing, I want to again express my thanks to our dedicated employees, their families, our business partners and all those associated with Carlisle's success. Given our 100-year history and the resilience this company has shown in times of adversity and uncertainty, we remain confident in Carlisle's outlook, our strong financial foundation, cash generating capabilities, unwavering commitment to our Vision 2025 strategic plan and to providing products and services essential to the world's needs. This concludes our formal comments. Josh, we are now ready for questions. Hi, Bryan. Bryan, I wouldn't want to give any specifics, but definitely, it was worse in April and then improved straight through June and has improved into July as well. Bryan, I am going to have to defer that one. Can I get back to you? I'd hate to give you a number without significant thought into that. All our focus right now has really been focused on 2020 here and getting through and being happy with what we've seen. But let me get back to you on that one. Hey, Tim. Well, I think we start with the information, and I think Bob has been pretty good about providing relative to reroofing demand as we look at the roofing cycle, we look at the 20-year roof as typical, and then we look at how that builds certainly through the end of this decade and a little bit into the next decade. I hate to look any further out in \u2013 than that time period that would be speculative. I think there'll be some product developments that change things, obviously, as we get into the 30s. I think if you look at the backlog, it's been relatively flat, maybe a little bit decline in the second quarter in contractor backlogs. But I think the work is still out there. And obviously the delays that occurred in April and May, as people work through this the requirements and the shutdowns and all that that impacted the reroofing market only in the sense that it just added to the back. We still have the same amount of roofs. They still have to be done. They just keep getting prolonged and hopefully we can get through those. I think on the new construction side, you'll see some variability. There's been a lot of talk across the country about different working habits, more working from home. We know that suburban environments provide better opportunities for flat roof constructions than, let's say, Downtown Manhattan. So I think it's a little bit early to tell on the new construction side and what's going to happen. Obviously, that's impacted as it can be deferred, and new construction can be challenged. It has to go through the CapEx process, where I think on the reroofing side, as we've said in many cases, even I'll give you the example of old KMarts or Sears or buildings like that, that are being repurposed. The roof still has to be done. So I think we're just still on the same track we were on for reroofing. We're still bullish on reroofing. Obviously, COVID in the second quarter impacted us. That will linger into Q3, but we don't see any reduction in our backlog of reroofing projects as we go through into 2021 and 2022 and on from there. It was significant. Bob, can probably give you a better answer for that than me. But what I would say is, it was significant. And I think that was \u2013 people were pretty public about not wanting to load up and that really we would have started that right end of March, and we carried through, and it was impactful. Bob, any thoughts on that? Thank you. No, there's been some deviation between some of the verticals. I think we've seen some pretty consistent and maybe even a little bit of acceleration around educational spending. Some of the retail has been down. Obviously, everyone understands the impacts there and what's happening. So I think on the Dodge reports, in that, you would see that kind of thing. Again, within most of our business on the reroofing side, again, it's spread across those verticals and we don't see that same impact because again, you've got to fix that roof or replace it when it occurs. But I think on the new construction side, you would see some differences in the verticals. Yes. Thanks Adam. Well, I'll take the first one. I don't think it's going to be a permanent phenomenon. We are set up to do that. We do it because of the size of the jobs and the packaging of the material and the efficiency to deliver it, but our distributors play a very key role in a lot of the business that we do that's smaller, stuff they can store on site. And I do think we will see some resumption of restocking as confidence returns in some normalcy. I mean, I think the thing that on that side that really hurts you is, if you're a distributor, you don't want to all of a sudden get a mandate that we're not doing construction anymore. There's some restrictions. People can't come into your distributorship or that. And then you're sitting on inventory that's costing you dollars and you're not moving it. So I do think as things stabilize and we'll see some restocking there. I don't think we'll see the big restocking we would've seen pre the season. I think we've dealt with that and getting into the third quarter, we're done with that. So on the first question, Bob, you want to handle that. I think it's a little bit early to be picking up any real significant changes in these new hot areas, Florida, Texas, and, Arizona in that. I mean, those have been good states for us. Texas though has been good. Florida is good. In the first part of this crisis, City of Boston was shut down. That impacted things. We had New York shut down. We had Pennsylvania shut down. We had Washington shut down. Those states were obviously affected. I think Pennsylvania had some retrenchment last week around further restrictions. I'm not sure they extended into the construction industry in terms of shutting down job sites, but they did impact our employees at our Carlisle facilities within Pennsylvania. So there were a few states that were more heavily impacted and I think I stated who those are, and then I think we'll have to watch and see what happens. I can tell you that the contractors that I've talked to have done a really good job of implementing CDC guidelines at the workplace. You're finding hand sanitizers out on a job site, a specific mask wearing. If they're not wearing them already for the jobs they're doing, social distancing, and it has put a little bit of a damper on the work and the efficiency there. But I think the contractors and distributors are doing a lot to at their locations to make sure that we don't shut down again and we could keep that revenue flow and get these jobs done and keep people employed. I don't think so. I think like you, we're looking out in the future. We hear a lot of different forecasts, everything from things coming back in 2022 to \u2013 I saw something on TV the other day, no one will ever fly again, now that they can do a Zoom meeting. So somewhere in between the two, we're probably or there's some version of the truth out there that hasn't really unfolded. I know Airbus did not have any new orders in June or so far in July. I think Boeing struggling with the 737 MAX issues to get that up. We did see some issues around the 787. I think it would be overly optimistic to think anything great is going to occur in the fourth quarter. So I think we'll probably just be looking at more of the same through the end of the year. You bet. Hey. Yes. I mean, Kevin I go right back to the Carlisle experience, the team at Carlisle, and what a great job they do around making sure people understand the value that Carlisle is providing. And that's really what it comes down to our teams. And I was on a weekly Zoom call with our sales leaders. And I can tell you that they're not selling a commodity. They're not selling a product that is out there and everybody else has the same thing. Products are similar, but our service levels, our committed to the contractors, the systems we put in place, the ability to solve difficult problems. Some of our new products are creating a lot of excitement around CAF group too, our APEEL systems, things like that, they really are differentiators out with our contractors and distributors. And I think, I just \u2013 that we keep summing up in the Carlisle experience. That's what people, once they get on board and they start working with CCM, they see and they want that, and they don't want crews standing around waiting for shipments to arrive. They don't want product that fails in the field. They don't want to be short shipped. And our team is able to successfully quantify that value for them and show them why it is better for their businesses to pay a little bit more for CCM to save costs and others later. No. I think that we \u2013 the pricing we held on to, we did walk away from a few jobs. I mean, there were a lot of people that threw some prices out there that were just unacceptable and didn't adequately capture the value we provide. I think will be interesting to see is if the actions taken in the second quarter cause any material shortages as we move into Q3 and into Q4. Remember, if we couple the destocking efforts with other cost savings measures, those wouldn't have shown up in the second quarter. Those will typically show up as people work through their jobs. And obviously, we highlighted that we've been putting an inventory and we're still working and we're there to support the contractors and distributors. So we'll see how that unfolds in the third quarter. If people were too aggressive and there's a shortage of their products, obviously, we'll be able to step in and fill that void. And at that point then we'd probably gained some share and we're prepared to do that, but right now, I haven't seen any of that. Yes. I mean my limited exposure here would tell me that the only reason they would be doing a patch and repair rather than a full replacement, if it was needed was only because they weren't able to have access to the building for very long because of restrictions let's say in Boston or something, it could only do an emergency or that. But I mean the contractors we're dealing with are the \u2013 they're the best in the industry. They follow the best practices. I mean, nobody's going to go up and do a patch and repair when a full replacement is needed. They're just not going to do that. So if we did see any of that, it was really, I think just to get them through the restrictions that were there and then people that we associated with and sell Carlisle and work with Carlisle only do good jobs. And so I don't think you'd see any short drifting on a job or trying to get by for a couple of years. They're just going to do the right job for the customer. You're welcome. Good afternoon. Well, I'll tell you what. I don't know about Biden being elected, and I don't know what he would do for our business. But what I can tell you is if we look back, you can see the growth in our polyiso insulation that was related to two things. One was a local building code reform where people understood that doing the simple thing of adding another layer of polyiso insulation dramatically affected the energy savings in those buildings. And so we saw that run through the United States. I'm going to say starting maybe six, seven years ago it was codified in a lot of areas, it continues to be. It has become kind of standard industry practice. And if you look at our polyiso sales over the last seven years, you can see that that growth in polyiso has corresponded nicely to that. And so we think that's one of the good stories around energy efficiency savings and the Carlisle experience, and really putting together systems that can benefit from that. We've also sold a lot of, what we call, green roofs, where we have people planting kind of different things and putting ponds and things on roofs with our membranes and creating a more, I'd say, sustainable environmentally friendly roof. So I think whatever administrations there, I know our customers are looking for different ways to reduce energy expense to create a more green environment. And I think a lot of that has gained some much momentum that I don't know that you need a political agenda to do that. People are doing, because it's the right thing to do in it, and it saves them money in the long-term. I guess, and Bob can jump in on this. Give him a minute to think about it. But I think from my perspective, it goes back to that idea that we look out and I think probably Bob showed you his chart on roofs that are coming due after 20 years of life. And I think we would just say anything that wasn't done this year that fit our 70% to 80% reroofing is going to be done next year. And so I don't think there's anything that's lost there. I think that will move forward into next year. I think the biggest question again is, are we going to be facing a different work environment that's more difficult for contractors to operate, it's more difficult for them to be efficient. And if that happens, then that actually, obviously, will have an impact on how many of those projects we can get caught up in. But I think pretty much for our reroofing, it just carries over as we've seen in many situations with winters. When we have a tough winter, we pick it up the next year, or it gets added to backlog. Bob, do you want to add anything? Thank you. We're all good. You? Yes. Joel, most of the cost, I mean the large restructuring is being directed towards CIT and largely the aerospace environment as we sit here today. I mean, there was some at CCM, some at corporate, some of the other businesses, but they're smaller in magnitude. And most of those are of the what user was reactionary to bring infrastructure down with demand. On CIT, we did close one factory early in the quarter, which is a structural cost change. But a lot of it, I would say 75% of the cost reductions at CIT even are just bringing workforce both direct and indirect down with the volumes we're seeing across the aerospace business, so not a lot of structural change right now. For share. You bet, Joel. Thank you. Yes. There's a bit of a delay, I think, in the second quarter, pretty much everybody was focused on the existential threat that appeared in April. And I think then we've seen some changes. We're seeing a little bit of deal flow come back. Certainly there are some assets that are out there. But I think the big thing for us is, again, we've always tried to be very judicious in our use of funds and how much we pay and making sure that we can get the \u2013 our hurdles to be covered in our cost of capital in that. And so I think right now, when you look at the uncertainty going forward, it makes it more difficult to get a value that both seller and buyer can kind of reach and agree and think it's reasonable for both, let's say. Thank you. Well, thanks Josh. Thanks to everyone. This concludes our second quarter 2020 earnings call. We want to, again, thank you for your participation, your interest in Carlisle. I hope everybody stays healthy, and we look forward to speaking with you at the third quarter call. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies' First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Giannakouros, Carlisle's Vice President and Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Jim, please go ahead.\nJim Giannakouros: Thank you, Chantelle. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Carlisle's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. We released our first quarter financial results after the market closed today. And you can find both our press release and earnings call slide presentation on our website at www.carlisle.com in the Investor Relations section. Leading the call today are Chris Koch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Roche, our Chief Financial Officer. We will begin with Chris discussing COVID-19 impacts, the related economic reality for Carlisle, and the trends we're experiencing in our businesses as a result. Bob will discuss Carlisle's first quarter performance and current financial position. Following Chris and Bob's remarks, we will open up the line for questions. Before we begin, please refer to slide two of our presentation, where we note that certain statements made during this call may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from our expectations due to a number of factors, including impacts from COVID-19. A discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our results are provided in our press release, and in our SEC filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Those considering an investment in Carlisle should read these statements carefully, along with reviewing the reports we filed with the SEC before making an investment decision. With that, I will turn over the call to Chris.\nChris Koch: Thanks Jim. Good afternoon. Everyone, please refer to slides three through five for these opening comments. I'd like to start the call acknowledging the obvious. The impact that COVID-19 pandemic has had on all our lives. Our thoughts go out to all those affected. It's not often in the human experience that we collectively face the same global adversary that will certainly change our notions of security, community, safety, and a mere day-to-day functioning for years to come. Even more rarely do we collectively come together to unite and exhibit our humanity, understanding and compassion as human beings. One area in which Carlisle has directed its philanthropic efforts has been the cause of civility. In this crisis, we should all be mindful to observe the many examples of civility, which give us hope that when this is all over, we'll be a more understanding civil and compassionate society. All of us should take the time to express special gratitude for those on the front lines combating the coronavirus for our collective well-being as well. We know many of you on the call today reside in New York and the Tristate area as well as many major metro areas hit hard by COVID-19. I'd like to thank you for joining us and your continued interest in Carlisle Companies and wish you and your families, good health and safety during these challenging times. At Carlisle, our pledge has always been to provide a safe working environment for our employees. Our safety-first culture has reduced our incident rate well below industry standards for all our businesses. We're following best practices and guidance from recognized authorities on employee health and safety measures, including safe, hygiene and social distancing, enhanced facility cleaning and disinfecting, travel and facility access restrictions, and telecommuting where practical. As of April 20th, we've had 29 confirmed cases of coronavirus out of nearly 16,000 employees since we were first impacted in our Chinese facilities well over three months ago. In these instances, we immediately followed or exceeded the procedures, protocols and expectations of local governing authorities. After appropriate shutdown periods, we have and intend to reopen the affected facilities. We're pleased that our businesses remain operating and are considered essential in many country, states and local jurisdictions. This is evidence of the importance our products and the employees who design and produce them are. We're very pleased to be able to provide uninterrupted service to our customers who need our products to maintain critical infrastructure, support vital transportation needs, and supply critical medical products at this time. Most of our North American customers, particularly in construction, have also been considered essential and remain open for business as well. Today, nearly all of our over 100 sites globally are fully operational with the following exceptions. Nogales, Mexico; Orzinuovi, Italy; Chino, California; and two U.K. facilities in the cities of Pontypool and Belper. The crisis management protocols we follow today emerged as the coronavirus threat began to impact our facilities in China. As the virus spread across the globe, we were able to adapt and prepare for what has transformed from a regional health outbreak into a global crisis. And what has turned out to be a devastating impact on our health systems and on the global economy. As the crisis continues, we'll review and update our policies and responses accordingly. We're prudently adjusting our business operating norms in response to intensified and necessary health and safety guidelines and dramatic decline in demand as well. We intend to stay on a course of responsible business activity to maintain a stable foundation for the post-COVID-19 recovery we know will arrive. However, in the near-term, all companies, including Carlisle, must brace for adjustments to business structures, employment and pay policies as the timing remains unclear of a return to acceptable levels of safety to allow increased personnel and economic activity. While Carlisle is in a strong position to weather a prolonged economic downturn, we are making necessary adjustments to our cost structure where appropriate to maintain that strength. We remain committed to emerging in a very strong financial position and in a position to leverage anticipated future growth. Bob will provide more granularity, but I want to touch on some important areas of our financial position. Due to our strong balance sheet, in the first quarter, we were able to avoid layoffs and disruptions in our operations outside of health and safety or government-mandated shutdowns. We paid our dividend of $28 million, deployed $23 million into capital expenditures and invested close to $15 million into R&D. As of the end of the quarter, we have a strong cash position of $1.2 billion, with an additional $500 million undrawn on our credit facility. We fully expect to pay our dividend in June and anticipate increasing our dividend in September for the 44th consecutive year. We remain committed to and focused on Vision 2025, our strategic guide to achieving $15 in earnings per share. This goal remains very much intact. Some of the specifics about our businesses that reinforced our conviction include: CCM is well-positioned to exhibit resilience during this global market downturn. We still foresee a significant need for maintaining an aging U.S. infrastructure. We see a strong and growing backlog as we believe the vast majority of reroofing demand is merely being delayed, not canceled. And we will benefit from lower input costs and a highly variable cost structure. Due to our size and scale, we believe we have the lowest cost structure in the industry. CCM status as the best-in-class building products supplier continues to be evidenced through price and market leadership, superior products and service, industry leading innovation, a strong and increasing reroofing backdrop and a high-teens operating income profile. Over 60% of CCM's product are shipped directly to the job site, reinforcing the Carlisle experience daily to our contractor base. Through February, the mid-single-digit growth rate CCM experienced were in line with our expectations for 2020. However, government-mandated shutdowns and quarantining efforts intensified in March, volumes in our core U.S. commercial roofing business began to drop nearly 10% in the last two weeks of the quarter, with Europe seeing double declines -- double those declines. We anticipate second quarter sales in North America will be impacted somewhere between 20% and 30%. There have been some bright spots. We're very pleased with recent results of our newer platforms within CCM. Spray foam was able to grow in the quarter and notably through March, which we view as momentum that should continue after the current malaise in the U.S. construction market dissipates. Architectural metals maintained its momentum and was up mid-single digits organically in the first quarter with profitability improvements, both in leverage and integration efforts gaining traction. For our interconnect business, we entered 2020 already significantly burdened with declines driven by the issues surrounding Boeing 737 MAX. The emergence of COVID-19 and its impact on airline travel had an almost immediate and substantial effect on aircraft production, expectations, and aerospace manufacturing. We've all been exposed to daily information on the significant commercial aerospace downturn in its details as what has transpired in the airline industry has been front page news for weeks. Accordingly, we are actively seeking to accelerate and complete restructuring actions, many of which were contemplated in Vision 2025. Our commercial aerospace business declined approximately 20% in the quarter, accelerating into March, which saw sales levels down roughly 35%. We're anticipating declines of up to 50% in the second quarter, and we will be rightsizing our commercial aerospace business to meet the reality of what we believe will be a longer recovery by eliminating variable cost and optimizing our footprint. CIT aerospace customers are not sharing forecasts at this time, and both Boeing and Airbus are operating at extremely limited production levels. These declines were already underway in Q1 with the fully disclosed impact from the 737 MAX certification delays, which we previously estimated at $50 million in sales impact in 2020. Essential to any aerospace recovery will be a return to flying by the general population. In April, all airlines were impacted to levels previously unseen with one airline indicating a 95% drop in air travel demand. With most of the major U.S. airlines recently agreed to terms with the federal government on a bailout, we feel some clarity and stability has returned. However, it's unclear when business and personal travel will completely recover. To offset expected commercial aero declines, we are seeking new opportunities with space and defense customers, positioning to take advantage of opportunities created by undercapitalized competitors and driving product innovation. Despite the current situation, we are encouraged by the fact that aircraft manufacturers, including Boeing and Airbus, went into this downturn with a multiyear backlog of over 13,000 planes. We're hopeful that air travel will return to normal levels by mid-2021, and that airlines will continue to defer not cancel orders, allowing the multiyear backlog to be realized. CIT's Medical Technologies platform, a key focus area for both organic investment and bolt-on acquisitions, is currently benefiting from increased demand for critical medical equipment to combat COVID-19. As a result of actions, we are taking both in aerospace and the positive sales in medical. We believe CIT's end market mix will improve dramatically, potentially to a more balanced and more profitable mix than outlined in Vision 2025. Turning to CFT. As I mentioned on our quarterly calls throughout 2019, CFT entered 2020 already experiencing the impact of uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the unresolved U.S.-China trade negotiations. Added to these issues was a meaningful downturn in global automotive production that has continued to linger. These pressures were exacerbated by the pandemic spread and will likely result in a second quarter revenue decline of over 20%. We are pleased that all CFT locations are currently operational and delivering important products to our customers. A few silver linings for CFT include the multiple acquisitions to create a Sealants and Adhesives platform we made in 2019 that are integrating and performing above expectations. For the most part, customers are postponing orders not canceling, we are seeing the emergence of post-COVID demand in China, and new product launches are in line with expectations despite market headwinds. Turning to CBF. CBF was the most affected by the coronavirus. In January, our factories in Hangzhou and Suzhou, China were impacted by the government mandates. Quickly following was a complete shutdown of our Orzinuovi, Italy facility, which as a reminder, is located in the heart of the Lombardy region, the hardest hit area of Europe. Our team in Orzinuovi continues to be on a government shutdown with a minor exception for critical spare parts for agriculture. We're encouraged by the fact that outside of Italy and our facility in Pontypool, Wales, our employees are safe and now back to work. Long periods of plant idling had an obvious negative effect on CBF's first quarter performance, and we expect similar declines in the second quarter. As contemplated in our 2020 operating plan, CBF was undertaking restructuring actions to right-size the business in line with anticipated global mining, ag and construction growth rates through 2025. These actions will position CBF to be able to meet our profitability expectations in the future. Moving away from our business segments. M&A remains a key pillar for Vision 2025, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy capital into strategic and synergistic acquisitions across CCM, CIT and CFT. Our financial strength and cash flow generating capabilities afford us flexibility, and we intend to remain opportunistic. Another pillar of Vision 2025 is COS, the Carlisle Operating System, which has delivered significant savings over the last decade and will continue to be an essential tool for our businesses to rely on as they seek new opportunities to make our operations and business processes more efficient. COS continues to generate savings and efficiency gains, equaling 1.4% of sales in the first quarter that will position Carlisle well when we emerge from this downturn. Now, I'd like to point out a few key highlights of the first quarter of 2020. First, CCM exhibited its resilience, both in profitability and in maintaining positive volume growth year-over-year despite the immense pressures felt in March due to COVID-19. Even though volumes were only up 0.8% in the quarter, operating income grew almost 16% year-over-year, and operating margin expanded more than 200 basis points to 15.9% in the quarter. These gains were driven by our continued commitment to deliver a premium Carlisle experience to our customers, given strong underlying reroofing demand, solid price discipline, favorable raw material trends, and strong COS execution. Second, I'm pleased that the integration of Providien within CIT, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2019, is going extremely well. Specifically, the rapid deployment of COS, including quickly training the team and conducting Kaizen events at all four of our Providien facilities. These events are aimed at improving safety, capacity, and material flow. We've begun integrating finance, HR and IT with all initiatives tracking really well. And we've begun a customer integration process to drive cross-selling. Providien brings significant scale and adds thermoforming, injection molding and precision metal machining capabilities to our expanding component and vertically integrated medical device solutions. It opens up market adjacencies, such as robotics, drug delivery in oncology, and establishes focused new product development for CIT's growing medical platform. Third, we're very excited to have published our first ever ESG report in the first quarter of 2020, and I welcome all of you to visit our website and download a copy. While Carlisle has been a responsible corporate steward for over a century, we are at the beginning of our ESG reporting journey. We're eager to share our progress to date and plans for the future with investors, customers and the communities in which we operate. Lastly, we're extremely pleased with the progress we have made on our center-led initiatives. None more so than our supply chain work, which has dramatically improved our communications among the divisions and has helped facilitate a real-time pulse on all of our suppliers, very few of which have had any delivery issues in the first quarter or thus far into the second. Bob will now provide operational and financial detail about the first quarter and review our balance sheet and cash flow. Bob?\nBob Roche: Thank you, Chris. Please turn to the revenue bridge on slide seven of the presentation. Revenue decreased 3.9% to $1 billion in the first quarter. Organic revenue declined 7%. Acquisitions contributed 3.4% of sales growth for the quarter, and FX was a 30 basis point headwind. Turning to our margin bridge on slide eight. Q1 operating margin declined 70 basis points. Pricing and volume combined for 200 basis points, and acquisitions were a 50 basis point headwind. Offsetting these, COS added 140 basis points. Freight, labor and raw material costs netted to a 20 basis point improvement, and restructuring and rationalization costs were an additional 20 basis point tailwind. On slide nine, we have provided an EPS bridge. As Chris mentioned earlier, we reported first quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.09, which compares to $1.33 last year. Volume, price and mix combined were a $0.37 year-over-year decrease. Raw material, freight and labor costs netted to a $0.21 benefit. COS contributed $0.20. Debt extinguishment, loss and net interest expense were a negative $0.18, while taxes were an $0.08 benefit. Now, let's turn to slide 10 to review the first quarter performance by segment in more detail. As CCM revenues increased 0.8%, acquisitions contributed 0.3% of the growth. Organic growth was 0.7%, partially offset by a 20 basis point foreign currency translation headwind. Stable U.S. commercial reroofing and our Architectural Metals platform drove this performance. Operating margin at CCM was 15.9% in the quarter, a 210 basis point improvement over last year, driven by raw material and COS savings, partially offset by wage inflation. CCM executed extremely well in delivering approximately $20 million of net price cost realization in the first quarter. Turning to slide 11 to review CIT's results. CIT revenue declined 8.9% in the first quarter. This decline was driven by the crisis in commercial aerospace markets, partially offset by positive trends in our Medical Technologies platform. CIT's operating margin declined 510 basis points year-over-year to 7.3%, driven largely by the 737 MAX volume declines, raw material and wage inflation. These were partially offset by favorable mix, the impact of FX and savings from COS. Turning now to slide 12. CFT's sales declined 7.6% year-over-year. Organic revenue declined 18.8%; acquisitions added 12% in the quarter. CFT is still experiencing the lingering effects of Brexit, U.S.-China trade negotiations, and automotive market declines. These declines were exacerbated by COVID-19-related volume experienced in all regions. Operating margin at CFT declined 530 basis points year-over-year to 4.8% as significant volume declines and related deleverage were partially offset by past restructuring facility rationalization efforts, lower SG&A and efficiencies from COS. Turning to slide 13, CBF's first quarter organic revenue decline of 20.8% was due to an accelerated COVID-19-related decline in all regions, made more acute by temporary plant closures in China, Italy, and the U.K. CBF is also experiencing a continued multiyear decline in mining, ag and construction. FX also had a negative 1.4% impact. Operating loss was $3.8 million or a negative 5.4% operating margin, driven primarily by volume declines, unfavorable mix, and higher restructuring costs. On slides 14 and 15, we show selected balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong, as we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash on hand and $500 million of availability under our revolving credit line. In the quarter, we paid off the remaining $250 million balance on our 5.8% senior notes due in 2020 and re-leveraged into $750 million of 2.75% senior notes due in 2030. We deployed $121 million in the first quarter, repurchasing 950,000 shares. We paid our first quarter dividend totaling $28.3 million on March 2nd, fully expect to pay our dividend in June and anticipate increasing our dividend in September for the 44th consecutive year. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner. Investing in organic growth through capital expenditures and opportunistically repurchasing shares, while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. Free cash flow in the quarter was $30.4 million. We expect to generate free cash flow conversion in excess of 125% for the full year. Finally, we expect to maintain our strong investment credit ratings of BBB/Baa2 during this crisis. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris.\nChris Koch: Thanks Bob. Please turn to slide 16. In light of current economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we've decided to withdraw our full year 2020 revenue guidance until a clear picture emerges for our businesses. Turning to our corporate items. Corporate expense has been lowered from $100 million to $105 million to approximately $80 million for the year. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $230 million. For the full year, we continue to invest in our businesses and expect to maintain our previously stated level of capital expenditures of $100 million to $120 million. We also expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 125%. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $75 million for the year. Finally, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. At Carlisle, we remain committed to our Vision 2025 objectives, ultimately driving $15 in earnings per share. The foundations of Vision 2025 success rest on driving organic growth with leverage, utilizing COS consistently to drive efficiencies, building scale with synergistic acquisitions and deploying over $3 billion in capital. When coupled with our long-standing and defining management approach of combining continuous improvement, entrepreneurial spirit and decentralization with an increasingly center-led approach, we created a unique culture, which assures that the day-to-day energy, focus and efforts of our employees are directed towards actions that drive results and support the key initiatives within the context of our strategic plan. At CCM, where approximately 70% of our business is in reroofing, we are in the midst of the strongest reroofing cycle ever. Coupling this with our continued expansion into the building envelope, namely spray foam and architectural metal and greater focus on international markets than in years past, we believe this sets up CCM well to contribute to Carlisle's goal of 5% organic growth through the Vision 2025 period. Given the value of the Carlisle experience and the focus on delivering the most comprehensive roofing support and solutions to contractors, building owners and architects, coupled with a best-in-class cost structure and a commitment to pricing resolve, we expect profitability to hold up well relative to more cyclical end market exposures, providing a solid anchor to Carlisle's stable overall operating earnings, cash flow and returns. With CIT, we remain committed to being a premier and reliable supplier of interconnect products to the commercial aircraft, space and defense industries. With backlog still high and with airlines, in general, delaying not canceling orders, we expect the industry to return to growth once passengers are comfortable flying again. While we were disappointed with the current demand situation, we believe the fundamentals that supported the growth in airline travel will return when the situation is safe. We also believe that the actions taken during this downturn will result in a more efficient and a higher-performing CIT when volumes return. We're excited about our progress on building out CIT's global Medical Technologies business, which is well-positioned to leverage favorable industry dynamics such as aging populations and trends towards minimally invasive procedures. We maintain an appropriate and opportunistic approach to augmenting this platform with tuck-in acquisitions. At CFT, while end market exposures have challenged our ability to grow the business in recent quarters, our original CFT acquisition deal thesis remains intact as we continue to establish a solid platform on which to build going forward. While we are taking some actions on cost near terms, we will not sacrifice future growth potential for what should be a meaningful contributor to achieving Vision 2025. As we enter the second quarter in a period of increasing uncertainty, we once again express our thanks to our dedicated employees, their families, our business partners and all those associated with Carlisle's success. Given our 100-year history and the resilience this company has shown in times of diversity and uncertainty, we remain confident in Carlisle's outlook, our strong financial foundation, cash-generating capabilities, unwavering commitment to our Vision 2025 strategic plan and to providing products and services essential to the world's needs. This concludes our formal comments. Chantelle, we're ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.\nTim Wojs: Hey, good morning guys -- good afternoon guys.\nChris Koch: Good afternoon.\nTim Wojs: I guess -- thanks for all the color. I know it's pretty dynamic. I guess on CCM, and you gave us a little bit of an outlook here for Q2 on the sales side. But how confident and any kind of color you can give us on just how quickly some of the reroofing demand could snap back in your eyes? I mean, is it something where you think we have more of a moderating kind of decline as you go into the back half of the year? Or do you think it can snap back quicker than that?\nChris Koch: Well, I think there's a lot of opinions out there, Tim. I spoke with our top contractors and distributors over the last couple of weeks. And I think it's been interesting. The backlog was definitely there. We -- a lot of people were off to record starts in the first quarter. And I think there will be work to do where they're able to get on job sites in that through June. I think as we get into the second half, it gets more murky. And really, it all depends on how quickly we can free up the quotation is processed, how quickly we can get people back into the buildings for reroofing because a lot of those buildings people are out commuting from home. And so they don't want workers in there in any proximity either. In a lot of cases, not enough people there. So, my thoughts are that if we can get something in terms of a relief on some of the policies that are in place right now within the May, June time frame, it could be a good second half to the year. I think if it gets prolonged into August and September, then we start to push up against the fall. And also, I think then the ability to quote and get jobs approved and that will prove difficult. So, I didn't really give you much more there, but one of those two is probably the outcome\nTim Wojs: Yes, I guess from what you're saying, I mean, would you say more of the second quarter decline, you would say, is due to things like permitting issues and not getting access to buildings as opposed to actual demand?\nChris Koch: Yes, I think the demand was there. I think definitely, the incoming booking rates for people, the jobs that were lined up, I think, like I said, it was a good start to the year. And I think we've had a enforced slowdown, let's say, as opposed to one that had anything to do with the underlying demand.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just -- if you could give us maybe an updated outlook on what you're thinking about the cost basket in CCM? And I think previously, it was $25 million to $35 million. I think a majority of that was cost deflation. Where oil is today and just given how much you buy in terms of like poly oils and MDI, what does that kind of cost bucket look like today?\nChris Koch: So, we're -- we've moved that up to around $40 million, $45 million is our current outlook. Obviously, that can change. There could be some upside to that. But right now, we're thinking, I'd say the price cost combo is $40 million to $45 million. And I just want to add that, that does include our pricing thoughts in that $40 million to $45 million.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay. And just, I guess, the assumption is just given the raw material basket is widening in terms of the deflation, there's going to be some pressure on price?\nChris Koch: I think that's an accurate statement.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay, great. And then the last one, just on aerospace. I guess is there a way to think about what you're restructuring and kind of the what's available to restructure, I guess, if aerospace does kind of go through a more prolonged slump here?\nBob Roche: Yes. Tim, as you know, this is Bob, we definitely took out a lot of, I'll call it, factories over the last couple of years, as you well know. So, I don't think there's a lot of sizable footprint reduction to be done, but the team is reducing costs with what they see volumes doing. And some of that can be done through overtime reductions and temporary workforce and others, but there will be some reductions in that business due to the fact that volumes in aero are expecting to be down so sizable this year.\nTim Wojs: Okay. All right. I'll hop back in queue. Good luck on rest of the year guys. Thank you.\nChris Koch: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nBryan Blair: Good afternoon guys. I hope everyone is safe and doing well.\nChris Koch: Thanks.\nBob Roche: Thank you, Bryan.\nBryan Blair: I wanted to follow up on CCM's volume cadence year-to-date. I know it was solid January, February. Declines as of the back half of March, and I assume that you're seeing peak or what you expect to be almost peak declines in April. Is that the 20% to 30% range that you've cited for the second quarter or is April different than that rate?\nChris Koch: So, I think you're seeing -- yes, it's indicative of that, that 20% to 30%. I mean, it may accelerate a little bit start entering in April and the 20% and move up a little bit as we get further on, but that's our thought right now.\nBryan Blair: Got it. Okay. And then sorry if I missed this, did you cite the organic growth rate for CIT Medical in the quarter?\nChris Koch: We did not cite the organic growth rate for CIT Medical on the call. Let me get back to you on that, all right?\nBryan Blair: Okay. Just in terms of that outlook, second quarter and full year to the extent that you can offer directional guide, should that remain resilient, perhaps grow in this environment or are there offsets to the underlying demand expansion?\nChris Koch: Bryan, can you rephrase that question for me?\nBryan Blair: Sure. I'm speaking specifically to CIT Medical again. Should that remain in positive territory in terms of core growth rate in the second quarter and the full year or are there offsets then?\nChris Koch: No, I think it should remain positive. And we continue to -- actually we expand our capabilities without digressing too much. There's been a lot of work by Bill and the team in Providien and Lars, the leader of our RedGroup organization and then our existing wire and cable medical people to facilitate greater coordination. And I would say we're getting greater access, and we're seeing greater demand for projects at existing customers and some new customers. The only impact would be some of the telecommuting or the, I say, travel restraints have hurt some of the new contacts where we'd like to be out there with the engineers working with them in the field. But other than that, our growth rates are good. And in terms of organic growth in the first quarter for CIT Medical, it was in the 12%, 13% range.\nBryan Blair: Okay. Good to hear. And last one on the stepped-up restructuring in CIT, how should we think about the payback period there?\nBob Roche: Yes, the payback is probably close to a year or less, Bryan.\nBryan Blair: Okay, excellent. Thanks guys.\nChris Koch: Yes, thank you, Bryan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks. Good afternoon.\nChris Koch: Good afternoon.\nSaree Boroditsky: So, I wanted to see what is driving your assumption for higher free cash flow conversion for the full year. And then for my second question, just given that your balance sheet is in really good shape. How are you thinking about capital allocation between share repurchases and acquisitions, just given the uncertainty in the current environment?\nBob Roche: Yes. On your -- I'll start with the second one. On -- our priorities aren't changing. They're continuing with -- we're looking for acquisitions. In these times, obviously, acquisitions have slowed down with everybody's business being where it is. We're hopeful that will pick back up in the second half and we want to continue to be acquisitive with our strength. And then we will continue to be opportunistic in repurchasing shares as we see -- as we move through the rest of the year.\nChris Koch: And then the question, Bob, on the 125% free cash flow.\nBob Roche: Yes, 125% free cash flow. In times when revenue is shrinking in this business, we will obviously reduce inventory. Most of it is working capital-driven because it will reduce inventory and receivables will come down.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great. Thank you for taking my question.\nChris Koch: Yes, just one -- I'll just add one more thing on the M&A because I'm sure it will come up. The pipeline you see has been, I would say, it slowed down dramatically when this started. I think there's, obviously, a lot of people that are not looking to monetize their assets at this time. So, I think things will start to free up as we see how long this goes on and people get some more stability, and we'll be there on those assets we've identified within CCM, CIT and CFT to act if there's opportunities that present themselves.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nChris Koch: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nGarik Shmois: Hi, thanks. Thanks for the color and staff environment. Just wanted to start off just on CCM. Just as far as the weakness that you're seeing right now. Are these mostly project delays, the best that you can tell? Or are you seeing outright cancellations in which your customers are saying, you know what, we just don't have the visibility and we'll get back to you at some point in the future whether or not we want to reroof?\nChris Koch: Well, I think in terms of our impact, I think really at the contractor level, they're mostly, I would say, delayed. I don't have the exact ratio, but I would say that the ratio of cancellations to delays favors delays by far. For us, we also sell a considerable amount of our product through distribution. And one of the effects that's exacerbated our volume declines has been this is typically the season when our distributors start to load up on product to get ready for the summer months and the two quarters in the summer, second and third that are typically our big quarters. So, they've been looking, I think, for the most part, and you know the big ones, they've been looking to serve cash. And so we've seen a big drop-off on that. With that said, we've still been producing, we've still been inventorying. And we, as I said in the call, intend to be to make sure our contractors are supplied with products. So been a little bit of a drop-off there that's exacerbated that volume decline. But I think for the most part, to answer your question again, mostly delays.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. Thanks. And just one more on CCM. You called out in the slide, health0care and education is, I guess, relative bright spots. Are you seeing some activity getting pulled forward into the second quarter, just given some maybe some capacity availability in some of those verticals? And maybe if you do whip around on some of the different verticals in CCM?\nChris Koch: Well, I think, obviously, the education one's an easy one to touch on. I don't have numbers I'm going to give you, but what I'd say is with the children and students out of school, it's given some people, I think, some thoughts that maybe they should get the work done now. Because what happens if we need to bring people back to school earlier in the summer, we won't have that same window. And then healthcare, obviously, there's a big focus on healthcare right now and just no sense that anybody wants a delay there. And certainly, we can't have any leaking or dysfunctionality in a roof that's over a nursing home or a medical facility. Obviously, these people have enough to deal with; they don't need to deal with that. So, I know our contractors are taking care of that immediately, and that's a primary focus for them. So, Bob, I don't know, do you want to add anything on any verticals there?\nBob Roche: No, I think, yes, you covered it, Chris, that the education and healthcare is what we're seeing right now.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. Thanks. Just lastly, just on the CapEx guidance. You maintained that. So I'm just kind of curious as to how you're thinking about CapEx this year. You've taken some restructuring actions that you put forward in accelerating, but at what point will that potential need to be adjusted, if at all?\nChris Koch: Yes, I think that's -- I'll start, and then Bob can continue. But I think that's why we emphasize the Vision 2025. Typically, when we make capital investments, they are done for the longevity of the business and not being in a position where that's going to impact our performance from a cash perspective or put us into a situation where we can't deliver on our other commitments. We don't see any point in hesitating. Specifically in CCM, I mean, we don't view this to be a -- I mean there's still a lot of product going through CCM. CCM still maintains a great position in the industry. It's viewed as the premium product. We want to make sure that all of our facilities are, first of all, safe. So, if there's any safety CapEx that goes through. And then anything that's going to drive efficiency, product quality improvements, expansions into new markets, specifically in some of our acquisitions like spray foam, or an architectural metal, we're going to continue to do those. Because, as I said, we think we have the lowest cost operating structure, and we want to continue to maintain that. Bob, anything?\nBob Roche: Yes. No. And Garik, as Chris said, most of this CapEx in the year is skewed towards CCM. We had already brought CIT down with the known MAX issues we talked about in February. So, we're -- and we intend to be offensive. And a lot of our projects are cost related, where we're taking costs out, automating and like Chris said, safety. So, we don't see the need or -- say, opportunity to cut that because it will hurt the business longer term.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. Thanks for the help.\nChris Koch: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research.\nKevin Hocevar: Hey good evening everybody. I hope everybody is healthy and doing well.\nChris Koch: Good evening.\nKevin Hocevar: Chris, hoping to dissect the down 20% to 30% comments for -- in the CCM business one other way. Curious, there are certain parts of the country that are more prohibitive in terms of construction activity, like Boston, New York, Michigan, et cetera, versus others that have deemed are less prohibitive in terms of construction activity. So, curious, are what -- curious what type of declines you're seeing in those more prohibitive places versus the rest of the country?\nChris Koch: Well, I think the declines are pretty substantial. I know when I was talking to one of our contractors in Pennsylvania, who also had branches in Ohio, Pennsylvania basically shut down and Ohio still operating and still fulfilling the backlog that they were working on. So, I think it's pretty dramatic. I think in a place like Boston as well or Washington State, I think New York, Pennsylvania, Washington State, Michigan. I mean, they're serious about it, and it's a big difference.\nKevin Hocevar: Got you. And then in terms of -- what can building owners do to it sounds like the projects that are in the backlog right now are getting delayed. But what about new bidding activity? And what are -- are building owners instead of just delaying, are they taking other actions to -- as opposed to waiting a couple of months or a year to replace the roof, are they taking other actions to defer that spending in terms of patch and repair, putting a coating on top, whatever? Just curious, your thoughts in terms of what other actions building owners can do? And are they taking those actions now to really defer the bigger spend of the full replacement of the roof?\nChris Koch: My knowledge is now, let's say, a week old. And in this time, that seems to be a lot. But I think I'd say most building owners probably don't have this at the top of their list. To be perfectly frank, I think with the rental -- with the rents and people not paying rents or delaying rents or the economic situation of their tenants and things like this, my guess is that if they have a project underway and it's gotten inspection approval and they're in the midst of it, they complete it, my guess is if you have an emergency situation on a leak and you're able to fix it, you're fixing it. Nobody wants to operate a building where whether it's a warehouse or anything else that has those issues, you're just destroying the product or creating an unsafe situation for your workers. But my guess is, after that, with few exceptions right now, they're focused on that income-generating side of it. And also, really, the lives of their people that they rent from them, and in many cases, have been renting for many years and are suffering financial disaster. I think they'll turn to the roots a little bit later, but my guess is we haven't seen -- I mean, I just haven't seen enough to address your question with any more granularity than that.\nKevin Hocevar: Sure. And it might be -- my last question, in terms of -- it might be tough to say at this point, but 2019 was then seemingly the peak this cycle for demand. 2020 will be down something. Is this -- does it take -- how long does it take do you think to recover to get back to that 2019 type peak level? Is that something that, given the resiliency and the primarily retrofit side of thing, is that something within a year or two could get back to 2019 levels or does that take a couple of years before we fully recover?\nChris Koch: I'll put it for you this way. We had constraints on labor that had built up some of the highest backlogs we've had in this industry, specifically with our team, it's been 70% reroof, which we know is -- we have to do it. I think it's one of the first things you need to do to create a safe and obviously, feasible working space for the people to work in the building. So, my guess is when things get released, it is going to be a rapid return. I know the contractors are ready. We've got -- they're trained, they have product, they're professionals. I mean, they're ready to go as soon as it happens. And as I said, I don't really believe any demand is being destroyed. I believe that it's sitting there and it's even building because remember, reroofing is an ongoing process. So, anything that's not being reroof now is sitting there, it's working its way towards being reroofed. If it's in year 2017 and we wait a year, now it's in year 2018. So, it's generally 20 years when we need to have them reroof. So, yes, I think a rapid recovery once these restrictions get lifted.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay, makes sense. Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open.\nJoel Tiss: Hey guys. How is it going?\nChris Koch: Joel, good evening. Fine. Thank you. Hope you're well too.\nJoel Tiss: Finally, get to; I have a beer while I listen to conference calls.\nChris Koch: That's nice.\nJoel Tiss: I have kind of a weird question. How do you think, like, you've probably been talking to people who've been doing this for a long time. And how do you think about demand for buildings for square footage as we go into 2021 and 2022? Like, I understand the backlog that's there is going to want to -- people are going to want to knock it out quick. But longer term, like if restaurants go bankrupt or businesses stop, whatever, aren't around anymore or more people work from home. Like, can you -- have you talked to anybody about kind of structural issues that might change this business over the next decade?\nChris Koch: Joel, it's interesting. We have spent some time looking into that and talking. Obviously, there's a wide variety of opinions, and I think it's appropriate. I think we see things like education, and we knew there were already trends to online learning, and we wonder what that impact will be on the physical plants. Yes, we also look back over events that have occurred over the last few years, the Great Recession, 9/11, things like that, and we know that small colleges and universities continued in a lot of ways to behave like they used to. So, will it be a rapid transformation? I don't know. Medical is one that people have said, that the digital transformation that was already occurring on medical records on maybe FaceTiming with your physician will be accelerated, and maybe we won't go back from that. But I still think in terms of hospitals and that, what we're seeing out of this is that the infrastructure may not have been what we want it to be in certain cases. And so we may see an enhanced construction around new facilities with better capabilities to address surges and things like that. Certainly, the use of the Internet for shopping, I know in my family and me personally, we're doing a lot of that. That's a trend that had been building anyway. It looks like it's going to continue to build. Amazon seems to be showcasing what they can do in this situation. So, yes, it will be interesting. I think there's going to be -- I don't really have an answer for you other than in some places, it will be affected. In others, I think we'll go right back to probably doing things the way we were already doing. But I think in terms of the net-net, we're still going to be in a really good place, at least through the reroofing backlog and probably into 2030, 2032, somewhere in there.\nJoel Tiss: Okay, that's good. And then just on acquisitions, I know, whatever, it's probably not appropriate timing to think about it. But have you rethought about where you would take like maybe something that you really, really would love to have all of a sudden becomes available in six months? Is there sort of a limit that you would take the debt-to-EBITDA to? Or has that -- have you thought about like changing that or like just what's your thought process there? Thank you.\nChris Koch: No, no. Yes. I think -- no, I think on acquisitions, there's a pause. Obviously, one of the reasons is the integration and the due diligence issues not being able to get there and all that, you understand that. And we have thought about it. I think our strategy; we've come back and said, at least from a target perspective, we want to do the same things we're doing in CCM, CIT and CFT. And then I think, Bob, you want to just touch on the debt. I don't think it changes--\nBob Roche: Yes. We're at 1.6% net debt-to-EBITDA right now, Joel. We have -- our covenants don't allow us to go above 3.5%. Like we said, with the size of things we see out there, it's hard getting above 2.5%, but we -- if something, the prime target came up, we'd go to 3% probably.\nJoel Tiss: Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you.\nChris Koch: Thanks Joel.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.\nDavid MacGregor: Hi, good afternoon.\nChris Koch: Hi David.\nDavid MacGregor: I guess as the economy goes through its reopening, whatever that might ultimately end up looking like, how do you position the business tactically to achieve maximum possible recovery?\nChris Koch: Well, I think we just -- we're in a very, I guess, advantageous position. We have really been able -- like I said, all of our factories have stayed open. We always invest in safety. We invest in efficiency. We've got a great leader, Doug Taylor with COS. He's been here for five years. He and his team, they work every day. Whether the economy is doing well or not, they're working on ways to earn more money for us, operate more efficiently. So, in terms of positioning, I think you do all that work before you get to this point. And you have an organization like we do with a lot of great people who are just -- they're ready to go, they've got the capabilities. They've got everything we need. We've got great suppliers. Like I said, we haven't had really any issues with the supply chain. They're ready to go. So, I think we're positioned to do it. I mean it's -- go ahead, Bob.\nBob Roche: And just to add CCM specifically, I mean, normally, during the first quarter, we're building inventory for the season anyway. And this just allowed us to build more with the slowdown we have in taking products. So, like Chris said, we expect demand to come back at CCM. We have -- I'm going to say, excess inventory. We have a lot of inventory because we will build that anyway. So, we're ready to serve our customers as soon as it comes back.\nDavid MacGregor: Good. I guess if I could get you to maybe go back and talk a little bit more about what you're seeing right now in terms of bidding activity, and I'm guessing it's slowed. But to what extent are you seeing bidding activity? What are the patterns you may be seeing there right now that maybe surprised you a little bit given the slowdown? And to what extent are you seeing more aggressive pricing in these bids?\nChris Koch: I can't comment on really any -- I haven't seen any pricing action in the bids. I think, as I said, people are focused on maybe completing the jobs they've got. And I think there is substantial trouble in getting these quotes and bids out. I look at the retail or the consumer. General housing, and we saw the results that traffic is down and inventories are down on residential. But one of the problems with selling a house is you can't get -- nobody wants to open their house to have you come by and take a look. I think the same is true in commercial. We've got that issue. We've got some place to shelter in place. You can't leave your home anyway in San Francisco or whatever. So, yes, it's impactful. I don't think the pricing is and the bids is probably impacted right now or the first thing they're thinking about. Yes, I can't give you a lot of clarity other than that.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. If I could maybe just squeeze one more in quickly. The second quarter outlook, you've provided some clarity around your expectations there. Can you talk about what you're expecting in terms of distributors out the door sales trends in the second quarter?\nChris Koch: I can't. I think that we have -- like I said, we have good access to the contractors in that. I think distribution is probably saying the same things we are. And yes, I can't because each distributor, at least the big ones, they're all different, they all operate in a different way in different regions. So, I would just -- I guess, my general comment would be they're probably seeing the same things as we are.\nBob Roche: Yes. And 60%, 65% of our product is shipped from our facility straight to the job site due to the size. So, it's not normal for distribution to hold that much anyway. Like Chris said, in these months, they build up a little bit, getting ready for the summer. But most of the jobs shipped directly from our warehouses, which is why we're building it indoor to get ready for the--\nDavid MacGregor: Great. Thanks very much. Stay well.\nChris Koch: Thank you\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to the presenters.\nChris Koch: Thanks Chantelle. This concludes our first quarter 2020 earnings call. Thanks everybody for your participation. We look forward to speaking with you on the next earnings call and having a -- hopefully, more clarity on where we are in the situation. Be safe. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bob Roche",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Please turn to the revenue bridge on slide seven of the presentation. Revenue decreased 3.9% to $1 billion in the first quarter. Organic revenue declined 7%. Acquisitions contributed 3.4% of sales growth for the quarter, and FX was a 30 basis point headwind. Turning to our margin bridge on slide eight. Q1 operating margin declined 70 basis points. Pricing and volume combined for 200 basis points, and acquisitions were a 50 basis point headwind. Offsetting these, COS added 140 basis points. Freight, labor and raw material costs netted to a 20 basis point improvement, and restructuring and rationalization costs were an additional 20 basis point tailwind. On slide nine, we have provided an EPS bridge. As Chris mentioned earlier, we reported first quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.09, which compares to $1.33 last year. Volume, price and mix combined were a $0.37 year-over-year decrease. Raw material, freight and labor costs netted to a $0.21 benefit. COS contributed $0.20. Debt extinguishment, loss and net interest expense were a negative $0.18, while taxes were an $0.08 benefit. Now, let's turn to slide 10 to review the first quarter performance by segment in more detail. As CCM revenues increased 0.8%, acquisitions contributed 0.3% of the growth. Organic growth was 0.7%, partially offset by a 20 basis point foreign currency translation headwind. Stable U.S. commercial reroofing and our Architectural Metals platform drove this performance. Operating margin at CCM was 15.9% in the quarter, a 210 basis point improvement over last year, driven by raw material and COS savings, partially offset by wage inflation. CCM executed extremely well in delivering approximately $20 million of net price cost realization in the first quarter. Turning to slide 11 to review CIT's results. CIT revenue declined 8.9% in the first quarter. This decline was driven by the crisis in commercial aerospace markets, partially offset by positive trends in our Medical Technologies platform. CIT's operating margin declined 510 basis points year-over-year to 7.3%, driven largely by the 737 MAX volume declines, raw material and wage inflation. These were partially offset by favorable mix, the impact of FX and savings from COS. Turning now to slide 12. CFT's sales declined 7.6% year-over-year. Organic revenue declined 18.8%; acquisitions added 12% in the quarter. CFT is still experiencing the lingering effects of Brexit, U.S.-China trade negotiations, and automotive market declines. These declines were exacerbated by COVID-19-related volume experienced in all regions. Operating margin at CFT declined 530 basis points year-over-year to 4.8% as significant volume declines and related deleverage were partially offset by past restructuring facility rationalization efforts, lower SG&A and efficiencies from COS. Turning to slide 13, CBF's first quarter organic revenue decline of 20.8% was due to an accelerated COVID-19-related decline in all regions, made more acute by temporary plant closures in China, Italy, and the U.K. CBF is also experiencing a continued multiyear decline in mining, ag and construction. FX also had a negative 1.4% impact. Operating loss was $3.8 million or a negative 5.4% operating margin, driven primarily by volume declines, unfavorable mix, and higher restructuring costs. On slides 14 and 15, we show selected balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong, as we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash on hand and $500 million of availability under our revolving credit line. In the quarter, we paid off the remaining $250 million balance on our 5.8% senior notes due in 2020 and re-leveraged into $750 million of 2.75% senior notes due in 2030. We deployed $121 million in the first quarter, repurchasing 950,000 shares. We paid our first quarter dividend totaling $28.3 million on March 2nd, fully expect to pay our dividend in June and anticipate increasing our dividend in September for the 44th consecutive year. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner. Investing in organic growth through capital expenditures and opportunistically repurchasing shares, while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. Free cash flow in the quarter was $30.4 million. We expect to generate free cash flow conversion in excess of 125% for the full year. Finally, we expect to maintain our strong investment credit ratings of BBB/Baa2 during this crisis. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris. Yes. Tim, as you know, this is Bob, we definitely took out a lot of, I'll call it, factories over the last couple of years, as you well know. So, I don't think there's a lot of sizable footprint reduction to be done, but the team is reducing costs with what they see volumes doing. And some of that can be done through overtime reductions and temporary workforce and others, but there will be some reductions in that business due to the fact that volumes in aero are expecting to be down so sizable this year. Thank you, Bryan. Yes, the payback is probably close to a year or less, Bryan. Yes. On your -- I'll start with the second one. On -- our priorities aren't changing. They're continuing with -- we're looking for acquisitions. In these times, obviously, acquisitions have slowed down with everybody's business being where it is. We're hopeful that will pick back up in the second half and we want to continue to be acquisitive with our strength. And then we will continue to be opportunistic in repurchasing shares as we see -- as we move through the rest of the year. Yes, 125% free cash flow. In times when revenue is shrinking in this business, we will obviously reduce inventory. Most of it is working capital-driven because it will reduce inventory and receivables will come down. No, I think, yes, you covered it, Chris, that the education and healthcare is what we're seeing right now. Yes. No. And Garik, as Chris said, most of this CapEx in the year is skewed towards CCM. We had already brought CIT down with the known MAX issues we talked about in February. So, we're -- and we intend to be offensive. And a lot of our projects are cost related, where we're taking costs out, automating and like Chris said, safety. So, we don't see the need or -- say, opportunity to cut that because it will hurt the business longer term. Yes. We're at 1.6% net debt-to-EBITDA right now, Joel. We have -- our covenants don't allow us to go above 3.5%. Like we said, with the size of things we see out there, it's hard getting above 2.5%, but we -- if something, the prime target came up, we'd go to 3% probably.

            "name": "Chris Koch",
            "content": "Thanks Jim. Good afternoon. Everyone, please refer to slides three through five for these opening comments. I'd like to start the call acknowledging the obvious. The impact that COVID-19 pandemic has had on all our lives. Our thoughts go out to all those affected. It's not often in the human experience that we collectively face the same global adversary that will certainly change our notions of security, community, safety, and a mere day-to-day functioning for years to come. Even more rarely do we collectively come together to unite and exhibit our humanity, understanding and compassion as human beings. One area in which Carlisle has directed its philanthropic efforts has been the cause of civility. In this crisis, we should all be mindful to observe the many examples of civility, which give us hope that when this is all over, we'll be a more understanding civil and compassionate society. All of us should take the time to express special gratitude for those on the front lines combating the coronavirus for our collective well-being as well. We know many of you on the call today reside in New York and the Tristate area as well as many major metro areas hit hard by COVID-19. I'd like to thank you for joining us and your continued interest in Carlisle Companies and wish you and your families, good health and safety during these challenging times. At Carlisle, our pledge has always been to provide a safe working environment for our employees. Our safety-first culture has reduced our incident rate well below industry standards for all our businesses. We're following best practices and guidance from recognized authorities on employee health and safety measures, including safe, hygiene and social distancing, enhanced facility cleaning and disinfecting, travel and facility access restrictions, and telecommuting where practical. As of April 20th, we've had 29 confirmed cases of coronavirus out of nearly 16,000 employees since we were first impacted in our Chinese facilities well over three months ago. In these instances, we immediately followed or exceeded the procedures, protocols and expectations of local governing authorities. After appropriate shutdown periods, we have and intend to reopen the affected facilities. We're pleased that our businesses remain operating and are considered essential in many country, states and local jurisdictions. This is evidence of the importance our products and the employees who design and produce them are. We're very pleased to be able to provide uninterrupted service to our customers who need our products to maintain critical infrastructure, support vital transportation needs, and supply critical medical products at this time. Most of our North American customers, particularly in construction, have also been considered essential and remain open for business as well. Today, nearly all of our over 100 sites globally are fully operational with the following exceptions. Nogales, Mexico; Orzinuovi, Italy; Chino, California; and two U.K. facilities in the cities of Pontypool and Belper. The crisis management protocols we follow today emerged as the coronavirus threat began to impact our facilities in China. As the virus spread across the globe, we were able to adapt and prepare for what has transformed from a regional health outbreak into a global crisis. And what has turned out to be a devastating impact on our health systems and on the global economy. As the crisis continues, we'll review and update our policies and responses accordingly. We're prudently adjusting our business operating norms in response to intensified and necessary health and safety guidelines and dramatic decline in demand as well. We intend to stay on a course of responsible business activity to maintain a stable foundation for the post-COVID-19 recovery we know will arrive. However, in the near-term, all companies, including Carlisle, must brace for adjustments to business structures, employment and pay policies as the timing remains unclear of a return to acceptable levels of safety to allow increased personnel and economic activity. While Carlisle is in a strong position to weather a prolonged economic downturn, we are making necessary adjustments to our cost structure where appropriate to maintain that strength. We remain committed to emerging in a very strong financial position and in a position to leverage anticipated future growth. Bob will provide more granularity, but I want to touch on some important areas of our financial position. Due to our strong balance sheet, in the first quarter, we were able to avoid layoffs and disruptions in our operations outside of health and safety or government-mandated shutdowns. We paid our dividend of $28 million, deployed $23 million into capital expenditures and invested close to $15 million into R&D. As of the end of the quarter, we have a strong cash position of $1.2 billion, with an additional $500 million undrawn on our credit facility. We fully expect to pay our dividend in June and anticipate increasing our dividend in September for the 44th consecutive year. We remain committed to and focused on Vision 2025, our strategic guide to achieving $15 in earnings per share. This goal remains very much intact. Some of the specifics about our businesses that reinforced our conviction include: CCM is well-positioned to exhibit resilience during this global market downturn. We still foresee a significant need for maintaining an aging U.S. infrastructure. We see a strong and growing backlog as we believe the vast majority of reroofing demand is merely being delayed, not canceled. And we will benefit from lower input costs and a highly variable cost structure. Due to our size and scale, we believe we have the lowest cost structure in the industry. CCM status as the best-in-class building products supplier continues to be evidenced through price and market leadership, superior products and service, industry leading innovation, a strong and increasing reroofing backdrop and a high-teens operating income profile. Over 60% of CCM's product are shipped directly to the job site, reinforcing the Carlisle experience daily to our contractor base. Through February, the mid-single-digit growth rate CCM experienced were in line with our expectations for 2020. However, government-mandated shutdowns and quarantining efforts intensified in March, volumes in our core U.S. commercial roofing business began to drop nearly 10% in the last two weeks of the quarter, with Europe seeing double declines -- double those declines. We anticipate second quarter sales in North America will be impacted somewhere between 20% and 30%. There have been some bright spots. We're very pleased with recent results of our newer platforms within CCM. Spray foam was able to grow in the quarter and notably through March, which we view as momentum that should continue after the current malaise in the U.S. construction market dissipates. Architectural metals maintained its momentum and was up mid-single digits organically in the first quarter with profitability improvements, both in leverage and integration efforts gaining traction. For our interconnect business, we entered 2020 already significantly burdened with declines driven by the issues surrounding Boeing 737 MAX. The emergence of COVID-19 and its impact on airline travel had an almost immediate and substantial effect on aircraft production, expectations, and aerospace manufacturing. We've all been exposed to daily information on the significant commercial aerospace downturn in its details as what has transpired in the airline industry has been front page news for weeks. Accordingly, we are actively seeking to accelerate and complete restructuring actions, many of which were contemplated in Vision 2025. Our commercial aerospace business declined approximately 20% in the quarter, accelerating into March, which saw sales levels down roughly 35%. We're anticipating declines of up to 50% in the second quarter, and we will be rightsizing our commercial aerospace business to meet the reality of what we believe will be a longer recovery by eliminating variable cost and optimizing our footprint. CIT aerospace customers are not sharing forecasts at this time, and both Boeing and Airbus are operating at extremely limited production levels. These declines were already underway in Q1 with the fully disclosed impact from the 737 MAX certification delays, which we previously estimated at $50 million in sales impact in 2020. Essential to any aerospace recovery will be a return to flying by the general population. In April, all airlines were impacted to levels previously unseen with one airline indicating a 95% drop in air travel demand. With most of the major U.S. airlines recently agreed to terms with the federal government on a bailout, we feel some clarity and stability has returned. However, it's unclear when business and personal travel will completely recover. To offset expected commercial aero declines, we are seeking new opportunities with space and defense customers, positioning to take advantage of opportunities created by undercapitalized competitors and driving product innovation. Despite the current situation, we are encouraged by the fact that aircraft manufacturers, including Boeing and Airbus, went into this downturn with a multiyear backlog of over 13,000 planes. We're hopeful that air travel will return to normal levels by mid-2021, and that airlines will continue to defer not cancel orders, allowing the multiyear backlog to be realized. CIT's Medical Technologies platform, a key focus area for both organic investment and bolt-on acquisitions, is currently benefiting from increased demand for critical medical equipment to combat COVID-19. As a result of actions, we are taking both in aerospace and the positive sales in medical. We believe CIT's end market mix will improve dramatically, potentially to a more balanced and more profitable mix than outlined in Vision 2025. Turning to CFT. As I mentioned on our quarterly calls throughout 2019, CFT entered 2020 already experiencing the impact of uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the unresolved U.S.-China trade negotiations. Added to these issues was a meaningful downturn in global automotive production that has continued to linger. These pressures were exacerbated by the pandemic spread and will likely result in a second quarter revenue decline of over 20%. We are pleased that all CFT locations are currently operational and delivering important products to our customers. A few silver linings for CFT include the multiple acquisitions to create a Sealants and Adhesives platform we made in 2019 that are integrating and performing above expectations. For the most part, customers are postponing orders not canceling, we are seeing the emergence of post-COVID demand in China, and new product launches are in line with expectations despite market headwinds. Turning to CBF. CBF was the most affected by the coronavirus. In January, our factories in Hangzhou and Suzhou, China were impacted by the government mandates. Quickly following was a complete shutdown of our Orzinuovi, Italy facility, which as a reminder, is located in the heart of the Lombardy region, the hardest hit area of Europe. Our team in Orzinuovi continues to be on a government shutdown with a minor exception for critical spare parts for agriculture. We're encouraged by the fact that outside of Italy and our facility in Pontypool, Wales, our employees are safe and now back to work. Long periods of plant idling had an obvious negative effect on CBF's first quarter performance, and we expect similar declines in the second quarter. As contemplated in our 2020 operating plan, CBF was undertaking restructuring actions to right-size the business in line with anticipated global mining, ag and construction growth rates through 2025. These actions will position CBF to be able to meet our profitability expectations in the future. Moving away from our business segments. M&A remains a key pillar for Vision 2025, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy capital into strategic and synergistic acquisitions across CCM, CIT and CFT. Our financial strength and cash flow generating capabilities afford us flexibility, and we intend to remain opportunistic. Another pillar of Vision 2025 is COS, the Carlisle Operating System, which has delivered significant savings over the last decade and will continue to be an essential tool for our businesses to rely on as they seek new opportunities to make our operations and business processes more efficient. COS continues to generate savings and efficiency gains, equaling 1.4% of sales in the first quarter that will position Carlisle well when we emerge from this downturn. Now, I'd like to point out a few key highlights of the first quarter of 2020. First, CCM exhibited its resilience, both in profitability and in maintaining positive volume growth year-over-year despite the immense pressures felt in March due to COVID-19. Even though volumes were only up 0.8% in the quarter, operating income grew almost 16% year-over-year, and operating margin expanded more than 200 basis points to 15.9% in the quarter. These gains were driven by our continued commitment to deliver a premium Carlisle experience to our customers, given strong underlying reroofing demand, solid price discipline, favorable raw material trends, and strong COS execution. Second, I'm pleased that the integration of Providien within CIT, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2019, is going extremely well. Specifically, the rapid deployment of COS, including quickly training the team and conducting Kaizen events at all four of our Providien facilities. These events are aimed at improving safety, capacity, and material flow. We've begun integrating finance, HR and IT with all initiatives tracking really well. And we've begun a customer integration process to drive cross-selling. Providien brings significant scale and adds thermoforming, injection molding and precision metal machining capabilities to our expanding component and vertically integrated medical device solutions. It opens up market adjacencies, such as robotics, drug delivery in oncology, and establishes focused new product development for CIT's growing medical platform. Third, we're very excited to have published our first ever ESG report in the first quarter of 2020, and I welcome all of you to visit our website and download a copy. While Carlisle has been a responsible corporate steward for over a century, we are at the beginning of our ESG reporting journey. We're eager to share our progress to date and plans for the future with investors, customers and the communities in which we operate. Lastly, we're extremely pleased with the progress we have made on our center-led initiatives. None more so than our supply chain work, which has dramatically improved our communications among the divisions and has helped facilitate a real-time pulse on all of our suppliers, very few of which have had any delivery issues in the first quarter or thus far into the second. Bob will now provide operational and financial detail about the first quarter and review our balance sheet and cash flow. Bob? Thanks Bob. Please turn to slide 16. In light of current economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we've decided to withdraw our full year 2020 revenue guidance until a clear picture emerges for our businesses. Turning to our corporate items. Corporate expense has been lowered from $100 million to $105 million to approximately $80 million for the year. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $230 million. For the full year, we continue to invest in our businesses and expect to maintain our previously stated level of capital expenditures of $100 million to $120 million. We also expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 125%. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $75 million for the year. Finally, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. At Carlisle, we remain committed to our Vision 2025 objectives, ultimately driving $15 in earnings per share. The foundations of Vision 2025 success rest on driving organic growth with leverage, utilizing COS consistently to drive efficiencies, building scale with synergistic acquisitions and deploying over $3 billion in capital. When coupled with our long-standing and defining management approach of combining continuous improvement, entrepreneurial spirit and decentralization with an increasingly center-led approach, we created a unique culture, which assures that the day-to-day energy, focus and efforts of our employees are directed towards actions that drive results and support the key initiatives within the context of our strategic plan. At CCM, where approximately 70% of our business is in reroofing, we are in the midst of the strongest reroofing cycle ever. Coupling this with our continued expansion into the building envelope, namely spray foam and architectural metal and greater focus on international markets than in years past, we believe this sets up CCM well to contribute to Carlisle's goal of 5% organic growth through the Vision 2025 period. Given the value of the Carlisle experience and the focus on delivering the most comprehensive roofing support and solutions to contractors, building owners and architects, coupled with a best-in-class cost structure and a commitment to pricing resolve, we expect profitability to hold up well relative to more cyclical end market exposures, providing a solid anchor to Carlisle's stable overall operating earnings, cash flow and returns. With CIT, we remain committed to being a premier and reliable supplier of interconnect products to the commercial aircraft, space and defense industries. With backlog still high and with airlines, in general, delaying not canceling orders, we expect the industry to return to growth once passengers are comfortable flying again. While we were disappointed with the current demand situation, we believe the fundamentals that supported the growth in airline travel will return when the situation is safe. We also believe that the actions taken during this downturn will result in a more efficient and a higher-performing CIT when volumes return. We're excited about our progress on building out CIT's global Medical Technologies business, which is well-positioned to leverage favorable industry dynamics such as aging populations and trends towards minimally invasive procedures. We maintain an appropriate and opportunistic approach to augmenting this platform with tuck-in acquisitions. At CFT, while end market exposures have challenged our ability to grow the business in recent quarters, our original CFT acquisition deal thesis remains intact as we continue to establish a solid platform on which to build going forward. While we are taking some actions on cost near terms, we will not sacrifice future growth potential for what should be a meaningful contributor to achieving Vision 2025. As we enter the second quarter in a period of increasing uncertainty, we once again express our thanks to our dedicated employees, their families, our business partners and all those associated with Carlisle's success. Given our 100-year history and the resilience this company has shown in times of diversity and uncertainty, we remain confident in Carlisle's outlook, our strong financial foundation, cash-generating capabilities, unwavering commitment to our Vision 2025 strategic plan and to providing products and services essential to the world's needs. This concludes our formal comments. Chantelle, we're ready for questions. Good afternoon. Well, I think there's a lot of opinions out there, Tim. I spoke with our top contractors and distributors over the last couple of weeks. And I think it's been interesting. The backlog was definitely there. We -- a lot of people were off to record starts in the first quarter. And I think there will be work to do where they're able to get on job sites in that through June. I think as we get into the second half, it gets more murky. And really, it all depends on how quickly we can free up the quotation is processed, how quickly we can get people back into the buildings for reroofing because a lot of those buildings people are out commuting from home. And so they don't want workers in there in any proximity either. In a lot of cases, not enough people there. So, my thoughts are that if we can get something in terms of a relief on some of the policies that are in place right now within the May, June time frame, it could be a good second half to the year. I think if it gets prolonged into August and September, then we start to push up against the fall. And also, I think then the ability to quote and get jobs approved and that will prove difficult. So, I didn't really give you much more there, but one of those two is probably the outcome Yes, I think the demand was there. I think definitely, the incoming booking rates for people, the jobs that were lined up, I think, like I said, it was a good start to the year. And I think we've had a enforced slowdown, let's say, as opposed to one that had anything to do with the underlying demand. So, we're -- we've moved that up to around $40 million, $45 million is our current outlook. Obviously, that can change. There could be some upside to that. But right now, we're thinking, I'd say the price cost combo is $40 million to $45 million. And I just want to add that, that does include our pricing thoughts in that $40 million to $45 million. I think that's an accurate statement. Thanks. Thanks. So, I think you're seeing -- yes, it's indicative of that, that 20% to 30%. I mean, it may accelerate a little bit start entering in April and the 20% and move up a little bit as we get further on, but that's our thought right now. We did not cite the organic growth rate for CIT Medical on the call. Let me get back to you on that, all right? Bryan, can you rephrase that question for me? No, I think it should remain positive. And we continue to -- actually we expand our capabilities without digressing too much. There's been a lot of work by Bill and the team in Providien and Lars, the leader of our RedGroup organization and then our existing wire and cable medical people to facilitate greater coordination. And I would say we're getting greater access, and we're seeing greater demand for projects at existing customers and some new customers. The only impact would be some of the telecommuting or the, I say, travel restraints have hurt some of the new contacts where we'd like to be out there with the engineers working with them in the field. But other than that, our growth rates are good. And in terms of organic growth in the first quarter for CIT Medical, it was in the 12%, 13% range. Yes, thank you, Bryan. Good afternoon. And then the question, Bob, on the 125% free cash flow. Yes, just one -- I'll just add one more thing on the M&A because I'm sure it will come up. The pipeline you see has been, I would say, it slowed down dramatically when this started. I think there's, obviously, a lot of people that are not looking to monetize their assets at this time. So, I think things will start to free up as we see how long this goes on and people get some more stability, and we'll be there on those assets we've identified within CCM, CIT and CFT to act if there's opportunities that present themselves. Thank you. Well, I think in terms of our impact, I think really at the contractor level, they're mostly, I would say, delayed. I don't have the exact ratio, but I would say that the ratio of cancellations to delays favors delays by far. For us, we also sell a considerable amount of our product through distribution. And one of the effects that's exacerbated our volume declines has been this is typically the season when our distributors start to load up on product to get ready for the summer months and the two quarters in the summer, second and third that are typically our big quarters. So, they've been looking, I think, for the most part, and you know the big ones, they've been looking to serve cash. And so we've seen a big drop-off on that. With that said, we've still been producing, we've still been inventorying. And we, as I said in the call, intend to be to make sure our contractors are supplied with products. So been a little bit of a drop-off there that's exacerbated that volume decline. But I think for the most part, to answer your question again, mostly delays. Well, I think, obviously, the education one's an easy one to touch on. I don't have numbers I'm going to give you, but what I'd say is with the children and students out of school, it's given some people, I think, some thoughts that maybe they should get the work done now. Because what happens if we need to bring people back to school earlier in the summer, we won't have that same window. And then healthcare, obviously, there's a big focus on healthcare right now and just no sense that anybody wants a delay there. And certainly, we can't have any leaking or dysfunctionality in a roof that's over a nursing home or a medical facility. Obviously, these people have enough to deal with; they don't need to deal with that. So, I know our contractors are taking care of that immediately, and that's a primary focus for them. So, Bob, I don't know, do you want to add anything on any verticals there? Yes, I think that's -- I'll start, and then Bob can continue. But I think that's why we emphasize the Vision 2025. Typically, when we make capital investments, they are done for the longevity of the business and not being in a position where that's going to impact our performance from a cash perspective or put us into a situation where we can't deliver on our other commitments. We don't see any point in hesitating. Specifically in CCM, I mean, we don't view this to be a -- I mean there's still a lot of product going through CCM. CCM still maintains a great position in the industry. It's viewed as the premium product. We want to make sure that all of our facilities are, first of all, safe. So, if there's any safety CapEx that goes through. And then anything that's going to drive efficiency, product quality improvements, expansions into new markets, specifically in some of our acquisitions like spray foam, or an architectural metal, we're going to continue to do those. Because, as I said, we think we have the lowest cost operating structure, and we want to continue to maintain that. Bob, anything? You bet. Good evening. Well, I think the declines are pretty substantial. I know when I was talking to one of our contractors in Pennsylvania, who also had branches in Ohio, Pennsylvania basically shut down and Ohio still operating and still fulfilling the backlog that they were working on. So, I think it's pretty dramatic. I think in a place like Boston as well or Washington State, I think New York, Pennsylvania, Washington State, Michigan. I mean, they're serious about it, and it's a big difference. My knowledge is now, let's say, a week old. And in this time, that seems to be a lot. But I think I'd say most building owners probably don't have this at the top of their list. To be perfectly frank, I think with the rental -- with the rents and people not paying rents or delaying rents or the economic situation of their tenants and things like this, my guess is that if they have a project underway and it's gotten inspection approval and they're in the midst of it, they complete it, my guess is if you have an emergency situation on a leak and you're able to fix it, you're fixing it. Nobody wants to operate a building where whether it's a warehouse or anything else that has those issues, you're just destroying the product or creating an unsafe situation for your workers. But my guess is, after that, with few exceptions right now, they're focused on that income-generating side of it. And also, really, the lives of their people that they rent from them, and in many cases, have been renting for many years and are suffering financial disaster. I think they'll turn to the roots a little bit later, but my guess is we haven't seen -- I mean, I just haven't seen enough to address your question with any more granularity than that. I'll put it for you this way. We had constraints on labor that had built up some of the highest backlogs we've had in this industry, specifically with our team, it's been 70% reroof, which we know is -- we have to do it. I think it's one of the first things you need to do to create a safe and obviously, feasible working space for the people to work in the building. So, my guess is when things get released, it is going to be a rapid return. I know the contractors are ready. We've got -- they're trained, they have product, they're professionals. I mean, they're ready to go as soon as it happens. And as I said, I don't really believe any demand is being destroyed. I believe that it's sitting there and it's even building because remember, reroofing is an ongoing process. So, anything that's not being reroof now is sitting there, it's working its way towards being reroofed. If it's in year 2017 and we wait a year, now it's in year 2018. So, it's generally 20 years when we need to have them reroof. So, yes, I think a rapid recovery once these restrictions get lifted. Joel, good evening. Fine. Thank you. Hope you're well too. That's nice. Joel, it's interesting. We have spent some time looking into that and talking. Obviously, there's a wide variety of opinions, and I think it's appropriate. I think we see things like education, and we knew there were already trends to online learning, and we wonder what that impact will be on the physical plants. Yes, we also look back over events that have occurred over the last few years, the Great Recession, 9/11, things like that, and we know that small colleges and universities continued in a lot of ways to behave like they used to. So, will it be a rapid transformation? I don't know. Medical is one that people have said, that the digital transformation that was already occurring on medical records on maybe FaceTiming with your physician will be accelerated, and maybe we won't go back from that. But I still think in terms of hospitals and that, what we're seeing out of this is that the infrastructure may not have been what we want it to be in certain cases. And so we may see an enhanced construction around new facilities with better capabilities to address surges and things like that. Certainly, the use of the Internet for shopping, I know in my family and me personally, we're doing a lot of that. That's a trend that had been building anyway. It looks like it's going to continue to build. Amazon seems to be showcasing what they can do in this situation. So, yes, it will be interesting. I think there's going to be -- I don't really have an answer for you other than in some places, it will be affected. In others, I think we'll go right back to probably doing things the way we were already doing. But I think in terms of the net-net, we're still going to be in a really good place, at least through the reroofing backlog and probably into 2030, 2032, somewhere in there. No, no. Yes. I think -- no, I think on acquisitions, there's a pause. Obviously, one of the reasons is the integration and the due diligence issues not being able to get there and all that, you understand that. And we have thought about it. I think our strategy; we've come back and said, at least from a target perspective, we want to do the same things we're doing in CCM, CIT and CFT. And then I think, Bob, you want to just touch on the debt. I don't think it changes-- Thanks Joel. Hi David. Well, I think we just -- we're in a very, I guess, advantageous position. We have really been able -- like I said, all of our factories have stayed open. We always invest in safety. We invest in efficiency. We've got a great leader, Doug Taylor with COS. He's been here for five years. He and his team, they work every day. Whether the economy is doing well or not, they're working on ways to earn more money for us, operate more efficiently. So, in terms of positioning, I think you do all that work before you get to this point. And you have an organization like we do with a lot of great people who are just -- they're ready to go, they've got the capabilities. They've got everything we need. We've got great suppliers. Like I said, we haven't had really any issues with the supply chain. They're ready to go. So, I think we're positioned to do it. I mean it's -- go ahead, Bob. I can't comment on really any -- I haven't seen any pricing action in the bids. I think, as I said, people are focused on maybe completing the jobs they've got. And I think there is substantial trouble in getting these quotes and bids out. I look at the retail or the consumer. General housing, and we saw the results that traffic is down and inventories are down on residential. But one of the problems with selling a house is you can't get -- nobody wants to open their house to have you come by and take a look. I think the same is true in commercial. We've got that issue. We've got some place to shelter in place. You can't leave your home anyway in San Francisco or whatever. So, yes, it's impactful. I don't think the pricing is and the bids is probably impacted right now or the first thing they're thinking about. Yes, I can't give you a lot of clarity other than that. I can't. I think that we have -- like I said, we have good access to the contractors in that. I think distribution is probably saying the same things we are. And yes, I can't because each distributor, at least the big ones, they're all different, they all operate in a different way in different regions. So, I would just -- I guess, my general comment would be they're probably seeing the same things as we are. Thank you Thanks Chantelle. This concludes our first quarter 2020 earnings call. Thanks everybody for your participation. We look forward to speaking with you on the next earnings call and having a -- hopefully, more clarity on where we are in the situation. Be safe. Thanks."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Giannakouros, Carlisle's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jim, please go ahead.\nJim Giannakouros: Thank you, Elliot. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Carlisle's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We released our fourth quarter financial results after the market closed today, and you can find both our press release and earnings call slide presentation in the Investor Relations section of our website, carlisle.com. Additionally, please refer to a separate release, we issued where we announced key leadership appointments and a new segment structure for CCM's building products businesses. Today, we'll be discussing our results and expectations referencing CCM on the hold as we have in the past. We will however, be providing historical data and updated guidance in accordance with our new segment structure in the coming weeks. On the call with me today are Chris Koch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Roche, our Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Zdimal, our VP of Corporate Development, who we announced today will be succeeding Bob Roche, as Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will begin with Chris' business update highlighting fourth quarter results, current trends and context around our continued progress towards achieving our strategic plan, Vision 2025. Bob will discuss the financial details of Carlisle's fourth quarter performance, current financial position and outlook for 2022. Following Chris and Bob's remarks, we will open up the line for questions. But before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that comments made on this call may include forward-looking statements based on current expectations of future events and their potential effect on Carlisle's operating and financial performance that involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to be materially different. A discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties is provided in our press release and in our SEC filings. Those considering investing in Carlisle should read these statements carefully and review reports we file with the SEC before making an investment decision. Today's presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financials in our press release and in the appendix of our presentation materials. With that, I introduce Chris Koch, Chairman, President and CEO of Carlisle.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. First of all, I want to thank all of Carlisle's 12,000 employees for their resilience and perseverance through a challenging 2021. I'm also very pleased everyone worked so well together this year to deliver record fourth quarter results. Turning now to the organizational announcements made earlier today. I'd like to formally announce that after five years at Carlisle, Bob Roche, will be stepping down as our Chief Financial Officer. As you may recall, Bob joined Carlisle in 2017, the year after I was appointed CEO. Bob came to Carlisle from Johnson Controls, where he had been leading the integration efforts of the merger of Johnson Controls and Tyco. Bob blended seamlessly into Carlisle and his experience in counsel were immediately impactful, especially in the development and execution of Vision 2025. And on behalf of our entire management team, I want to express my sincere gratitude for the many contributions Bob has made to Carlisle over the past five years and wish Bob the best as he embarks on this new chapter of his life. With the strong bench and active succession planning efforts, we are able to ensure a smooth transition for leadership with the promotion and appointment of Carlisle's next CFO. I am extremely pleased to announce the promotion and appointment of Kevin Zdimal to the position of CFO. Kevin joined Carlisle in 1995. And at that time, Kevin had made a decision to move from public accounting at Coopers and Lybrand to start a new career at Carlisle. In the following 26 years, Kevin held roles of increasing responsibility and scope throughout Carlisle, providing him with a unique and comprehensive foundation for the role of CFO. Since the move of our headquarters to Scottsdale, Arizona, Kevin has held the role of VP of Corporate Development, helping shape our strategy and finance capabilities alongside Bob and myself. With that, I extend my sincere congratulations to Kevin. And now let's turn to our 2021 forth quarter results on Slide 3. As we stated in our release, the Carlisle team delivered very strong performance in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations despite the many challenges we faced in 2021. This performance would not have been possible without the team's resilience, which has been demonstrated since the beginning of the pandemic. In 2021, our acceleration into the recovery was in full swing in the results showed. I'm very proud that our teams delivered record revenues, record adjusted EBITDA and record adjusted EPS for the quarter. This performance is a clear measure of the Carlisle team's unwavering commitment to our customers, to the Carlisle experience, to each other, to a continuous improvement and to achieving Vision 2025. Fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results were even more gratifying given the severe demand declines in 2020 that brought challenges of a different sort. This past year followed 2020 with accelerating demand in a market that had recently adjusted to the severe pandemic declines. The associated increasing demand levels and unprecedented orders placed on our business, the historic supply chain disruptions, raw material price increases and extraordinary labor challenges impacted all our businesses and required truly exceptional efforts by our teams. In particular, CCM was charged with proactively managing price, securing raw materials and maintaining staffing levels throughout 2021 to ensure our ability to deliver the Carlisle experience to our customers and to all our channel partners who expect and rely on our industry-leading service. Needless to say, our customer service, operations and supply teams performed exceptionally well, keeping our customers both informed and supplied with product. While our businesses continue to navigate significant supply chain, labor and inflationary challenges as we enter 2022, solid demand fundamentals for all our businesses remain intact. Specifically in CCM, we remain confident in a strong multi-year reroofing cycle, continued pent-up demand from the pandemic challenges in 2020 and 2021, increasing demand for our products that improve the energy efficiency of buildings and expanding our ability to meet growing customer demands with a broader suite of products for the building envelope. In our other Carlisle businesses, we are encouraged by increasing passenger air travel numbers and improved capital spending in the medical and industrial markets, all of which are returning to pre-pandemic levels, and this bodes very well for our CIT and CFT businesses. Rest assured though everyone at Carlisle is working on solutions and innovative approaches to help alleviate the pressures experienced in our markets. Our teams continue to take appropriate pricing actions to help mitigate continued inflation pressures, actions that reflect our value to our contractors, distribution channel partners, building owners and architects as solid order trends across our businesses suggest demand remains strong entering 2022. Coupled with expectations for supply chain constraints beginning to abate in mid-2022, we expect healthy volume growth at accretive margins across our businesses. Please turn to Slide 4. Over the last several years, and in particular, through the pandemic, Vision 2025 has ensured clarity of mission and consistent direction for our entire organization. In the fourth quarter, we continued to successfully deliver on our key pillars of Vision 2025, including driving organic growth well in excess of 5%. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 26% organic growth for the company, both off a rebound of the COVID induced lows of 2020 by achieving greater price realization. As we look forward to the prospects for growth across our business segments, we remain very confident in our ability to generate our targeted mid single-digit organic growth CAGR in 2022 and beyond. An important component of organic growth is demonstrated price leadership. We remain focused on earning price in the marketplace by delivering on the Carlisle Experience, which means providing our distributors, contractors and other channel partners with innovative products of the best quality at the right place at the right time and as efficiently as possible. We could not provide that value without diligent planning, significant efforts by our operations teams and collaboration with our suppliers to ensure a steady flow of our necessary inputs. While anticipated supply chain challenges persisted in the fourth quarter, this collaboration proved particularly valuable in this uncertain environment. Our ability to anticipate these challenges, especially this year and proactively manage expectations around pricing has enabled us to provide a high level of visibility and service to our channel and to our end user base. In the fourth quarter, we more than offset the significant raw material and freight cost increases experienced in CCM with pricing, meeting our full-year target of being price cost neutral for the full calendar year 2021. Another important pillar of Vision 2025 is to build scale in our highest returning businesses through acquisition. Since the inception of Vision 2025, we've expanded into polyurethanes with the 2017 acquisition of Accella into Architectural Metals with the 2018 and 2019 acquisitions of Drexel and Petersen and most recently expanded into weather, vapor, air and energy barrier systems with the acquisition of the Henry Company in the third quarter of 2021. The Henry acquisition not only clearly demonstrates execution of our strategy to expand further into the Building Envelope, but also highlights our drive to increase the content of energy-efficient products in our portfolio. As a reminder, buildings account for approximately 30% to 40% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions. Henry's weather, vapor, air and energy barrier systems, coupled with our existing poly installation solutions help build reductions in these emissions throughout buildings and in the environment we live in. With accelerating demand for increasingly energy-efficient products made to help create more sustainable buildings in the future, we will continue to emphasize the development of products that help reduce the carbon emissions of buildings and positively impact the environment. Henry's culture around innovation, pricing to value, focus on customers and continuous improvement complements CCM's culture very well. With strong results occurring in these initial post-acquisition months, we are raising our adjusted EPS accretion forecast to over $1.50 in 2022, up from our original commitment of $1.25. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we continue to execute on our Vision 2025 capital deployment strategy. We remain committed to maintaining a balanced approach to capital deployment, continuing share repurchases. We spent $25 million on share repurchases during the fourth quarter, bringing our total spend in 2021 to $316 million. I'm proud to report that our cumulative share repurchases since 2017 now stands at $1.8 billion. With our building products focus in mind, we also announced today that we are realigning our CCM division by creating a new segment organized around Henry's products and applications for the sustainable Building Envelope. With the Henry acquisition, we've established our Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies segment, which will be led by Frank Ready, the President and CEO of Henry since 2014. In addition to Henry, Frank, will also take on leadership of our Carlisle Coatings & Waterproofing business, Carlisle Polyurethane Systems and Carlisle Diversified Products. Additionally, Steve Schwar, who has been with CCM for over 30 years, most recently serving as Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, has been promoted to President of Carlisle Construction Materials, which now consists largely of our core U.S. commercial roofing businesses and Carlisle Architectural Metals. Both Frank and Steve will continue to report to next years. Nick has successfully led CCM through some of the most challenging times in its history, and he will continue to provide leadership to both segments. Nick and Steve have fortified Carlisle's largest businesses with a deep and talented bench ready to drive its continued extension into the Building Envelope. And we look forward to this next chapter of our pivot, where we will continue to broaden and deepen our offerings of substantial, sustainable solutions to energy-efficient buildings of the future. Turning to Slide 5. In 2021, we continued to make substantial progress on our ESG journey. Our key accomplishments in the fourth quarter included breaking ground on our state-of-the-art polyiso insulation facility in Sikeston, Missouri, which will be built to LEED specifications. Progressing on energy audits of our manufacturing facilities. These audits will form the baseline on which we will make a formal commitment on net-zero carbon emissions in the near future. And we're proud to have gained increased recognition for our ESG efforts with Carlisle's inclusion in Newsweek's list of America's Most Responsible Companies. Turning to Slide 6. Our performance in the fourth quarter of 2021 evidence is continued solid execution. Revenue increased 39% year-over-year with organic revenue up over 26%. All segments contributed to this growth. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 60% year-over-year to $2.92 as higher volumes, price and cost discipline more than offset inflation during the quarter. And Bob will provide more detail around these numbers later. Turning to Slide 7. At CCM, our core Construction Materials businesses delivered an outstanding quarter despite the severe challenges across its supply chain. CCM's organic growth in the fourth quarter was approximately 30% year-over-year. And notably, organic sales were well in excess of the fourth quarter of 2019. CCM continues to benefit from a growing backlog of orders fueled by the strong reroofing cycle in the U.S., which we continue to forecast will grow at mid-single digits to a market size of over $8 billion in the next decade, an ever increasing emphasis on the energy efficiency of buildings, proactive pricing actions, further expansion into retail and residential markets and our investments in expanding our presence in the Building Envelope. We believe CCM's fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results support our long \u2013 our view, excuse me, that replacing and upgrading a roof can only be postponed for so long and that the underlying demand trends and value proposition of the Carlisle Experience are very much intact. We are also very pleased with our other growing platforms in CCM that represent our continued expansion efforts into the Building Envelope as outlined on Slide 8. Architectural Metals was a standout in the fourth quarter, growing over 40% year-over-year, Polyurethane Systems over 20% and Europe grew over 30% year-over-year. Notably, all platforms continue to progress well on profitability improvements given price discipline and leveraging COS to drive higher efficiency. Given our history of price leadership and proactive approach to price, we are very pleased that pricing more than offset raw material and freight cost inflation in the fourth quarter, which drove full-year price/cost neutrality, a target we set for 2021 this time last year. Our multiyear focus on monetizing the value of the Carlisle Experience that began in 2016 continues to evolve. This evolution has resulted in a more robust and comprehensive pricing management philosophy, which was clearly demonstrated during this extreme inflationary environment in 2021. Moving to Slide 9. At CIT, fourth quarter revenue grew over 19% year-over-year, evidence of continued progress in both its commercial aerospace and medical technology platforms. Encouragingly, in commercial aerospace, backlog is now at levels not seen since March of 2020. We are encouraged by the growing demand related to narrow-body production, driven by a steady rebound in global domestic air travel. Longer term, as demand for wide-body production returns with the resumption of international travel, CIT will be well positioned to capture and leverage that growth. Over the past several quarters, CIT has taken significant restructuring actions to drive improved profitability. The impact of these actions has shown over the past several quarters, driving CIT's profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis to swing to positive year-over-year growth in the second half of 2021 as the resumption of revenue growth drives greater leverage. On the medical side, the team delivered record fourth quarter revenue as hospital capital spending resumes. Longer term, as our medical business gains momentum and adds to its current record backlog, we believe the platform is well positioned to drive and leverage mid-to-high single-digit annual growth going forward. CFT generated revenue growth of 6% year-over-year. We continue to be pleased on the progress of \u2013 the progress CFT is making on new products, improved operational efficiencies, price realization from earning the value of innovation and an improved customer experience. And we're confident these actions will deliver results in the coming quarters. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob to discuss our financial performance in greater detail. Bob?\nRobert Roche: Thank you, Chris. As Chris mentioned, we had an outstanding fourth quarter. I'm especially pleased about CCM's ability to effectively offset significant inflation by implementing early and effective price actions in 2021. The goal was put in place last February. Please now turn to the revenue bridge on Slide 10 of the presentation. Revenue was up 39% in the fourth quarter, driven by volume growth at all of our businesses, price and the acquisition of Henry. Organic revenue was up 26.4% driven by CCM, which delivered approximately 30% organic revenue growth. Acquisitions contributed 12.9% of sales growth in the fourth quarter, and FX was a 10 basis point headwind. On Slide 11, we have provided an adjusted EPS bridge, where you can see the fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $2.92, which compares to $1.83 last year. Volume price and mix combined accounted for $3.02 of the year-over-year increase. Raw material, freight and labor costs were $1.98 year-over-year headwind. Acquisitions contributed $0.13. Interest and tax together were $0.09 headwind. Share repurchase contributed $0.03. COS contributed $0.11 and higher OpEx was a $0.13 headwind year-over-year. Now let's turn to Slide 12 to review the fourth quarter performance by segment in more detail. At CCM, the team again delivered outstanding results with revenue increasing 46.5%, driven by volume and price, along with contributions from Henry. On top of that, a 10 basis point FX translation headwind. Notably, all of CCM's product lines delivered double-digit sales growth. CCM effectively managed raw material inflation headwinds experienced in the quarter with disciplined pricing, proactive sourcing and allocating products to strategic customers. Adjusted EBITDA margin at CCM was 21.3% in the fourth quarter, a 260 basis point decline from last year, driven by higher raw material prices, labor inflation and return to more normalized SG&A spending, partially offset by volume, price and COS savings. Adjusted EBITDA grew 30.5% to $237.5 million, again demonstrating the earnings power of our CCM business. Please turn to Slide 13 to review CIT's results. CIT revenue increased 19.3% in the fourth quarter. CIT's commercial aerospace backlog has consistently grown in 2021 and has now surpassed the second quarter of 2020 levels. CIT's medical platform continues to build a robust pipeline of revenue-generating products with an increasing backlog. The team delivered record sales in the business in fourth quarter. We continue to expect sequential improvement from pent-up demand as the impacts of COVID-19 and hospital CapEx and postponed elective surgeries eased. CIT's adjusted EBITDA margins improved year-over-year to 15.2%, driven by Commercial Aerospace and Medical volume recovery and COS, partially offset by raw materials and labor inflation. Given the positive indicators and actions undertaken in 2020 and 2021 to rightsize the business, we are optimistic that CIT is positioned to leverage our return to growth over the coming quarters and years and deliver profitability exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Turning now to Slide 14. CFT's sales grew 6% year-over-year in the quarter. Organic revenue improved 7.3% and FX was a 1.3% headwind. CFT is well positioned to accelerate through the recovery due to continued stabilization in key end markets, driven by an improved industrial capital spending outlook, coupled with new product introductions, which included $18.7 million of incremental new products in 2021, along with positive pricing. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 18% were up 410 basis point improvement year-over-year. This improvement was driven by both volume and price. On Slides 15 and 16, we show selected metrics on our balance sheet, which remains strong. We ended the quarter with $324 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner, investing in organic growth through capital expenditures and opportunistically repurchasing shares, while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. In the quarter, we purchased 107,000 shares for $25 million, bringing our 2021 year-to-date total to 1.9 million shares for $316 million. We paid $28 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing our 2021 total to $113 million. We invested $46 million of CapEx into our high-returning businesses to drive organic growth, bringing our 2021 total to $135 million. Free cash flow from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $92 million, a 58% decline year-over-year. The decline is attributable to the higher volumes and pricing in November and December of 2021, which drove higher receivables and more notably, year-over-year raw material inflation driving higher working capital compared to 2020 levels. Turning to Slide 17 for full-year 2022 guidance, we anticipate the following. At CCM, the underlying reroofing trends that have provided a solid foundation for growth over the past decade picked up momentum in the second half of 2021, accelerating into 2022. With normalized volumes, strong pricing and the inclusion of Henry, we expect total revenue growth at CCM to be approximately 30% in 2022. At CIT, we are encouraged by the recovery in narrow-body commercial aircraft and backlog approaching pre-pandemic levels. While the first signs of recovery are encouraging, demand for wide-body aircraft driven by international travel will likely remain muted in 2022. In our Medical business, backlog continues to build. Taken together and coupled with the significant restructuring that has occurred at CIT over the past 24 months, CIT is now positioned to leverage what we anticipate would be a sustained recovery. We expect CIT revenue growth to be approximately 10% for full-year 2022. At CFT, with end market strengthening and improvements in the team's execution on our key strategies, including new product introductions, accelerating growth in our newer platforms and price discipline, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2022.  Finally, for Carlisle as a whole, we expect to deliver revenue growth of 25% to 30% in 2022. Turning to other items. Corporate expense is expected to be flat year-over-year or approximately $120 million. We expect depreciation to be about $100 million and amortization to be nearly $150 million, $53 million of that, which is attributable to Henry acquisition. We expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% and we expect capital expenditures of $150 million. Net interest expense is expected to be $90 million for the year, and we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. With that, I will now turn it back over to Chris for closing remarks. Chris?\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Bob. 2021 was a challenging year for all of us, a manner in which the Carlisle team approached our challenge is unified, resilient-driven, allowed us to persevere and finish with record results and momentum entering 2022 all of this, supporting our conviction in achieving Vision 2025. I'm very proud of our Carlisle team, especially the way everyone has shown respect for each other during the pandemic and supported our efforts to follow the CDC guidelines and Carlisle safety protocols. Our team members' cooperation with our guidelines has resulted in low levels of infection and serious illness in our workforce. And for that, I thank everyone at Carlisle. While we anticipate continued challenges throughout our end markets in 2022, we look forward to meeting them head on and driving continued profitable growth going forward and achieving our strategic goals set forth in Vision 2025. And that concludes our formal comments, Elliot. We are ready for questions.\nOperator:  Our first question today comes from Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer. Bryan, please go ahead.\nBryan Blair: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.\nChristian Koch: Hey. Good afternoon, Bryan.\nBryan Blair: And Bob, thank you for clear help over the years. Kevin, look forward to working with you.\nRobert Roche: Thanks, Bryan.\nBryan Blair: If we look at your topline CCM outperformance in 2021 and assume the 30% growth guided for 2022, you're massively ahead of expectations to the tune of more than $400 million for this year and in revenue. How should we think about your volume, price and incremental Henry contribution factored into that guidance?\nRobert Roche: Yes. If you think about it, Bryan, we're looking at somewhere around 8% to 12% price in the base business, volume probably in the 5% to 9% range and then 12% contribution from Henry, and  30%.\nBryan Blair: Yes. Inflation has obviously picked up again to start the year, although that coincided with pretty aggressive January, February pricing. I suspect you guys were ahead of the curve on that. Given current visibility, how is your team thinking about price cost for 2022? And to the extent that you can parse it out first versus second half dynamic?\nChristian Koch: Bryan, Chris here. I think just overall, I think we still see some pricing or I should say, some inflationary trends here as we are in the first half of the year. And then I just guess, in general, we're still somewhat optimistic that we'll get some raw material pricing relief as we head into the third quarter and hopefully some labor relief as well. But I'll let Bob more specifically address.\nRobert Roche: Yes. Bryan, overall, we're going to pull back some of the specific price cost guidance due to competitive issues and everything else going on. But to help everyone understand what we see from a profitability standpoint, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins with CCM Henry combined to be up 150 basis points going into next year for the full-year.\nBryan Blair: That's very helpful. And focusing on Henry, if you're willing to break this out, how much of the $0.25 plus increase in accretion outlook would be attributable to stronger growth, price/cost or other factors?\nRobert Roche: Yes, Bryan. I think, first of all, synergies are running ahead, that's where we'll start. Price/cost is helping and so is organic growth on top of it. So as Chris mentioned in his comments, I mean, we are thrilled with where Henry is and what it's doing and it's acting exactly like our base CCM business. So it's everything moving in the right direction, not just one thing outweighing another.\nChristian Koch: Yes. And Bryan, I would just say that this is attributed to Frank Ready and the team and also the prior ownership that there was really no slowdown in any of the activities that they had underway, both. As we were at Carlisle, they were ahead on pricing there, and they did a great job of getting ahead of that and making sure they were also taking care of supply chain, working to be efficient in their factories. And I'm really pleased that through all the turmoil, the acquisition and the integration, the teams remain really focused. And that to me is what's being delivered and the synergies being ahead of schedule and then the continued momentum in sales. So we're really pleased again. We said when we bought the company, we thought it was a great fit, and we're just pleased with what the Henry team has brought to Carlisle.\nBryan Blair: All good to hear. Appreciate the color. Thanks again.\nChristian Koch: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. David, please go ahead,\nJoseph Nolan: Hi. This is Joe Nolan on for David MacGregor. Congrats on the nice quarter.\nRobert Roche: Thanks, Joe.\nChristian Koch: Welcome to the call.\nJoseph Nolan: Thanks. So first, I was just wondering, how should we think about cash that you can harvest from working capital? How should we think about that in your 2022 guidance?\nRobert Roche: I don't think there's going to be a ton of cash harvested. I don't think we're going to have to invest again with \u2013 because we're going to have strong volumes and sales again when things start going in a different direction, maybe we'll be able to slow down. But as long as sales are up 30%, I don't see us harvesting \u2013 it's just \u2013 we're not going to have to put that big investment we did this year with the outsized growth, I'll call it, and the inflation.\nJoseph Nolan: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then also, could you just talk about the progress that you're making on Europe in terms of share gains in support of specifiers?\nChristian Koch: Share gains in support of specifiers. Just talking in general in Europe, we are really pleased. Obviously, we start off with the transition to new leadership under our new Head of Europe, Georg, and he's brought in also some new teams in a new approach. And they're out making as much progress as they can. But our work to expand with architects, specifiers and that is an ongoing thing. We do it all the time. One of the key things we need to do is to continue to reinforce our sales team with new products and new opportunities to bring into the marketplace. And so we're pretty excited about the addition of things like Henry that's probably, first and foremost, one that I think has a really good solid opportunity to drive some interest with specifiers in Europe. Obviously, we'll have to make sure the products are fit for the European market from a regulations perspective and local building codes, but then also some of the products that we're delivering in Architectural Metals and polyurethanes, we think have some excellent fit, which really complement and will provide a full suite of products for those salespeople to deliver. And I think right now, with what they've had in the past around our limited product line, they've done an excellent job. And really, it's going to be providing this suite of building envelope solutions, and then it'll give us the most progress, I think, with our specifiers. Hopefully, that answers your question.\nJoseph Nolan: Yes. That was very helpful. And then last one for me. Just within Vision 2025, how are you thinking about additional M&A going forward in your path to the goal of $8 billion in revenue? And then if you could also just talk about how your M&A pipeline looks at this point in the year.\nChristian Koch: Well, Bob and I can split this one up he can comment, too. I would say the pipeline looks fairly good. There have been a lot of transactions in the marketplace in a variety of areas. You saw we just picked up a small acquisition to add to Henry. So you can tell that even with Henry and I complimented Frank and the management team, I think it shows how much confidence we have in them that we would immediately invest in an acquisition under their leadership. And I know Henry has a list of acquisitions. We have targets in Europe. We have targets now in North America as well in other locations. So I think the pipeline is full. Obviously, pricing has been fairly robust for sellers. I think they're getting good multiples. So again, we're always going to be judicious and make sure that we can deliver on deals like Henry, where we can exceed expectations both in terms of EPS accretion and also in terms of synergies. But I'd say we're doing pretty well.\nRobert Roche: Yes. And I think the $8 billion, while it was a goal of ours. I don't see that as being the main goal, as Chris and I talked about many times. I mean, the $15-plus of EPS and the margins and returning cash flow to shareholders is what we've been focused on, and that's where the focus continues is profitable growth.\nJoseph Nolan: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks. I'll pass it along.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman & Associates. Adam, please go ahead.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe on the supply chain headwinds you guys have been facing, I think the comment was around that maybe abating by midyear this year. I guess, one, have you started to see any relief in the early parts of this year? And then two, are you mainly referring to some of the raw material shortages that you've been facing?\nChristian Koch: Absolutely. Yes. And sorry for that lack of clarification. Yes, really revolving around the raw materials. And I think when we say abating by midyear, maybe more specifically starting to show improvement by midyear. We are seeing some, I guess, green shoots, as you call them, but with the Omicron popping up, that didn't help with different kind of, I think, impact we've seen in the ports and the traditional supply chain issues we've seen. And then I think with Omicron and its rapid spread and then labor I'll call it, issues in the marketplace where people were having lots of people calling sick, we saw some delays there. But overall, we just see these trends to getting back to a more normalized raw material situation. And we'd like to see that have more substantial progress by midyear. Obviously, it's going to continue to evolve, and we hope that there aren't any more outbreaks of significance that could delay that. But yes, we are seeing some things happening right now. They're improving things, but mostly on the raw material side, as you said.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. Great. And then just on the strong replacement demand, which obviously is the vast majority of the business. I guess if we switch gears to new construction given the lag to some of the pretty positive indicators we've seen over the last year. Do you expect the new construction side of the business to actually be a tailwind in 2022?\nChristian Koch: I think in 2022. Well, yes, we've been having some meetings with contractors here in the first quarter. And it does seem like new construction still has some good legs to it. If we think about some specific areas, I'd say that warehouse is still are looking pretty good. We see the trends on online ordering and things like that, data warehouses, educational facilities and really office buildings as well. Despite all the talk we had around COVID and people working from home, we're still seeing some good positive momentum in 2022 in office buildings. So maybe that gives you a little color there.\nAdam Baumgarten: That's great. Well, best of luck. Thanks.\nChristian Koch: Thank you.\nOperator: We now turn to Tim Wojs from Baird. Tim, your line is now open.\nTimothy Wojs: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Nice job.\nRobert Roche: Hey, Tim.\nChristian Koch: Thank you.\nTimothy Wojs: And Bob, thanks for everything. So maybe just first question, just on volume growth and maybe visibility, could you talk a little bit about kind of what you're seeing from a backlog perspective and maybe how the length of that backlog has evolved over the last three to four months. And when you think about the 5% to 9% kind of guidance for volume growth, how much of that is based on bringing on incremental capacity versus just seeing that improvement in the supply chain that you talked about, Chris?\nChristian Koch: Yes, Tim. I think the capacity question is we did start up the TPO line in Carlisle PA last month. So that's going \u2013 we haven't launched the 16-foot sheet yet. That will be later in the year once the line gets qualified, but we have brought on some additional capacity, which will help drive the growth. But Sikeston is not going to be open until next year. So there's not a ton of capacity. I think what we've been able to do and even this is evident in the fourth quarter, how strong the sales were. Our teams have been able to get a little more bit more raw material than they thought, and they're able to continue to drive it through the factories and be productive. From what we see now, I don't believe that capacity in the \u2013 I'm going to call it the roofing industry is the gating factor right now. It's the raws coming in. We have plenty of capacity to make more. It's having the raw materials to make it.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. And then I guess on the backlog, I mean, have those \u2013 have they shrunk at all? Or are they elongating or pretty stable?\nChristian Koch: It's been \u2013 I think there's maybe been a little bit of an increase in backlog, and it really is related to more orders. And I think that's pretty much industry-wide. I don't think there's anyone that's seeing any lessening here as we start to head into the season and people get prepared to embark on another busy year. Obviously, the delays, Tim, as you know, in 2020, just added to it. I mean, labor \u2013 we talk about raw materials, but on the roof, labor is still a big constraint the installation, and that hasn't. I think raw materials probably will come back sooner than labor will. So we\u2019re still have some gating there. There are a couple specifically items, too, that are not related to us as much as other suppliers on the roof like plates and screws and things like that, that are really lower priced items, but you got to have them to put a roof down. And so even though we may be fine with the TPO sheets and the PVC and EPDM and sealants and adhesives and that, we're still \u2013 there can be some of these small items that can be gating items, too. So I think labor is a big one and then some of the things around putting down a complete system or having some constraints out with the contractor as well.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. Good. And then just last one I had. Just by splitting up roofing and waterproofing, I mean, would you say that both of those are now kind of growth platforms over time? I mean are they both going to get incremental capital deployment? And is that, I guess, the reason for splitting those two businesses up?\nChristian Koch: Yes. I think \u2013 well, for sure, they're both going to get a lot of attention. And you can see, like I said, with that, we've invested already some capital into Henry to help with productivity and operations. We're working on some IT stuff to again, expand capacity of the whole Henry organization, plus we've added one acquisition already. So you can bet that, that weatherproofing technologies group is going to get a lot of focus. And CCM, obviously, that's our core, we've been doing that for a long time. We still see a lot of opportunity there. We mentioned Europe. We have other new technologies as well around this Building Envelope. So there's really nothing in the portfolio within weatherproofing at CCM that isn't going to be a significant focus for our growth. And that's kind of what we're excited about. We call the Building Envelope. When you look at all these verticals, we're starting to really build some strength in each one of these verticals and give that leadership team, those leadership teams opportunity to execute their visions as well. And then as we work through the continued downsizing of our portfolio outside of building products, we'll be able to allocate capital to and focus to those from a management perspective as well.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. Good. Well, thanks for the time. And good luck on 2022, guys. Thanks.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Tim.\nRobert Roche: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator:  We now turn to Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Garik, please go ahead.\nGarik Shmois: Hi, thanks for having me on. Apologies if my questions are redundant. I was dropped earlier. But I wanted to ask just first off on any seasonality or cyclicality to call out for CCM volumes for the year, just kind of recognizing the supply chain headwinds that are still occurring here in the first half of the year. Would you expect the volume growth in CCM perhaps to be a bit more back half weighted just given the raw material availability or maybe conversely, just given the strong growth that you exited the year in 2021, should we expect the growth to be maybe a little bit more linear?\nChristian Koch: No. I mean, I think for me, Garik, the only thing that in terms of seasonality really is just the weather, right? And one of the reasons why we see less fewer roofs put on in the first quarter, fourth quarter is the parts of the United States that are impacted by winter weather. Obviously, it makes it more difficult for contractors to get out and do their job and deal with that. But other than that, I mean, it's pretty much full steam ahead for everybody in terms of work and getting as much now as they can. So I don't see anything else impacting us that would be different.\nRobert Roche: Yes. From a volume perspective, no, certainly, price will be front-half weighted as you know, for \u2013 so total sales to be stronger in the first half, but volumes pretty even.\nGarik Shmois: Yes. Are you seeing any kind of concern on the part of contractors, just given inflation and any desire on their end to perhaps delay projects and recognize you can only defer a commercial reroof for so long. But is that all playing out just given the inflation that\u2019s in the market?\nChristian Koch: No. As I mentioned with Mr. Wojs' comment around \u2013 and I mentioned the plates and screws and things like that, that may be delaying jobs. I don't think there are any contractors out there that are looking at deferred jobs. With the backlog where it is, I think the bigger issue for someone is if you were to say you wanted to defer your job, I think the quote would be well. If you defer it, you might not get back in the schedule til 2024. There's that much backlog and demand. So right now, I don't think there's anyone that is delaying anything unless, again, they don't have the labor, they don't have the complete system to put down. But I don't think anybody would delay anything willingly because it just probably means they're going to be waiting a lot longer than they would like to, to get back in the schedule.\nGarik Shmois: Yes. Understood. Last question is just on CIT and CFT, just the comment made in the release around bookings and backlogs coming back to your pre-pandemic levels. Just wondering how quickly you would expect that to convert to revenues. And I don't know if you're willing to take a stab as to how quickly revenues come back to pre-pandemic levels in those segments?\nRobert Roche: Yes. I think CFT is going to be a lot earlier with what we're seeing from a industrial CapEx. We mentioned on the call also that the long haul aircraft 787 and things like that aren't coming back even close to us quickly. So I guess, overall for CIT, you would expect revenue getting back somewhere around 2024, but that also includes the addition of Providien. So from a base aero business, you're probably looking at 25%, 26%, but total CIT would be back by 2024.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. All right. That's all for me. Bob, best of luck. It was great working with you.\nRobert Roche: Thanks, Garik. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research. Kevin, please go ahead.\nKevin Hocevar: Hey, everybody. Good afternoon. Nice quarter and Bob, it's been a pleasure working with you.\nRobert Roche: Thanks.\nKevin Hocevar: So maybe were to start on \u2013 I guess I just want to clarify, in the pricing baked in the guidance for CCM, I think, Bob, you mentioned pricing, 8% to 12% this year. I imagine you exited the year up like mid-high teens or something in terms of pricing, in terms of that sales number you put up in the fourth quarter. And I know you started the year at zero. So it seems like you anniversary \u2013 if we just kind of anniversary pricing from last year into this year, it seems like you could probably get to that type of level, at least on the low half of that. So \u2013 but I know you also have the January price increase. You've got a February price increase, both of which are fairly sizable. So I'm curious, how much incremental pricing you're assuming from the 2022 action versus carryforward pricing? And yes, just kind of the acceptance of these \u2013 the price increases you have out there?\nChristian Koch: Yes. I mean they're out there. They're being recognized. So I think we're counting on them to come through. I don't think there's anything unusual with what we're seeing from the price increases.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay. And what about, I\u2019ve heard \u2013 no, go ahead, sorry.\nRobert Roche: No. When you look at our guidance of 150 basis point improvement in EBITDA margins, that that shows some significant price.\nKevin Hocevar: Yes. Okay. And I've heard too that have you guys had a change or have you changed how you price warranties? I've heard that perhaps those were pretty low priced and historically, maybe even unprofitable. I don't know if that's true or not, but those had to be reset to more reasonable levels. So I'm curious if that's something that's happened. It wasn't clear to me if that's something that happened in 2021 or if it could be happening here in 2022. But curious if you could comment on kind of the warranties?\nChristian Koch: Well, we've had warranties for a long time. I think we've handled them differently than others have in the industry. I can tell you that I can't \u2013 I don't really want to speak to the profitability, but I can tell you that the CCM team has managed the warranties to be a value add to the people that choose to use them and not something that's a throwaway discounted item. So for sure, we won't be losing any money on them. And it is a valuable part of our entire Carlisle Experience. So there's value there that gets priced. But I can't really talk to any major changes because, to be honest with you, I don't think there's been any significance, I would say. But we'll check that out for you, Kevin, we'll get back.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay. And then lastly, in terms of mid to high single-digit type volume growth expectations for CCM this year. I'm curious is that an industry growth type number? Or is that \u2013 I'm curious how you believe you can perform versus the industry just given you've got the new capacity that's coming online. I've heard, I think, some other \u2013 maybe some other competitors have had some issues with certain raws. And I believe one of your competitors has to change their branding. They lose the branding rights at the end of this year. So I'm not sure if that's an opportunity for distributors to rethink some things who they're using. But I guess I'm curious your thoughts on your ability to how you \u2013 is there a chance for you to outperform the market? Or is it going to be so tight that, that might not be possible?\nChristian Koch: Well, I know our team at CCM and I know the team at Henry that just came in under Frank and his group, I know in Architectural Metals. I know everywhere. Europe included. Our teams seek to provide a Carlisle product for every application that's out there. So while we don't win all of them, I would say that our team over the past few years has probably done the best job of having the least disruptions if that makes any sense. And in certain cases, there have been times where we've been able to take some share. But when we think about even \u2013 let's just talk about reroofing or we think about \u2013 we just mentioned warranty, we're really looking for long-term relationships. Carlisle has been around a long time. We have a lot of really loyal contractors. We've got a lot of loyal architects and customers that depend on us, and we seek to serve those first. So in a time like this, I know as much as opportunities to gain share may come along really, Kevin, with the constraints that are there, we're going to worry less about what everybody else is doing and just make sure we're taking care of the people that are in the Carlisle family and that they get the service they need. And then, hey, look, if it results in us getting some extra share, that's fine. I mean we definitely want to be the number one, and we're going to strive to do that. But we got to do it under that Carlisle Experience, right product, right place, right time, most efficiently, and we want to pride ourselves on having the best experience for all of our channel partners and our contractors. So it doesn't really answer for you. All I can tell you is we think we've shared a lot of information over the years. We think the market is going to grow, as we said in the commentary to just over $8 billion, will continue to drive towards that. And so things that happen quarter-to-quarter, and we may not focus on as much. And we're on the right trajectory, and we just see that continuing to be the course that the market will take. And like I said, we'll try to do everything we can to take share. But first, we've got to serve our existing customers and our existing contractors.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay. Great. All right. Thank you very much.\nChristian Koch: Thank you. Well, thanks, Elliot. I guess this concludes our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call, and I want to thank everybody for their participation. I want to thank all the Carlisle employees for all hard work they've done. I want to thank all of our partners, especially the people that put their faith in our products every day, and I want to also thank Bob. It's been a great five years in these calls. We've done a few of them together, and appreciate all your support. And then Kevin, we\u2019ll look forward to doing the next one together. So thanks, everybody.\nRobert Roche: Thanks, Chris. Appreciate it.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Roche",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. As Chris mentioned, we had an outstanding fourth quarter. I'm especially pleased about CCM's ability to effectively offset significant inflation by implementing early and effective price actions in 2021. The goal was put in place last February. Please now turn to the revenue bridge on Slide 10 of the presentation. Revenue was up 39% in the fourth quarter, driven by volume growth at all of our businesses, price and the acquisition of Henry. Organic revenue was up 26.4% driven by CCM, which delivered approximately 30% organic revenue growth. Acquisitions contributed 12.9% of sales growth in the fourth quarter, and FX was a 10 basis point headwind. On Slide 11, we have provided an adjusted EPS bridge, where you can see the fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $2.92, which compares to $1.83 last year. Volume price and mix combined accounted for $3.02 of the year-over-year increase. Raw material, freight and labor costs were $1.98 year-over-year headwind. Acquisitions contributed $0.13. Interest and tax together were $0.09 headwind. Share repurchase contributed $0.03. COS contributed $0.11 and higher OpEx was a $0.13 headwind year-over-year. Now let's turn to Slide 12 to review the fourth quarter performance by segment in more detail. At CCM, the team again delivered outstanding results with revenue increasing 46.5%, driven by volume and price, along with contributions from Henry. On top of that, a 10 basis point FX translation headwind. Notably, all of CCM's product lines delivered double-digit sales growth. CCM effectively managed raw material inflation headwinds experienced in the quarter with disciplined pricing, proactive sourcing and allocating products to strategic customers. Adjusted EBITDA margin at CCM was 21.3% in the fourth quarter, a 260 basis point decline from last year, driven by higher raw material prices, labor inflation and return to more normalized SG&A spending, partially offset by volume, price and COS savings. Adjusted EBITDA grew 30.5% to $237.5 million, again demonstrating the earnings power of our CCM business. Please turn to Slide 13 to review CIT's results. CIT revenue increased 19.3% in the fourth quarter. CIT's commercial aerospace backlog has consistently grown in 2021 and has now surpassed the second quarter of 2020 levels. CIT's medical platform continues to build a robust pipeline of revenue-generating products with an increasing backlog. The team delivered record sales in the business in fourth quarter. We continue to expect sequential improvement from pent-up demand as the impacts of COVID-19 and hospital CapEx and postponed elective surgeries eased. CIT's adjusted EBITDA margins improved year-over-year to 15.2%, driven by Commercial Aerospace and Medical volume recovery and COS, partially offset by raw materials and labor inflation. Given the positive indicators and actions undertaken in 2020 and 2021 to rightsize the business, we are optimistic that CIT is positioned to leverage our return to growth over the coming quarters and years and deliver profitability exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Turning now to Slide 14. CFT's sales grew 6% year-over-year in the quarter. Organic revenue improved 7.3% and FX was a 1.3% headwind. CFT is well positioned to accelerate through the recovery due to continued stabilization in key end markets, driven by an improved industrial capital spending outlook, coupled with new product introductions, which included $18.7 million of incremental new products in 2021, along with positive pricing. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 18% were up 410 basis point improvement year-over-year. This improvement was driven by both volume and price. On Slides 15 and 16, we show selected metrics on our balance sheet, which remains strong. We ended the quarter with $324 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner, investing in organic growth through capital expenditures and opportunistically repurchasing shares, while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. In the quarter, we purchased 107,000 shares for $25 million, bringing our 2021 year-to-date total to 1.9 million shares for $316 million. We paid $28 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing our 2021 total to $113 million. We invested $46 million of CapEx into our high-returning businesses to drive organic growth, bringing our 2021 total to $135 million. Free cash flow from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $92 million, a 58% decline year-over-year. The decline is attributable to the higher volumes and pricing in November and December of 2021, which drove higher receivables and more notably, year-over-year raw material inflation driving higher working capital compared to 2020 levels. Turning to Slide 17 for full-year 2022 guidance, we anticipate the following. At CCM, the underlying reroofing trends that have provided a solid foundation for growth over the past decade picked up momentum in the second half of 2021, accelerating into 2022. With normalized volumes, strong pricing and the inclusion of Henry, we expect total revenue growth at CCM to be approximately 30% in 2022. At CIT, we are encouraged by the recovery in narrow-body commercial aircraft and backlog approaching pre-pandemic levels. While the first signs of recovery are encouraging, demand for wide-body aircraft driven by international travel will likely remain muted in 2022. In our Medical business, backlog continues to build. Taken together and coupled with the significant restructuring that has occurred at CIT over the past 24 months, CIT is now positioned to leverage what we anticipate would be a sustained recovery. We expect CIT revenue growth to be approximately 10% for full-year 2022. At CFT, with end market strengthening and improvements in the team's execution on our key strategies, including new product introductions, accelerating growth in our newer platforms and price discipline, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2022.  Finally, for Carlisle as a whole, we expect to deliver revenue growth of 25% to 30% in 2022. Turning to other items. Corporate expense is expected to be flat year-over-year or approximately $120 million. We expect depreciation to be about $100 million and amortization to be nearly $150 million, $53 million of that, which is attributable to Henry acquisition. We expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% and we expect capital expenditures of $150 million. Net interest expense is expected to be $90 million for the year, and we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. With that, I will now turn it back over to Chris for closing remarks. Chris? Thanks, Bryan. Yes. If you think about it, Bryan, we're looking at somewhere around 8% to 12% price in the base business, volume probably in the 5% to 9% range and then 12% contribution from Henry, and  30%. Yes. Bryan, overall, we're going to pull back some of the specific price cost guidance due to competitive issues and everything else going on. But to help everyone understand what we see from a profitability standpoint, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins with CCM Henry combined to be up 150 basis points going into next year for the full-year. Yes, Bryan. I think, first of all, synergies are running ahead, that's where we'll start. Price/cost is helping and so is organic growth on top of it. So as Chris mentioned in his comments, I mean, we are thrilled with where Henry is and what it's doing and it's acting exactly like our base CCM business. So it's everything moving in the right direction, not just one thing outweighing another. Thanks, Joe. I don't think there's going to be a ton of cash harvested. I don't think we're going to have to invest again with \u2013 because we're going to have strong volumes and sales again when things start going in a different direction, maybe we'll be able to slow down. But as long as sales are up 30%, I don't see us harvesting \u2013 it's just \u2013 we're not going to have to put that big investment we did this year with the outsized growth, I'll call it, and the inflation. Yes. And I think the $8 billion, while it was a goal of ours. I don't see that as being the main goal, as Chris and I talked about many times. I mean, the $15-plus of EPS and the margins and returning cash flow to shareholders is what we've been focused on, and that's where the focus continues is profitable growth. Hey, Tim. Thanks, Tim. Yes. From a volume perspective, no, certainly, price will be front-half weighted as you know, for \u2013 so total sales to be stronger in the first half, but volumes pretty even. Yes. I think CFT is going to be a lot earlier with what we're seeing from a industrial CapEx. We mentioned on the call also that the long haul aircraft 787 and things like that aren't coming back even close to us quickly. So I guess, overall for CIT, you would expect revenue getting back somewhere around 2024, but that also includes the addition of Providien. So from a base aero business, you're probably looking at 25%, 26%, but total CIT would be back by 2024. Thanks, Garik. Appreciate it. Thanks. No. When you look at our guidance of 150 basis point improvement in EBITDA margins, that that shows some significant price. Thanks, Chris. Appreciate it."

            "name": "Christian Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. First of all, I want to thank all of Carlisle's 12,000 employees for their resilience and perseverance through a challenging 2021. I'm also very pleased everyone worked so well together this year to deliver record fourth quarter results. Turning now to the organizational announcements made earlier today. I'd like to formally announce that after five years at Carlisle, Bob Roche, will be stepping down as our Chief Financial Officer. As you may recall, Bob joined Carlisle in 2017, the year after I was appointed CEO. Bob came to Carlisle from Johnson Controls, where he had been leading the integration efforts of the merger of Johnson Controls and Tyco. Bob blended seamlessly into Carlisle and his experience in counsel were immediately impactful, especially in the development and execution of Vision 2025. And on behalf of our entire management team, I want to express my sincere gratitude for the many contributions Bob has made to Carlisle over the past five years and wish Bob the best as he embarks on this new chapter of his life. With the strong bench and active succession planning efforts, we are able to ensure a smooth transition for leadership with the promotion and appointment of Carlisle's next CFO. I am extremely pleased to announce the promotion and appointment of Kevin Zdimal to the position of CFO. Kevin joined Carlisle in 1995. And at that time, Kevin had made a decision to move from public accounting at Coopers and Lybrand to start a new career at Carlisle. In the following 26 years, Kevin held roles of increasing responsibility and scope throughout Carlisle, providing him with a unique and comprehensive foundation for the role of CFO. Since the move of our headquarters to Scottsdale, Arizona, Kevin has held the role of VP of Corporate Development, helping shape our strategy and finance capabilities alongside Bob and myself. With that, I extend my sincere congratulations to Kevin. And now let's turn to our 2021 forth quarter results on Slide 3. As we stated in our release, the Carlisle team delivered very strong performance in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations despite the many challenges we faced in 2021. This performance would not have been possible without the team's resilience, which has been demonstrated since the beginning of the pandemic. In 2021, our acceleration into the recovery was in full swing in the results showed. I'm very proud that our teams delivered record revenues, record adjusted EBITDA and record adjusted EPS for the quarter. This performance is a clear measure of the Carlisle team's unwavering commitment to our customers, to the Carlisle experience, to each other, to a continuous improvement and to achieving Vision 2025. Fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results were even more gratifying given the severe demand declines in 2020 that brought challenges of a different sort. This past year followed 2020 with accelerating demand in a market that had recently adjusted to the severe pandemic declines. The associated increasing demand levels and unprecedented orders placed on our business, the historic supply chain disruptions, raw material price increases and extraordinary labor challenges impacted all our businesses and required truly exceptional efforts by our teams. In particular, CCM was charged with proactively managing price, securing raw materials and maintaining staffing levels throughout 2021 to ensure our ability to deliver the Carlisle experience to our customers and to all our channel partners who expect and rely on our industry-leading service. Needless to say, our customer service, operations and supply teams performed exceptionally well, keeping our customers both informed and supplied with product. While our businesses continue to navigate significant supply chain, labor and inflationary challenges as we enter 2022, solid demand fundamentals for all our businesses remain intact. Specifically in CCM, we remain confident in a strong multi-year reroofing cycle, continued pent-up demand from the pandemic challenges in 2020 and 2021, increasing demand for our products that improve the energy efficiency of buildings and expanding our ability to meet growing customer demands with a broader suite of products for the building envelope. In our other Carlisle businesses, we are encouraged by increasing passenger air travel numbers and improved capital spending in the medical and industrial markets, all of which are returning to pre-pandemic levels, and this bodes very well for our CIT and CFT businesses. Rest assured though everyone at Carlisle is working on solutions and innovative approaches to help alleviate the pressures experienced in our markets. Our teams continue to take appropriate pricing actions to help mitigate continued inflation pressures, actions that reflect our value to our contractors, distribution channel partners, building owners and architects as solid order trends across our businesses suggest demand remains strong entering 2022. Coupled with expectations for supply chain constraints beginning to abate in mid-2022, we expect healthy volume growth at accretive margins across our businesses. Please turn to Slide 4. Over the last several years, and in particular, through the pandemic, Vision 2025 has ensured clarity of mission and consistent direction for our entire organization. In the fourth quarter, we continued to successfully deliver on our key pillars of Vision 2025, including driving organic growth well in excess of 5%. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 26% organic growth for the company, both off a rebound of the COVID induced lows of 2020 by achieving greater price realization. As we look forward to the prospects for growth across our business segments, we remain very confident in our ability to generate our targeted mid single-digit organic growth CAGR in 2022 and beyond. An important component of organic growth is demonstrated price leadership. We remain focused on earning price in the marketplace by delivering on the Carlisle Experience, which means providing our distributors, contractors and other channel partners with innovative products of the best quality at the right place at the right time and as efficiently as possible. We could not provide that value without diligent planning, significant efforts by our operations teams and collaboration with our suppliers to ensure a steady flow of our necessary inputs. While anticipated supply chain challenges persisted in the fourth quarter, this collaboration proved particularly valuable in this uncertain environment. Our ability to anticipate these challenges, especially this year and proactively manage expectations around pricing has enabled us to provide a high level of visibility and service to our channel and to our end user base. In the fourth quarter, we more than offset the significant raw material and freight cost increases experienced in CCM with pricing, meeting our full-year target of being price cost neutral for the full calendar year 2021. Another important pillar of Vision 2025 is to build scale in our highest returning businesses through acquisition. Since the inception of Vision 2025, we've expanded into polyurethanes with the 2017 acquisition of Accella into Architectural Metals with the 2018 and 2019 acquisitions of Drexel and Petersen and most recently expanded into weather, vapor, air and energy barrier systems with the acquisition of the Henry Company in the third quarter of 2021. The Henry acquisition not only clearly demonstrates execution of our strategy to expand further into the Building Envelope, but also highlights our drive to increase the content of energy-efficient products in our portfolio. As a reminder, buildings account for approximately 30% to 40% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions. Henry's weather, vapor, air and energy barrier systems, coupled with our existing poly installation solutions help build reductions in these emissions throughout buildings and in the environment we live in. With accelerating demand for increasingly energy-efficient products made to help create more sustainable buildings in the future, we will continue to emphasize the development of products that help reduce the carbon emissions of buildings and positively impact the environment. Henry's culture around innovation, pricing to value, focus on customers and continuous improvement complements CCM's culture very well. With strong results occurring in these initial post-acquisition months, we are raising our adjusted EPS accretion forecast to over $1.50 in 2022, up from our original commitment of $1.25. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we continue to execute on our Vision 2025 capital deployment strategy. We remain committed to maintaining a balanced approach to capital deployment, continuing share repurchases. We spent $25 million on share repurchases during the fourth quarter, bringing our total spend in 2021 to $316 million. I'm proud to report that our cumulative share repurchases since 2017 now stands at $1.8 billion. With our building products focus in mind, we also announced today that we are realigning our CCM division by creating a new segment organized around Henry's products and applications for the sustainable Building Envelope. With the Henry acquisition, we've established our Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies segment, which will be led by Frank Ready, the President and CEO of Henry since 2014. In addition to Henry, Frank, will also take on leadership of our Carlisle Coatings & Waterproofing business, Carlisle Polyurethane Systems and Carlisle Diversified Products. Additionally, Steve Schwar, who has been with CCM for over 30 years, most recently serving as Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, has been promoted to President of Carlisle Construction Materials, which now consists largely of our core U.S. commercial roofing businesses and Carlisle Architectural Metals. Both Frank and Steve will continue to report to next years. Nick has successfully led CCM through some of the most challenging times in its history, and he will continue to provide leadership to both segments. Nick and Steve have fortified Carlisle's largest businesses with a deep and talented bench ready to drive its continued extension into the Building Envelope. And we look forward to this next chapter of our pivot, where we will continue to broaden and deepen our offerings of substantial, sustainable solutions to energy-efficient buildings of the future. Turning to Slide 5. In 2021, we continued to make substantial progress on our ESG journey. Our key accomplishments in the fourth quarter included breaking ground on our state-of-the-art polyiso insulation facility in Sikeston, Missouri, which will be built to LEED specifications. Progressing on energy audits of our manufacturing facilities. These audits will form the baseline on which we will make a formal commitment on net-zero carbon emissions in the near future. And we're proud to have gained increased recognition for our ESG efforts with Carlisle's inclusion in Newsweek's list of America's Most Responsible Companies. Turning to Slide 6. Our performance in the fourth quarter of 2021 evidence is continued solid execution. Revenue increased 39% year-over-year with organic revenue up over 26%. All segments contributed to this growth. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 60% year-over-year to $2.92 as higher volumes, price and cost discipline more than offset inflation during the quarter. And Bob will provide more detail around these numbers later. Turning to Slide 7. At CCM, our core Construction Materials businesses delivered an outstanding quarter despite the severe challenges across its supply chain. CCM's organic growth in the fourth quarter was approximately 30% year-over-year. And notably, organic sales were well in excess of the fourth quarter of 2019. CCM continues to benefit from a growing backlog of orders fueled by the strong reroofing cycle in the U.S., which we continue to forecast will grow at mid-single digits to a market size of over $8 billion in the next decade, an ever increasing emphasis on the energy efficiency of buildings, proactive pricing actions, further expansion into retail and residential markets and our investments in expanding our presence in the Building Envelope. We believe CCM's fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results support our long \u2013 our view, excuse me, that replacing and upgrading a roof can only be postponed for so long and that the underlying demand trends and value proposition of the Carlisle Experience are very much intact. We are also very pleased with our other growing platforms in CCM that represent our continued expansion efforts into the Building Envelope as outlined on Slide 8. Architectural Metals was a standout in the fourth quarter, growing over 40% year-over-year, Polyurethane Systems over 20% and Europe grew over 30% year-over-year. Notably, all platforms continue to progress well on profitability improvements given price discipline and leveraging COS to drive higher efficiency. Given our history of price leadership and proactive approach to price, we are very pleased that pricing more than offset raw material and freight cost inflation in the fourth quarter, which drove full-year price/cost neutrality, a target we set for 2021 this time last year. Our multiyear focus on monetizing the value of the Carlisle Experience that began in 2016 continues to evolve. This evolution has resulted in a more robust and comprehensive pricing management philosophy, which was clearly demonstrated during this extreme inflationary environment in 2021. Moving to Slide 9. At CIT, fourth quarter revenue grew over 19% year-over-year, evidence of continued progress in both its commercial aerospace and medical technology platforms. Encouragingly, in commercial aerospace, backlog is now at levels not seen since March of 2020. We are encouraged by the growing demand related to narrow-body production, driven by a steady rebound in global domestic air travel. Longer term, as demand for wide-body production returns with the resumption of international travel, CIT will be well positioned to capture and leverage that growth. Over the past several quarters, CIT has taken significant restructuring actions to drive improved profitability. The impact of these actions has shown over the past several quarters, driving CIT's profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis to swing to positive year-over-year growth in the second half of 2021 as the resumption of revenue growth drives greater leverage. On the medical side, the team delivered record fourth quarter revenue as hospital capital spending resumes. Longer term, as our medical business gains momentum and adds to its current record backlog, we believe the platform is well positioned to drive and leverage mid-to-high single-digit annual growth going forward. CFT generated revenue growth of 6% year-over-year. We continue to be pleased on the progress of \u2013 the progress CFT is making on new products, improved operational efficiencies, price realization from earning the value of innovation and an improved customer experience. And we're confident these actions will deliver results in the coming quarters. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob to discuss our financial performance in greater detail. Bob? Thanks, Bob. 2021 was a challenging year for all of us, a manner in which the Carlisle team approached our challenge is unified, resilient-driven, allowed us to persevere and finish with record results and momentum entering 2022 all of this, supporting our conviction in achieving Vision 2025. I'm very proud of our Carlisle team, especially the way everyone has shown respect for each other during the pandemic and supported our efforts to follow the CDC guidelines and Carlisle safety protocols. Our team members' cooperation with our guidelines has resulted in low levels of infection and serious illness in our workforce. And for that, I thank everyone at Carlisle. While we anticipate continued challenges throughout our end markets in 2022, we look forward to meeting them head on and driving continued profitable growth going forward and achieving our strategic goals set forth in Vision 2025. And that concludes our formal comments, Elliot. We are ready for questions. Hey. Good afternoon, Bryan. Bryan, Chris here. I think just overall, I think we still see some pricing or I should say, some inflationary trends here as we are in the first half of the year. And then I just guess, in general, we're still somewhat optimistic that we'll get some raw material pricing relief as we head into the third quarter and hopefully some labor relief as well. But I'll let Bob more specifically address. Yes. And Bryan, I would just say that this is attributed to Frank Ready and the team and also the prior ownership that there was really no slowdown in any of the activities that they had underway, both. As we were at Carlisle, they were ahead on pricing there, and they did a great job of getting ahead of that and making sure they were also taking care of supply chain, working to be efficient in their factories. And I'm really pleased that through all the turmoil, the acquisition and the integration, the teams remain really focused. And that to me is what's being delivered and the synergies being ahead of schedule and then the continued momentum in sales. So we're really pleased again. We said when we bought the company, we thought it was a great fit, and we're just pleased with what the Henry team has brought to Carlisle. You bet. Welcome to the call. Share gains in support of specifiers. Just talking in general in Europe, we are really pleased. Obviously, we start off with the transition to new leadership under our new Head of Europe, Georg, and he's brought in also some new teams in a new approach. And they're out making as much progress as they can. But our work to expand with architects, specifiers and that is an ongoing thing. We do it all the time. One of the key things we need to do is to continue to reinforce our sales team with new products and new opportunities to bring into the marketplace. And so we're pretty excited about the addition of things like Henry that's probably, first and foremost, one that I think has a really good solid opportunity to drive some interest with specifiers in Europe. Obviously, we'll have to make sure the products are fit for the European market from a regulations perspective and local building codes, but then also some of the products that we're delivering in Architectural Metals and polyurethanes, we think have some excellent fit, which really complement and will provide a full suite of products for those salespeople to deliver. And I think right now, with what they've had in the past around our limited product line, they've done an excellent job. And really, it's going to be providing this suite of building envelope solutions, and then it'll give us the most progress, I think, with our specifiers. Hopefully, that answers your question. Well, Bob and I can split this one up he can comment, too. I would say the pipeline looks fairly good. There have been a lot of transactions in the marketplace in a variety of areas. You saw we just picked up a small acquisition to add to Henry. So you can tell that even with Henry and I complimented Frank and the management team, I think it shows how much confidence we have in them that we would immediately invest in an acquisition under their leadership. And I know Henry has a list of acquisitions. We have targets in Europe. We have targets now in North America as well in other locations. So I think the pipeline is full. Obviously, pricing has been fairly robust for sellers. I think they're getting good multiples. So again, we're always going to be judicious and make sure that we can deliver on deals like Henry, where we can exceed expectations both in terms of EPS accretion and also in terms of synergies. But I'd say we're doing pretty well. Thanks, Joe. Absolutely. Yes. And sorry for that lack of clarification. Yes, really revolving around the raw materials. And I think when we say abating by midyear, maybe more specifically starting to show improvement by midyear. We are seeing some, I guess, green shoots, as you call them, but with the Omicron popping up, that didn't help with different kind of, I think, impact we've seen in the ports and the traditional supply chain issues we've seen. And then I think with Omicron and its rapid spread and then labor I'll call it, issues in the marketplace where people were having lots of people calling sick, we saw some delays there. But overall, we just see these trends to getting back to a more normalized raw material situation. And we'd like to see that have more substantial progress by midyear. Obviously, it's going to continue to evolve, and we hope that there aren't any more outbreaks of significance that could delay that. But yes, we are seeing some things happening right now. They're improving things, but mostly on the raw material side, as you said. I think in 2022. Well, yes, we've been having some meetings with contractors here in the first quarter. And it does seem like new construction still has some good legs to it. If we think about some specific areas, I'd say that warehouse is still are looking pretty good. We see the trends on online ordering and things like that, data warehouses, educational facilities and really office buildings as well. Despite all the talk we had around COVID and people working from home, we're still seeing some good positive momentum in 2022 in office buildings. So maybe that gives you a little color there. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, Tim. I think the capacity question is we did start up the TPO line in Carlisle PA last month. So that's going \u2013 we haven't launched the 16-foot sheet yet. That will be later in the year once the line gets qualified, but we have brought on some additional capacity, which will help drive the growth. But Sikeston is not going to be open until next year. So there's not a ton of capacity. I think what we've been able to do and even this is evident in the fourth quarter, how strong the sales were. Our teams have been able to get a little more bit more raw material than they thought, and they're able to continue to drive it through the factories and be productive. From what we see now, I don't believe that capacity in the \u2013 I'm going to call it the roofing industry is the gating factor right now. It's the raws coming in. We have plenty of capacity to make more. It's having the raw materials to make it. It's been \u2013 I think there's maybe been a little bit of an increase in backlog, and it really is related to more orders. And I think that's pretty much industry-wide. I don't think there's anyone that's seeing any lessening here as we start to head into the season and people get prepared to embark on another busy year. Obviously, the delays, Tim, as you know, in 2020, just added to it. I mean, labor \u2013 we talk about raw materials, but on the roof, labor is still a big constraint the installation, and that hasn't. I think raw materials probably will come back sooner than labor will. So we're still have some gating there. There are a couple specifically items, too, that are not related to us as much as other suppliers on the roof like plates and screws and things like that, that are really lower priced items, but you got to have them to put a roof down. And so even though we may be fine with the TPO sheets and the PVC and EPDM and sealants and adhesives and that, we're still \u2013 there can be some of these small items that can be gating items, too. So I think labor is a big one and then some of the things around putting down a complete system or having some constraints out with the contractor as well. Yes. I think \u2013 well, for sure, they're both going to get a lot of attention. And you can see, like I said, with that, we've invested already some capital into Henry to help with productivity and operations. We're working on some IT stuff to again, expand capacity of the whole Henry organization, plus we've added one acquisition already. So you can bet that, that weatherproofing technologies group is going to get a lot of focus. And CCM, obviously, that's our core, we've been doing that for a long time. We still see a lot of opportunity there. We mentioned Europe. We have other new technologies as well around this Building Envelope. So there's really nothing in the portfolio within weatherproofing at CCM that isn't going to be a significant focus for our growth. And that's kind of what we're excited about. We call the Building Envelope. When you look at all these verticals, we're starting to really build some strength in each one of these verticals and give that leadership team, those leadership teams opportunity to execute their visions as well. And then as we work through the continued downsizing of our portfolio outside of building products, we'll be able to allocate capital to and focus to those from a management perspective as well. Thanks, Tim. No. I mean, I think for me, Garik, the only thing that in terms of seasonality really is just the weather, right? And one of the reasons why we see less fewer roofs put on in the first quarter, fourth quarter is the parts of the United States that are impacted by winter weather. Obviously, it makes it more difficult for contractors to get out and do their job and deal with that. But other than that, I mean, it's pretty much full steam ahead for everybody in terms of work and getting as much now as they can. So I don't see anything else impacting us that would be different. No. As I mentioned with Mr. Wojs' comment around \u2013 and I mentioned the plates and screws and things like that, that may be delaying jobs. I don't think there are any contractors out there that are looking at deferred jobs. With the backlog where it is, I think the bigger issue for someone is if you were to say you wanted to defer your job, I think the quote would be well. If you defer it, you might not get back in the schedule til 2024. There's that much backlog and demand. So right now, I don't think there's anyone that is delaying anything unless, again, they don't have the labor, they don't have the complete system to put down. But I don't think anybody would delay anything willingly because it just probably means they're going to be waiting a lot longer than they would like to, to get back in the schedule. Yes. I mean they're out there. They're being recognized. So I think we're counting on them to come through. I don't think there's anything unusual with what we're seeing from the price increases. Well, we've had warranties for a long time. I think we've handled them differently than others have in the industry. I can tell you that I can't \u2013 I don't really want to speak to the profitability, but I can tell you that the CCM team has managed the warranties to be a value add to the people that choose to use them and not something that's a throwaway discounted item. So for sure, we won't be losing any money on them. And it is a valuable part of our entire Carlisle Experience. So there's value there that gets priced. But I can't really talk to any major changes because, to be honest with you, I don't think there's been any significance, I would say. But we'll check that out for you, Kevin, we'll get back. Well, I know our team at CCM and I know the team at Henry that just came in under Frank and his group, I know in Architectural Metals. I know everywhere. Europe included. Our teams seek to provide a Carlisle product for every application that's out there. So while we don't win all of them, I would say that our team over the past few years has probably done the best job of having the least disruptions if that makes any sense. And in certain cases, there have been times where we've been able to take some share. But when we think about even \u2013 let's just talk about reroofing or we think about \u2013 we just mentioned warranty, we're really looking for long-term relationships. Carlisle has been around a long time. We have a lot of really loyal contractors. We've got a lot of loyal architects and customers that depend on us, and we seek to serve those first. So in a time like this, I know as much as opportunities to gain share may come along really, Kevin, with the constraints that are there, we're going to worry less about what everybody else is doing and just make sure we're taking care of the people that are in the Carlisle family and that they get the service they need. And then, hey, look, if it results in us getting some extra share, that's fine. I mean we definitely want to be the number one, and we're going to strive to do that. But we got to do it under that Carlisle Experience, right product, right place, right time, most efficiently, and we want to pride ourselves on having the best experience for all of our channel partners and our contractors. So it doesn't really answer for you. All I can tell you is we think we've shared a lot of information over the years. We think the market is going to grow, as we said in the commentary to just over $8 billion, will continue to drive towards that. And so things that happen quarter-to-quarter, and we may not focus on as much. And we're on the right trajectory, and we just see that continuing to be the course that the market will take. And like I said, we'll try to do everything we can to take share. But first, we've got to serve our existing customers and our existing contractors. Thank you. Well, thanks, Elliot. I guess this concludes our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call, and I want to thank everybody for their participation. I want to thank all the Carlisle employees for all hard work they've done. I want to thank all of our partners, especially the people that put their faith in our products every day, and I want to also thank Bob. It's been a great five years in these calls. We've done a few of them together, and appreciate all your support. And then Kevin, we'll look forward to doing the next one together. So thanks, everybody."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Giannakouros, Carlisle\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Jim, please go ahead.\nJim Giannakouros: Thank you, Bethany. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Carlisle\u2019s third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We released our third quarter financial results after the market closed today, and you can find our press release and earnings call slide presentation in the Investor Relations section of our website, carlisle.com.

With that, I introduce Chris Koch, Chairman, President and CEO of Carlisle.\nChris Koch: All right. Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. I can start by saying I hope all of you, your families, coworkers and friends are returning to some semblance of your pre-pandemic lives while remaining safe and healthy. As you all know very well, the challenging and uncertain environment that we have experienced since the pandemic began in early 2020 continued through the third quarter of 2021. This year has truly been a story of two halves. We entered 2021, global prospects remained highly uncertain, new virus mutations were occurring, and we were slowly and unevenly emerging from lockdowns. Entering the second quarter, the rollout of vaccine started to gain momentum as access to vaccines became widespread and the extraordinary stimulus being injected into the global markets took hold. We began to turn a corner and slowly return to our pre-pandemic activity, which, in turn, drove increased economic growth in the world that was woefully unprepared to absorb the rates of gain. During factory shutdowns, stressed labor markets and lack of supply manifested themselves in increased inflation. The major challenges to normal business operations. These dynamics, coupled with the Delta variant spiking in the summer months and the effects of Hurricane Ida made the third quarter even more challenging. Thankfully, as we exited September, we seem to be past the Delta outbreak peak, and we\u2019re optimistic that recently enacted remedies to ensure stability in labor markets and easing of constrained conditions and our supply chains will take hold. Carlisle\u2019s team leveraged our continuous improvement culture, exhibiting grit and determination to deliver on the Carlisle experience, which I\u2019m happy to report drove outstanding performance, including record third quarter revenue. Simply put, we have asked a lot of our employees over the past 1.5-year, and the team has risen to the occasion every time, especially in the third quarter. There\u2019s no doubt, everyone at Carlisle is working on solutions and innovative approaches to help alleviate the pressures and deliver for our stakeholders as strong order trends across our businesses suggest demand will remain strong as we close out 2021 and continue through 2022. That said, we do expect supply chain issues to ease slightly in the fourth quarter and gain more traction early next year with a better balance being achieved perhaps by mid-2022. Please turn to slide 3. Over the last several years, and in particular, through the pandemic Vision 2025 has ensured clarity of mission and consistent direction for our entire organization. In the third quarter, we successfully delivered on our key pillars of Vision 2025, including driving organic growth in excess of 5%. In the third quarter, we delivered over 19% organic growth for the Company. As we rebound off the COVID-induced lows of last year and look forward to the prospects for growth across our business segments, we remain very confident in our ability to generate targeted mid-single-digit organic growth CAGR through 2025. An important component of organic growth has demonstrated price leadership. We\u2019ve always focused on earning price in the marketplace by delivering on the Carlisle experience, which means providing our distributors, contractors and other channel partners with innovative products of the best quality at the right place at the right time and as efficiently as possible. We couldn\u2019t do that without diligent planning and collaboration with our suppliers to ensure a steady flow of our necessary inputs. While extremely challenging in the third quarter, this collaboration proved particularly valuable in this uncertain environment. Our ability to anticipate these challenges, especially this year and maintain a proactive posture on pricing has enabled us to provide a high level of service to our channel and to our end user contractor base. Through a disciplined and proactive approach, we are successfully navigating the current inflationary environment. In the third quarter, we more than offset the significant raw material and freight cost increases experienced in CCM with pricing, and notably are on track to be price cost neutral for the full calendar year 2021. Another important pillar of Vision 2025 is to build scale in our higher-returning businesses through acquisitions. Since the inception of Vision 2025, we\u2019ve expanded into polyurethanes with the 2017 acquisition of Accella. We\u2019ve moved into architectural metals with the 2018 and 2019 acquisitions of Drexel and Petersen, respectively. And most recently, expanded into weather, vapor, air and energy barrier systems with the acquisition of Henry Company in the third quarter. Henry not only clearly demonstrates our strategy of expanding further into the building envelope, but also highlights our drive to increase the content of energy-efficient products in our portfolio. As a reminder, buildings account for approximately 30% to 40% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions. Henry\u2019s weather, vapor, air and energy barrier systems contribute to the reduction of these emissions. One example of this is Henry\u2019s Air and Vapor barrier product called Blueskin. Blueskin prevents uncontrolled air leakage and can yield up to 30% savings on heating and cooling costs. With accelerating demand for energy-efficient products made for more sustainable buildings of the future, we will continue to emphasize the development of products that help reduce the carbon emissions of buildings, positively impacting the environment. Finally, in the third quarter, we also continued to execute on our Vision 2025 capital deployment strategy. Despite closing on Henry, which was the largest acquisition in Carlisle\u2019s history, we continued to repurchase shares, spending $25 million during the third quarter and bringing our total repurchases year-to-date to $291 million. As a reminder, since 2016, we have had over $1.8 billion in share repurchases. We also anticipate continuing our long history of consistently raising our dividend, which we did again in August, marking the 45th consecutive year of increases. We are very proud of the near half century of stability in our business model that affords us the ability to consistently return capital to shareholders. Turning to slide 4 and transitioning to our ESG efforts. As we close out 2021, we continue to make steady progress on performing audits to establish baseline data at our manufacturing facilities, identify opportunities for energy, waste, water and greenhouse gas reduction and establish achievable reduction targets for the future, based on real, measurable and impactful actions. With the Carlisle Operating System core to our culture is a key driver of our success, continuous improvement applies to our ESG efforts as well. We\u2019re utilizing the Carlisle Operating System toolkit and processes to establish ESG goals and targets, which, among many benefits, will result in meaningful reductions in our emissions and energy consumption. We will set and publish these targets in the coming year. Citing a few notable ESG projects with impactful results that progressed in the third quarter. We started recycling production materials made of paper such as facer, cardboard, office wastepaper from our Carlisle, Pennsylvania campus back into our polyiso insulation products in mid-2020. Throughout 2021, we\u2019ve expanded this program to three more CCM manufacturing sites around the U.S. And through the third quarter, we have recycled nearly 1 million pounds of what would have been waste, back into our insulation products. Another effort has been to upgrade our factories with more efficient LED lighting. Throughout 2021, we have added LEDs and motion controls at many factories, saving more than 3.5 million kilowatt hours of electricity, which translates into a reduction of close to 1,300 metric tons of greenhouse gases. In an exciting new program, we plan to upgrade our expanded polystyrene facility in Dixon, California, to enable production using 100% recycled materials by the end of next year. We\u2019ll have the ability to recycle as much as 150 tons of our production and customer scrap annually, which avoids significant waste from entering landfills. Subsequent expansion of the facility will provide for the recycle of any EPS product to waste from any source. I was in Dixon this fall -- at the beginning of this fall, and I was really pleased with what the team was doing and the fact that this initiative was driven by the folks in the facility there. And we\u2019re proud to see ESG moving through our entire Company with such momentum. Turning to slide 5. Our performance in the third quarter of 2021 evidence is solid execution. Revenue increased 25% year-over-year with organic revenue up over 19%. All segments contributed to this growth. Adjusted EPS increased 27% year-over-year to $2.99 as higher volumes and price and cost discipline more than offset inflation during the quarter. And let me provide some additional divisional highlights, starting with CCM. Our Construction Materials business delivered an outstanding quarter despite the severe challenges across its supply chain. CCM\u2019s organic growth in the third quarter was over 23% year-over-year. And notably, organic sales were close to 14% higher than the third quarter of 2019. CCM continues to benefit from a growing backlog fueled by the strong reroofing cycle in the U.S., which we estimate will grow from a market size of $6 billion to $8 billion in the next decade, and with an ever-increasing emphasis on the energy efficiency of buildings, our proactive pricing actions and our investments in expanding our presence in the building envelope. We believe CCM\u2019s third quarter results on top of their performance through the pandemic support our view that replacing a roof can only be postponed for so long, ensuring that the underlying demand trends are very much intact. On slide 6, you can see how we\u2019re continuing into and expanding the building envelope, providing solutions from the ground up. Our increasing focus on the building envelope is exemplified by our recent acquisition of Henry, which delivered excellent results in its first month with Carlisle, where the integration thus far has been very smooth. As the integration has progressed, we\u2019ve really become more appreciative of Henry\u2019s seasoned management team, which is executing all fronts -- on all fronts and already proving to be a great addition to Carlisle. With similar cultures around innovation, pricing to value, focus on customers and continuous improvement and strong results out of the gate, we are increasingly confident in Henry\u2019s ability to exceed our preliminary forecast of $1.25 and adjusted EPS accretion in 2022. We\u2019re also pleased with our other growing platforms that represent our initial expansion efforts into the building envelope. Please turn to slide 7. architectural metals and polyurethanes were both up over 35% in the quarter and continue to progress well on profitability improvements. And regarding our presence and our expansion geographically, our new CCM European leadership team continues to make really good progress growing the core business, improving their profitability and driving new energy-efficient product introductions. And our recent investments to expand our capacity in our Waltershausen Germany facility will only serve to support that growth. Lastly, on CCM drivers, given our history of price leadership, proactive approach to pricing coming into 2021 and actions taken year-to-date, we\u2019re very pleased that pricing more than offset raw material and freight cost inflation in the quarter. Our multiyear focus on price began in 2016, gained traction in 2017 and continued to evolve. This evolution has resulted in a more robust and comprehensive pricing management philosophy and execution at CCM, which demonstrated its power during the inflationary environment in 2021. And finally, I\u2019d like to take a moment to note that our results could not have been generated without the stellar work of our sourcing team at CCM. They\u2019re doing an excellent job ensuring CCM is able to produce all it can, especially as demand across product lines is showing no signs of slowing. Ultimately, their hard work contributes significantly to our ability to deliver the Carlisle experience. Moving to slide 8, at CIT, third quarter revenue grew 6% year-over-year, evidence of continued progress in both CIT\u2019s commercial aerospace and medical technology platforms. The commercial aerospace backlog has now reached levels not seen since May of 2020, which is a significant milestone. We\u2019re encouraged by the growing demand related to narrow-body production driven by a steady rebound in air travel domestically. And longer term, when demand for wide-body production returns, CIT is well-positioned to capture and leverage that growth. Over the last several quarters, CIT has taken significant restructuring actions such as closing our facility in Kent, Washington to drive improved profitability. The impact of these actions has shown over the past several quarters, driving CIT\u2019s profitability on an adjusted EBIT basis to swing positive during the quarter. Now, on the medical side, record revenues supported CIT\u2019s sequential and year-over-year revenue growth as hospital capital spending has resumed. Longer term, as our medical business gains momentum and adds to its record backlog, we believe the platform is well-positioned to drive and leverage mid to high single-digit annual growth going forward. On CFT, given its reenergized commitment to new products, improved operational efficiencies, price realization from earning the value of innovation and an improved customer experience, CFT generated revenue growth of 9% year-over-year and adjusted EBIT growth of 16% year-over-year in the third quarter. CFT is benefiting from increasing industrial capital expenditures across its end markets, despite supply chain issues in the automotive markets. It\u2019s also making solid progress integrating and growing its newer platforms of Sealants & Adhesives, Foam and Powder. With a focus on innovation, the leader cost structure and a push into automation, we are optimistic about CFT\u2019s ability to generate sustainable value creation by driving and leveraging solid growth and healthy incremental margins. We expect the team to continue executing on its Vision 2025 growth strategy and to deliver continued improvement in the fourth quarter and certainly next year and beyond. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob to discuss our financial performance in greater detail. Bob?\nBob Roche: Thanks. As Chris mentioned earlier, we had a strong third quarter. There are some items -- several items that I\u2019m especially pleased with. CCM\u2019s ability to offset challenging operating cost conditions by focusing on delivering Carlisle experience, the growing backlog at CIT and CFT, our successful senior notes issuance, our disciplined approach to capital deployment in the form of share repurchases and dividends, continued investment in our high ROIC businesses to drive organic growth, and finally, our portfolio optimization actions, including divesting CBF and the acquisition of Henry Company. Please turn to revenue bridge on slide 9 of the presentation. Revenue was up 25% in the third quarter driven by volume growth at all of our businesses, price and the acquisition of Henry. Organic revenue was up 19%, driven by CCM, which delivered 23.3% organic growth. Acquisitions contributed 4.8% of sales growth for the quarter, and FX was a 30 basis-point tailwind. On slide 10, we have provided an adjusted EPS bridge. We can see third quarter adjusted EPS was $2.99, which compares to $2.35 last year. Volume, price and mix combined accounted for $2.15 of the year-over-year increase. Raw material, freight and labor costs were a $1.75 year-over-year headwind. Acquisitions contributed $0.15, Interest and tax together were a $0.05 tailwind, share repurchases contributed $0.06, COS contributed $0.09 and higher OpEx was an $0.11 headwind year-over-year. Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 11 to review the third quarter performance by segment in more detail. At CCM, the team again delivered outstanding results, with revenues increasing 29%, driven by volume price, contributions from Henry, along with a 10 basis-point foreign currency translation tailwind. All of CCM\u2019s product lines delivered double-digit percentage growth. CCM effectively managed raw material inflation headwinds experienced in the quarter with disciplined pricing, proactive sourcing and allocating products to the strategic customers. Adjusted EBITDA margin at CCM was 22.6% in the third quarter, a 240 basis-point decline from last year, driven by higher raw material prices, labor inflation and a return to more normalized SG&A spending, partially offset by volume, price and COS savings. We continue to anticipate net neutral price cost for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 16.6% to $240.5 million, again demonstrating the earnings power of our CCM business. Please turn to slide 12 to review CIT\u2019s results. CIT revenue increased 6.1% in the third quarter. As we expected, CIT returned to growth and promisingly returned to profitability on adjusted basis. CIT\u2019s commercial aerospace backlog has consistently grown in 2021 and has now surpassed second quarter 2020 levels. CIT\u2019s medical platform continues to build a robust pipeline of revenue-generating products with increasing backlog. The team delivered record sales in this business in the third quarter, and we continue to expect sequential improvement from pent-up demand as the impacts of COVID on-hospital CapEx and postponed elective surgeries ease. CIT\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin improved year-over-year 13%, driven by commercial aerospace and medical volume recovery, along with COS, partially offset by raw material and labor inflation. Given the positive indicators and actions undertaken in 2020 and 2021 to rightsize the business, we are optimistic that CIT is positioned to leverage a return to growth over the coming quarters and years. While mix influences and timing of channel inventory depletion are our biggest watch items, we remain confident in CIT\u2019s ability to manage through this, ensuring greater leverage to the recovery in the coming quarters and years with the line of sight to profitability exceeding pre-pandemic levels as demand returns. Turning to slide 13. CFT\u2019s sales grew 9.4% year-over-year. Organic revenue improved 6.3%. Additionally, acquisitions added 0.9% in the quarter, and FX contributed 2.2%. CFT is well-positioned to accelerate through the recovery due to continued stabilization in end markets, driven by an improved industrial capital spending outlook, coupled with new product introductions, which have included $12.4 million of incremental new product sales in 2021 year-to-date, along with pricing results. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 15.3% or 40 basis points, declined year-over-year. This decline was driven by labor inflation and higher operating costs, partially offset by volume, price and mix. On slides 14 and 15, we show selected balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with $296 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner, investing in organic growth through capital expenditures, and opportunistically repurchasing shares, while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. In the quarter, we repurchased 124,000 shares for $25 million, bringing our 2021 year-to-date total to 1.7 million shares for $291 million. We paid $28 million in dividends in the third quarter, bringing our \u201821 total to $84 million. We invested $34 million of CapEx into our high-returning businesses to drive organic growth, bringing our 2021 total to $89 million. Finally, we had a successful debt issuance of $850 million of senior notes at a weighted average coupon of 1.6%, which lowered Carlisle\u2019s cost of debt from 3.35% to 2.85%. In addition, as has been noted, we completed the purchase of Henry Company for $1.575 billion. Henry is expected to deliver approximately $100 million in free cash flow on our first full year of ownership. We expect meaningful cost synergies of $30 million annually by 2025. Finally, we expect Henry to be immediately accretive to Carlisle\u2019s EBITDA margins, adding over $1.25 of EPS in 2022. Free cash flow for the quarter was $82 million, a 55% decline year-over-year due to increased working capital usage related to our 25% revenue growth in the quarter. Turning to slide 16, you can see the outlook for 2021 and corporate items. Corporate expense is now expected to be approximately in the $120 million to $122 million range, slightly lower than our previous estimate of $125 million. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $230 million, which now reflects the Henry acquisition. We expect free cash flow conversion to be in the 105% to 110% range, slightly lower than our previous estimate, primarily due to high-cost raw materials that we are holding in inventory. We now expect capital expenditures of approximately $125 million, lower than previous estimates, mostly due to timing. Net interest expense is now expected to be approximately $94 million for the year, higher than previous guidance due to our debt issuance in the quarter. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25% for the year. And finally, we expect restructuring expense to be approximately $15 million to $20 million in 2021. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Chris.\nChris Koch: Thanks, Bob. Entering the third quarter, we continue to be optimistic about the remainder of 2021 and the first half of 2022. There are numerous reasons for this optimism, including record backlogs at CCM, supportive trends in CIT\u2019s aerospace markets, growing strength at CFT, improvements in our supply chain, the impact of positive and proactive pricing actions, and significant traction in our ESG journey, all the while leveraging COS and the Carlisle experience to deliver innovative products to our customers. For these reasons, we\u2019re confident in our continued ability to deliver results for all Carlisle stakeholders. For full year 2021, we anticipate the following: At CCM, the underlying reroofing trends that have provided a solid foundation for growth over the past decade, picked up in the second half of 2021 after a pause in 2020. Through the pandemic, we continue to invest in CCM in order to ensure we would be ready when demand returned. In addition, our expansion further into the building envelope; the increasing importance of energy-efficient products; contributions from Henry; and our proactive pricing actions have positioned CCM well for continued growth over the coming quarters. Considering this momentum, we are increasing our anticipated revenue growth to mid-20% in 2021. At CIT, we are encouraged by the recovery in narrow-body commercial aircraft. While this first step to recovery is encouraging, demand for wide-body aircraft driven by international travel remains muted in 2021. We anticipate this demand will return to previous levels as COVID concerns subside and countries relax their travel restrictions. In addition, CIT\u2019s medical business has built a record backlog. Taken together and coupled with significant restructuring at CIT over the past 18 months, CIT is now positioned to take advantage of the ongoing recovery. We continue to expect sequential improvements and now expect CIT revenue will only decline in the mid-single-digit range in full year 2021. At CFT, with end market strengthening due to increasing industrial capital expenditures and improvements in the team\u2019s execution of our key strategies, including new product introductions accelerating, growth in our new platforms and price discipline, we continue to expect mid-teens revenue growth in 2021. And finally, for Carlisle as a whole, we are now increasing our expectations to deliver high-teens revenue growth in 2021. As we progress through the final quarter of 2021, we are tracking to deliver a record year despite one of the most challenging time periods in our history. We remain committed to our Vision 2025 goals of $8 billion in revenues, 20% operating income and 15% ROIC, all driving to exceed $15 of earnings per share by 2025. Despite the continued uncertainties around COVID, stressed supply chains, raw material shortages, labor inflation and winter weather, Carlisle\u2019s resilient employees have adhered to our COVID protocols, shown respect for each other in the workplace, focused on safety, most importantly, remained focused on delivering results for all our Carlisle stakeholders. With that, we\u2019ll conclude our formal comments. Bethany, we\u2019re now ready for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  The first question comes from the line of Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer.\nBryan Blair: I was hoping to dig in a little more on CCM\u2019s underlying demand trends and outlook. Last quarter, you had cited orders close to -- I think it was 2x normalized levels. How did 3Q trend compare to that? What kind of momentum do you have into 4Q, understanding that\u2019s a seasonally lighter period we\u2019re now in? And how is your team thinking about the disconnect that we\u2019ve had, at least over the recent past in terms of order rates versus revenue? On that front, is there any further clarity on percentage of firm orders and adding to pent-up demand and backlog entering 2022 versus the double order when it was there in response to supply concerns?\nChris Koch: Bryan, let me first start and Bob can jump in. I think the demand has just continued. We see more traction as we progress into Q3 and as we enter Q4. And we\u2019ve seen backlogs increase, and we\u2019ve seen orders push out. I think we\u2019re now into the second quarter of 2022, something that in the past -- that length of ordering or at least that time period of delivery has not really been seen before in a large scale. So, yes, the demand continues. I think, fourth quarter will be an abnormal fourth quarter in the sense that, yes, we have been seasonally affected in the fourth quarter usually. But, I think with the backlog, it will be as much as we can get shipped, and as much really importantly, as roofers can put down. I mean, obviously, they have work that needs to get done. And we\u2019re going to be constrained or they\u2019re going to be constrained by two things, I think, labor availability and then weather. So, stay tuned, but I think should we have a good fall and good early winter, and by that, I mean open days on the roof, I think things will continue in a positive direction. And then, on the double booking in that, I think our team has done something very interesting, which is they\u2019ve put in some -- and I\u2019m not going to go into details, but they\u2019ve put in some mechanisms that have really taken out that double booking in our bookings. And even with doing that, things remain strong and lead times continue to extend. Bob, do you want to add anything?\nBob Roche: No. You\u2019ve covered, Chris.\nBryan Blair: All good to hear. And you\u2019re obviously putting through a lot of price, encouraging to see price cost back into positive territory. As prices continue to climb, have you sensed any pushback in the channel? Are there concerns about demand destruction with potentially shifting project economics going forward?\nChris Koch: No, I don\u2019t really think so. I think, people understand that it\u2019s in a very inflationary time. I think the key thing now is can you get product, I think it gets passed on early in the year. I would say there was more pushback in the first quarter where the demand hadn\u2019t picked up yet. But as things have accelerated, I think people are focused on getting jobs done. I think also, I\u2019ll give a tip of hat to the guys at Greco today and David Low, who made a nice comment that people do a fair job of recapturing the costs, right? But, we still have to make sense to what the end user customer is doing at the decision point of sale. And I think our CCM team has done a really good job of that of balancing that idea that it\u2019s not like we made big gains in price over raws. We\u2019re saying we\u2019re neutral. So, we\u2019re attempting to secure raw materials so they can complete their jobs and not trying to take advantage of the situation. So again, they\u2019ve been making decisions to come to Carlisle consistently, and we haven\u2019t seen any degradation in jobs or movement of jobs due to price.\nBryan Blair: Understood. Your commentary on early stage tender integrations was very positive. Any other color you can offer there? And specifically, what drives your confidence in -- or increasing confidence in exceeding the $1.25 in year one? And specifically, does that contemplate any price cost tailwinds, or what\u2019s your commentary independent of that lever?\nChris Koch: Yes. I would say that, first of all, our confidence in this is we\u2019ve gotten -- we had a lot of confidence going as we did our due diligence and looked at what the Henry team has done over at least the last six years. And we talked about that on the call after we purchased them and Bob\u2019s talked about it and Jim, I know has too. We\u2019ve gotten to know the team better. I can tell you that. And we are very impressed with Frank Ready and the team that he\u2019s assembled. They\u2019ve stayed on post acquisition. They\u2019re doing a great job. They continue to operate. There hasn\u2019t been any delay. We\u2019ve had a really good job by our corporate integration team supporting the CCM and Henry folks, and things have gone really smooth. So, tip of the hat to both teams and how quickly they\u2019ve come together and really focused on growth in that. In terms of the pricing in that, I would say that Henry is a premium brand. It\u2019s well-recognized by their end users. It\u2019s demanded by their end users. And I think they\u2019ve had the same success as CCM has had and going to their channel partners and saying, we\u2019re seeing escalated raw material costs. We\u2019re seeing availability struggles that we need to pay more to get that product, but we can get it to you and they\u2019re fulfilling but they\u2019re having to fill at higher cost. And I think, the channel partners and end users have understood that, and we\u2019ve just seen good execution there. So, I think, in general, a great team, continued execution on what they were doing anyway and really good integration is just increasing our optimism for 2022.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Can you just talk through your increase in guidance for CCM sales to be up mid-20%? How should we think about the contribution from Henry and your assumptions on price versus volume? And then, any color on the carryover of pricing actions into 2022?\nChris Koch: And maybe I\u2019ll take the first one on the carryover and Bob can handle the previous one. The pricing actions, again, we talked about being neutral. We do think those pricing actions will carry through as long as demand holds up, which it is. And I think we will see if there is any continued increase in either labor or freight or raw materials or any of that, we will obviously take actions to offset that. But, I don\u2019t see any issue with that carrying through, and I think it will probably carry through at least to the first half of 2022. So, that\u2019s pretty much just what we\u2019ve been doing and been pretty consistent through the year on price and why we\u2019re driving price. And I think it\u2019s been clearly communicated to the channel as well and to -- and everyone understands. And Bob, you might want to address that comment of Saree\u2019s.\nBob Roche: Yes. Saree, the -- I\u2019m going to say, the guidance for base CCM continues to be the high-teens and then we\u2019re adding in Henry to the tune of 5% or 6%.\nSaree Boroditsky: Understood. And then, you made a comment about orders going out to second quarter of 2022. How does that work from a price cost perspective? Do these orders go out to prior pricing levels, so there should be more of a lag in realized pricing than is typical?\nChris Koch: No. In fact, Saree, what\u2019s really happened recently has been that a lot of these orders are being priced at the time of shipment. So, we\u2019ll see that those orders are really -- they\u2019re placed, but they\u2019re not being given pricing that we\u2019re going to have to recognize later. If there is escalation, we\u2019ll price to that escalation.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: You cited weather as a headwind in the release. Is that mostly on the supply side with the storms in Gulf Coast? Was there a cost impact, if so? And also, do you see any push-out of demand given some of the weather headwinds that you might have experienced? And I guess, what I\u2019m ultimately getting at is it possible at all to quantify how much the weather impacted the margin side?\nChris Koch: Yes. It\u2019s interesting, Garik, if it was a normal quarter, we probably would have been able to quantify. We would have said something like two or three days off the roof, but we didn\u2019t, I think with everything else going on and all the puts and takes. It obviously impacted demand, if there\u2019s a hurricane coming through the central part of the United States, obviously, we\u2019re not going to have people on roofs. They\u2019re going to be taking care to be safe and other things like that. I would say, though, it probably impacted a supply chain that was already under stress, even more than it did demand. And so, yes, the demand gets pushed out. As we said, if you\u2019re going to reroof for roof or if you\u2019re going to do a job, you\u2019re going to have to do it. And if you can\u2019t get it done that day, you got to do it in the future. And then, on the supply chain, I think it\u2019s just -- as I said, it aggravated the situation more, probably put a little bit greater upward pressure on either supply availability or pricing or maybe both.\nGarik Shmois: I was wondering if you could maybe provide a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing on the supply chain, your degree of confidence that it will return to some sort of normalization in 2022 would be helpful.\nChris Koch: Right. Well, I think from the base premises, if we look back at 2020, when we look at the costs that we had on unit cost across MDI, TPO, polyiso, EPDM, those things, those were -- those are supplied at a certain level with certain capacity there. And really, the only thing that happened was we had COVID hit and people had more restricted work days. They shut things down, things like that. And prices escalated. When we look at the pricing escalation, most of it was done between the latter of Q2, I would say, probably June and then into Q3 and accelerated a bit into Q4. As they had to hire, you can see the rising cost of labor, you have to start up factories, you have increased shipping costs. I think we saw that this doesn\u2019t affect us necessarily directly, but freight from containers from China had gone from, let\u2019s say, 4,000, 5,000 to 25,000 on the spot market, I think. So, you see this happening. And I think our thought is that these things will get worked out. We know in the Port of Long Beach, I think they\u2019ve gone to 7-day a week, 24-hour a day work. They\u2019re going to see some reduction in the backlog there over time. It will take time to do it. And we think that plays out in the rest of the economy. And by the time we get to Q1, those same trends that were there in 2019 and the capacity and everything else comes back. And really, we haven\u2019t seen the growth that would tell you that we\u2019ve exceeded some of those capacities. And so, I think we go back to kind of \u201819, and we see some stabilization and reduction in at least in the lack of availability and hopefully some pricing as well.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. And then, just my last question. Just in CCM, just given the momentum in your backlog, how much of this do you think is just underlying demand and just kind of the natural part of the commercial cycle that you\u2019re in versus your ability to continue to take market share just given your capacity and service levels?\nChris Koch: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t read too much in the market share in the June through current date time frame. I think, we don\u2019t have a lot of really concrete data that we\u2019ve gained share. I think what we\u2019ve seen anecdotally is that we\u2019ve had more people that previously were with competitors come and ask us for products. That would tell me that we\u2019re maybe in a little bit of a better position than others, but I can\u2019t back that up with anything on numbers. So, I looked back to the way it was, like I said, in \u201819 before COIVD hit. And I don\u2019t think where the competitors are there that the markets have changed that much. So, they\u2019re going forward will see significant changes in market share. So, I think it\u2019s really been demand has accelerated because last year went down and projects were delayed and projects were pushed aside and projects were postponed. And then, we came back, as we said in the first quarter, we thought things were going to be strong this year, we built inventory, we raised prices because we anticipated as the vaccines took hold and as reopenings occurred that demand would pick up. And as we\u2019ve always said, with 70% of our business being in reroofing that these things have to get done and it would have to pick up some time. And so, I think a lot of this demand is spread evenly across all of our competitors and ourselves, and it\u2019s just a response to the 2020 downturn. And that great mid-single-digit underlying trend that was there post 2010 just continues.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird.\nTim Wojs: Maybe just sticking on supply a little bit, more on availability. Have you had any meaningful challenges actually getting supply in terms of commodities?\nChris Koch: Yes. I would say, yes -- yes, definitely. I\u2019m not going to point out which ones. But yes, there have been some instances. And that\u2019s why we pointed to our sourcing team. They\u2019ve done a heck of good job scouring the globe, trying to find stuff to make sure we can meet our customer demand.\nTim Wojs: Okay. I mean, has that -- is that what the easing is as you think of Q3 to Q4, it\u2019s actually the availability?\nChris Koch: Yes. I think that\u2019s the first, I think that absolutely.\nTim Wojs: Okay. And then, I guess, just in the offseason, I mean, historically, you guys have used it as a time to build more inventory. I\u2019m just trying to think about, as you prepare for next season, particularly in the membrane part of the business, how you\u2019re thinking about kind of that pre-season inventory builds to support next season, if you can have a normal build, I guess, or be able to do a normal build?\nChris Koch: I would think it would be disingenuous to say we\u2019re going to have a normal build. I think, as we talk about getting everything we can out to keep people working and to keep these job sites and living up to our Carlisle experience, right? We make a big commitment with that and people expect it. As long as that demand holds, like I said, and the weather is good in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, we\u2019re going to be shipping things out to put on roofs and support our contractors. Now, if there are days where we have a long weather periods of snow or that we\u2019ll use that opportunity to build inventory, we\u2019re not going to slow down. But, I think there will be some opportunity just because of the way the winter is in most of the United States. But, I also think if there\u2019s any opportunity for people to catch up, they\u2019re going to do it. So, I think we\u2019ll have more information as we get kind of further into the quarter, see how things go. But, I think it\u2019s going to be tough to build any real meaningful inventory in Q4 and Q1, like we usually do.\nTim Wojs: Okay. And then, could you just remind us when the TPO and polyiso capacity comes on next year, at least preliminarily?\nChris Koch: Yes, go ahead.\nBob Roche: Yes. TPO is going to be the first quarter. We\u2019re going to be making the normal 12-foot sheets on it and then going to 16 later in the year as they, I\u2019m going to say, stabilize the production process and then get it dialed in. And then, the polyiso is going to be late \u201822, early \u201823.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: I guess, Chris, I wanted to ask you about a comment you made earlier with respect to the potential limitations you may face on growth, one of them being installation labor. And I guess to what extent do you think the installation labor availability use as a governor to 2022 growth? And what can you do about that? Is there anything -- do you any options, do you have any levers you can pull to work around those potential constraints?\nChris Koch: Yes. Well, I think you\u2019re right to cite that. It is true. I mean, we actually are constrained. We\u2019re happy to most times be able to deliver everything our customers can apply to a roof, but we\u2019re constrained by their ability to put it down. So, that\u2019s a real issue. I don\u2019t know how much we can do to alleviate that. But what we can do and what our team is doing is making products to take labor off the roof. And Bob just mentioned the new 16-foot TPO sheets that are going to be made in Carlisle PA. And we had a chance to see the progress on that line earlier this year. And it\u2019s really remarkable, what an enduring feed it is. But more remarkable is the fact that that\u2019s going to get a roof put down faster and allow our contractors to get off the roof quicker. We also have work we\u2019ve done with CAV-GRIP, one of our adhesives and other things. We just keep trying to make the installation as quick as possible, obviously, still holding all the quality and technical specification we need, making sure all the product is there. This is a big one. If you think about that idea that we say getting the product at the right place at the right time, right, in the right quantity and all that, we pride ourselves on that. And it makes a huge difference because as we know, unless you have all the products there, you\u2019re going to have labor standing around and that doesn\u2019t benefit anybody. And then even on cleanup. We\u2019ve talked about our -- I\u2019ll cite a product called APEEL that we\u2019ve talked about for a couple of years. I thought it was an extraordinary product. It\u2019s a thin sheet that goes on that as opposed to having to wash the roof after an installation and clean it and bringing power washers up and that stuff. You simply peel this membrane off and you\u2019re on your way. So, I think the CCM team is doing a heck of a job focusing their new product efforts on doing two things. One is really that whole ESG thing and making sure that we\u2019re making our buildings more energy efficient and people are able to use our products to do that. And then the other one is just to deal with this labor component and take labor out of the process.\nTim Wojs: The second question was really kind of, I guess, at a much higher level. I\u2019m just wondering to what extent you\u2019re seeing any change in building codes that would, if anything at all, that might bode well for your business over the next couple of years or are building codes relatively static at this point and not an area where you\u2019re seeing much revision?\nChris Koch: No. I think building codes are definitely moving. We\u2019ve had some incidents that have been positive this year and others that we know about that have been negative for everything from concrete to cladding and things like this globally that I know our building code people and our engineers and architects spend a lot of time trying to make these buildings safe as energy efficient as they can because there\u2019s great returns, and they want their buildings to be the best buildings that are out there. And look, in our business, one of the biggest ones that happened was a few years ago when we started CCM going out and talking about the idea of having two layers of polyiso and it was increasing the value for a very reasonable price. And we used to have a calculator on iPad that would take the local rebates and things into that and allow building owners to see what adding another layer of insulation would do. What we found was that soon that became codified. And over the last few years, I think some of the big driver in our increased polyiso sales has been around the codification of that trend to double insulation and build it into the building code because increasing that, our value just had a great return for everyone. So, we will see that with some of the Henry products. We mentioned Blueskin. Once people start to see that a new product can help with the energy efficiency of a building, it gets through the architects. We do a lot of training, train our contractors on it. And then we can drive that through. And I think that type of product once people get to use it and see the results, then it can move into that code stage. But, to have the codes modified and improved is a pretty elaborate process and they have to make sure they\u2019re doing the right thing and testing everything. So, it happens. It just happens over time. But yes, we\u2019re seeing that.\nOperator: There are no additional questions waiting at this time. I would like to pass the conference back over to Chris for any additional remarks.\nChris Koch: All right. Well, thanks, Bethany. This concludes our third quarter 2021 earnings call. We want to thank everybody for their participation, and we look forward to speaking with you again at our next earnings call. Thanks very much.\nOperator: This concludes the Carlisle Companies third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I hope you all enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Roche",
            "content": "Thanks. As Chris mentioned earlier, we had a strong third quarter. There are some items -- several items that I'm especially pleased with. CCM's ability to offset challenging operating cost conditions by focusing on delivering Carlisle experience, the growing backlog at CIT and CFT, our successful senior notes issuance, our disciplined approach to capital deployment in the form of share repurchases and dividends, continued investment in our high ROIC businesses to drive organic growth, and finally, our portfolio optimization actions, including divesting CBF and the acquisition of Henry Company. Please turn to revenue bridge on slide 9 of the presentation. Revenue was up 25% in the third quarter driven by volume growth at all of our businesses, price and the acquisition of Henry. Organic revenue was up 19%, driven by CCM, which delivered 23.3% organic growth. Acquisitions contributed 4.8% of sales growth for the quarter, and FX was a 30 basis-point tailwind. On slide 10, we have provided an adjusted EPS bridge. We can see third quarter adjusted EPS was $2.99, which compares to $2.35 last year. Volume, price and mix combined accounted for $2.15 of the year-over-year increase. Raw material, freight and labor costs were a $1.75 year-over-year headwind. Acquisitions contributed $0.15, Interest and tax together were a $0.05 tailwind, share repurchases contributed $0.06, COS contributed $0.09 and higher OpEx was an $0.11 headwind year-over-year. Now, let's turn to slide 11 to review the third quarter performance by segment in more detail. At CCM, the team again delivered outstanding results, with revenues increasing 29%, driven by volume price, contributions from Henry, along with a 10 basis-point foreign currency translation tailwind. All of CCM's product lines delivered double-digit percentage growth. CCM effectively managed raw material inflation headwinds experienced in the quarter with disciplined pricing, proactive sourcing and allocating products to the strategic customers. Adjusted EBITDA margin at CCM was 22.6% in the third quarter, a 240 basis-point decline from last year, driven by higher raw material prices, labor inflation and a return to more normalized SG&A spending, partially offset by volume, price and COS savings. We continue to anticipate net neutral price cost for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 16.6% to $240.5 million, again demonstrating the earnings power of our CCM business. Please turn to slide 12 to review CIT's results. CIT revenue increased 6.1% in the third quarter. As we expected, CIT returned to growth and promisingly returned to profitability on adjusted basis. CIT's commercial aerospace backlog has consistently grown in 2021 and has now surpassed second quarter 2020 levels. CIT's medical platform continues to build a robust pipeline of revenue-generating products with increasing backlog. The team delivered record sales in this business in the third quarter, and we continue to expect sequential improvement from pent-up demand as the impacts of COVID on-hospital CapEx and postponed elective surgeries ease. CIT's adjusted EBITDA margin improved year-over-year 13%, driven by commercial aerospace and medical volume recovery, along with COS, partially offset by raw material and labor inflation. Given the positive indicators and actions undertaken in 2020 and 2021 to rightsize the business, we are optimistic that CIT is positioned to leverage a return to growth over the coming quarters and years. While mix influences and timing of channel inventory depletion are our biggest watch items, we remain confident in CIT's ability to manage through this, ensuring greater leverage to the recovery in the coming quarters and years with the line of sight to profitability exceeding pre-pandemic levels as demand returns. Turning to slide 13. CFT's sales grew 9.4% year-over-year. Organic revenue improved 6.3%. Additionally, acquisitions added 0.9% in the quarter, and FX contributed 2.2%. CFT is well-positioned to accelerate through the recovery due to continued stabilization in end markets, driven by an improved industrial capital spending outlook, coupled with new product introductions, which have included $12.4 million of incremental new product sales in 2021 year-to-date, along with pricing results. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 15.3% or 40 basis points, declined year-over-year. This decline was driven by labor inflation and higher operating costs, partially offset by volume, price and mix. On slides 14 and 15, we show selected balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with $296 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner, investing in organic growth through capital expenditures, and opportunistically repurchasing shares, while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. In the quarter, we repurchased 124,000 shares for $25 million, bringing our 2021 year-to-date total to 1.7 million shares for $291 million. We paid $28 million in dividends in the third quarter, bringing our \u201821 total to $84 million. We invested $34 million of CapEx into our high-returning businesses to drive organic growth, bringing our 2021 total to $89 million. Finally, we had a successful debt issuance of $850 million of senior notes at a weighted average coupon of 1.6%, which lowered Carlisle's cost of debt from 3.35% to 2.85%. In addition, as has been noted, we completed the purchase of Henry Company for $1.575 billion. Henry is expected to deliver approximately $100 million in free cash flow on our first full year of ownership. We expect meaningful cost synergies of $30 million annually by 2025. Finally, we expect Henry to be immediately accretive to Carlisle's EBITDA margins, adding over $1.25 of EPS in 2022. Free cash flow for the quarter was $82 million, a 55% decline year-over-year due to increased working capital usage related to our 25% revenue growth in the quarter. Turning to slide 16, you can see the outlook for 2021 and corporate items. Corporate expense is now expected to be approximately in the $120 million to $122 million range, slightly lower than our previous estimate of $125 million. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $230 million, which now reflects the Henry acquisition. We expect free cash flow conversion to be in the 105% to 110% range, slightly lower than our previous estimate, primarily due to high-cost raw materials that we are holding in inventory. We now expect capital expenditures of approximately $125 million, lower than previous estimates, mostly due to timing. Net interest expense is now expected to be approximately $94 million for the year, higher than previous guidance due to our debt issuance in the quarter. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25% for the year. And finally, we expect restructuring expense to be approximately $15 million to $20 million in 2021. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris. No. You've covered, Chris. Yes. Saree, the -- I'm going to say, the guidance for base CCM continues to be the high-teens and then we're adding in Henry to the tune of 5% or 6%. Yes. TPO is going to be the first quarter. We're going to be making the normal 12-foot sheets on it and then going to 16 later in the year as they, I'm going to say, stabilize the production process and then get it dialed in. And then, the polyiso is going to be late \u201822, early \u201823."

            "name": "Chris Koch",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. I can start by saying I hope all of you, your families, coworkers and friends are returning to some semblance of your pre-pandemic lives while remaining safe and healthy. As you all know very well, the challenging and uncertain environment that we have experienced since the pandemic began in early 2020 continued through the third quarter of 2021. This year has truly been a story of two halves. We entered 2021, global prospects remained highly uncertain, new virus mutations were occurring, and we were slowly and unevenly emerging from lockdowns. Entering the second quarter, the rollout of vaccine started to gain momentum as access to vaccines became widespread and the extraordinary stimulus being injected into the global markets took hold. We began to turn a corner and slowly return to our pre-pandemic activity, which, in turn, drove increased economic growth in the world that was woefully unprepared to absorb the rates of gain. During factory shutdowns, stressed labor markets and lack of supply manifested themselves in increased inflation. The major challenges to normal business operations. These dynamics, coupled with the Delta variant spiking in the summer months and the effects of Hurricane Ida made the third quarter even more challenging. Thankfully, as we exited September, we seem to be past the Delta outbreak peak, and we're optimistic that recently enacted remedies to ensure stability in labor markets and easing of constrained conditions and our supply chains will take hold. Carlisle's team leveraged our continuous improvement culture, exhibiting grit and determination to deliver on the Carlisle experience, which I'm happy to report drove outstanding performance, including record third quarter revenue. Simply put, we have asked a lot of our employees over the past 1.5-year, and the team has risen to the occasion every time, especially in the third quarter. There's no doubt, everyone at Carlisle is working on solutions and innovative approaches to help alleviate the pressures and deliver for our stakeholders as strong order trends across our businesses suggest demand will remain strong as we close out 2021 and continue through 2022. That said, we do expect supply chain issues to ease slightly in the fourth quarter and gain more traction early next year with a better balance being achieved perhaps by mid-2022. Please turn to slide 3. Over the last several years, and in particular, through the pandemic Vision 2025 has ensured clarity of mission and consistent direction for our entire organization. In the third quarter, we successfully delivered on our key pillars of Vision 2025, including driving organic growth in excess of 5%. In the third quarter, we delivered over 19% organic growth for the Company. As we rebound off the COVID-induced lows of last year and look forward to the prospects for growth across our business segments, we remain very confident in our ability to generate targeted mid-single-digit organic growth CAGR through 2025. An important component of organic growth has demonstrated price leadership. We've always focused on earning price in the marketplace by delivering on the Carlisle experience, which means providing our distributors, contractors and other channel partners with innovative products of the best quality at the right place at the right time and as efficiently as possible. We couldn't do that without diligent planning and collaboration with our suppliers to ensure a steady flow of our necessary inputs. While extremely challenging in the third quarter, this collaboration proved particularly valuable in this uncertain environment. Our ability to anticipate these challenges, especially this year and maintain a proactive posture on pricing has enabled us to provide a high level of service to our channel and to our end user contractor base. Through a disciplined and proactive approach, we are successfully navigating the current inflationary environment. In the third quarter, we more than offset the significant raw material and freight cost increases experienced in CCM with pricing, and notably are on track to be price cost neutral for the full calendar year 2021. Another important pillar of Vision 2025 is to build scale in our higher-returning businesses through acquisitions. Since the inception of Vision 2025, we've expanded into polyurethanes with the 2017 acquisition of Accella. We've moved into architectural metals with the 2018 and 2019 acquisitions of Drexel and Petersen, respectively. And most recently, expanded into weather, vapor, air and energy barrier systems with the acquisition of Henry Company in the third quarter. Henry not only clearly demonstrates our strategy of expanding further into the building envelope, but also highlights our drive to increase the content of energy-efficient products in our portfolio. As a reminder, buildings account for approximately 30% to 40% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions. Henry's weather, vapor, air and energy barrier systems contribute to the reduction of these emissions. One example of this is Henry's Air and Vapor barrier product called Blueskin. Blueskin prevents uncontrolled air leakage and can yield up to 30% savings on heating and cooling costs. With accelerating demand for energy-efficient products made for more sustainable buildings of the future, we will continue to emphasize the development of products that help reduce the carbon emissions of buildings, positively impacting the environment. Finally, in the third quarter, we also continued to execute on our Vision 2025 capital deployment strategy. Despite closing on Henry, which was the largest acquisition in Carlisle's history, we continued to repurchase shares, spending $25 million during the third quarter and bringing our total repurchases year-to-date to $291 million. As a reminder, since 2016, we have had over $1.8 billion in share repurchases. We also anticipate continuing our long history of consistently raising our dividend, which we did again in August, marking the 45th consecutive year of increases. We are very proud of the near half century of stability in our business model that affords us the ability to consistently return capital to shareholders. Turning to slide 4 and transitioning to our ESG efforts. As we close out 2021, we continue to make steady progress on performing audits to establish baseline data at our manufacturing facilities, identify opportunities for energy, waste, water and greenhouse gas reduction and establish achievable reduction targets for the future, based on real, measurable and impactful actions. With the Carlisle Operating System core to our culture is a key driver of our success, continuous improvement applies to our ESG efforts as well. We're utilizing the Carlisle Operating System toolkit and processes to establish ESG goals and targets, which, among many benefits, will result in meaningful reductions in our emissions and energy consumption. We will set and publish these targets in the coming year. Citing a few notable ESG projects with impactful results that progressed in the third quarter. We started recycling production materials made of paper such as facer, cardboard, office wastepaper from our Carlisle, Pennsylvania campus back into our polyiso insulation products in mid-2020. Throughout 2021, we've expanded this program to three more CCM manufacturing sites around the U.S. And through the third quarter, we have recycled nearly 1 million pounds of what would have been waste, back into our insulation products. Another effort has been to upgrade our factories with more efficient LED lighting. Throughout 2021, we have added LEDs and motion controls at many factories, saving more than 3.5 million kilowatt hours of electricity, which translates into a reduction of close to 1,300 metric tons of greenhouse gases. In an exciting new program, we plan to upgrade our expanded polystyrene facility in Dixon, California, to enable production using 100% recycled materials by the end of next year. We'll have the ability to recycle as much as 150 tons of our production and customer scrap annually, which avoids significant waste from entering landfills. Subsequent expansion of the facility will provide for the recycle of any EPS product to waste from any source. I was in Dixon this fall -- at the beginning of this fall, and I was really pleased with what the team was doing and the fact that this initiative was driven by the folks in the facility there. And we're proud to see ESG moving through our entire Company with such momentum. Turning to slide 5. Our performance in the third quarter of 2021 evidence is solid execution. Revenue increased 25% year-over-year with organic revenue up over 19%. All segments contributed to this growth. Adjusted EPS increased 27% year-over-year to $2.99 as higher volumes and price and cost discipline more than offset inflation during the quarter. And let me provide some additional divisional highlights, starting with CCM. Our Construction Materials business delivered an outstanding quarter despite the severe challenges across its supply chain. CCM's organic growth in the third quarter was over 23% year-over-year. And notably, organic sales were close to 14% higher than the third quarter of 2019. CCM continues to benefit from a growing backlog fueled by the strong reroofing cycle in the U.S., which we estimate will grow from a market size of $6 billion to $8 billion in the next decade, and with an ever-increasing emphasis on the energy efficiency of buildings, our proactive pricing actions and our investments in expanding our presence in the building envelope. We believe CCM's third quarter results on top of their performance through the pandemic support our view that replacing a roof can only be postponed for so long, ensuring that the underlying demand trends are very much intact. On slide 6, you can see how we're continuing into and expanding the building envelope, providing solutions from the ground up. Our increasing focus on the building envelope is exemplified by our recent acquisition of Henry, which delivered excellent results in its first month with Carlisle, where the integration thus far has been very smooth. As the integration has progressed, we've really become more appreciative of Henry's seasoned management team, which is executing all fronts -- on all fronts and already proving to be a great addition to Carlisle. With similar cultures around innovation, pricing to value, focus on customers and continuous improvement and strong results out of the gate, we are increasingly confident in Henry's ability to exceed our preliminary forecast of $1.25 and adjusted EPS accretion in 2022. We're also pleased with our other growing platforms that represent our initial expansion efforts into the building envelope. Please turn to slide 7. architectural metals and polyurethanes were both up over 35% in the quarter and continue to progress well on profitability improvements. And regarding our presence and our expansion geographically, our new CCM European leadership team continues to make really good progress growing the core business, improving their profitability and driving new energy-efficient product introductions. And our recent investments to expand our capacity in our Waltershausen Germany facility will only serve to support that growth. Lastly, on CCM drivers, given our history of price leadership, proactive approach to pricing coming into 2021 and actions taken year-to-date, we're very pleased that pricing more than offset raw material and freight cost inflation in the quarter. Our multiyear focus on price began in 2016, gained traction in 2017 and continued to evolve. This evolution has resulted in a more robust and comprehensive pricing management philosophy and execution at CCM, which demonstrated its power during the inflationary environment in 2021. And finally, I'd like to take a moment to note that our results could not have been generated without the stellar work of our sourcing team at CCM. They're doing an excellent job ensuring CCM is able to produce all it can, especially as demand across product lines is showing no signs of slowing. Ultimately, their hard work contributes significantly to our ability to deliver the Carlisle experience. Moving to slide 8, at CIT, third quarter revenue grew 6% year-over-year, evidence of continued progress in both CIT's commercial aerospace and medical technology platforms. The commercial aerospace backlog has now reached levels not seen since May of 2020, which is a significant milestone. We're encouraged by the growing demand related to narrow-body production driven by a steady rebound in air travel domestically. And longer term, when demand for wide-body production returns, CIT is well-positioned to capture and leverage that growth. Over the last several quarters, CIT has taken significant restructuring actions such as closing our facility in Kent, Washington to drive improved profitability. The impact of these actions has shown over the past several quarters, driving CIT's profitability on an adjusted EBIT basis to swing positive during the quarter. Now, on the medical side, record revenues supported CIT's sequential and year-over-year revenue growth as hospital capital spending has resumed. Longer term, as our medical business gains momentum and adds to its record backlog, we believe the platform is well-positioned to drive and leverage mid to high single-digit annual growth going forward. On CFT, given its reenergized commitment to new products, improved operational efficiencies, price realization from earning the value of innovation and an improved customer experience, CFT generated revenue growth of 9% year-over-year and adjusted EBIT growth of 16% year-over-year in the third quarter. CFT is benefiting from increasing industrial capital expenditures across its end markets, despite supply chain issues in the automotive markets. It's also making solid progress integrating and growing its newer platforms of Sealants & Adhesives, Foam and Powder. With a focus on innovation, the leader cost structure and a push into automation, we are optimistic about CFT's ability to generate sustainable value creation by driving and leveraging solid growth and healthy incremental margins. We expect the team to continue executing on its Vision 2025 growth strategy and to deliver continued improvement in the fourth quarter and certainly next year and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bob to discuss our financial performance in greater detail. Bob? Thanks, Bob. Entering the third quarter, we continue to be optimistic about the remainder of 2021 and the first half of 2022. There are numerous reasons for this optimism, including record backlogs at CCM, supportive trends in CIT's aerospace markets, growing strength at CFT, improvements in our supply chain, the impact of positive and proactive pricing actions, and significant traction in our ESG journey, all the while leveraging COS and the Carlisle experience to deliver innovative products to our customers. For these reasons, we're confident in our continued ability to deliver results for all Carlisle stakeholders. For full year 2021, we anticipate the following: At CCM, the underlying reroofing trends that have provided a solid foundation for growth over the past decade, picked up in the second half of 2021 after a pause in 2020. Through the pandemic, we continue to invest in CCM in order to ensure we would be ready when demand returned. In addition, our expansion further into the building envelope; the increasing importance of energy-efficient products; contributions from Henry; and our proactive pricing actions have positioned CCM well for continued growth over the coming quarters. Considering this momentum, we are increasing our anticipated revenue growth to mid-20% in 2021. At CIT, we are encouraged by the recovery in narrow-body commercial aircraft. While this first step to recovery is encouraging, demand for wide-body aircraft driven by international travel remains muted in 2021. We anticipate this demand will return to previous levels as COVID concerns subside and countries relax their travel restrictions. In addition, CIT's medical business has built a record backlog. Taken together and coupled with significant restructuring at CIT over the past 18 months, CIT is now positioned to take advantage of the ongoing recovery. We continue to expect sequential improvements and now expect CIT revenue will only decline in the mid-single-digit range in full year 2021. At CFT, with end market strengthening due to increasing industrial capital expenditures and improvements in the team's execution of our key strategies, including new product introductions accelerating, growth in our new platforms and price discipline, we continue to expect mid-teens revenue growth in 2021. And finally, for Carlisle as a whole, we are now increasing our expectations to deliver high-teens revenue growth in 2021. As we progress through the final quarter of 2021, we are tracking to deliver a record year despite one of the most challenging time periods in our history. We remain committed to our Vision 2025 goals of $8 billion in revenues, 20% operating income and 15% ROIC, all driving to exceed $15 of earnings per share by 2025. Despite the continued uncertainties around COVID, stressed supply chains, raw material shortages, labor inflation and winter weather, Carlisle's resilient employees have adhered to our COVID protocols, shown respect for each other in the workplace, focused on safety, most importantly, remained focused on delivering results for all our Carlisle stakeholders. With that, we'll conclude our formal comments. Bethany, we're now ready for questions. Bryan, let me first start and Bob can jump in. I think the demand has just continued. We see more traction as we progress into Q3 and as we enter Q4. And we've seen backlogs increase, and we've seen orders push out. I think we're now into the second quarter of 2022, something that in the past -- that length of ordering or at least that time period of delivery has not really been seen before in a large scale. So, yes, the demand continues. I think, fourth quarter will be an abnormal fourth quarter in the sense that, yes, we have been seasonally affected in the fourth quarter usually. But, I think with the backlog, it will be as much as we can get shipped, and as much really importantly, as roofers can put down. I mean, obviously, they have work that needs to get done. And we're going to be constrained or they're going to be constrained by two things, I think, labor availability and then weather. So, stay tuned, but I think should we have a good fall and good early winter, and by that, I mean open days on the roof, I think things will continue in a positive direction. And then, on the double booking in that, I think our team has done something very interesting, which is they've put in some -- and I'm not going to go into details, but they've put in some mechanisms that have really taken out that double booking in our bookings. And even with doing that, things remain strong and lead times continue to extend. Bob, do you want to add anything? No, I don't really think so. I think, people understand that it's in a very inflationary time. I think the key thing now is can you get product, I think it gets passed on early in the year. I would say there was more pushback in the first quarter where the demand hadn't picked up yet. But as things have accelerated, I think people are focused on getting jobs done. I think also, I'll give a tip of hat to the guys at Greco today and David Low, who made a nice comment that people do a fair job of recapturing the costs, right? But, we still have to make sense to what the end user customer is doing at the decision point of sale. And I think our CCM team has done a really good job of that of balancing that idea that it's not like we made big gains in price over raws. We're saying we're neutral. So, we're attempting to secure raw materials so they can complete their jobs and not trying to take advantage of the situation. So again, they've been making decisions to come to Carlisle consistently, and we haven't seen any degradation in jobs or movement of jobs due to price. Yes. I would say that, first of all, our confidence in this is we've gotten -- we had a lot of confidence going as we did our due diligence and looked at what the Henry team has done over at least the last six years. And we talked about that on the call after we purchased them and Bob's talked about it and Jim, I know has too. We've gotten to know the team better. I can tell you that. And we are very impressed with Frank Ready and the team that he's assembled. They've stayed on post acquisition. They're doing a great job. They continue to operate. There hasn't been any delay. We've had a really good job by our corporate integration team supporting the CCM and Henry folks, and things have gone really smooth. So, tip of the hat to both teams and how quickly they've come together and really focused on growth in that. In terms of the pricing in that, I would say that Henry is a premium brand. It's well-recognized by their end users. It's demanded by their end users. And I think they've had the same success as CCM has had and going to their channel partners and saying, we're seeing escalated raw material costs. We're seeing availability struggles that we need to pay more to get that product, but we can get it to you and they're fulfilling but they're having to fill at higher cost. And I think, the channel partners and end users have understood that, and we've just seen good execution there. So, I think, in general, a great team, continued execution on what they were doing anyway and really good integration is just increasing our optimism for 2022. And maybe I'll take the first one on the carryover and Bob can handle the previous one. The pricing actions, again, we talked about being neutral. We do think those pricing actions will carry through as long as demand holds up, which it is. And I think we will see if there is any continued increase in either labor or freight or raw materials or any of that, we will obviously take actions to offset that. But, I don't see any issue with that carrying through, and I think it will probably carry through at least to the first half of 2022. So, that's pretty much just what we've been doing and been pretty consistent through the year on price and why we're driving price. And I think it's been clearly communicated to the channel as well and to -- and everyone understands. And Bob, you might want to address that comment of Saree's. No. In fact, Saree, what's really happened recently has been that a lot of these orders are being priced at the time of shipment. So, we'll see that those orders are really -- they're placed, but they're not being given pricing that we're going to have to recognize later. If there is escalation, we'll price to that escalation. Yes. It's interesting, Garik, if it was a normal quarter, we probably would have been able to quantify. We would have said something like two or three days off the roof, but we didn't, I think with everything else going on and all the puts and takes. It obviously impacted demand, if there's a hurricane coming through the central part of the United States, obviously, we're not going to have people on roofs. They're going to be taking care to be safe and other things like that. I would say, though, it probably impacted a supply chain that was already under stress, even more than it did demand. And so, yes, the demand gets pushed out. As we said, if you're going to reroof for roof or if you're going to do a job, you're going to have to do it. And if you can't get it done that day, you got to do it in the future. And then, on the supply chain, I think it's just -- as I said, it aggravated the situation more, probably put a little bit greater upward pressure on either supply availability or pricing or maybe both. Right. Well, I think from the base premises, if we look back at 2020, when we look at the costs that we had on unit cost across MDI, TPO, polyiso, EPDM, those things, those were -- those are supplied at a certain level with certain capacity there. And really, the only thing that happened was we had COVID hit and people had more restricted work days. They shut things down, things like that. And prices escalated. When we look at the pricing escalation, most of it was done between the latter of Q2, I would say, probably June and then into Q3 and accelerated a bit into Q4. As they had to hire, you can see the rising cost of labor, you have to start up factories, you have increased shipping costs. I think we saw that this doesn't affect us necessarily directly, but freight from containers from China had gone from, let's say, 4,000, 5,000 to 25,000 on the spot market, I think. So, you see this happening. And I think our thought is that these things will get worked out. We know in the Port of Long Beach, I think they've gone to 7-day a week, 24-hour a day work. They're going to see some reduction in the backlog there over time. It will take time to do it. And we think that plays out in the rest of the economy. And by the time we get to Q1, those same trends that were there in 2019 and the capacity and everything else comes back. And really, we haven't seen the growth that would tell you that we've exceeded some of those capacities. And so, I think we go back to kind of \u201819, and we see some stabilization and reduction in at least in the lack of availability and hopefully some pricing as well. Yes. I wouldn't read too much in the market share in the June through current date time frame. I think, we don't have a lot of really concrete data that we've gained share. I think what we've seen anecdotally is that we've had more people that previously were with competitors come and ask us for products. That would tell me that we're maybe in a little bit of a better position than others, but I can't back that up with anything on numbers. So, I looked back to the way it was, like I said, in \u201819 before COIVD hit. And I don't think where the competitors are there that the markets have changed that much. So, they're going forward will see significant changes in market share. So, I think it's really been demand has accelerated because last year went down and projects were delayed and projects were pushed aside and projects were postponed. And then, we came back, as we said in the first quarter, we thought things were going to be strong this year, we built inventory, we raised prices because we anticipated as the vaccines took hold and as reopenings occurred that demand would pick up. And as we've always said, with 70% of our business being in reroofing that these things have to get done and it would have to pick up some time. And so, I think a lot of this demand is spread evenly across all of our competitors and ourselves, and it's just a response to the 2020 downturn. And that great mid-single-digit underlying trend that was there post 2010 just continues. Yes. I would say, yes -- yes, definitely. I'm not going to point out which ones. But yes, there have been some instances. And that's why we pointed to our sourcing team. They've done a heck of good job scouring the globe, trying to find stuff to make sure we can meet our customer demand. Yes. I think that's the first, I think that absolutely. I would think it would be disingenuous to say we're going to have a normal build. I think, as we talk about getting everything we can out to keep people working and to keep these job sites and living up to our Carlisle experience, right? We make a big commitment with that and people expect it. As long as that demand holds, like I said, and the weather is good in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, we're going to be shipping things out to put on roofs and support our contractors. Now, if there are days where we have a long weather periods of snow or that we'll use that opportunity to build inventory, we're not going to slow down. But, I think there will be some opportunity just because of the way the winter is in most of the United States. But, I also think if there's any opportunity for people to catch up, they're going to do it. So, I think we'll have more information as we get kind of further into the quarter, see how things go. But, I think it's going to be tough to build any real meaningful inventory in Q4 and Q1, like we usually do. Yes, go ahead. Yes. Well, I think you're right to cite that. It is true. I mean, we actually are constrained. We're happy to most times be able to deliver everything our customers can apply to a roof, but we're constrained by their ability to put it down. So, that's a real issue. I don't know how much we can do to alleviate that. But what we can do and what our team is doing is making products to take labor off the roof. And Bob just mentioned the new 16-foot TPO sheets that are going to be made in Carlisle PA. And we had a chance to see the progress on that line earlier this year. And it's really remarkable, what an enduring feed it is. But more remarkable is the fact that that's going to get a roof put down faster and allow our contractors to get off the roof quicker. We also have work we've done with CAV-GRIP, one of our adhesives and other things. We just keep trying to make the installation as quick as possible, obviously, still holding all the quality and technical specification we need, making sure all the product is there. This is a big one. If you think about that idea that we say getting the product at the right place at the right time, right, in the right quantity and all that, we pride ourselves on that. And it makes a huge difference because as we know, unless you have all the products there, you're going to have labor standing around and that doesn't benefit anybody. And then even on cleanup. We've talked about our -- I'll cite a product called APEEL that we've talked about for a couple of years. I thought it was an extraordinary product. It's a thin sheet that goes on that as opposed to having to wash the roof after an installation and clean it and bringing power washers up and that stuff. You simply peel this membrane off and you're on your way. So, I think the CCM team is doing a heck of a job focusing their new product efforts on doing two things. One is really that whole ESG thing and making sure that we're making our buildings more energy efficient and people are able to use our products to do that. And then the other one is just to deal with this labor component and take labor out of the process. No. I think building codes are definitely moving. We've had some incidents that have been positive this year and others that we know about that have been negative for everything from concrete to cladding and things like this globally that I know our building code people and our engineers and architects spend a lot of time trying to make these buildings safe as energy efficient as they can because there's great returns, and they want their buildings to be the best buildings that are out there. And look, in our business, one of the biggest ones that happened was a few years ago when we started CCM going out and talking about the idea of having two layers of polyiso and it was increasing the value for a very reasonable price. And we used to have a calculator on iPad that would take the local rebates and things into that and allow building owners to see what adding another layer of insulation would do. What we found was that soon that became codified. And over the last few years, I think some of the big driver in our increased polyiso sales has been around the codification of that trend to double insulation and build it into the building code because increasing that, our value just had a great return for everyone. So, we will see that with some of the Henry products. We mentioned Blueskin. Once people start to see that a new product can help with the energy efficiency of a building, it gets through the architects. We do a lot of training, train our contractors on it. And then we can drive that through. And I think that type of product once people get to use it and see the results, then it can move into that code stage. But, to have the codes modified and improved is a pretty elaborate process and they have to make sure they're doing the right thing and testing everything. So, it happens. It just happens over time. But yes, we're seeing that. All right. Well, thanks, Bethany. This concludes our third quarter 2021 earnings call. We want to thank everybody for their participation, and we look forward to speaking with you again at our next earnings call. Thanks very much."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Giannakouros, Carlisle's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jim, Please go ahead.\nJim Giannakouros: Thank you, Zen. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Carlisle's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We released our second quarter financial results after the market close today and you can find both our press release and earnings call slide presentation in the Investor Relations section of our website carlisle.com. On the call with me today are Chris Koch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Roche, our CFO. Today's call will begin with Chris discussing business trends experienced during the second quarter of 2021, views of what's to come and context around our continued progress toward an unwavering commitment to achieving Vision 2025. Bob will discuss the financial details of Carlisle's second quarter performance and current financial position. Following Chris and Bob's remarks, we will open up the line for questions.\nChris Koch: Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon everyone. And thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2021 earnings call. While we recognize that there are still many people suffering from the continued effects of the pandemic globally, and in an even recover, we hope all of you your families, co-workers and friends are healthy and you're reengaging as global economies open. I'm also pleased to report Carlisle\u2019s COVID-19 infection rates approach zero in the second quarter, which wouldn't have happened without our team strict adherence to our safety protocols, and commitment each other across our global footprint. I'm also very pleased that Carlisle\u2019s performance continues to strengthen as we further accelerate into the economic recovery/ Please turn to Slide 3. Vision 2025 has provided the clarity and consistency of direction that proved to be essential in guiding our efforts during the depths of the pandemic last year. It continues to guide us today as we seek to leverage a proven demand across our end markets in 2021 and beyond. Vision 2025 provides Carlisle and our stakeholders a clear and direct vision that unites us in a collective goal, which in turn drives our priorities in everyday actions. We are very much on track to exceed the $15 of earnings per share targeted in Vision 2025. Our performance in the second quarter of 2021 illustrates our continued solid execution towards our stated goals. Several highlights of this continued progress include CCMs, continue to rebound and sales from the bottom of the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020. As a reminder, CCM sales were down approximately 20% in the second quarter of last year. As we entered the third quarter of last year, we had already begun to see improvement sooner than many industries and that has continued sequentially through today. That positive momentum drove 28% organic growth year-over-year at CCM in the second quarter of this year and added to a significant in growing backlog.\nBob Roche: Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned earlier, we had a very solid second quarter. I'm especially pleased about the margin expansion of CCM, CIT coming-off market lows and position to deliver sequential growth in the next few quarters. CFTs order book improving our disciplined approach to capital deployment in the form of share repurchases and dividends continued investment in our high ROIC businesses to drive organic growth. And our portfolio optimization actions including the vesting CBF and the announced agreement to acquire Henry Company. Please turn the revenue bridge on Slide 8 of the presentation. Revenue was up 22% in the second quarter driven by CCM and CFT offset by the well documented commercial aerospace declines at CIT. Organic revenue was up 20.7%. CCM and CFT each delivered greater than 25% organic growth in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 0.4% of sales growth for the quarter and FX was a 90 basis point tailwind. On Slide 9, we have provided and adjusted EPS where you can see second quarter adjusted EPS was $2.16 which compares with $1.95 last year. Volume price and mix combined were $1.30 year-over-year increase. Raw material, freight and labor costs were $0.95 headwind. Interest in tax together were a $0.01 headwind. Share repurchases contributed $0.07 and COS contributed additional $0.12. Higher OpEx was a $0.32 headwind year-over-year half of which is related to the May vesting and cash settlement of stock appreciation rights granted to all Carlisle employees outside of the U.S. in 2018, with the remainder reflecting the resumption of more normalized expense level versus last year's cost containment measures taken in the depths of the pandemic. Now let's turn to Slide 10 on the second quarter performance by segment in more detail. At CCM, the team again delivered outstanding results with revenues increasing 27.5% driven by volume and price along with 70 basis points of foreign currency translation tailwind. All of CCMs product lines deliver 20% growth with particular strength and architectural models and spray foam insulation. CCM effectively managed raw material inflation headwinds experienced in the quarter with discipline pricing for active sourcing and allocating products to strategic customers. Adjusted EBITDA margin at CCM was 21.5% in the second quarter, a 60 basis point decline from last year driven by higher raw material prices partially offset by volumes price and COS savings. Despite raw materials being a headwind in second quarter, we continue to anticipate, net neutral price raw\u2019s for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 24% to $201.2 million again demonstrating the earnings power of our CCM business. Please turn to Slide 11, CIT results. CIT revenue declined 8.2% in the second quarter. As has been well publicized, this decline was driven by the pandemics continued impact on commercial aerospace markets. We still anticipate a prolonged recovery in aerospace but are optimistic there will be resumption and growth as we enter the second half of the year. CIT\u2019s medical platform continues to build a robust pipeline of projects with an increasing backlog. We continue to expect sequential improvement from pent-up demand as the impacts of COVID on hospital CapEx and postponed elective surgeries ease. CIT\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margins decline year-over-year to 8%, driven by commercial aerospace volumes, partially offset by price COS and lower expenses. Given the positive indicators, we are optimistic that CIT will deliver sequentially improving financial performance into the second half of 2021. Turning now to Slide 12. CFT sales grew 54% year-over-year, organic revenue improved 44.3% and acquisitions added 3.6% in the quarter, FX contributed 6%. CFT is well positioned accelerate through the recovery due to continued stabilization in key end markets driven by an improved industrial capital spending outlook in 2021 coupled with new product introductions, would have included $4.1 million of incremental new product sales in 2021 year-to-date, along with our continued pricing result. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 15.9% or over 100 basis point improvement from last year. This improvement primarily affects volume pricing and mix. On Slide 13 and 14, we show selected balance sheet metrics. our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with $713 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner, investing in organic growth through capital expenditures and opportunistically purchasing shares, while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. In the quarter, we repurchased 643,000 shares for $116 million bringing our 2021 year-to-date total to 1.6 million shares for $266 million. We paid $28 million of dividends in the second quarter bringing our \u201821 total to $56 million. We invested $32 million of CapEx into our high returning businesses to drive organic growth bringing our 2021 total to $55 million. A few examples of these investments include our new Missouri polyiso facility, expansion of our TPO line in Carlisle PA and investment in our spray foam capabilities in Cartersville, Georgia. In addition, and as has been noted, we announced an agreement to purchase Henry Company for $1.575 billion. Henry generated revenue a $511 million and adjusted EBITDA $119 million representing a 23% EBITDA. Additionally, Henry expected to deliver $100 million of free cash flow in our first year of ownership. We also expect meaningful cost synergies of $30 million by 2025. Finally, we expect Henry to be immediately accretive to Carlisle\u2019s EBITDA margin adding over $1.25 of adjusted EPS in 2022. Free cash flow for the quarter was $64.6 million a 54% decline year-over-year due to increased working capital usage related to our high sales growth of 22%. Turning to Slide 15, you can see the outlook for 2021 and corporate items. Corporate expenses now expected to be approximately $125 million up from the previous estimate of 120. The increase is wholly related to the vesting in cash settlement of our stock appreciation rights discussed earlier. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $210 million. We still expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 120%. For the full year, we continue to invest in our business and expect capital expenditures approximately $150 million. Net interest expense is still expected to be approximately $75 million for the year. And we still expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. Finally, restructuring is expected in 2021 to be approximately $20 million. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris.\nChris Koch: Thanks Bob. Entering the third quarter we continue to be very optimistic about the remainder of 2021 from record backlogs at CCM to supportive trends and CIT aerospace markets to growing strength at CFT coupled with excellent sourcing and price discipline and significant traction on our ESG journey. We're confident in our ability to deliver solid results for all Carlisle stakeholders. For full year 2021, we anticipate the following. At CCM as previously mentioned the trends that began in Q3, 2020 gained momentum as we moved into 2021. We anticipate this momentum to carry over in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. Considering this momentum coupled with record backlogs stemming from project deferrals that occurred in 2020 positive momentum in our newer businesses of architectural metals and spray foam and expansion of our European business, we are increasing our anticipated revenue growth to high teens in 2021. At CIT, we are encouraged by leading indicators trending positive, but it remains difficult to gauge when a complete recovery and commercial aerospace will occur. Given a very difficult year-over-year comparison in the first and second quarters, we continue to expect CIT revenue will decline in the mid-to-high single-digit range in full year 2021. At CFT, with end market strengthening and improvements in the team's execution of our key strategies. We now expect mid-teens revenue growth in 2021. And finally for Carlisle as a whole, we are now increasing our expectations to mid-teens revenue growth in 2021. As we pass the midpoint of 2021, we are tracking to deliver our Vision 2025 goals of $8 billion in revenues, 20% operating income and 15% ROIC all driving to exceed $15 of earnings per share by 2025. Despite lingering uncertainties around COVID supply chain constraints and what we perceive as near-term raw material inflation. Carlisle's employees across the globe remained focused on the execution of the strategies and key actions that support Vision 2025. Our team continues to embody a positive and entrepreneurial spirit, a commitment to continuous improvement and a focus on delivering results for the Carlisle shareholder. Given our 100-year plus history and the resilience this company has shown in times of adversity and uncertainty, we remain confident in Carlisle's outlook, our strong financial foundation, cash generating capabilities, unwavering commitment to our Vision 2025 Strategic Plan, and to providing products and services essential to the world's needs. This concludes our formal comments. Then we're now ready for questions.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Blair of Oppenheimer.\nBryan Blair: Thanks good afternoon guys.\nChris Koch: Yes, good afternoon Bryan.\nBob Roche: Bryan.\nBryan Blair: Great performance in CCM, we actually were flirting with normal seasonality sequential seasonality, which I didn't think was possible?\nChris Koch: Yes.\nBryan Blair: Given the supply chain constraints that the EU called out and that are so pervasive, to what extent did raw material availability freights, no other constraints, impact CCMs ability to meet demand in the quarter?\nChris Koch: Well, as we discussed, the team did a great job managing it, I don't think it really impacted their ability to beat the demand that was present in the quarter. Obviously, the surge in orders, takes into account some orders that are for the third quarter and fourth quarter, and we continue to work to fulfill all those but the team did a great job in meeting all the demand that was put to it in the second quarter.\nBryan Blair: Understood. And thinking about the third quarter, are there any incremental watch items in terms of the listed constraints that we think about in terms of CCMs ability to meet demands and an extension of that? What kind of growth rate are you assuming as we bridge to the pipe teens guide?\nChris Koch: Yes, Bryan , we don't see -- I mean again, there's a lot going on in the world with Delta variant and everything else. But we don't see a lot of changes from what happened in the second quarter going into the third, we would expect raw materials to -- I'm going to say loosen up a little they've been loosening up since the beginning of the year more and more since the problems in Texas and the freeze and everything. So we can -- we see that continuing slightly. So we don't see a lot of watchout items on our list and we'll be going in today. We'd expect I'm going to say normal growth, you expect third quarter to be somewhat higher than the second quarter. So I think the growth rate will continue going into the third with normal -- like you said, normal seasonality where third quarter is larger than the second. And then shrinking a bit in the fourth as always happens into the winter months.\nBob Roche: Yes. And Bryan, I would just add one thing that I think we -- the results were encouraging. And it's interesting to talk about normal seasonality. But we really are still in the midst of an extraordinary time just as impactful as going down was last year into the declines we had I think coming back has been something that is not normal. And I think the CCM team has done a superb job of managing through all of that, like you said, and getting close to normal seasonality, but we still want to communicate the fact that it's a very difficult environment, throughout the business from supply chain all the way to order entry as we discussed.\nBryan Blair: Completely understood. One last one for me. In the revised high teens sales growth guide for CCM. How should we think about volume first price contribution for the year?\nChris Koch: Yes, Bryan, that's mostly going to be price, but there is some volume increase in there as well.\nBryan Blair: Okay, so the step up from low double-digits to high-teens is mostly price?\nChris Koch: Yes mostly price as raw\u2019s continued to increase we -- as discussed needed to continue to increase price to keep up with that. Got it.\nBryan Blair: Okay, thanks again.\nChris Koch: Thanks, Bryan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs of Baird Equity Research.\nTim Wojs: Good afternoon.\nChris Koch: Good afternoon, Tim.\nBob Roche: Hey Tim.\nTim Wojs: Nice work. I guess, first question, could you just talk a little bit about how you're managing the backlog just there's chatter that like people are double ordering and trying to get products from anybody they can. So how are you kind of controlling that just to make sure that you actually have real backlog?\nChris Koch: Well, certainly we can't -- we don't know, because we don't have a customer's mind as to what's a real order, what's not a real order, we treat all orders the same and then what we're really doing is just prioritizing them based on the necessity of shipping. And in addition to that, obviously, customer, existing customer that's been a longtime customer for Carlisle is going to be prioritized over someone that's being opportunistic. So I think, again, we're doing a very rational way. we're attempting to maintain that Carlisle experience and ensuring that the contractors in needed have that product there and making sure that we're not having any inventory or products sit around somewhere on a job site or in a warehouse but that people that need the product put on the roof or getting it done and I think the team's doing good job of that, but obviously that involves a lot of work that involves a lot of heavy lifting on the part of the sales force on the part of customer service to coordinate a lot of work there. So I think as we -- to your point on the extra ordering as we get through the year, we don't see it impacting the projections that we've made, that will sort itself out, as we begin to -- continue to fulfill these orders. And then I'd say just we'll check in as we get closer to the winter, and we'll know where we are. So as I mentioned, to Bryan, it's such a evolving environment and this recovery has been so rapid and the demand has been -- in a lot of industries so strong that like to just focus on the near-term and make sure again that we're delivering on that Carlisle experience for the contractor that needs it today.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay, good. And then I think you guys are definitely taking share, where would you kind of peg the market at relative to your high-teen sales growth? And I guess, what's your confidence that once some of these supply chain issues settle down that you can hang on to some of that share gain longer term?\nChris Koch: Well, I'll take the last one first. I think we view these last year and this year, these disturbances these really trying times as opportunities and probably the best opportunity for contractors, distributors, end users architects to see the really true Carlisle experience and the work that our team does. I mean, when everything's going smoothly, understand that how powerful that experience is. And so what I would hope is that as we are introduced to new customers, as people that are with other suppliers decide to try Carlisle, that they are overwhelmed by the experience and decide to make that permanent shift. Is that always occur I can't tell you what level of people, or what percentage of the people that get material from us for the first time stay with us. But my guess is that it's contributed to our growth over the last few years and will contribute -- and we'll continue to do that. So that's our goal, continue to perform well continue to perform better than anyone else and make sure that people see that and want to be part of that team. I think the other -- on the other side, the growth side, Bob may have some comments on that. But I think that the industry right now and the recovery probably market shares have not moved much relative overall demand, just because demand has been so heavy. So again, what I would look for is to run through the year. Let's sort out those orders you talked about that there may be some over ordering and then get into 2022. Hopefully, we'll have a more normal year. And then we'll be able to assess our progress versus the industry and versus our competitors. Bob, do you want to add anything?\nTim Wojs: Okay, good. Well I hop back in queue. Thanks, guys.\nChris Koch: Yes, thanks Tim.\nBob Roche: Thanks Tim.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from Bank of Montreal.\nJoel Tiss: Hey, guys, how's it going?\nChris Koch: Hey Joel.\nJoel Tiss:  All right. So I'm going to switch gears a little bit. I wonder it's kind of an off the wall question. But you think it wouldn't make any sense for you guys to think about like spinning out everything that's not CCM that would kind of accelerate your move to 2025 maybe not on the revenue side, but certainly on the margin side?\nBob Roche: Well, I don't think it would make any sense right now. And no reason I say that is I think that certainly valuations would be very hard to find evaluation from a purely pragmatic perspective on any business given, CCMs declines and given the fact that CFT is not probably reached its full potential after the years of work we put into it, but there's still more to come. So, what I would -- yes, I would just say that's probably not a thought of how in our mind, I mean, we want to continue to boost the building products portion of our business around CCM, adding Henry does that that gives us a lot to digest and to focus on. I think we wait till things get through the sustainable growth recovery that -- and runway that we see and CIT and CFT. And then Joel as we've always done, we just assess the portfolio and I think that's something that's gone back long as I've been at Carlisle everything from divesting of Carlisle tire and wheel motion control food service and making additions like Accella, Petersen and that we're always looking at the portfolio and obviously we make all our decisions based on what's best for the Carlisle shareholder. So it's something we always look at, but I don't see any actions in the near-term.\nJoel Tiss: And then as you build-out your you're building envelope and it's starting to get pretty serious. Is there any way or to team up with like a carrier or train or someone who is doing sort of building assessments to help the buildings get more efficient and lower their costs and all that? Is there any way to team up with those guys to get like spec-ed into being part of that energy audit and helping them get to their goals?\nChris Koch: Sure. And I think -- I don't know about those two companies in particular, but I do know that every day our teams in CCM through their connections with the industry organizations through their connections to architects through large building owners people who are putting in warehousing, data centers, things like that, you can't help but think that as ESG, as energy efficiency becomes a bigger priority for all those end users and building owners that they're going to almost drive cooperation. So that we're getting -- we're making sure that as we're putting on that building envelope and ensuring that it's a -- it's got great insulation, vapor, water, air barriers, things like that, that they're also asking, the provider of that energy, and if it's either heating and cooling, to participate and have some coordination, I think a lot of that occurs at the design level with architects and specifiers. And, as we mentioned, both with Carlisle and with our Henry team, they're going to spend a lot of time with those organizations. So I think you're on the right track. I just -- I can't comment on carrier train, because I just don't know, but I would imagine those conversations are being had.\nJoel Tiss: Well, that's great. Thank you very much.\nBob Roche: Thank you Joel.\nChris Koch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky of Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Hi, good afternoon.\nChris Koch: Good afternoon.\nSaree Boroditsky: Within CIT, could you talk about what you saw in the quarter from medical versus aerospace? And then how do those growth rates are expected to look for the remainder of the year? And then any color as we start to think about 2022?\nChris Koch: Yes, I think the last one first Saree. I mean, I don't think we're ready to talk about 2022 yet now, certainly, we expect growth at CIT and continued ramp in our profitability. But we're a long way from what's going to happen with aerospace getting into 2022 at this point in time. Medical versus aerospace in the quarter, were almost the same decline. And that's largely due to the massive orders or I\u2019m going to say, revenue we saw last second quarter remember, we talked about a big spike in orders, when COVID hit in shipments in the quarter so -- in medical. So that's why it was relatively flat, but we expect acceleration, faster acceleration in medical going to the end of the year than we do in aerospace, but we expect some growth in aerospace.\nSaree Boroditsky: Got it. And then you raised the outlook for CFT could you talk about the outlook for industrial CapEx and projects. What are you hearing from customers? And then again, I'll just ask, should this strength continue as you think about going into next year?\nChris Koch: We -- I think we see the industrial space continuing to improve out of the depths of 2020 and improvement in production. And, that I think the other thing that I would remind you, as you know, CFT, we did have some difficulties when we first bought that business, and then we're sharing losses. And I think part of the gains are getting back what is what I would call their rightful share through their innovation, and new products and really good work by the teams and communicating the value proposition. So I think it's a combination of that, that markets are improving industrial markets are improving. We think they'll continue to improve globally as we go throughout the year. And then I think there's a piece of that too. That is just CFT getting its stride back and becoming a solid Carlisle Company, Bob you want to add anything?\nBob Roche: No, that was clear Chris.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks for taking my questions. I'll pass it on.\nChris Koch: Thanks, Saree.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kevin Hocevar of Northcoast Research.\nKevin Hocevar: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. nice job there. Chris, I'm trying to wrap my head around one of the comments you made I think in your prepared remarks, I think you'd mentioned in the CCM business, you'd receive 65,000 orders in the quarter, which is double the usual amounts. I guess I'm just trying to understand what that means I mean is that again a sign that there's some double ordering going on is that maybe distributors trying to build some inventory even maybe contractors get some product on the job site even if they don't need it yet just because things are so tight. Is it backlogs building in a pretty material way I guess and does that mean there'll be less orders in the third and fourth quarter? Is it some panic buying? I guess I'm just trying to understand because that seemed like a pretty interesting stat that got my head around. I am curious if you could just elaborate on that a little bit?\nChris Koch: Yes, well, I think one of the things that we probably will need to do later is give the reference point in 2019. Because without that reference point, double the previous period you don't have a good reference for where we were in 2019 to gauge that. I think the other thing is on the double ordering. I'd be careful about that because as we know last year people were not ordering, we talked at length about how distribution going into the season had cut back on orders, people were concerned about where they'd be on the job. I mean, it was only a year ago, that States like Pennsylvania and cities like Boston weren't allowing contractors on the job site. In certain cases, they were increasing the PPE and the other protocols making more difficult. We were having inspections occurring virtually, it was hard to get permits pull, because governmental agencies were shut down. So when -- and we think that now we're in the second quarter, but you have to remember that was some of that stuff there was still concerned in the first quarter, that things were happening. And we did get ahead of it in production, as we mentioned, we got to have in our pricing, but there's still some lag there on the market until the confidence came back to the contractor and the -- distributors that would be able to function somewhat normally. So I think there is a surge there. And I think a lot of those orders, I have no reason to believe that most of them actually occur the quarter aren't real. Because I do think there's pent-up demand, people were waiting. And that's what we talked about as demand and continue to build. And if you think about even not including 25% of the orders in a year and letting them build in the back half of 2020 and then the first quarter of 2021, one would expect a pretty substantial surge in the second quarter of this year, and then we'll just need to monitor and we get to this third quarter of this year, it'll be -- we can do that same check and then have a comparison because we'll have been through the heavy and last part of the season getting into the winter months. So don't read too much into it other than demand is strong. And we are coming out of this pandemic strong and people are gaining confidence. And they're placing orders and they're getting back on the roof. And they got a lot of backlog to make up.\nBob Roche: Yes.\nKevin Hocevar: Yes, okay. That's helpful. And in terms of the increased guidance, just one quick question there that so the low double-digit, the high-teens increased in CCM. And it sounds like the majority of that is pricing, is that pricing increase based on what you've currently kind of realized between price increases that have already taken effect or I know, there's also like an August increase you have out there for a lot of roofing products. Is there some assumptions of future pricing as well baked into that guidance?\nBob Roche: No, that includes obviously the announced price for August, but no, nothing beyond that at this point.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay, got you. And then just last question, what was -- in terms of the price cost dynamics? What was that in the second quarter? And it sounds like the expectation is a continuation of neutral for the year, so is there any change in the expectations of three -- I mean, obviously, there's been a lot of moving pieces since three months ago, in terms of the inflation expectations and the pricing expectations. So but maybe it is the kind of the trajectory sounds like might not be the expectation of the net of that might not be all that different. But yes, curious, what was in the quarter and then kind of the -- how you see that playing out the balance of the year?\nChris Koch: Yes, certainly the net\u2019s, not different. But certainly with our increase in revenue based on price, we've gotten a lot more cost pressure and assumed a lot more price traction over the last three months, as costs have continued to rise and be up there we are a lot more confident that we need the price to cover it. Q2 was about $25 million negative as we expected and we expect to make that up in the second half of the year more in the fourth quarter, in the third quarter, but positive in both those quarters to make up for what we were short this quarter.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay, our Thank you very much.\nChris Koch: Thanks Kevin.\nBob Roche: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: Thanks for taking my question. Chris, just curious you made a comment in your prepared remarks around allocating products to strategic customers or just wanting to get a spin on that is it really more of a function that because you're effectively at full capacity, you can be selective and service or I guess higher margin higher quality customers or any kind of additional color that or comment would be helpful?\nChris Koch: Yes, I think that our customers, we have some lot of very loyal customers that work very hard to make sure Carlisle is specified and chosen throughout the world actually and we don't want to make decisions in a quarter and we want to have share gains, but we want to make sure that the work we're doing with people, because it is pretty extensive, we spent a lot of time working with our contractors on things like warranty inspections and on helping prepare quotes in that that we always want to strategically give our efforts to those distributors, contracts and those that are with us and for the long run and have invested significantly in the Carlisle brand. So I don't think it's anything. While we stated I don't think it's anything other than our normal practice there that, we expect a lot out of our partners and they would expect a lot out of us in terms of loyalty as well.\nGarik Shmois: Okay, thanks. And just on the building envelope business, you called out spray foam, metal roofing growing over 40% in the corner sounds like that the entire building envelope business was up over 20% in the quarter. What's the outlook there? I guess what I'm asking, given that business has been more exposure to housing, is there any pause that you might be seeing at all just with the pause in new housing just given the escalation in the market and the builders pulling back a bit, any help on the building envelope side will be helpful?\nChris Koch: I think on the metal side, Peterson is a pretty much a commercial metal business. And I think there we're seeing a lot of movement into metal as it becomes architecturally more attractive as it has some renewable and recyclable aspects to it. We're just finding, it's gaining traction, there's some very positive trends there. And Peterson has done an excellent job of adopting the Carlisle experience, which they probably call it the Peterson experience before and, but it's a great brand with great coverage and good relationships and on the Drexel side, which is a little bit more on the residential side again, we're seeing people are choosing metal roofs in a lot of cases, there's more interest in Drexel has a very unique value proposition where they are actually preparing that work right on site and driving a lot of value. So is that team gets out and demonstrates a value proposition they're gaining a lot of traction. On the spray foam side, we originally bought a cell we talked about that high single-digit industry growth rate as people would adopt foam as a far superior insulator and some in certain cases, vapor barrier components to it. And what we're really seeing is that continued traction versus other forms of insulation and certainly here in the southwest with the heat and even in the north. I know being from Minnesota and live in the Arizona, spray foam insulation just provides a superior solution for the space in the wall cavity. And it just drives great performance and we see it just continuing to gain share in the marketplace. So I think the trends are positive for both. And then we on top of that we're adding very positive unique value propositions with this business. And I would be remiss if I didn't say that the partnership between CFT with their newly launched spray foam equipment which provides superior on ratio performance, it's got better heating capabilities in the competition. And much better performing product coupled with our spray foam coming out of CCM has also created a lot of interest with end users and is helping us drive a preference for our brand. So it's actually we're excited about all of those businesses and what they've done.\nGarik Shmois: Okay, and I guess just one follow up. In the guide you took your CCM guidance up largely on price was there any change to the underlying assumptions on the envelope side of the CCM?\nBob Roche: No Garik they are mostly in line and those are up in price as well.\nChris Koch: Right. Commodities as they go into metal roofing and in the spray foam are just as volatile as the flat roofing commodity. So we need to get price in those as well to keep up with our flat price cost.\nGarik Shmois: Okay, fair point. Thanks again.\nChris Koch: Yes. Thank you, Garik.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back Chris. Please go ahead.\nChris Koch: Thanks, Zen. And thanks, everybody. This concludes our second quarter 2020 earnings call -- 2021.excuse me. And thanks for your participation. We look forward to speaking with you at our next earnings call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bob Roche",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned earlier, we had a very solid second quarter. I'm especially pleased about the margin expansion of CCM, CIT coming-off market lows and position to deliver sequential growth in the next few quarters. CFTs order book improving our disciplined approach to capital deployment in the form of share repurchases and dividends continued investment in our high ROIC businesses to drive organic growth. And our portfolio optimization actions including the vesting CBF and the announced agreement to acquire Henry Company. Please turn the revenue bridge on Slide 8 of the presentation. Revenue was up 22% in the second quarter driven by CCM and CFT offset by the well documented commercial aerospace declines at CIT. Organic revenue was up 20.7%. CCM and CFT each delivered greater than 25% organic growth in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 0.4% of sales growth for the quarter and FX was a 90 basis point tailwind. On Slide 9, we have provided and adjusted EPS where you can see second quarter adjusted EPS was $2.16 which compares with $1.95 last year. Volume price and mix combined were $1.30 year-over-year increase. Raw material, freight and labor costs were $0.95 headwind. Interest in tax together were a $0.01 headwind. Share repurchases contributed $0.07 and COS contributed additional $0.12. Higher OpEx was a $0.32 headwind year-over-year half of which is related to the May vesting and cash settlement of stock appreciation rights granted to all Carlisle employees outside of the U.S. in 2018, with the remainder reflecting the resumption of more normalized expense level versus last year's cost containment measures taken in the depths of the pandemic. Now let's turn to Slide 10 on the second quarter performance by segment in more detail. At CCM, the team again delivered outstanding results with revenues increasing 27.5% driven by volume and price along with 70 basis points of foreign currency translation tailwind. All of CCMs product lines deliver 20% growth with particular strength and architectural models and spray foam insulation. CCM effectively managed raw material inflation headwinds experienced in the quarter with discipline pricing for active sourcing and allocating products to strategic customers. Adjusted EBITDA margin at CCM was 21.5% in the second quarter, a 60 basis point decline from last year driven by higher raw material prices partially offset by volumes price and COS savings. Despite raw materials being a headwind in second quarter, we continue to anticipate, net neutral price raw's for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 24% to $201.2 million again demonstrating the earnings power of our CCM business. Please turn to Slide 11, CIT results. CIT revenue declined 8.2% in the second quarter. As has been well publicized, this decline was driven by the pandemics continued impact on commercial aerospace markets. We still anticipate a prolonged recovery in aerospace but are optimistic there will be resumption and growth as we enter the second half of the year. CIT's medical platform continues to build a robust pipeline of projects with an increasing backlog. We continue to expect sequential improvement from pent-up demand as the impacts of COVID on hospital CapEx and postponed elective surgeries ease. CIT's adjusted EBITDA margins decline year-over-year to 8%, driven by commercial aerospace volumes, partially offset by price COS and lower expenses. Given the positive indicators, we are optimistic that CIT will deliver sequentially improving financial performance into the second half of 2021. Turning now to Slide 12. CFT sales grew 54% year-over-year, organic revenue improved 44.3% and acquisitions added 3.6% in the quarter, FX contributed 6%. CFT is well positioned accelerate through the recovery due to continued stabilization in key end markets driven by an improved industrial capital spending outlook in 2021 coupled with new product introductions, would have included $4.1 million of incremental new product sales in 2021 year-to-date, along with our continued pricing result. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 15.9% or over 100 basis point improvement from last year. This improvement primarily affects volume pricing and mix. On Slide 13 and 14, we show selected balance sheet metrics. our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with $713 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner, investing in organic growth through capital expenditures and opportunistically purchasing shares, while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. In the quarter, we repurchased 643,000 shares for $116 million bringing our 2021 year-to-date total to 1.6 million shares for $266 million. We paid $28 million of dividends in the second quarter bringing our \u201821 total to $56 million. We invested $32 million of CapEx into our high returning businesses to drive organic growth bringing our 2021 total to $55 million. A few examples of these investments include our new Missouri polyiso facility, expansion of our TPO line in Carlisle PA and investment in our spray foam capabilities in Cartersville, Georgia. In addition, and as has been noted, we announced an agreement to purchase Henry Company for $1.575 billion. Henry generated revenue a $511 million and adjusted EBITDA $119 million representing a 23% EBITDA. Additionally, Henry expected to deliver $100 million of free cash flow in our first year of ownership. We also expect meaningful cost synergies of $30 million by 2025. Finally, we expect Henry to be immediately accretive to Carlisle's EBITDA margin adding over $1.25 of adjusted EPS in 2022. Free cash flow for the quarter was $64.6 million a 54% decline year-over-year due to increased working capital usage related to our high sales growth of 22%. Turning to Slide 15, you can see the outlook for 2021 and corporate items. Corporate expenses now expected to be approximately $125 million up from the previous estimate of 120. The increase is wholly related to the vesting in cash settlement of our stock appreciation rights discussed earlier. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $210 million. We still expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 120%. For the full year, we continue to invest in our business and expect capital expenditures approximately $150 million. Net interest expense is still expected to be approximately $75 million for the year. And we still expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. Finally, restructuring is expected in 2021 to be approximately $20 million. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris. Bryan. Yes. And Bryan, I would just add one thing that I think we -- the results were encouraging. And it's interesting to talk about normal seasonality. But we really are still in the midst of an extraordinary time just as impactful as going down was last year into the declines we had I think coming back has been something that is not normal. And I think the CCM team has done a superb job of managing through all of that, like you said, and getting close to normal seasonality, but we still want to communicate the fact that it's a very difficult environment, throughout the business from supply chain all the way to order entry as we discussed. Hey Tim. Thanks Tim. Well, I don't think it would make any sense right now. And no reason I say that is I think that certainly valuations would be very hard to find evaluation from a purely pragmatic perspective on any business given, CCMs declines and given the fact that CFT is not probably reached its full potential after the years of work we put into it, but there's still more to come. So, what I would -- yes, I would just say that's probably not a thought of how in our mind, I mean, we want to continue to boost the building products portion of our business around CCM, adding Henry does that that gives us a lot to digest and to focus on. I think we wait till things get through the sustainable growth recovery that -- and runway that we see and CIT and CFT. And then Joel as we've always done, we just assess the portfolio and I think that's something that's gone back long as I've been at Carlisle everything from divesting of Carlisle tire and wheel motion control food service and making additions like Accella, Petersen and that we're always looking at the portfolio and obviously we make all our decisions based on what's best for the Carlisle shareholder. So it's something we always look at, but I don't see any actions in the near-term. Thank you Joel. No, that was clear Chris. Yes. No, that includes obviously the announced price for August, but no, nothing beyond that at this point. Thank you. No Garik they are mostly in line and those are up in price as well."

            "name": "Chris Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon everyone. And thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2021 earnings call. While we recognize that there are still many people suffering from the continued effects of the pandemic globally, and in an even recover, we hope all of you your families, co-workers and friends are healthy and you're reengaging as global economies open. I'm also pleased to report Carlisle's COVID-19 infection rates approach zero in the second quarter, which wouldn't have happened without our team strict adherence to our safety protocols, and commitment each other across our global footprint. I'm also very pleased that Carlisle's performance continues to strengthen as we further accelerate into the economic recovery/ Please turn to Slide 3. Vision 2025 has provided the clarity and consistency of direction that proved to be essential in guiding our efforts during the depths of the pandemic last year. It continues to guide us today as we seek to leverage a proven demand across our end markets in 2021 and beyond. Vision 2025 provides Carlisle and our stakeholders a clear and direct vision that unites us in a collective goal, which in turn drives our priorities in everyday actions. We are very much on track to exceed the $15 of earnings per share targeted in Vision 2025. Our performance in the second quarter of 2021 illustrates our continued solid execution towards our stated goals. Several highlights of this continued progress include CCMs, continue to rebound and sales from the bottom of the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020. As a reminder, CCM sales were down approximately 20% in the second quarter of last year. As we entered the third quarter of last year, we had already begun to see improvement sooner than many industries and that has continued sequentially through today. That positive momentum drove 28% organic growth year-over-year at CCM in the second quarter of this year and added to a significant in growing backlog. Thanks Bob. Entering the third quarter we continue to be very optimistic about the remainder of 2021 from record backlogs at CCM to supportive trends and CIT aerospace markets to growing strength at CFT coupled with excellent sourcing and price discipline and significant traction on our ESG journey. We're confident in our ability to deliver solid results for all Carlisle stakeholders. For full year 2021, we anticipate the following. At CCM as previously mentioned the trends that began in Q3, 2020 gained momentum as we moved into 2021. We anticipate this momentum to carry over in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. Considering this momentum coupled with record backlogs stemming from project deferrals that occurred in 2020 positive momentum in our newer businesses of architectural metals and spray foam and expansion of our European business, we are increasing our anticipated revenue growth to high teens in 2021. At CIT, we are encouraged by leading indicators trending positive, but it remains difficult to gauge when a complete recovery and commercial aerospace will occur. Given a very difficult year-over-year comparison in the first and second quarters, we continue to expect CIT revenue will decline in the mid-to-high single-digit range in full year 2021. At CFT, with end market strengthening and improvements in the team's execution of our key strategies. We now expect mid-teens revenue growth in 2021. And finally for Carlisle as a whole, we are now increasing our expectations to mid-teens revenue growth in 2021. As we pass the midpoint of 2021, we are tracking to deliver our Vision 2025 goals of $8 billion in revenues, 20% operating income and 15% ROIC all driving to exceed $15 of earnings per share by 2025. Despite lingering uncertainties around COVID supply chain constraints and what we perceive as near-term raw material inflation. Carlisle's employees across the globe remained focused on the execution of the strategies and key actions that support Vision 2025. Our team continues to embody a positive and entrepreneurial spirit, a commitment to continuous improvement and a focus on delivering results for the Carlisle shareholder. Given our 100-year plus history and the resilience this company has shown in times of adversity and uncertainty, we remain confident in Carlisle's outlook, our strong financial foundation, cash generating capabilities, unwavering commitment to our Vision 2025 Strategic Plan, and to providing products and services essential to the world's needs. This concludes our formal comments. Then we're now ready for questions. Yes, good afternoon Bryan. Yes. Well, as we discussed, the team did a great job managing it, I don't think it really impacted their ability to beat the demand that was present in the quarter. Obviously, the surge in orders, takes into account some orders that are for the third quarter and fourth quarter, and we continue to work to fulfill all those but the team did a great job in meeting all the demand that was put to it in the second quarter. Yes, Bryan , we don't see -- I mean again, there's a lot going on in the world with Delta variant and everything else. But we don't see a lot of changes from what happened in the second quarter going into the third, we would expect raw materials to -- I'm going to say loosen up a little they've been loosening up since the beginning of the year more and more since the problems in Texas and the freeze and everything. So we can -- we see that continuing slightly. So we don't see a lot of watchout items on our list and we'll be going in today. We'd expect I'm going to say normal growth, you expect third quarter to be somewhat higher than the second quarter. So I think the growth rate will continue going into the third with normal -- like you said, normal seasonality where third quarter is larger than the second. And then shrinking a bit in the fourth as always happens into the winter months. Yes, Bryan, that's mostly going to be price, but there is some volume increase in there as well. Yes mostly price as raw's continued to increase we -- as discussed needed to continue to increase price to keep up with that. Got it. Thanks, Bryan. Good afternoon, Tim. Well, certainly we can't -- we don't know, because we don't have a customer's mind as to what's a real order, what's not a real order, we treat all orders the same and then what we're really doing is just prioritizing them based on the necessity of shipping. And in addition to that, obviously, customer, existing customer that's been a longtime customer for Carlisle is going to be prioritized over someone that's being opportunistic. So I think, again, we're doing a very rational way. we're attempting to maintain that Carlisle experience and ensuring that the contractors in needed have that product there and making sure that we're not having any inventory or products sit around somewhere on a job site or in a warehouse but that people that need the product put on the roof or getting it done and I think the team's doing good job of that, but obviously that involves a lot of work that involves a lot of heavy lifting on the part of the sales force on the part of customer service to coordinate a lot of work there. So I think as we -- to your point on the extra ordering as we get through the year, we don't see it impacting the projections that we've made, that will sort itself out, as we begin to -- continue to fulfill these orders. And then I'd say just we'll check in as we get closer to the winter, and we'll know where we are. So as I mentioned, to Bryan, it's such a evolving environment and this recovery has been so rapid and the demand has been -- in a lot of industries so strong that like to just focus on the near-term and make sure again that we're delivering on that Carlisle experience for the contractor that needs it today. Well, I'll take the last one first. I think we view these last year and this year, these disturbances these really trying times as opportunities and probably the best opportunity for contractors, distributors, end users architects to see the really true Carlisle experience and the work that our team does. I mean, when everything's going smoothly, understand that how powerful that experience is. And so what I would hope is that as we are introduced to new customers, as people that are with other suppliers decide to try Carlisle, that they are overwhelmed by the experience and decide to make that permanent shift. Is that always occur I can't tell you what level of people, or what percentage of the people that get material from us for the first time stay with us. But my guess is that it's contributed to our growth over the last few years and will contribute -- and we'll continue to do that. So that's our goal, continue to perform well continue to perform better than anyone else and make sure that people see that and want to be part of that team. I think the other -- on the other side, the growth side, Bob may have some comments on that. But I think that the industry right now and the recovery probably market shares have not moved much relative overall demand, just because demand has been so heavy. So again, what I would look for is to run through the year. Let's sort out those orders you talked about that there may be some over ordering and then get into 2022. Hopefully, we'll have a more normal year. And then we'll be able to assess our progress versus the industry and versus our competitors. Bob, do you want to add anything? Yes, thanks Tim. Hey Joel. Sure. And I think -- I don't know about those two companies in particular, but I do know that every day our teams in CCM through their connections with the industry organizations through their connections to architects through large building owners people who are putting in warehousing, data centers, things like that, you can't help but think that as ESG, as energy efficiency becomes a bigger priority for all those end users and building owners that they're going to almost drive cooperation. So that we're getting -- we're making sure that as we're putting on that building envelope and ensuring that it's a -- it's got great insulation, vapor, water, air barriers, things like that, that they're also asking, the provider of that energy, and if it's either heating and cooling, to participate and have some coordination, I think a lot of that occurs at the design level with architects and specifiers. And, as we mentioned, both with Carlisle and with our Henry team, they're going to spend a lot of time with those organizations. So I think you're on the right track. I just -- I can't comment on carrier train, because I just don't know, but I would imagine those conversations are being had. Thank you. Good afternoon. Yes, I think the last one first Saree. I mean, I don't think we're ready to talk about 2022 yet now, certainly, we expect growth at CIT and continued ramp in our profitability. But we're a long way from what's going to happen with aerospace getting into 2022 at this point in time. Medical versus aerospace in the quarter, were almost the same decline. And that's largely due to the massive orders or I'm going to say, revenue we saw last second quarter remember, we talked about a big spike in orders, when COVID hit in shipments in the quarter so -- in medical. So that's why it was relatively flat, but we expect acceleration, faster acceleration in medical going to the end of the year than we do in aerospace, but we expect some growth in aerospace. We -- I think we see the industrial space continuing to improve out of the depths of 2020 and improvement in production. And, that I think the other thing that I would remind you, as you know, CFT, we did have some difficulties when we first bought that business, and then we're sharing losses. And I think part of the gains are getting back what is what I would call their rightful share through their innovation, and new products and really good work by the teams and communicating the value proposition. So I think it's a combination of that, that markets are improving industrial markets are improving. We think they'll continue to improve globally as we go throughout the year. And then I think there's a piece of that too. That is just CFT getting its stride back and becoming a solid Carlisle Company, Bob you want to add anything? Thanks, Saree. Yes, well, I think one of the things that we probably will need to do later is give the reference point in 2019. Because without that reference point, double the previous period you don't have a good reference for where we were in 2019 to gauge that. I think the other thing is on the double ordering. I'd be careful about that because as we know last year people were not ordering, we talked at length about how distribution going into the season had cut back on orders, people were concerned about where they'd be on the job. I mean, it was only a year ago, that States like Pennsylvania and cities like Boston weren't allowing contractors on the job site. In certain cases, they were increasing the PPE and the other protocols making more difficult. We were having inspections occurring virtually, it was hard to get permits pull, because governmental agencies were shut down. So when -- and we think that now we're in the second quarter, but you have to remember that was some of that stuff there was still concerned in the first quarter, that things were happening. And we did get ahead of it in production, as we mentioned, we got to have in our pricing, but there's still some lag there on the market until the confidence came back to the contractor and the -- distributors that would be able to function somewhat normally. So I think there is a surge there. And I think a lot of those orders, I have no reason to believe that most of them actually occur the quarter aren't real. Because I do think there's pent-up demand, people were waiting. And that's what we talked about as demand and continue to build. And if you think about even not including 25% of the orders in a year and letting them build in the back half of 2020 and then the first quarter of 2021, one would expect a pretty substantial surge in the second quarter of this year, and then we'll just need to monitor and we get to this third quarter of this year, it'll be -- we can do that same check and then have a comparison because we'll have been through the heavy and last part of the season getting into the winter months. So don't read too much into it other than demand is strong. And we are coming out of this pandemic strong and people are gaining confidence. And they're placing orders and they're getting back on the roof. And they got a lot of backlog to make up. Yes, certainly the net's, not different. But certainly with our increase in revenue based on price, we've gotten a lot more cost pressure and assumed a lot more price traction over the last three months, as costs have continued to rise and be up there we are a lot more confident that we need the price to cover it. Q2 was about $25 million negative as we expected and we expect to make that up in the second half of the year more in the fourth quarter, in the third quarter, but positive in both those quarters to make up for what we were short this quarter. Thanks Kevin. Yes, I think that our customers, we have some lot of very loyal customers that work very hard to make sure Carlisle is specified and chosen throughout the world actually and we don't want to make decisions in a quarter and we want to have share gains, but we want to make sure that the work we're doing with people, because it is pretty extensive, we spent a lot of time working with our contractors on things like warranty inspections and on helping prepare quotes in that that we always want to strategically give our efforts to those distributors, contracts and those that are with us and for the long run and have invested significantly in the Carlisle brand. So I don't think it's anything. While we stated I don't think it's anything other than our normal practice there that, we expect a lot out of our partners and they would expect a lot out of us in terms of loyalty as well. I think on the metal side, Peterson is a pretty much a commercial metal business. And I think there we're seeing a lot of movement into metal as it becomes architecturally more attractive as it has some renewable and recyclable aspects to it. We're just finding, it's gaining traction, there's some very positive trends there. And Peterson has done an excellent job of adopting the Carlisle experience, which they probably call it the Peterson experience before and, but it's a great brand with great coverage and good relationships and on the Drexel side, which is a little bit more on the residential side again, we're seeing people are choosing metal roofs in a lot of cases, there's more interest in Drexel has a very unique value proposition where they are actually preparing that work right on site and driving a lot of value. So is that team gets out and demonstrates a value proposition they're gaining a lot of traction. On the spray foam side, we originally bought a cell we talked about that high single-digit industry growth rate as people would adopt foam as a far superior insulator and some in certain cases, vapor barrier components to it. And what we're really seeing is that continued traction versus other forms of insulation and certainly here in the southwest with the heat and even in the north. I know being from Minnesota and live in the Arizona, spray foam insulation just provides a superior solution for the space in the wall cavity. And it just drives great performance and we see it just continuing to gain share in the marketplace. So I think the trends are positive for both. And then we on top of that we're adding very positive unique value propositions with this business. And I would be remiss if I didn't say that the partnership between CFT with their newly launched spray foam equipment which provides superior on ratio performance, it's got better heating capabilities in the competition. And much better performing product coupled with our spray foam coming out of CCM has also created a lot of interest with end users and is helping us drive a preference for our brand. So it's actually we're excited about all of those businesses and what they've done. Right. Commodities as they go into metal roofing and in the spray foam are just as volatile as the flat roofing commodity. So we need to get price in those as well to keep up with our flat price cost. Yes. Thank you, Garik. Thanks, Zen. And thanks, everybody. This concludes our second quarter 2020 earnings call -- 2021.excuse me. And thanks for your participation. We look forward to speaking with you at our next earnings call."

Before we begin, please refer to slide two of our presentation where we note that comments made on this call may include forward-looking statements based on current expectations of future events and their potential effect on Carlisle's operating and financial performance that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to be materially differ. A discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties is provided in our press release and in our SEC filings on forms 10-K and 10-Q. Those considering investing in Carlisle should read these statements carefully and review reports we file with the SEC before making an investment decision. Today's presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financials in our press release and in the appendix of our presentation materials and we've also have historicals provided in supplemental tables which are available on our website. With that, I introduce Chris Koch, Chairman, President and CEO of Carlisle.\nChris Koch: Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon. I'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope all of you, your families, coworkers and friends are staying safe and healthy as we collectively manage through what is hopefully the beginning of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reflecting on the last 12 months of uncertainty, I take great pride in how roughly one year ago, the Carlisle team handled the immediate threats borne out of the pandemic. Our first actions were to ensure our teams of Carlisle were taking the steps necessary to provide a safe work environment. We ensure that our team members had access to healthcare, continue to be paid and had company support for the difficult situations many we're facing. We enacted strict health and safety protocols based on the CDC, World Health Organization and best-in-class pure actions and recommendations, which contributed to a low infection rate at Carlisle across the globe. Our next steps were to support our highly engaged and flexible workforce as they took very proactive measures to ensure we supported our customers that we're providing essential services to the economy. We wanted to ensure that they can count on Carlisle to be there to provide the right product to the right place at the right time. Overall, we've come to call the Carlisle experience. Turning to Slide 3 now; throughout 2020 an essential part of leadership's job was to cut through the confusion, misinformation and complexity present in our daily lives and communicated clear, direct, and simple strategic vision for the organization that would inform our priorities, educate our collective mission, and guide our everyday actions of work. At Carlisle, we call this Vision 2025 and this compelling strategic framework gave us clear direction and consistency of mission during the tumultuous past year and will continue to guide our efforts as we accelerate into the recovery in 2021. During the past 12 months Carlisle again proved its ability to navigate varying economic cycles with steadiness and focus, while delivering strong financial performance, reconfirming our conviction in Vision 2025 and its key strategies. The first quarter of 2021 continues to validate the hard work, effort and commitment by all Carlisle place to our stakeholders and signals that operational momentum is building across our platforms. Moving to Slide 4. Due to the strength in our CCM, CFT, and CBF businesses, our revenue was flat year-over-year despite a very tough comparison to quarter one of 2020. The well understood impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the commercial aerospace markets continued to weigh on CIT results and it had a significant negative impact on the first quarter of this year. More than offsetting this was outstanding performance at CCM where our team delivered 6.3% year-over-year revenue growth. A tremendous achievement when considering the first quarter of 2020 was 1% higher than 2019 and Q1 of 2019 was 12% higher than 2018. Additionally, we are encouraged by CBF's rebound from a multi-year sector decline in demand for our off-highway vehicles and lastly CFT continues to build on its second half 2020 performance and we're encouraged with CFT's global end market strengthening. Our strong results and rapid recovery from the initial shock of the early stages of the pandemic reinforce our confidence in the Carlisle team's ability to achieve its Vision 2025. The first quarter results highlight how we continue to execute on our long-term strategies including maintaining the highest standards in providing the Carlisle experience to our customers. Investing in high return capital projects to drive organic growth across our core platforms, working an active pipeline of acquisition targets, returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Continuing on our ESG journey and demonstrating the exceptional and sustainable earnings power of the Carlisle business model. It's our history of innovation, investment and continuous improvements that supports more conviction than ever in Carlisle's future success. Turning to Slide 5, please. The first quarter of 2021 continue to demonstrate the strength of the CCM franchise and reaffirms our commitment to reinvesting in this our highest returning business. Our pivot to CCM that began with the introduction of Vision 2025 several years ago was to us an obvious strategic choice after more than two decades of exceptional returns on capital, strong organic growth and solid financial performance. This has further bolstered by the now well understood value of the Carlisle experience. By the Carlisle experience we mean ensuring delivery of the right product at the right place at the right time. We mean industry leading investment in production facilities and R&D capabilities. Best-in-class education for channel partners on the latest roofing products and installation best practices and award winning customer service team. Continuing to innovate and provide value added products then ensure quicker, easier, and safer installation of our building envelope systems and solutions in an increasingly labor and material constrained environment. And finally, and maybe, most importantly, contributing products that provide a better environment for all stakeholders. Taken in whole the Carlisle experience is how CCM has become a manufacturing engineering and commercial leader in the construction products industry. Further evidence of our commitment to the Carlisle experience into investing in our highest returning businesses. Earlier this week, Carlisle announced plans to invest more than $60 million to build an innovative state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Sikeston Missouri. This investment will support our organic growth initiatives and also create jobs for the City of Sikeston and surrounding communities. The building and its surrounding footprint will incorporate the latest advances in LEED building technologies and highest standards of sustainability. The insulation materials manufactured here not only lower energy costs for building owners and operators, but also help reduce a building's GHG emissions. Additionally, the sites central location will reduce the carbon footprint of CCM supply chain and improve material lead times for these customers in the region. Demand continues to grow for our insulation solutions, given the strong reroofing cycle underway in the US as well as the growing needs to improve the energy performance of commercial buildings. With that in mind, we felt this was the right time to expand our capacity and enhance the Carlisle experience for our customers in the Midwest. Please turn now to Slide 6. I'll illustrate some specifics on our first quarter results where CCM exhibited the remarkable strength of its business model. CCM organic sales grew nearly 6% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for our sustainable building envelope solutions and underscoring the importance of the Carlisle experience. March volumes were particularly strong more than offsetting significant weather induced softness in February. And additionally bookings entering the second quarter are at record levels. Fortunately our conviction and a strong 2021 meant that we anticipated the market needs and drove elevated production levels during the latter part of 2020 and into the winter months as others in the industry cast out on underlying demand. We did this as a commitment to our customers to ensure their needs would be met and continue to earn our place as the supplier of choice for their building envelope solution. CCM continues to benefit from the strong reroofing cycle in the United States. Our products and solutions for nonresidential buildings are non-discretionary and can only be deferred for so long. We believe CCM volumes in 2021 should benefit from work postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic. When we maintain our conviction and the sustainability of the reroofing demand in the US where we continue to expect the market to grow from $6 billion to $8 billion in the next decade. Additionally CCM is meeting head on the challenges from the significant acceleration in raw material and logistics cost inflation during the quarter. Coming into the year, we were expecting an inflationary environment, coupled with strong demand and thus had prioritized selling price increases across most product categories at CCM to ensure we could continue to invest in and provide world-class customer service to our customers. Our procurement and supply chain teams are doing a great job in navigating a volatile and extremely tight marketplace. Again with the goal of providing the best-in-class Carlisle experience to our customers. Turning to CIT; the first quarter results were in line with subdued expectations, giving the ongoing disruption in the commercial aerospace market. Improving leading indicators, which include the expanding vaccine rollout, increasing numbers of domestic travelers, growing aircraft manufacturer backlogs and improvements in CITs order books give us confidence that CIT is positioned for sequential improvement going forward. CFT delivered improved revenue and profitability performance in the first quarter driven by its re-energized commitment to new product innovation, improved operational efficiencies, price discipline and integration of our newer platforms. We are especially pleased that new products accounted for over half of the volume growth in this quarter. And at CBF the significant actions taken to improve the business over the past few years are yielding expected results. Combined with demand for off-highway vehicles and equipment especially in ag and construction is driving very strong volumes. CBF is delivering positive and accelerated earnings growth in what looks to be a significant inflection year for this business. Please turn to slide seven. Our ESG efforts also continue to gain momentum under Dave Smith, our recently appointed Vice President of Sustainability. In early April, we published our 2020 Sustainability Report in conjunction with the launch of a new award winning ESG focused website. These launches collectively share details of Carlisle's century long journey and provide a deeper look into the socially responsible approach we undertake to create value for all stakeholders of the company. I'd invite you to read what we have published on the sustainability section of our website at carlisle.com. I'd also like to highlight how important that Carlisle operating system was to Carlisle throughout the past year and will continue to be as we drive to deliver Vision 2025. During the pandemic year of 2020 and the 13th year of our COS journey, our teams leaned heavily on COS to navigate through significant uncertainty. The first quarter again demonstrated the value of COS as we delivered 1.2% savings as a percent of sales well within our target of 1% to 2% annually. Moving to Slide 8. Before Bob updates you on our financial performance, I wanted to give you a quick update on capital deployment. We continue to seek synergistic acquisitions that are currently working a robust pipeline. As has been the case for the last four years, we remained active on share repurchases buying back $150 million worth of shares during the first quarter and we paid $28 million worth of dividends. We remain opportunistic in share repurchases and we'll continue to balance our cash position with the opportunities within the robust M&A pipeline. We believe the strong performance in the first quarter across all platforms of Carlisle is a product of staying the course on our strategies. I'm proud of how the team met the challenges in the past year and believe Carlisle is at a solid position to accelerate through the recovery. Bob will now provide operational and financial detail about the first quarter and review our balance sheet and cash flow. Bob?\nBob Roche: Thanks, Chris. Starting with this quarterly call when referencing profitability, I'll be speaking to adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted earnings. Please now turn revenue bridge on Slide 9 of the presentation. Revenue was flat in the first quarter driven by CCM, CFT and CBF offset by the well-documented commercial aerospace declines at CIT. Organic revenue declined 1.4%. CCM, CFT and CBF all delivered greater than 5% organic growth in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 0.4% of sales growth for the quarter and FX was a 90 basis point tailwind. Turning to our adjusted EBITDA margin bridge on slide 10. Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin declined 180 basis points to 14.4%. Pricing and volume headwinds combined for 150 basis point decline driven by CIT. Acquisitions were a 10 basis point headwind. Freight, labor, raw material and other operating costs netted to a 140 basis point decline. COS benefits added 120 basis points. On Slide 11, we have provided an adjusted EPS bridge where you can see the first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.47, which compares to $1.67 last year. Volume, price and mix combined were $0.24 year-over-year decline. Raw material, freight, and labor costs were a $0.25 headwind. Interest and tax together were a $0.01 headwind. Partially offsetting the decline, share repurchases contributed 5%, COS contributed $0.16 and lower OpEx was a $0.09 benefit year-over-year. While COVID related volume declines at CIT clearly represented the most significant headwind during the quarter. Our CIT team did a commendable job, managing costs, leveraging COS to improve efficiencies and taking actions to position Carlisle for the recovery, while mitigating the pandemic's impact on earnings. Now, please turn to Slide 12 to review the first quarter performance by segment in more detail. At CCM the team again delivered outstanding results with revenues increasing 6.3% driven by volume and 60 basis points of foreign currency translation tailwind. CCM continued to exhibit its resilience with solid US commercial roofing performance despite continued COVID related restrictions in some areas and severe weather in February. Our European and architectural metals teams were solid contributors to the quarter's revenue performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin at CCM was 20.1% in the first quarter, a 50 basis point improvement over last year driven by the higher volumes. COS savings and cost management partially offset by wage and raw material inflation. Please turn to Slide 13 to review CITs results. CIT revenue declined 30.6% in the first quarter as has been well publicized just this decline was driven by pandemic's impact on commercial aerospace markets. While recovery in aerospace could be prolonged, we are confident that there will be a resumption of growth with the continued rollout of the COVID vaccine and airlines returning to profitability. In our medical platform, where sales were up nicely in the quarter year-over-year. We continue to expect sequential improvement from pent-up demand as the impacts of COVID on hospital CapEx and postponement of elective surgeries ease. Additionally, our project pipeline is robust and our backlogs improving. CIT's adjusted EBITDA margin declined year-over-year to 7.1% driven by commercial aerospace softly, partly offset by savings from COS and lower expenses. While the actions taken by CIT in 2020 to right size our footprint and reuse the overall workforce were difficult, we are positioned to deliver sequentially improving performance throughout 2021. Turning to Slide 14; CFT sales grew 12.9% year-over-year. Organic revenue improved 5.3%, acquisitions added 4.1% in the quarter and FX contributed 350 basis points. Stabilization in key end markets driven by an improved industrial capital spending outlook in 2021, coupled with new product introductions, pricing resolve and efforts to upgrade the customer experience positioned CFT to accelerate through the recovery. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 15.5% was a 590 basis point decline year-over-year. This decline primarily reflects an FX gain of approximately $3 million from the previous year partially offset by growing volume. Turning to Slide 15. CBFs first quarter organic revenue growth was 20.4% and FX had a positive 3.7% impact, driving CBF's organic total growth to 24.1% in the quarter. Demand for agricultural and construction equipment was the primary contributor to Europe. Additionally backlog continues to strengthen where bookings up 80% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 13.3%, a 600 base improvement driven by higher volumes and COS savings. On Slide 16 and 17, we show selected balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with $767 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner. Investing in organic growth through capital expenditures and opportunistically repurchasing shares while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. Free cash flow for the quarter was $47.6 million, a 57% improvement year-over-year. Turning to Slide 18. You can see the outlook for 2021 in corporate items. Corporate expenses now expected to be approximately $120 million for the year driven by stock and incentive-based compensation along with higher medical expenses. We continue to expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $225 million. For the full year, we expect to invest in our businesses and still expect capital expenditures of $150 million to $175 million. Net interest expense is still expected to be approximately $75 million for the year and we still expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. Finally, we expect restructuring in 2021 to be approximately $20 million. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris.\nChris Koch: All right. Thanks, Bob. Entering the second quarter of 2021, we are very optimistic about the remainder of the year. From record backlogs at CCM to growing positive trends in CIT aerospace markets to recovery in both CBF and CFT coupled with excellent sourcing and price discipline. We're confident in our ability to deliver solid results for our shareholders. We will continue to seek to deploy capital into strategic acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. While there are still uncertainties around the pandemic for the full year of 2021, we anticipate the following. At CCM supported by a strong multi-year reroofing base project deferrals that occurred in 2020, positive momentum in our newer businesses of architectural metals and polyurethanes and expansion of our European business. We now anticipate revenue growth of low double-digits in 2021. At CIT given improving leading indicators, including a vastly better COVID-19 outlook increasing daily TSA screenings for domestic travel and improving airline financials translating into increased manufacturers' orders CIT's financial performance has stabilized and is positioned for sequential improvement going forward. That said, we anticipate pressures remain near term, given a very difficult year-over-year comparison in the first and second quarters, we continue to expect CIT revenue will decline in the mid to high single-digit range in full year 2021. At CFT with end markets strengthening especially general industrial and improvements in the team's execution of our key strategies, we continue to expect low double-digit growth in 2021. And at CBF supported by strengthening demand in core markets, price resolving and growing backlog, we now expect over 30% year-over-year growth in 2021. And finally for Carlisle as a whole, we expect low double-digit growth in 2021. In closing, I want to once again express my gratitude to our dedicated employees their families, our business partners and all those associated with Carlisle's success. Given our 100-year history and the resilience of this company has shown in times of adversity and uncertainty, we remain confident in Carlisle's outlook, our strong financial foundation, cash generating capabilities, unwavering commitment to our Vision 2025 strategic plan and to providing products and services essential to the world's needs. This concludes our formal comments. Kavita [ph], we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer.\nBryan Blair: Good afternoon, guys. Very solid start to the year.\nChris Koch: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Good afternoon.\nBryan Blair: I was wondering if you could offer a little more detail on CCM volume trends through the quarter. I guess I'm most interested in the -- what I assume was an inflection in March. Our read was that February was tough and then there was a freeze throughout a good portion of the month. January wasn't great, flat to slightly up, so that implies a very strong margin momentum into the second quarter, which is consistent with having record bookings, but curious if you could quantify that level of momentum?\nChris Koch: Yes, I think, we pretty consistently with you. But I'd also say the third quarter and fourth quarter the teams were already seeing a return to some pretty solid numbers in backlog is continuing to be quite stable and growing. And then we did say I think in the fourth quarter call that we came into the year with momentum and the first quarter was going to be fairly good and I think as we've talked about, we did anticipate a strong 2021 coming off of the tough 2020 where we had some adds that we knew we're going to come back specifically in distributor stocking for instance and we also know there'll be a big backlog they hadn't been addressed in 2020. So, yes, you're right, January was I think was good. I think it continue to trend. February was a dip created some uncertainty out there. I think people were wondering how many days were lost at the roof and then March did come back and I think March just reflected though what we anticipate at all along. 2020 was going to be a good year that we were going to get some distributor restocking that contractors going to have more flexibility going on under the roof and we were going to see momentum build so.\nBryan Blair: I appreciate that color. And how is your team thinking about second quarter growth for CCM and if we work off of the 719 in the first quarter and think of historical seasonality and again with record bookings going into the quarter that implies very significant second quarter growth versus obviously a weak comp, but nonetheless very significant growth. Anything you could quantify would be appreciated?\nChris Koch: Yes, I'll let Bob address. But I think the seasonality thing I would kind of forget that. I think it's -- again the last year was an exceptional year. And I think there are some forces that overwhelm any seasonality that might be there but Bob you want to give some more specific.\nBob Roche: Yes, Bryan, on second quarter we're expecting over 20% growth off a weak last year. So I think you know the normal bump from Q1 to Q2 was there, but the year-over-year is definitely going to be bigger than usual because of the weakness last year.\nBryan Blair: Okay, fair enough. And then any updated thoughts you can offer on price cost outlook input costs have been less than cooperative that's well understood, you have been aggressive on price. We know there is traction there. How do you see that shaking out on a full year basis. And how should we think about first versus second half dynamic.\nChris Koch: Yes, I'm thinking about, what, at least from my perspective what we talked about at some of the other calls, which where we thought we were going to be relatively flat in 2021 that we were being the team was being very aggressive on price. Again I think the anticipated what was going to happen in the year. Very well I think the news is going to be high demand, there's going to still be labor constraints and I think they knew this idea of having product would be important especially inflationary times. So when we look at Q1 and Q2. I think for Q1. I mean, from my perspective, relatively flat on price cost. I think Q2 might be a little bit negative. And then as we roll into Q3 and Q4 we turn flat and then maybe a little positive, so net-net for the year. I'm thinking flat. Bob, you want to add anything.\nBob Roche: Yes, Bryan, just even with what Chris said about the second quarter. We still believe I think adjusted EBITDA margins relatively flat year-on-year even with the slight pressure we may see.\nBryan Blair: Okay. Excellent, Chris. I appreciate that. I'll leave it there.\nChris Koch: All right. Thanks, Bryan.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.\nTim Wojs: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Nice start to the year.\nChris Koch: Thank you.\nTim Wojs: Maybe just first question, could you just talk a little bit about kind of material availability maybe not for yourself to selling. It sounds like you guys are fine, but perhaps maybe just kind of the broader industry and kind of what you're hearing around lead times and kind of how those compared maybe relative to your own business?\nChris Koch: Yes, I think you're right, I think our team has done a good job of ensuring that we have supply and things are getting tighter. We're able to I think keep everybody satisfied for right now, but across the business I think there are those who are perhaps struggling. I know, on the form side, there has been polyols been tough to get MDI. I think for some people has been cut tough to get. I think even on the fasteners and steel decking has been surprisingly. I think tough to get. So, yes, I think in a broad sense Tim across what we're seeing it's getting a little bit worse you know and that's putting pressure obviously on the ability to deliver product and I think for some folks lead times extending. But as I said, I think for us we're keeping our customers satisfied and filled. So we'll see what happens there because at the demand rates things continue like this, it's going to put even more pressure. I do think as the year goes through though suppliers will caught up, they will have caught up to what they took out in 2020 and probably as we look at the back half of the year, things should normalize, but I think this summer is going to be interesting.\nTim Wojs: Okay. And then, if I remember correctly, distributors, really, really tightened up in April last year. Are you seeing that significantly loosen up, are they kind of scrambling for inventory?\nChris Koch: Well, I think that some of the record bookings obviously are people who are restocking. Last year we had that big hit. We did talk about in the second quarter, we talked about people not putting in that normal load for the year, I think now there is probably that normal load plus there was the -- there is the backlog from last year's jobs didn't get completed. And then we might have I would say some buying where people are worried about being able to deliver jobs in July and August and want to make sure they get a priced and get them in inventory at least have a line of sight to being able to deliver.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay, good. And then just free cash flow conversion, it looks the same, but I think it's actually off adjusted net income now. I guess from a dollar perspective what I guess it's change relative to before, because I guess if you put it relative to would be significantly higher, right?\nBob Roche: Yes, relative to GAAP it was higher. The new metric that we have is on adjusted net income, Tim.\nTim Wojs: Okay. And I guess what changed?\nBob Roche: Yes, nothing has changed.\nTim Wojs: But you had 120 on GAAP last time I know you have 120 on the adjusted in terms of conversion, right?\nBob Roche: We did. We leave some room for conservatism on the preliminary call for free cash flow conversion. So the math is the same.\nTim Wojs: I got you. Okay, good. Okay, great. I'll hop back. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Good luck.\nChris Koch: Okay. Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Hi, good evening. Typically a positive sign when companies are increasing capacity. What's the capacity of your new facility and how long will this capacity last before you think you're going to require another one?\nChris Koch: Well, I think we generally think that a Polyiso plan add somewhere between 5% and 10% to the capacity of the industry. And when you think that we're growing in the first quarter 6% and we think that's going to continue. I think it's just an appropriate level of capacity add and likely it will take couple of years to consume that. We've seen competitors add plants I think over the last five or six years, it's been one every couple of years and that seems to have been the appropriate level of capacity to not over-capacitized the industry and then have pressure on pricing.\nSaree Boroditsky: And then, maybe can you talk about what you saw from an end market perspective in CFT and do you see an acceleration through the quarter how orders trending. And then I believe you have a decent amount of auto exposure there. So maybe any impact you're seeing from production issues?\nChris Koch: Right. So I think most of the things that I'll address the first one, the production issues there and capacity, when they're putting in these paint systems and sealer systems. Typically, it's a longer term project with an ROIC based investment over multi-years. And so we haven't seen much in terms of negative impact over the long-term visions of people upgrading, either sealer decks or paint shops. When we look at the general trends in industrial, I think they are good. I think -- I've been surprised at how Europe has been as strong as it has been, China has returned and North America if anything, will be a little bit of a laggard, but that's coming on strong now too. So end market trends and I think you see that in CBF as well where we're seeing heavy equipment and that pickup after many years of that kind of a malaise. Bob you want to add anything or?\nBob Roche: No. I think that covers, Chris.\nSaree Boroditsky: Okay. Thanks for the questions.\nChris Koch: Thanks, Saree.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Garik Shmois with The Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: Great, thank you. Just with respect to CCM volumes you cited record bookings and that's clearly driving some of the strength here, but maybe you could flush out what you're seeing maybe from a regional or end market standpoint how new construction versus re-roofing and any region standout in particular?\nChris Koch: Yes. I think, the regions that still stand being headquartered in Phoenix one of the interesting things that we see is how strong building in the Southwest has been and obviously in Texas where there's a lot of talk about the migration that occurs there Florida. We see that surprisingly I think our business so pretty much everywhere has been pretty good. And you know one of the leading indicators, we've always said for years has been win resi construction is good, non-resi tends to follow when you're building houses and expanding suburbs and things like that, you tend to draw long shopping centers and places to eat, Walgreens, CVS and kinds of thing. So I think across the US it's been very good and you can see that in the resi as well. For new construction, it's been a contributor Bob, and I've talked for a while about how anything north of zero probably really helps and it has been, we think low single-digit for new. So that's been really good to add to what we articulated in this presentation and we have many times around how strong we think the reroofing backlog and growth in that it has been and will be over the next decade. So it's kind of an interesting thing here, but I mean really, if it's when I think about hitting on all cylinders, pretty much doing it right now.\nGarik Shmois: That's encouraging. What are the shut to the price cost outlook. Is this -- you reiterated it, is this predicated on getting or needing additional price increases or do you think, what you secured so far this year should get you there, just given the visibility that you have on the cost sites?\nChris Koch: Yes. And what I articulated, about the cost side, I think is a key part of that, obviously, we are anticipating that suppliers will give their capacity back online and we'll see some modulation as we get into third quarter and then into the fourth quarter obviously if things anything substantial changes that throws it off, but given that I think where we are from a price perspective, I think our team was very proactive and got ahead of us and that's what's embodied in this flat call for the year.\nGarik Shmois: Great. And then just lastly, just wondering on the supply side for CCM just given how tight it is and recognizing that maybe some manufacturers will be able to get their production in line later on this year, but just given how strong the market appears to be for you and how strong the market appears to be when looking out over the next several quarters and several years assuming a recovery. Do you think in an inflection point and you've been talking about this for several years. But do you think will truly at inflection point now for pricing in CCM?\nChris Koch: Well, I can't speak for the rest of the market, but I think given where we are on a variety of fronts, I mean, first of all, the demand, the labor constraints, the productivity needs you can get it ESG global. There are a lot of trends that just point to what we've been saying which is this market is going to be a robust market and people are going to place a premium on having a supplier that will deliver every time with the right product, the right place, but also a high quality product that's innovative takes labor hours off the roof. And our teams work over the last few years and investing in our R&D center, investing in training, investing in contractor education on application things like this leads us to believe that they're going to pay, they will pay a premium for a company that delivers on their promises like that. And so I think for us going forward we've had this pricing resolve for a while now, many years. And I think our inflection point was three or four years ago. I think maybe the rest of the industry may get there, but the only thing I would say Garik s if people don't deliver on those things if you're not providing innovation, if you're not providing superior customer service, if you're not providing products that take labor off the roof and things like that then I don't think the pricing situation is the same and you may not be at inflection point so.\nGarik Shmois: Understood. Thanks again.\nChris Koch: You bet.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joel Tiss with Bank of Montreal.\nJoel Tiss: Hey, guys. How is it going?\nChris Koch: Joel, how are you doing? Good to hear your voice.\nJoel Tiss: All right. Yes, good to hear you guys too. Glad everyone's safe and it sounds like happy and making everybody money, that's what it's all about, right.\nChris Koch: Thank you.\nJoel Tiss: Can you clarify what is price discipline mean in CFT?\nChris Koch: Well, one of the things, we know is that a large part over the years of our competitors growth and profitability has come through price and that idea that same kind of thing is in CCM you create innovative products, you provide excellent service, and then you price it appropriately and you don't just because someone tells you the competitor has a good deal, you don't lower price, you stick to pricing, your product to the value you provide. So that's really what we mean there is that CFT now is delivering on time there that we had good customer service. We're working on some innovative products as we said in the call. Half of the volume in the first quarter was through new products. So I think we're starting to build that business the way we wanted to which we could continue to get price and be disciplined in how we do it. We don't, we're not getting into these price competition, we're selling the value.\nJoel Tiss: Okay. So that's smart like establish yourself as the premium brand and they are a premium brand there?\nChris Koch: Yes, a premium brand.\nJoel Tiss: Can you talk a little bit about CIT. I'm sure you have a little more sort of insight just into what the customers are thinking and I'm thinking more '22 and '23. I'm not really thinking about the second quarter, but anything you can help us with because I know we went into kind of this time last year, it was a little too much inventory in the channel and is that all cleaned out and just give us maybe a little bit of a deeper look of how that setting up for the next like three years.\nChris Koch: Yes, I think it's all, Joel. I mean, it all depends on travel, and we're seeing increased travel at least we're seeing increased leisure travel, certainly in the US. I know China travel has picked up too. I've looked at that. I think Europe is a little bit soft still. I think what has there would have to really start to come back and we hopefully, we're going to see that the summer and I think we feel it will come back is the business traveler in the international traveler. And so that's what we're looking at. And then when we start seeing revenue improve at our major airlines then we can start thinking about them adding routes back and adding planes back into service. And I think that's happening right now, I mean, the things that we hear are that there is a backlog in simulators where players have to get re-certified that seems to be everybody starting to ramp up again. I think we're seeing more planes being brought out of backlog are those places where they've been stored and then we have seen some increase in orders from airlines certain airlines to aircraft manufacturers. So all those things point to us to say that as we get into the back half of 2021, we should start to see things really improving and then 2022 should bring us back to profitability in that and then marching forward from there.\nJoel Tiss: Okay. So it sounds like maybe just a little bit too early to have a clear view or whatever. And can you just talk quickly about acquisition valuation and then I'll leave you guys alone. And thank you very much for the time.\nChris Koch: No, no problem. The, actually I think the trend that's happened over the last couple of years, you know it well that there has been increasing amounts of money in the market with decreasing amount of assets and so multiples continue to increase. I think we saw with the Firestone deal. So I think what somewhere around 12, which for construction products compared to five years ago is probably a couple of turns higher than it would have been. So, yes, as long as we have money out there and we have strategics and sponsors out there looking for assets to buy and deploy capital and now we have specs and other things. Demand is high for assets and multiples continue to rise.\nJoel Tiss: And can you do anything creative to get through Bob screens like buying things for stock or not really?\nChris Koch: Can do Polyiso creative guy. So I can't do anything creative because he won't respond to it Joel it's just mean potato. So I, we, I know we just have to make sure we're fine and assets that have great synergies and good strong organic growth programs embedded in their businesses and I think when you look at where we are in the construction products are in CFT or in even in CIT in medical there are businesses that have great products that have good runways with strong organic growth and luckily in those markets, we now even in medical, we've got basis that are big enough that we can make acquisitions and get synergies out of it. And so I think that, that's the only way we can make the model work as we have to have good strong organic growth and leverage with those synergies.\nJoel Tiss: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nChris Koch: You bet.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research.\nKevin Hocevar: Hey, everybody. Nice start to the year there.\nChris Koch: Hey, thanks, Kevin.\nKevin Hocevar: Wondering if Bob I want to revisit you mentioned CCM margin, do you expect it to be flat in the second quarter compared to the prior year-end. I guess with if sales are expected to be up over 20% and price cost just a small headwind. I guess, why would that be the case, what would be the offsets there?\nBob Roche: Well, it's a little bit of the price cost that Chris mentioned that we think the second quarter is going to be the toughest compare and then growing into the back half. So it's --\nKevin Hocevar: Okay. And in terms of the, you guys mentioned metal roofs. I think you had mentioned in the prepared remarks, when you're talking about CCM that metal roofing in Europe did well. Wonder if you could just give a little bit more color there. And you didn't -- I don't think you mentioned Polyurethanes, so curious what you're seeing out of each of those businesses within CCM?\nChris Koch: Well, we're really pleased with Europe and the new management team that came in a little bit while back. We're impressive leader and how things have really solidified. And we invested in expansion of Walter's house and we're really pushing our new products and that's going to continue to be a good story. So I just think the story in Europe is just a new management team with a really exciting outlook really get it done attitude and the gentlemen, we brought in, is a very experienced in European construction products markets. He runs big businesses. And I think he has great strategic direction. So that's fun to watch happen. We love that when people come in with great skill sets and can apply their craft at Carlisle. Architectural metals is another great story. I mean, both leaders of the businesses at Drexel and Petersen are doing a great job. I think Petersen had a record month all time record month in March. So that team is doing a great job. They're also doing an excellent job of getting supply and maintaining price. I think they had some very improved margins as we headed into March on a year-over-year basis and historically we're improved as well. The Drexel team continues to do a great job as well there. And then Polyurethanes is great. The only issue in Polyurethanes is really for us right now is that some of the materials are hard to come by across the industry and everyone is kind of suffering on the MDI and polyols. And so we probably can get as much as we would like to have and that's really the only thing I think that's constraining the growth in that market. And that's a market where we have projected high single-digit growth out of Polyurethanes. And we still think that growth is there that, that product line continues to be more and more accepted and desired in homes for its insulating properties and vapor barrier properties and it's just a very high performing insulations. So there are three great segments for CCM, there were three great additions and we like what the management teams are doing and how they're creating value. Bob, you want to add anything to that?\nBob Roche: No.\nChris Koch: Great.\nKevin Hocevar: And last one for me, out of curiosity, it seems like you guys have always focused on GAAP, EPS, and GAAP EBIT you've always provided the adjusting items, but it always seem like the focus was the GAAP at the end of the day, but it seemed like it is this quarter, the focusing to shift to adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA. I guess as opposed to GAAP EBIT. So curious -- just curious what the reason that you're shifting the focus there. And are you also shifting it internally in terms of bonuses or anything in terms of how you're compensating your employees more tied to adjusted EBITDA as opposed to GAAP EBIT or yes just curious the shift there?\nChris Koch: So I don't really think there has been much of a change is certainly nothing with respect to compensation or anything. It's happening at Carlisle. We're a GAAP company and our most important metric is cash flow obviously and then return on invested capital. So we're still the same as we were. The move to add information and that's really what we did is we added information. We obviously after for GAAP. So anything we're doing is adding it was really driven by the investment community our shareholders and the desire for more information quicker and trying to take some work off of their plate. I mean we obviously would send our GAAP and say to our investors and others you have it, you can make the adjustments, but I think for us to do that work in advance and try to just make it a little bit easier to digest the information in a more rapid timeframe and to take some burden off the investment community and the analysts that are they're doing the work on. It was really the reason to do it and hopefully that in turn will produce a better understanding of the Carlisle story and what's driving value here. So that's all it was, it's not going to drive any changes in our performance and how we work and how we measure our capital investment or acquisitions. It's just an effort to provide more granularity to the investment community.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay, good. Yes, very helpful. So I appreciate that. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the conference back over to Chris for closing remarks.\nChris Koch: Thanks, Kavita [ph]. This concludes our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I want to thank everybody for your participation. And we look forward to speaking with you at the next earnings call. Thanks, and stay safe.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bob Roche",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Starting with this quarterly call when referencing profitability, I'll be speaking to adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted earnings. Please now turn revenue bridge on Slide 9 of the presentation. Revenue was flat in the first quarter driven by CCM, CFT and CBF offset by the well-documented commercial aerospace declines at CIT. Organic revenue declined 1.4%. CCM, CFT and CBF all delivered greater than 5% organic growth in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 0.4% of sales growth for the quarter and FX was a 90 basis point tailwind. Turning to our adjusted EBITDA margin bridge on slide 10. Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin declined 180 basis points to 14.4%. Pricing and volume headwinds combined for 150 basis point decline driven by CIT. Acquisitions were a 10 basis point headwind. Freight, labor, raw material and other operating costs netted to a 140 basis point decline. COS benefits added 120 basis points. On Slide 11, we have provided an adjusted EPS bridge where you can see the first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.47, which compares to $1.67 last year. Volume, price and mix combined were $0.24 year-over-year decline. Raw material, freight, and labor costs were a $0.25 headwind. Interest and tax together were a $0.01 headwind. Partially offsetting the decline, share repurchases contributed 5%, COS contributed $0.16 and lower OpEx was a $0.09 benefit year-over-year. While COVID related volume declines at CIT clearly represented the most significant headwind during the quarter. Our CIT team did a commendable job, managing costs, leveraging COS to improve efficiencies and taking actions to position Carlisle for the recovery, while mitigating the pandemic's impact on earnings. Now, please turn to Slide 12 to review the first quarter performance by segment in more detail. At CCM the team again delivered outstanding results with revenues increasing 6.3% driven by volume and 60 basis points of foreign currency translation tailwind. CCM continued to exhibit its resilience with solid US commercial roofing performance despite continued COVID related restrictions in some areas and severe weather in February. Our European and architectural metals teams were solid contributors to the quarter's revenue performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin at CCM was 20.1% in the first quarter, a 50 basis point improvement over last year driven by the higher volumes. COS savings and cost management partially offset by wage and raw material inflation. Please turn to Slide 13 to review CITs results. CIT revenue declined 30.6% in the first quarter as has been well publicized just this decline was driven by pandemic's impact on commercial aerospace markets. While recovery in aerospace could be prolonged, we are confident that there will be a resumption of growth with the continued rollout of the COVID vaccine and airlines returning to profitability. In our medical platform, where sales were up nicely in the quarter year-over-year. We continue to expect sequential improvement from pent-up demand as the impacts of COVID on hospital CapEx and postponement of elective surgeries ease. Additionally, our project pipeline is robust and our backlogs improving. CIT's adjusted EBITDA margin declined year-over-year to 7.1% driven by commercial aerospace softly, partly offset by savings from COS and lower expenses. While the actions taken by CIT in 2020 to right size our footprint and reuse the overall workforce were difficult, we are positioned to deliver sequentially improving performance throughout 2021. Turning to Slide 14; CFT sales grew 12.9% year-over-year. Organic revenue improved 5.3%, acquisitions added 4.1% in the quarter and FX contributed 350 basis points. Stabilization in key end markets driven by an improved industrial capital spending outlook in 2021, coupled with new product introductions, pricing resolve and efforts to upgrade the customer experience positioned CFT to accelerate through the recovery. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 15.5% was a 590 basis point decline year-over-year. This decline primarily reflects an FX gain of approximately $3 million from the previous year partially offset by growing volume. Turning to Slide 15. CBFs first quarter organic revenue growth was 20.4% and FX had a positive 3.7% impact, driving CBF's organic total growth to 24.1% in the quarter. Demand for agricultural and construction equipment was the primary contributor to Europe. Additionally backlog continues to strengthen where bookings up 80% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 13.3%, a 600 base improvement driven by higher volumes and COS savings. On Slide 16 and 17, we show selected balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with $767 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner. Investing in organic growth through capital expenditures and opportunistically repurchasing shares while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions. Free cash flow for the quarter was $47.6 million, a 57% improvement year-over-year. Turning to Slide 18. You can see the outlook for 2021 in corporate items. Corporate expenses now expected to be approximately $120 million for the year driven by stock and incentive-based compensation along with higher medical expenses. We continue to expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $225 million. For the full year, we expect to invest in our businesses and still expect capital expenditures of $150 million to $175 million. Net interest expense is still expected to be approximately $75 million for the year and we still expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. Finally, we expect restructuring in 2021 to be approximately $20 million. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris. Yes, Bryan, on second quarter we're expecting over 20% growth off a weak last year. So I think you know the normal bump from Q1 to Q2 was there, but the year-over-year is definitely going to be bigger than usual because of the weakness last year. Yes, Bryan, just even with what Chris said about the second quarter. We still believe I think adjusted EBITDA margins relatively flat year-on-year even with the slight pressure we may see. Yes, relative to GAAP it was higher. The new metric that we have is on adjusted net income, Tim. Yes, nothing has changed. We did. We leave some room for conservatism on the preliminary call for free cash flow conversion. So the math is the same. No. I think that covers, Chris. Well, it's a little bit of the price cost that Chris mentioned that we think the second quarter is going to be the toughest compare and then growing into the back half. So it's -- No."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Giannakouros, Carlisle's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jim, please go ahead.\nJim Giannakouros: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Carlisle's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We released our fourth quarter financial results after the market closed today, and you can find both our press release and earnings call slide presentation in the Investor Relations section of our website, carlisle.com. On the call with me today are Chris Koch, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Zdimal, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dave Smith, Carlisle's Vice President of Sustainability. Today's call will begin with Chris giving an update on our progress in achieving our strategic plan, Vision 2025, highlights of our fourth quarter and full year results and a discussion of our current business outlook. With our recently announced commitment to achieving Net-Zero emissions by 2050, Dave will elaborate on our commitment to this pledge and provide a general update on our sustainability progress. And Kevin will discuss additional financial details and our outlook for 2023. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the line for questions. But before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our press release and SEC filings. As Carlisle provides non-GAAP financial information, we've provided reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and in the appendix of our presentation materials, which are available on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Koch: Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Please turn to Slide 3. Let me begin my commentary by complementing the entire Carlisle team on the sales and earnings records set in the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022. 2022 truly was an exceptional year. In addition to delivering record fourth quarter sales of $1.5 billion, we also delivered record annual sales of $6.6 billion, surpassing both the $5 billion and $6 billion marks in sales for the first time in Carlisle's 105-year history. We further delivered a record adjusted diluted EPS of $3.92 in the quarter, an increase of 34% year-over-year. 2022 also marked a key milestone in our Vision 2025 journey as we delivered $17.58 of GAAP EPS for the year, exceeding our primary Vision 2025 goal of generating $15 of GAAP EPS for our shareholders. Exceeding this goal three years early is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all of Carlisle's employees and to their commitment to the work of Vision 2025. These record results are even more remarkable given the extremely challenging operating environment of the past few years. Of the many challenges we faced over this period, I would say navigating the COVID pandemic was the most unexpected challenge. For so many people, the pandemic was a traumatic experience in their lives from a health and welfare, social and economic perspective. I'm grateful for the significant actions Carlisle employees took to keep us all as safe as possible while navigating COVID in their personal life as well. In addition, we also experienced significant supply chain disruptions and inflationary environment and labor and material shortages. Our record results would not have been possible without the clarity of mission that Vision 2025 has provided us since its launch in 2018, and the unwavering commitment of our teams. Guided by Vision 2025, our teams remained unified and stayed the course for the past five years, diligently overcoming the challenges we faced. Please turn to Slide 4. Our record results continue to demonstrate that Vision 2025 has been the right strategy for Carlisle. In addition to our world-class teams and proven business model, we've benefited from a strong balance sheet, an excellent cash flow generation to provide both financial and strategic flexibility to execute and achieve our ambitious goals. A significant portion of our success has been driven by the multiyear process of reshaping our portfolio to pivot from a diversified industrial products company to a higher returning building products portfolio of businesses. This transformation sets the stage for a more focused, simplified and better understood path for future sustainable value creation at Carlisle. The pillars of Vision 2025 remain core to our strategy going forward. These include: first, drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 6.6% organic revenue growth, which helped drive organic growth of 29% for the full year 2022. Notably, all four segments contributed to this growth. Second, utilize the Carlisle Operating System, or COS, to drive continuous improvement. We use COS to consistently drive efficiencies and enhance operating leverage. For the full year 2022, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded nicely and COS contributed to that. We continue to target COS savings of 1% to 2% of annual sales. Third, build scale with synergistic accretive acquisitions. Under Vision 2025, we have streamlined and optimized our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to build scale in our highest returning building products businesses and to broaden our suite of energy-efficient solutions. Through 2022, we have invested over $3 billion in accretive acquisitions. And fourth, a returns-focused capital allocation strategy that includes deploying over $3 billion into capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends. Since the launch of Vision 2025, we have invested over $3 billion into these areas of capital allocation, also three years ahead of our original plan. In 2022, we made capital investments of over $184 million into our businesses to drive innovation, increase operational efficiencies and enhance the Carlisle experience. We also returned over $500 million to shareholders with share repurchases totaling $400 million and $134 million paid in dividends in 2022. And of course, none of this would be possible without continuing to invest in and develop exceptional talent. Through the accelerated execution of Vision 2025, Carlisle has built a solid foundation, leveraging a diversified workplace, decentralized management style, entrepreneurial spirit and a culture of continuous improvement, which will continue to guide our value creation journey in 2023 and beyond. Turning to Slide 5. I'd like to highlight some of the many accomplishments in the fourth quarter. First, collectively, our building products segment now constituting over 80% of Carlisle total sales delivered record fourth quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA. Second, we are pleased with the ongoing integration efforts at our newest segment, CWT. The team continues to effectively capture the projected synergies from the Henry acquisition of $30 million, while focusing on delivering excellent customer service in a challenging environment. This commitment to our channel partners and customers was recognized when Henry was awarded to Home Depot's Building Materials Vendor of the Year Award in October. Third, we continued the introduction of our innovative labor-saving 16-foot TPO product to the market, which is manufactured on the industry's latest and most technologically advanced TPO line in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. As a reminder, we began shipping this product in the third quarter of 2022. Additionally, construction of our state-of-the-art polyiso facility in Sikeston, Missouri is on track for completion in the second quarter and on track to achieve LEED Platinum certification, the highest level of commercial building energy-efficient standards. Fourth, pricing remained and continues to be positive across all segments as we continue to demonstrate our value to our customers. Fifth, supply chain and material availability returned to a more normal state. This return to normal has enabled our channel partners to settle back into more of a historical buying cadence. And finally, global aerospace markets continue their recovery, driving strong sales and backlogs at CIT and increased profitability on the back of the significant restructuring actions taken by the CIT team over the past few years. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave Smith, our Vice President of Sustainability, for an update on our ESG progress. Dave?\nDave Smith: Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. I'd like to begin by reiterating that Carlisle has had a century-long legacy of responsible stewardship and stakeholder focus, all driven by our core cultural value of continuous improvement. We believe that creating a more sustainable environment is also productive for our shareholders. As an organization, Carlisle is committed to being a responsible environmental stakeholder with our three pillars of environmental sustainability. First, develop energy-efficient products and solutions to reduce the greenhouse gas, or GHG emissions, from building operations and help lower operating costs for our customers. In 2022, Carlisle sold $3.5 billion of LEED certified products and solutions, up from $2.5 billion in 2021. Second, reduced material weights going into landfills. Our history of recycling began in the 1920s when we incorporated scrap rubber into our inner-tube production. Today, we continue that tradition by upcycling polyiso waste into water filtration products. Carlisle has had a century long commitment to reduce material waste and continually improve our processes to deliver shareholder value while improving the environment for the communities in which we operate. And third, a focus on lowering the GHG emissions of our operations and manufacturing processes with the implementation of enhanced energy conservation measures such as converting our factory forklift fleet from propane to electric. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Carlisle probably took a significant step to achieving Net-Zero GHG emissions in our value chain by 2050. To accomplish this Net-Zero state, we proposed near-term GHG reduction targets through the science-based targets initiative. The site-based targets initiative is an independent body based in the U.K. that works in conjunction with United Nations to help guide companies to establish emission reductions initiatives using science-based targets. Our near-term 2030 GHG reduction targets are: first, to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 38%; and second, reduce scope 3 GHG emissions by 48% per pound produced. While our focus on emissions, waste reduction and sustainable products are a key part of our sustainability efforts, we also made a significant commitment to the social component of our ESG progress. On October 17, 2022, we proudly announced a special stock option grant to all eligible U.S. employees and a cash award to all eligible employees outside the U.S. These awards are designed to allow all Carlisle employees to participate in Carlisle's success as stakeholders. Previous grants issued in 2009 and 2018, generated significant returns for our employees based in no small part on their contribution to increasing shareholder value. Additionally, our path to zero program, which represents Carlisle's commitment to creating the safest possible work environment, continues to be a source of pride for our organization. In 2022, Carlisle's OSHA Incident Rate was a remarkable 0.67, significantly below the industry average of over 3 and that represents a 69% decline in workplace incidents since 2014. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details as well as our 2023 outlook. Kevin?\nKevin Zdimal: Thank you, Dave. Before turning to segment results, let's turn to our overall 2022 fourth quarter results on Slide 7. The fourth quarter played out much as we anticipated and communicated on our last earnings call. As Chris mentioned, the Carlisle team delivered a very strong fourth quarter despite the many challenges we faced. Fourth quarter revenues increased 6.6% organically, driven primarily by positive pricing across all segments. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin improved 280 basis points, driven by efficiencies gained through COS and our ability to price to value. Revenues, adjusted EBITDA and EPS were all fourth quarter records for Carlisle. For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 8. CCM delivered revenues of $800 million, up 3% organically. This performance was driven by positive price more than offsetting year-over-year volume declines given current normalization of buying patterns by our customers in severe weather in December in much of the U.S. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.5%, a record performance in the fourth quarter by our CCM team was driven by price and COS and partially offset by raw material and labor inflation unfavorable mix and a reduction in volume. Moving to Slide 9. Sales at Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies increased 5.5% organically. This growth was achieved despite ongoing supply constraints and softness in residential demand. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.8%. The team continues to focus on the integration of Henry, the $30 million of stated synergies from the acquisition and rolling out COS throughout CWT to drive greater efficiencies in our operations. Moving to Slide 10. CIT revenue increased 22% organically in the fourth quarter of 2022 with balanced growth in our commercial aerospace and medical technology platforms. We continue to see domestic travel approach pre-pandemic levels, strong backlogs and growth in our medical new product pipeline. As a result, CIT is well positioned for continued revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion in 2023. Turning to CFT on Slide 11. CFT generated organic revenue growth of 11.3%, driven by positive pricing and favorable volume, partially offset by a 7% year-over-year foreign exchange headwind. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded more than 400 basis points to 22.1%, driven by favorable volume, price and efficiencies gained from COS. Slides 12 and 13 provide details of our record fourth quarter consolidated results for revenue and adjusted EPS. Moving to Slides 14 and 15. Carlisle ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with $400 million of cash on hand and $1 billion availability under our revolving credit facility. We generated cash flow from continuing operations of $418 million, bringing our full year 2022 total to $1 billion. Turning to Slide 16. We have our 2023 financial outlook. Despite a challenging first quarter, we expect to deliver another record year in 2023 with full year consolidated revenue up low single digits. The first quarter will be a challenge as a result of tough comps for CCM, the weather disruptions that we have already seen as well as the continued normalization of buying patterns in the channel. Residential exposure represents a significant headwind for CWT in 2023, also weighing on our consolidated revenue growth outlook. While smaller contributors to consolidated results, healthy backlogs in both CIT and CFT give us confidence in their ability to each grow revenue high-single digits in 2023. Given our focus on disciplined pricing, operational efficiency and managing costs through our continuous improvement efforts, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins to expand 100 basis points year-over-year. In November, we gave a preliminary view of 2023, stating we expect to drive adjusted EPS growth this year. With non-residential re-roofing demand remaining strong, continued pricing discipline and an unending focus on manufacturing efficiencies, we reiterate this view and are driving towards another record year for Carlisle. With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks.\nChris Koch: Thanks, Kevin. In closing, I once again would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the hard work and perseverance of all of Carlisle\u2019s employees. The accomplishments the team has achieved since the launch of Vision 2025 are remarkable and were done under some of the most challenging conditions industry has faced in over a decade. I think we can all look back on 2022 and be proud of an outstanding year. As we move through 2023 and with Vision 2025 objectives well ingrained throughout Carlisle, I am optimistic for the year ahead. We will take actions to navigate this complex operating environment, deliver the Carlisle experience to our customers, drive earnings growth for our shareholders and strive to deliver another record year. And that will conclude our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nBryan Blair: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.\nChris Koch: Hey, good afternoon, Bryan.\nBryan Blair: There\u2019s been a lot of focus, I think understandably so on whether CCM\u2019s Q4 volume compression, simply the normalization of order patterns and channel reset are indicative of underlying demand destruction. And it sounds like some of the channel recalibration is continuing into the first quarter. That in mind, I think it would be helpful if you walked us through how orders phased through Q4, what you\u2019re seeing in Q1 relative to the Q4 rates and where you see Q1 revenue shaking out relative to the Q4 level?\nChris Koch: All right, Bryan. That\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s a lot in there. So let me just first say that we do see some of the inventory normalization going into Q1 when we had originally thought it would probably be down by the end of the year. Some of that has to do with weather. Some of that has to do with economic impact to interest rates and things like that. But overall, as we go into the year, we still see commercial roofing strong. We think it\u2019s going to be a good year in 2023. We do have some comps in Q1 that are, I would say, fairly large, but nothing really happening there on the demand side. Re-roofing continues to be strong. I think some modulation, I think in the future, maybe on new construction. But we\u2019ve been out talking to a lot of contractors, a lot of distributors. We do see, for sure, it\u2019s real, this inventory normalization. We see it continuing. I think people have hinted that. But the underlying demand is still good. And I\u2019ll turn it to Jim, just to give you a little more granularity on the demand and the order.\nJim Giannakouros: Yes. So an extension of what we saw and what we communicated all through 4Q, Bryan, we\u2019re seeing just because we are in our seasonally softest period that the channel or recalibration of inventory levels, et cetera, has taken us through the winter months, right? And so you could see an extension of those trends certainly through most of 1Q. And then that should probably take you to normal \u2013 approaching normal seasonal patterns that you would typically see as 1Q being our seasonally softest period.\nBryan Blair: Okay. I appreciate the color. And I guess just to follow-up on that and level set. So if we take our stab at where in the low-single digit range, CCM revenue picks out for the year, you\u2019re saying that it\u2019s fair to assume more of a normalized seasonal pattern to revenue with significant step up Q2, Q3?\nKevin Zdimal: Right. This is Kevin. And yes, on that piece of the revenue throughout the year, we don\u2019t break it down too much by quarter, but we would say that our first quarter typically is about 20% of our full year revenue for CCM. This year based on our low-single digit guide, we would say our Q1 would be high teens as a percent of the total year.\nBryan Blair: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I think about segment margin for the year, you have the 100 basis point consolidated margin expansion guide. That seems to necessitate that core CCM is higher year-on-year. How should we think about the other platforms? You have pretty good momentum, CIT, CFT. You\u2019ve spoken to expansion there. Can you quantify that further or add a bit more detail? And in terms of CCM and CWT, am I correct that, of course, CCM should be higher year-on-year? And how should we think of the volume versus synergy and COS-based offset with CWT.\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. We don\u2019t get into too much on the segments. I\u2019m breaking down exactly what the components are at the margin. But I would say, so we have said that overall consolidated will be up 100 basis points on margin, and we do see all four segments having year-over-year improvement in margin. So each of \u2013 so CCM to your point, definitely, we are seeing margin improvement, we\u2019re expecting margin improvement year-over-year.\nBryan Blair: Okay. Understood. Thanks again guys.\nChris Koch: Yes. Thanks, Bryan.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Blair. The next question is from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Please proceed.\nTim Wojs: Yes. Hey guys, good afternoon.\nChris Koch: Hi, Tim.\nTim Wojs: Maybe just on the pricing side, I think there\u2019s just some anxiousness among investors that this kind of normalization period that the industry is working through is going to create some sort of, I guess, pricing competition. So maybe if you could just talk to kind of what you\u2019ve seen as you\u2019ve gone through the fourth quarter around price realization or at least the stiffness the price? And then how you expect \u2013 what you kind of see to fall already in the first quarter?\nChris Koch: Yes, Tim, we \u2013 pricing is remaining firm. I think we talked about it at your conference. We continue to see great stability in the industry, people pricing to value, no degradation. We talked about, I think earlier about how the price increases that we put in the latter half of 2022 would continue on into 2023 and be accretive in 2023, and we\u2019re seeing that happen just as we expected, no real deviation there. There have been some \u2013 hence, yes, we know from people hints \u2013 but questions from people, but we\u2019re really not seeing it. Fourth quarter was consistent on what we expect at the price, no degradation going into the year, we don\u2019t see that. And we really don\u2019t see any motivation coming from either contractors or distributors to participate in that. There\u2019s still a premium on delivery. We still have labor constraints. And so as we go into 2023, we would expect pricing to be accretive and to have a gain based upon that lapping of the price increases that we put later in 2022, so nothing\u2019s changed.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay. That\u2019s good. And then I guess, just from a raw material standpoint, I mean is there a way just conceptualize kind of what you\u2019re seeing in the raw material basket from a price standpoint and kind of what may be embedded in the total company target of 100 basis points expansion.\nChris Koch: Yes. And the raw materials, as we look at it throughout the year, early in the year, first quarter, we\u2019re not going to see much of the benefit, but as we get into the summer months, we expect to have some tailwinds there on the raw material costs and throughout the balance of the year.\nTim Wojs: Okay. And then the last one for me, just on Henry. So if sales are down double digits, how do we think about the EBITDA margin I guess CWT? But how do we think about the EBITDA margin in CWT? What\u2019s kind of the core decremental I guess, on those volume declines? And then what are \u2013 are there any potential offsets?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. The margins \u2013 incremental, decremental margins are right around 30%. And again, we expect to see year-over-year margin improvement in this segment, despite, as you said, the doubt-digit decline in revenue.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.\nKevin Zdimal: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Wojs. The next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed.\nGarik Shmois: Hi, thanks. I just want to follow-up on point you make with respect to expecting some modulation in new commercial construction. I was just wondering if you could maybe speak to that a little bit more, maybe speak to backlogs or any conversations that you might be having with your customers with respect to the timing of that?\nChris Koch: Yes. We still see, I think 2023 as a strong year. There may be a little modulation in new. We did have a really strong, I would say, bias to new construction when we were in 2022 and coming out of COVID, Garik. And I think what\u2019s happening is we\u2019re seeing the re-roofing pickup as a larger part of the sales in 2023. We would have expected that. I think Jim may have indicated that in previous quarters how as that may modulate a little bit re-roofing would pick up because of the backlog there. And I think we\u2019ve shared our charts with you about how we see re-roofing playing out over the next five years to seven years. So as we came out of COVID and the delay on new construction there, I think new picked up. And obviously, it\u2019s easier, I think, to delay re-roofing a little bit than it is to delay a new project that it was under way and COVID experienced delays due to the governmental restrictions on the job sites and things that were happening back then. So still see a positive year, still see a good scenario for new. And then I think really what starts to happen is as we get through 2023, we\u2019re going to have to look at what happens from the Fed, what happens with other things in the economy on a macro level to really start wondering if it\u2019s going to have a dramatic change into 2024. Now through that whole thing, we still see underlying demand is positive for re-roofing and other things. So yes, 2023 should still remain good.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. Great. Want to follow-up just on the mix impact in CCM and CWT in the fourth quarter, and how you anticipate mix to evolve in 2023, if at all?\nChris Koch: Well, we don\u2019t normally get to that granularity on the call around mix. I would say when we look at CCM across the Board, EPDM, TPO, PVC, polyiso, really, with the exception of the last year where we\u2019ve seen the raw material availability and then the supply availability and some different ordering patterns. For the most part, they\u2019ve been very stable. EPDM has been a steady low-single digit grower. TPO continues to be a product that gains momentum. And obviously, polyiso with the ESG and efficiencies that are becoming now regulations and people wanting to higher our values on their roof. We\u2019re seeing yes, polyiso continues as it has through the years to gain as a percentage of the job site. We\u2019re still putting on maybe a square of TPO. But underneath that, we could be now putting on two, three, four layers of polyiso, and I think that will continue to gain momentum. And then on the PVC side, our team has done a great job on PVC. We think it\u2019s a nice product. It\u2019s been relatively new to Carlisle. A few years ago, we opened up our plant in Greenville. And so polyiso or PVC has continued to gain some market share and had, again, good growth in the fourth quarter and in 2022 overall. So I don\u2019t really think the mix will change much. When you look at our metals business, it\u2019s pretty consistent there. Petersen and Drexel, the two acquisitions continue to grow at an expected rate and remain about the same percentage. CWT gets a little bit different because the businesses get a little bit smaller, but we continue to see nice improvement with Henry. They continue to have pretty good success in the retail channels and R&R. We think R&R should pick up in 2023. And then spray foam to the Accella acquisition that had a few years ago, it was a little bit lower mix, but we\u2019ve done some nice things there with that group to continue to drive, I would say, market or above rates, and there were some \u2013 I think when we did that deal, we were talking about 8% as a market growth rate there, and so they continue to grow. But then you get into some smaller businesses. And as you saw with the public announcement on [indiscernible] side of our rubber business, we did exit that. And so obviously, that changes a little bit of the mix, but it\u2019s not much. So try to give you some granularity there. But overall, mix pretty much stays the same that for the company and hopefully, that helps you.\nGarik Shmois: It does. Thanks for all that and I appreciate and best of luck.\nChris Koch: You bet. Thanks, Garik.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Shmois. The next question is from Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.\nDan Oppenheim: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about CCM in terms of the low-single digit revenue there for 2023. You\u2019ve talked about pricing in terms of still getting some benefit there. So given the impact on volume here in 1Q with inventory and such, are you essentially assuming sort of some slight benefit from pricing volumes flat to down or slightly there? Is that the way to think about it?\nChris Koch: Dan, I think we don\u2019t want to \u2013 obviously, we don\u2019t like to share too much because of competition. But just try to give you a little color. I think if we look at that number, we\u2019d split it. We\u2019d probably say the low-single digits. We take half in price and half in volume. So that could fluctuate a little bit. I happen to think that we\u2019re seeing a little bit better start to the year. So could see a little bit more volume. But I think it\u2019s a good place to just say split it 50-50.\nJim Giannakouros: And also \u2013 this is Jim, just that I mean, 1Q, obviously, is our toughest comp. We have our easiest comp in 4Q, right? And so that that will tend to balance out your model, Dan, to get into the low-singles on average for the year.\nDan Oppenheim: Great. And then, I guess, second thing, in terms of repurchase activity increasing there in the fourth quarter, how do you think about that in terms of planning for 2023? Should we expect more ones to get past these short-term challenges in 1Q?\nChris Koch: No. I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent about our allocation of capital, especially into share repurchases. And we still tend to look at our intrinsic value, and then we do some work around that to see where we end up and then we compare it to other places where you can allocate capital. And I\u2019d say we should be in that same level for 2023 that we were for 2022. When you look at the year as a whole, obviously, it\u2019s going to maybe vary by quarter, but I think what we did in 2022 is probably a good starting point for what we\u2019ll do in 2023.\nDan Oppenheim: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Oppenheim. The next question is from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks for taking my questions. So just following up on the CWT margin commentary. Just given the volume declines, can you just walk us through the offset that way you expand margins for the full year?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. We \u2013 as far as \u2013 I mean, the biggest one will be price cost. As you look at that one, we\u2019re seeing that to be a benefit in our business for 2023 at CWT, and that\u2019s been historically, what we\u2019ve seen in other cycles like this as you look back, whether it was financial crisis or back-end early 2000s, very similar that we didn\u2019t own the business at the time, the Henry business, but that\u2019s \u2013 they saw similar to what we saw in our core roofing business with those being tailwinds.\nChris Koch: Yes. Saree, I would also say, Chris here, that COS, we buy an organization, especially the magnitude of Henry, and we roll COS out. It typically tends to be very well received. And I think Frank Ready and the team at Henry have embraced COS. And so we think we\u2019ve got some upside there because they\u2019re in the early innings of that lean sigma rollout, so that should help. And then obviously, we are applying \u2013 with a longer-term view that Carlisle has, we\u2019re applying a little bit more focus on automation and capital investment in our factories, so we should get some efficiency there. And then we also had some portfolio action in there, and we talked about that rubber business, which actually was taking away from margin in 2022. And with that out of the mix, that will boost that margin up. So when you look at those things altogether, it gives us quite a few vectors to work on and also see some nice returns.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great. And then you had a competitor announce who was buying DuralastI believe today. Can you just talk about any impact to the competitive environment as they continue to make acquisitions in the space?\nChris Koch: Yes. It\u2019s for us, it\u2019s an interesting situation. I believe they bought Malarkey earlier, and that\u2019s a residential shingle organization doesn\u2019t affect us too much. I mean I can\u2019t really think that impacts our commercial roofing business or CWT business. And now this acquisition of Duralast, great company. We know Duralast very well. They have a great product, but they\u2019re really not a competitor to us in our commercial roofing space. They really deal, I would say, in a kind of a smaller square foot size and maybe in some different segments that we compete in. So that\u2019s a great business, great family business. And so they\u2019ll \u2013 I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll do well with that. But the impact on it should be minimal. I think going forward, we would obviously \u2013 they\u2019re stated they want to grow in North America. And obviously, Carlisle wants to grow in North America, and we\u2019re acquisitive, and they want to be acquisitive. So I would imagine we will run into that team again as assets come up on the horizon.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great. Thanks for the color and congrats on the quarter.\nChris Koch: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Boroditsky. The next question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please proceed.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes, good afternoon everybody. I guess, I just want to go back to CCM. And fourth quarter, I think a normal seasonality there as being kind of down 15% sequentially versus the third quarter. You were down kind of 2 times that. It looks like there was obviously more than seasonality here. Kevin referenced the snowstorms in the U.S. Maybe for starters, can you just quantify the impact to some of these other things beyond seasonality might have had there and help us break this down a little bit?\nKevin Zdimal: Right. The biggest piece, I mean, the weather was there, but it\u2019s also just how we\u2019ve talked about it in the last earnings call and this one, there\u2019s normalization of the buying patterns that what we had throughout 2022, folks were on allocation and being on allocation. People are buying what they could get their hands on. And they basically bought ahead in the first part of 2022. And that was really the biggest reason why in the fourth quarter as customers brought inventory levels down that impacted that piece. So we would not say 2022 was a normal year of seasonality. We think even bright and to go back pre-COVID and look at how those years broke out as far as quarter-by-quarter, like you\u2019re looking to do from Q3 to Q4 because as we get back to normal, a lot of that will be in play, and you can look at it that way. I pointed out what Q1 would be not normal this year. But then once we get to Q2 and the balance of the year, we think that will be more normal. And as a result of what happened in 2022, the fourth quarter is going to be an easy comp for 2023.\nDavid MacGregor: Excluding that \u2013 sorry, go ahead.\nChris Koch: No, go head, David.\nDavid MacGregor: No, I was just going to ask, do you think excluding that sort of the reconciliation of the pre-buy and the weather that you were closer to that kind of 15% down sequential pattern that would be sort of the typical seasonality, I\u2019m just trying to quantify some of this.\nChris Koch: Yes, David, I\u2019m going to jump in here just because I think what Kevin said is important, and I just want to make sure we recognize. We look at what CCM organic growth was probably prior to 2020, which was in COVID hit, right, Feb 2020, I\u2019d say, or March of 2020. We\u2019ve been tracking to that mid-to-high single digits, and it had been going there. And I think we\u2019ve always said new construction in the two, three, four and reroofing in the four, five, six or something like that seven. And it held pretty much there, and I\u2019m talking organic. In 2020, we were down 7.5% and then we were up almost 22% and then 22% up 37% in organic growth. So I think when we look at those numbers, we kind of know if the long-term trend in these underlying fundamentals, which are super strong and have been very consistent with CCM for a long time, are going to kind of repeat themselves. There had to be some, I guess, reversion to the mean. And I think that\u2019s what was working it out in Q4. And I think that\u2019s why Kevin made that statement of what\u2019s normal. And I don\u2019t really know that we\u2019re going to be able to pick apart with what I just told you and make any real sense of it because when you think how many contractors and distributors that we interface with and you think of what the variability might be in each region, and in each location with what they could carry on inventory and how quick they\u2019re going to get out of that. It just gets super complicated. So I know that doesn\u2019t help you, but I think what Jim and Kevin are trying to say is just as we move into 2023, we\u2019re getting back to that pre-COVID cadence, it\u2019s a strong cadence. It\u2019s got great growth on the underlying demand with leverage. And really, just \u2013 I just think as we come out of that, we just have to take it what these three years has been, which is just a very much an anomaly. And I think when you at the team did to manage through it, great job. But trying to parse that apart, I don\u2019t think we can do it.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks, Chris. Just as a follow-up. I guess, within the guidance, you\u2019ve got Sykes in ramping here in the second quarter. Is that going to be a temporary drag to the P&L? And if so, how should we phase that over the quarters in our models?\nChris Koch: Jim?\nJim Giannakouros: Yes. No, it shouldn\u2019t be relative to how we set expectations both for top line and for the margin progression for this year, David. I will say, though, just given the correction that\u2019s taken place in the marketplace, our ability to produce if we think that the demand is going to be as strong as \u2013 if the demand is as strong as we believe it will be, our ability to service that demand only increases in the spring summer selling season with that facility fired up. So we see it more as an opportunity, not something that you should be modeling or hindering your margin progression with firing up.\nChris Koch: And David, I think Jim brings up an interesting point, which is the timing of this inventory, let\u2019s call it, correction or normalization is going to be interesting. Usually, back in pre-2020, we\u2019d see an inventory load into distribution in the April \u2013 March, April time frame as we began the bulk of the North American construction season. And if we think about this inventory normalization probably wrapping up in the first quarter. You have to ask yourself the question, well, that might mean that there is going to be less inventory in the channel going into the construction season where the high demand is there. And if we\u2019re right, which we \u2013 from every indication we have, this is going to be another good year in the commercial roofing space, then you think we start to think about how there might be some pressure for product and around availability, which obviously at Carlisle with Sikeston, with the new 16-foot TPO line and this kind of stuff, we think we\u2019re prepared to flex with that. But that does have some implications for pricing, for sure, that creates a very nice support for the pricing question asked earlier. So again, early days, Q1 really never tells us in certainly January much about how the whole year is going to go. But at this point, things do look positive.\nDavid MacGregor: Got it. Thanks very much for the detail.\nChris Koch: Yes, of course.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. MacGregor. The next question is from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman. Please proceed.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey, everybody. Maybe just starting with CCM and CWT, just kind of what you\u2019re thinking in terms of end market demand across the various verticals like commercial reroofing, new commercial roofing demand in the new res and residential R&R?\nJim Giannakouros: Yes. I mean I\u2019ll start with the high level, Adam, as far as new resi. I mean, when you split \u2013 I\u2019ll start with CWT, right, each exposure, repair and remodel and new in both res and non-res, each about a quarter of the exposure there. Obviously, on the new residential side, we have to think that 20% to 30% down is a potential. The backdrop for demand in that end market. On the repair and remodel, obviously, we have a mix of discretionary and non-discretionary. So it shouldn\u2019t be that bad at all. It should be potentially flat to maybe slightly down \u2013 excuse me. And then on the commercial side, I would think just think low single digits both on the new and repair remodel, commercial, we think is going to be a strong end market for us. So that\u2019s the CWT basket, if you will. For CCM, hard to have that discussion without pointing out that 70% of what we sell CCM is reroofing. And that demand, we think we have tailwinds not only for 2023, but certainly for the next decade.\nAdam Baumgarten: Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then just maybe the step-up in CapEx, what\u2019s kind of driving that? Is it just timing? Or is there something across some of the businesses that we\u2019re investing.\nKevin Zdimal: Certainly, with Sykes then coming on in 2023, that will be a big piece of it. And outside of that, as you say, just really a normal step up with growth of our business and continuing to invest organically into our businesses. That\u2019s been our highest ROIC type investments.\nAdam Baumgarten: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Baumgarten. Our last question is from the line of John Joyner with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nJohn Joyner: Hey, Thank you. So I guess, I don\u2019t know, like a lot has been asked, but \u2013 so just looking at the segment outlook, right? I want to figure that the assumptions around CCM would have been closed or probably the single-digit range. And maybe following up on, I believe it was Dan, who asked this question about the first quarter. I mean, based on the guidance for CCM, it pretty clearly implies that the first quarter is down. And with regard to, I guess, the growth being half price at volume, how does the, I guess, significant amount of pricing that was put through over the past year, not carry over more than what is implied?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes, it\u2019s going to be on the volume side. Certainly, the price will carry over into the first quarter and throughout the year, but the volume is a bigger challenge, and that\u2019s a few different pieces. One, the weather in the fourth quarter actually impacts the first quarter because the inventory didn\u2019t get out of the channel as we got to the end of 2022, we were expecting that to be out and not be an issue going into 2023, but weather slowed that down, so that\u2019s going to impact the first quarter. And then also with the weather in January, that\u2019s impacted volume in the first quarter for CCM as well as CWT. CWT actually benefited from some of the rain and some of that piece in California. That\u2019s been a pickup there. But sticking with CCM, the other piece that we discussed earlier in the call is the year-over-year comp is a challenge because 2022 was a much higher first quarter than the historical trend that we\u2019ve been talking about.\nJohn Joyner: Okay. Thank you. And then maybe just one more, just a follow-up on the Duralast, so which would no doubt has been \u2013 I think a home for Carlisle synergistically. But regardless of the competitive landscape, you certainly know the company and presumably did the due diligence on it. So I guess, what do you think about the prices being paid by wholesome?\nChris Koch: Well, the first thing we talk about can extract the value and every decision, every company, they have to make the decision for their company. I don\u2019t know what their synergies were or how they\u2019re going to integrate, how much they\u2019re going to integrate, whether they keep the team alone, whether they seek to get that or whether they even bring in things like pricing. So I can\u2019t really comment on whether the pricing is good or not. I mean they\u2019ll have to decide that, and we\u2019ll see that in their numbers like we would at Carlisle. But what\u2019s good for, I think, the industry is it\u2019s demonstrating that the companies in this space, certainly Carlisle, you can see our margins some are private may have been undervalued in the last few years. And it\u2019s a very good space, North America to be in with good underlying demand. The ESG trends are positive for all of us. We have great products that many can be recycled and just a great contribution. We\u2019ve got the IRA act that came out in the Biden administration. We\u2019ve got reshoring. And I think the price is being paid for things like Firestone to Malarkey and now Duralast reflect a lot of confidence by people in this framework for the next five to 10 years. And I think that\u2019s good for Carlisle. I think that\u2019s also good for our investors. It sends a really good signal about that. And I think you can look at multiples then and say are the public traded companies trading at those kind of multiples. And if not, they\u2019re probably trading at a discount based upon what we see in the market. So I think overall, yes, it\u2019s good for all of us.\nJohn Joyner: Okay. Excellent.

            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. I'd like to begin by reiterating that Carlisle has had a century-long legacy of responsible stewardship and stakeholder focus, all driven by our core cultural value of continuous improvement. We believe that creating a more sustainable environment is also productive for our shareholders. As an organization, Carlisle is committed to being a responsible environmental stakeholder with our three pillars of environmental sustainability. First, develop energy-efficient products and solutions to reduce the greenhouse gas, or GHG emissions, from building operations and help lower operating costs for our customers. In 2022, Carlisle sold $3.5 billion of LEED certified products and solutions, up from $2.5 billion in 2021. Second, reduced material weights going into landfills. Our history of recycling began in the 1920s when we incorporated scrap rubber into our inner-tube production. Today, we continue that tradition by upcycling polyiso waste into water filtration products. Carlisle has had a century long commitment to reduce material waste and continually improve our processes to deliver shareholder value while improving the environment for the communities in which we operate. And third, a focus on lowering the GHG emissions of our operations and manufacturing processes with the implementation of enhanced energy conservation measures such as converting our factory forklift fleet from propane to electric. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Carlisle probably took a significant step to achieving Net-Zero GHG emissions in our value chain by 2050. To accomplish this Net-Zero state, we proposed near-term GHG reduction targets through the science-based targets initiative. The site-based targets initiative is an independent body based in the U.K. that works in conjunction with United Nations to help guide companies to establish emission reductions initiatives using science-based targets. Our near-term 2030 GHG reduction targets are: first, to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 38%; and second, reduce scope 3 GHG emissions by 48% per pound produced. While our focus on emissions, waste reduction and sustainable products are a key part of our sustainability efforts, we also made a significant commitment to the social component of our ESG progress. On October 17, 2022, we proudly announced a special stock option grant to all eligible U.S. employees and a cash award to all eligible employees outside the U.S. These awards are designed to allow all Carlisle employees to participate in Carlisle's success as stakeholders. Previous grants issued in 2009 and 2018, generated significant returns for our employees based in no small part on their contribution to increasing shareholder value. Additionally, our path to zero program, which represents Carlisle's commitment to creating the safest possible work environment, continues to be a source of pride for our organization. In 2022, Carlisle's OSHA Incident Rate was a remarkable 0.67, significantly below the industry average of over 3 and that represents a 69% decline in workplace incidents since 2014. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details as well as our 2023 outlook. Kevin?"

            "name": "Chris Koch",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Please turn to Slide 3. Let me begin my commentary by complementing the entire Carlisle team on the sales and earnings records set in the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022. 2022 truly was an exceptional year. In addition to delivering record fourth quarter sales of $1.5 billion, we also delivered record annual sales of $6.6 billion, surpassing both the $5 billion and $6 billion marks in sales for the first time in Carlisle's 105-year history. We further delivered a record adjusted diluted EPS of $3.92 in the quarter, an increase of 34% year-over-year. 2022 also marked a key milestone in our Vision 2025 journey as we delivered $17.58 of GAAP EPS for the year, exceeding our primary Vision 2025 goal of generating $15 of GAAP EPS for our shareholders. Exceeding this goal three years early is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all of Carlisle's employees and to their commitment to the work of Vision 2025. These record results are even more remarkable given the extremely challenging operating environment of the past few years. Of the many challenges we faced over this period, I would say navigating the COVID pandemic was the most unexpected challenge. For so many people, the pandemic was a traumatic experience in their lives from a health and welfare, social and economic perspective. I'm grateful for the significant actions Carlisle employees took to keep us all as safe as possible while navigating COVID in their personal life as well. In addition, we also experienced significant supply chain disruptions and inflationary environment and labor and material shortages. Our record results would not have been possible without the clarity of mission that Vision 2025 has provided us since its launch in 2018, and the unwavering commitment of our teams. Guided by Vision 2025, our teams remained unified and stayed the course for the past five years, diligently overcoming the challenges we faced. Please turn to Slide 4. Our record results continue to demonstrate that Vision 2025 has been the right strategy for Carlisle. In addition to our world-class teams and proven business model, we've benefited from a strong balance sheet, an excellent cash flow generation to provide both financial and strategic flexibility to execute and achieve our ambitious goals. A significant portion of our success has been driven by the multiyear process of reshaping our portfolio to pivot from a diversified industrial products company to a higher returning building products portfolio of businesses. This transformation sets the stage for a more focused, simplified and better understood path for future sustainable value creation at Carlisle. The pillars of Vision 2025 remain core to our strategy going forward. These include: first, drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 6.6% organic revenue growth, which helped drive organic growth of 29% for the full year 2022. Notably, all four segments contributed to this growth. Second, utilize the Carlisle Operating System, or COS, to drive continuous improvement. We use COS to consistently drive efficiencies and enhance operating leverage. For the full year 2022, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded nicely and COS contributed to that. We continue to target COS savings of 1% to 2% of annual sales. Third, build scale with synergistic accretive acquisitions. Under Vision 2025, we have streamlined and optimized our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to build scale in our highest returning building products businesses and to broaden our suite of energy-efficient solutions. Through 2022, we have invested over $3 billion in accretive acquisitions. And fourth, a returns-focused capital allocation strategy that includes deploying over $3 billion into capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends. Since the launch of Vision 2025, we have invested over $3 billion into these areas of capital allocation, also three years ahead of our original plan. In 2022, we made capital investments of over $184 million into our businesses to drive innovation, increase operational efficiencies and enhance the Carlisle experience. We also returned over $500 million to shareholders with share repurchases totaling $400 million and $134 million paid in dividends in 2022. And of course, none of this would be possible without continuing to invest in and develop exceptional talent. Through the accelerated execution of Vision 2025, Carlisle has built a solid foundation, leveraging a diversified workplace, decentralized management style, entrepreneurial spirit and a culture of continuous improvement, which will continue to guide our value creation journey in 2023 and beyond. Turning to Slide 5. I'd like to highlight some of the many accomplishments in the fourth quarter. First, collectively, our building products segment now constituting over 80% of Carlisle total sales delivered record fourth quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA. Second, we are pleased with the ongoing integration efforts at our newest segment, CWT. The team continues to effectively capture the projected synergies from the Henry acquisition of $30 million, while focusing on delivering excellent customer service in a challenging environment. This commitment to our channel partners and customers was recognized when Henry was awarded to Home Depot's Building Materials Vendor of the Year Award in October. Third, we continued the introduction of our innovative labor-saving 16-foot TPO product to the market, which is manufactured on the industry's latest and most technologically advanced TPO line in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. As a reminder, we began shipping this product in the third quarter of 2022. Additionally, construction of our state-of-the-art polyiso facility in Sikeston, Missouri is on track for completion in the second quarter and on track to achieve LEED Platinum certification, the highest level of commercial building energy-efficient standards. Fourth, pricing remained and continues to be positive across all segments as we continue to demonstrate our value to our customers. Fifth, supply chain and material availability returned to a more normal state. This return to normal has enabled our channel partners to settle back into more of a historical buying cadence. And finally, global aerospace markets continue their recovery, driving strong sales and backlogs at CIT and increased profitability on the back of the significant restructuring actions taken by the CIT team over the past few years. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave Smith, our Vice President of Sustainability, for an update on our ESG progress. Dave? Thanks, Kevin. In closing, I once again would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the hard work and perseverance of all of Carlisle's employees. The accomplishments the team has achieved since the launch of Vision 2025 are remarkable and were done under some of the most challenging conditions industry has faced in over a decade. I think we can all look back on 2022 and be proud of an outstanding year. As we move through 2023 and with Vision 2025 objectives well ingrained throughout Carlisle, I am optimistic for the year ahead. We will take actions to navigate this complex operating environment, deliver the Carlisle experience to our customers, drive earnings growth for our shareholders and strive to deliver another record year. And that will conclude our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Hey, good afternoon, Bryan. All right, Bryan. That's \u2013 there's a lot in there. So let me just first say that we do see some of the inventory normalization going into Q1 when we had originally thought it would probably be down by the end of the year. Some of that has to do with weather. Some of that has to do with economic impact to interest rates and things like that. But overall, as we go into the year, we still see commercial roofing strong. We think it's going to be a good year in 2023. We do have some comps in Q1 that are, I would say, fairly large, but nothing really happening there on the demand side. Re-roofing continues to be strong. I think some modulation, I think in the future, maybe on new construction. But we've been out talking to a lot of contractors, a lot of distributors. We do see, for sure, it's real, this inventory normalization. We see it continuing. I think people have hinted that. But the underlying demand is still good. And I'll turn it to Jim, just to give you a little more granularity on the demand and the order. Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Hi, Tim. Yes, Tim, we \u2013 pricing is remaining firm. I think we talked about it at your conference. We continue to see great stability in the industry, people pricing to value, no degradation. We talked about, I think earlier about how the price increases that we put in the latter half of 2022 would continue on into 2023 and be accretive in 2023, and we're seeing that happen just as we expected, no real deviation there. There have been some \u2013 hence, yes, we know from people hints \u2013 but questions from people, but we're really not seeing it. Fourth quarter was consistent on what we expect at the price, no degradation going into the year, we don't see that. And we really don't see any motivation coming from either contractors or distributors to participate in that. There's still a premium on delivery. We still have labor constraints. And so as we go into 2023, we would expect pricing to be accretive and to have a gain based upon that lapping of the price increases that we put later in 2022, so nothing's changed. Yes. And the raw materials, as we look at it throughout the year, early in the year, first quarter, we're not going to see much of the benefit, but as we get into the summer months, we expect to have some tailwinds there on the raw material costs and throughout the balance of the year. Yes. We still see, I think 2023 as a strong year. There may be a little modulation in new. We did have a really strong, I would say, bias to new construction when we were in 2022 and coming out of COVID, Garik. And I think what's happening is we're seeing the re-roofing pickup as a larger part of the sales in 2023. We would have expected that. I think Jim may have indicated that in previous quarters how as that may modulate a little bit re-roofing would pick up because of the backlog there. And I think we've shared our charts with you about how we see re-roofing playing out over the next five years to seven years. So as we came out of COVID and the delay on new construction there, I think new picked up. And obviously, it's easier, I think, to delay re-roofing a little bit than it is to delay a new project that it was under way and COVID experienced delays due to the governmental restrictions on the job sites and things that were happening back then. So still see a positive year, still see a good scenario for new. And then I think really what starts to happen is as we get through 2023, we're going to have to look at what happens from the Fed, what happens with other things in the economy on a macro level to really start wondering if it's going to have a dramatic change into 2024. Now through that whole thing, we still see underlying demand is positive for re-roofing and other things. So yes, 2023 should still remain good. Well, we don't normally get to that granularity on the call around mix. I would say when we look at CCM across the Board, EPDM, TPO, PVC, polyiso, really, with the exception of the last year where we've seen the raw material availability and then the supply availability and some different ordering patterns. For the most part, they've been very stable. EPDM has been a steady low-single digit grower. TPO continues to be a product that gains momentum. And obviously, polyiso with the ESG and efficiencies that are becoming now regulations and people wanting to higher our values on their roof. We're seeing yes, polyiso continues as it has through the years to gain as a percentage of the job site. We're still putting on maybe a square of TPO. But underneath that, we could be now putting on two, three, four layers of polyiso, and I think that will continue to gain momentum. And then on the PVC side, our team has done a great job on PVC. We think it's a nice product. It's been relatively new to Carlisle. A few years ago, we opened up our plant in Greenville. And so polyiso or PVC has continued to gain some market share and had, again, good growth in the fourth quarter and in 2022 overall. So I don't really think the mix will change much. When you look at our metals business, it's pretty consistent there. Petersen and Drexel, the two acquisitions continue to grow at an expected rate and remain about the same percentage. CWT gets a little bit different because the businesses get a little bit smaller, but we continue to see nice improvement with Henry. They continue to have pretty good success in the retail channels and R&R. We think R&R should pick up in 2023. And then spray foam to the Accella acquisition that had a few years ago, it was a little bit lower mix, but we've done some nice things there with that group to continue to drive, I would say, market or above rates, and there were some \u2013 I think when we did that deal, we were talking about 8% as a market growth rate there, and so they continue to grow. But then you get into some smaller businesses. And as you saw with the public announcement on [indiscernible] side of our rubber business, we did exit that. And so obviously, that changes a little bit of the mix, but it's not much. So try to give you some granularity there. But overall, mix pretty much stays the same that for the company and hopefully, that helps you. You bet. Thanks, Garik. Dan, I think we don't want to \u2013 obviously, we don't like to share too much because of competition. But just try to give you a little color. I think if we look at that number, we'd split it. We'd probably say the low-single digits. We take half in price and half in volume. So that could fluctuate a little bit. I happen to think that we're seeing a little bit better start to the year. So could see a little bit more volume. But I think it's a good place to just say split it 50-50. No. I think we've been pretty consistent about our allocation of capital, especially into share repurchases. And we still tend to look at our intrinsic value, and then we do some work around that to see where we end up and then we compare it to other places where you can allocate capital. And I'd say we should be in that same level for 2023 that we were for 2022. When you look at the year as a whole, obviously, it's going to maybe vary by quarter, but I think what we did in 2022 is probably a good starting point for what we'll do in 2023. Yes. Saree, I would also say, Chris here, that COS, we buy an organization, especially the magnitude of Henry, and we roll COS out. It typically tends to be very well received. And I think Frank Ready and the team at Henry have embraced COS. And so we think we've got some upside there because they're in the early innings of that lean sigma rollout, so that should help. And then obviously, we are applying \u2013 with a longer-term view that Carlisle has, we're applying a little bit more focus on automation and capital investment in our factories, so we should get some efficiency there. And then we also had some portfolio action in there, and we talked about that rubber business, which actually was taking away from margin in 2022. And with that out of the mix, that will boost that margin up. So when you look at those things altogether, it gives us quite a few vectors to work on and also see some nice returns. Yes. It's for us, it's an interesting situation. I believe they bought Malarkey earlier, and that's a residential shingle organization doesn't affect us too much. I mean I can't really think that impacts our commercial roofing business or CWT business. And now this acquisition of Duralast, great company. We know Duralast very well. They have a great product, but they're really not a competitor to us in our commercial roofing space. They really deal, I would say, in a kind of a smaller square foot size and maybe in some different segments that we compete in. So that's a great business, great family business. And so they'll \u2013 I'm sure they'll do well with that. But the impact on it should be minimal. I think going forward, we would obviously \u2013 they're stated they want to grow in North America. And obviously, Carlisle wants to grow in North America, and we're acquisitive, and they want to be acquisitive. So I would imagine we will run into that team again as assets come up on the horizon. Thank you very much. No, go head, David. Yes, David, I'm going to jump in here just because I think what Kevin said is important, and I just want to make sure we recognize. We look at what CCM organic growth was probably prior to 2020, which was in COVID hit, right, Feb 2020, I'd say, or March of 2020. We've been tracking to that mid-to-high single digits, and it had been going there. And I think we've always said new construction in the two, three, four and reroofing in the four, five, six or something like that seven. And it held pretty much there, and I'm talking organic. In 2020, we were down 7.5% and then we were up almost 22% and then 22% up 37% in organic growth. So I think when we look at those numbers, we kind of know if the long-term trend in these underlying fundamentals, which are super strong and have been very consistent with CCM for a long time, are going to kind of repeat themselves. There had to be some, I guess, reversion to the mean. And I think that's what was working it out in Q4. And I think that's why Kevin made that statement of what's normal. And I don't really know that we're going to be able to pick apart with what I just told you and make any real sense of it because when you think how many contractors and distributors that we interface with and you think of what the variability might be in each region, and in each location with what they could carry on inventory and how quick they're going to get out of that. It just gets super complicated. So I know that doesn't help you, but I think what Jim and Kevin are trying to say is just as we move into 2023, we're getting back to that pre-COVID cadence, it's a strong cadence. It's got great growth on the underlying demand with leverage. And really, just \u2013 I just think as we come out of that, we just have to take it what these three years has been, which is just a very much an anomaly. And I think when you at the team did to manage through it, great job. But trying to parse that apart, I don't think we can do it. Jim? And David, I think Jim brings up an interesting point, which is the timing of this inventory, let's call it, correction or normalization is going to be interesting. Usually, back in pre-2020, we'd see an inventory load into distribution in the April \u2013 March, April time frame as we began the bulk of the North American construction season. And if we think about this inventory normalization probably wrapping up in the first quarter. You have to ask yourself the question, well, that might mean that there is going to be less inventory in the channel going into the construction season where the high demand is there. And if we're right, which we \u2013 from every indication we have, this is going to be another good year in the commercial roofing space, then you think we start to think about how there might be some pressure for product and around availability, which obviously at Carlisle with Sikeston, with the new 16-foot TPO line and this kind of stuff, we think we're prepared to flex with that. But that does have some implications for pricing, for sure, that creates a very nice support for the pricing question asked earlier. So again, early days, Q1 really never tells us in certainly January much about how the whole year is going to go. But at this point, things do look positive. Yes, of course. Well, the first thing we talk about can extract the value and every decision, every company, they have to make the decision for their company. I don't know what their synergies were or how they're going to integrate, how much they're going to integrate, whether they keep the team alone, whether they seek to get that or whether they even bring in things like pricing. So I can't really comment on whether the pricing is good or not. I mean they'll have to decide that, and we'll see that in their numbers like we would at Carlisle. But what's good for, I think, the industry is it's demonstrating that the companies in this space, certainly Carlisle, you can see our margins some are private may have been undervalued in the last few years. And it's a very good space, North America to be in with good underlying demand. The ESG trends are positive for all of us. We have great products that many can be recycled and just a great contribution. We've got the IRA act that came out in the Biden administration. We've got reshoring. And I think the price is being paid for things like Firestone to Malarkey and now Duralast reflect a lot of confidence by people in this framework for the next five to 10 years. And I think that's good for Carlisle. I think that's also good for our investors. It sends a really good signal about that. And I think you can look at multiples then and say are the public traded companies trading at those kind of multiples. And if not, they're probably trading at a discount based upon what we see in the market. So I think overall, yes, it's good for all of us. You bet, John. Well, thanks, Hannah. This does conclude our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. I appreciate everyone for the questions. Thanks for your participation, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call. Thanks."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Before turning to segment results, let's turn to our overall 2022 fourth quarter results on Slide 7. The fourth quarter played out much as we anticipated and communicated on our last earnings call. As Chris mentioned, the Carlisle team delivered a very strong fourth quarter despite the many challenges we faced. Fourth quarter revenues increased 6.6% organically, driven primarily by positive pricing across all segments. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin improved 280 basis points, driven by efficiencies gained through COS and our ability to price to value. Revenues, adjusted EBITDA and EPS were all fourth quarter records for Carlisle. For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 8. CCM delivered revenues of $800 million, up 3% organically. This performance was driven by positive price more than offsetting year-over-year volume declines given current normalization of buying patterns by our customers in severe weather in December in much of the U.S. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.5%, a record performance in the fourth quarter by our CCM team was driven by price and COS and partially offset by raw material and labor inflation unfavorable mix and a reduction in volume. Moving to Slide 9. Sales at Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies increased 5.5% organically. This growth was achieved despite ongoing supply constraints and softness in residential demand. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.8%. The team continues to focus on the integration of Henry, the $30 million of stated synergies from the acquisition and rolling out COS throughout CWT to drive greater efficiencies in our operations. Moving to Slide 10. CIT revenue increased 22% organically in the fourth quarter of 2022 with balanced growth in our commercial aerospace and medical technology platforms. We continue to see domestic travel approach pre-pandemic levels, strong backlogs and growth in our medical new product pipeline. As a result, CIT is well positioned for continued revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion in 2023. Turning to CFT on Slide 11. CFT generated organic revenue growth of 11.3%, driven by positive pricing and favorable volume, partially offset by a 7% year-over-year foreign exchange headwind. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded more than 400 basis points to 22.1%, driven by favorable volume, price and efficiencies gained from COS. Slides 12 and 13 provide details of our record fourth quarter consolidated results for revenue and adjusted EPS. Moving to Slides 14 and 15. Carlisle ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with $400 million of cash on hand and $1 billion availability under our revolving credit facility. We generated cash flow from continuing operations of $418 million, bringing our full year 2022 total to $1 billion. Turning to Slide 16. We have our 2023 financial outlook. Despite a challenging first quarter, we expect to deliver another record year in 2023 with full year consolidated revenue up low single digits. The first quarter will be a challenge as a result of tough comps for CCM, the weather disruptions that we have already seen as well as the continued normalization of buying patterns in the channel. Residential exposure represents a significant headwind for CWT in 2023, also weighing on our consolidated revenue growth outlook. While smaller contributors to consolidated results, healthy backlogs in both CIT and CFT give us confidence in their ability to each grow revenue high-single digits in 2023. Given our focus on disciplined pricing, operational efficiency and managing costs through our continuous improvement efforts, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins to expand 100 basis points year-over-year. In November, we gave a preliminary view of 2023, stating we expect to drive adjusted EPS growth this year. With non-residential re-roofing demand remaining strong, continued pricing discipline and an unending focus on manufacturing efficiencies, we reiterate this view and are driving towards another record year for Carlisle. With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. Right. This is Kevin. And yes, on that piece of the revenue throughout the year, we don't break it down too much by quarter, but we would say that our first quarter typically is about 20% of our full year revenue for CCM. This year based on our low-single digit guide, we would say our Q1 would be high teens as a percent of the total year. Yes. We don't get into too much on the segments. I'm breaking down exactly what the components are at the margin. But I would say, so we have said that overall consolidated will be up 100 basis points on margin, and we do see all four segments having year-over-year improvement in margin. So each of \u2013 so CCM to your point, definitely, we are seeing margin improvement, we're expecting margin improvement year-over-year. Yes. The margins \u2013 incremental, decremental margins are right around 30%. And again, we expect to see year-over-year margin improvement in this segment, despite, as you said, the doubt-digit decline in revenue. Yes. Yes. We \u2013 as far as \u2013 I mean, the biggest one will be price cost. As you look at that one, we're seeing that to be a benefit in our business for 2023 at CWT, and that's been historically, what we've seen in other cycles like this as you look back, whether it was financial crisis or back-end early 2000s, very similar that we didn't own the business at the time, the Henry business, but that's \u2013 they saw similar to what we saw in our core roofing business with those being tailwinds. Right. The biggest piece, I mean, the weather was there, but it's also just how we've talked about it in the last earnings call and this one, there's normalization of the buying patterns that what we had throughout 2022, folks were on allocation and being on allocation. People are buying what they could get their hands on. And they basically bought ahead in the first part of 2022. And that was really the biggest reason why in the fourth quarter as customers brought inventory levels down that impacted that piece. So we would not say 2022 was a normal year of seasonality. We think even bright and to go back pre-COVID and look at how those years broke out as far as quarter-by-quarter, like you're looking to do from Q3 to Q4 because as we get back to normal, a lot of that will be in play, and you can look at it that way. I pointed out what Q1 would be not normal this year. But then once we get to Q2 and the balance of the year, we think that will be more normal. And as a result of what happened in 2022, the fourth quarter is going to be an easy comp for 2023. Certainly, with Sykes then coming on in 2023, that will be a big piece of it. And outside of that, as you say, just really a normal step up with growth of our business and continuing to invest organically into our businesses. That's been our highest ROIC type investments. Yes, it's going to be on the volume side. Certainly, the price will carry over into the first quarter and throughout the year, but the volume is a bigger challenge, and that's a few different pieces. One, the weather in the fourth quarter actually impacts the first quarter because the inventory didn't get out of the channel as we got to the end of 2022, we were expecting that to be out and not be an issue going into 2023, but weather slowed that down, so that's going to impact the first quarter. And then also with the weather in January, that's impacted volume in the first quarter for CCM as well as CWT. CWT actually benefited from some of the rain and some of that piece in California. That's been a pickup there. But sticking with CCM, the other piece that we discussed earlier in the call is the year-over-year comp is a challenge because 2022 was a much higher first quarter than the historical trend that we've been talking about."

At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Giannakouros, Carlisle's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jim, please go ahead. \nJim Giannakouros: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Carlisle's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We released our third quarter financial results after the market closed today and you can find both our press release and earnings call slide presentation in the Investor Relations section of our website, carlisle.com. On the call with me today are Chris Koch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Zdimal, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will begin with Chris giving an update on our progress and achieving our strategic plan, Vision 2025, highlights of our third quarter results and a discussion of current trends. Kevin will discuss the financial details and our updated outlook. Following Chris and Kevin's remarks, we will open up the line for questions. Before we begin, please refer to slide two of our presentation, where we note that comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our press release and SEC filings. As Carlisle provides non-GAAP financial information, we\u2019ve provided reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release, and in the appendix of our presentation materials, which are available on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Koch: Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2022 earnings call. The third quarter of 2022 was another superb quarter for Carlisle, as our teams across the globe continued to deliver on the Carlisle experience, utilized our continuous improvement culture to improve our processes and leveraged our position as a preferred supplier of solutions to our customers, from order entry to deliveries, to writing specifications, to the ongoing performance of our products in the Building Envelope. We also continue to see positive underlying trends, including positive multiyear re-roofing needs, solid new non-residential construction demand and increasing interest in energy-efficient solutions. Additionally, a much improved supply chain resulted in the emergence of a more orderly and normal operating environment than we have seen during the last two years. One example of this improvement is within our CWT business where we have gone from having 50-plus suppliers on our watch list to now having less than 10. While supply remains tight in many areas, we did see our customers have more confidence in the supply of our product, which drives a better and more efficient workplace and ultimately a reduction in the need for building inventory and extending lead times. As we enter the fourth quarter, despite the positive underlying trends I just mentioned, we continue to operate in a highly uncertain and volatile environment, which has really been the case since March of 2020. The continued effects of inflation and impact on the American consumer have been significant. The decision by the Fed to mitigate rising inflation with meaningful increases in interest rates has slowed the housing market due to a rapid increase in mortgage rates, which has raised borrowing costs for buyers and pushed many prospective buyers out of the market. In addition, most signs are pointing to a slowdown in US and global growth, which will likely impact jobs and investments for the near term. Coupling these factors with the coming US midterm elections and another potential 75 basis point increase by the Fed in November, there is no doubt the fourth quarter will continue to bring us volatility, uncertainty and a more cautious stance by consumers and businesses. Turning back to the performance of the quarter and a more focused eye on our work here at Carlisle, I am very pleased with the outstanding performance of our teams. They continue to show resilience and persevere in their work and have driven record year-to-date earnings to over $14 of diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis, well on our way to achieving our Vision 2025 annual EPS target of $15. Our accelerated path to achieving Vision 2025 is due to our teams' unyielding commitment to deliver the Carlisle experience and a resilient and continuous improvement culture, all the while focused on delivering results for our stakeholders. Please turn to slide three. Our record results continue to demonstrate that Vision 2025 which has provided the clarity and consistency of mission since its launch in 2018 has been a guiding beacon and well-defined path for Carlisle, particularly given extraordinary volatility in global markets over the past several years. In addition to our world-class teams and proven business model, we've relied on a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow generation to provide both financial and strategic flexibility to execute on our long-term plan and elevate the earnings power of Carlisle. A significant portion of our success has been driven by the multiyear process of reshaping our portfolio to pivot from a diversified industrial products company to a building products focus setting the stage for more focus, more simplification and a better understood path to accelerated and sustainable value creation. The pillars of Vision 2025 remain core to our strategy going forward. These include: first, drive mid single-digit organic growth. And in the third quarter, we delivered 28% organic revenue growth. Second, utilize the Carlisle Operating System or COS to drive leverage. We use COS to consistently drive efficiencies and enhance operating leverage by targeting cost savings of 1% to 2% of sales annually. In the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 75% nicely leveraging our sales growth. Third, build scale with synergistic accretive acquisitions. Under Vision 2025, we have streamlined and optimized our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to build scale in our highest returning building products businesses. CWT leadership continues to execute extremely well on delivering a smooth and efficient integration of Henry and is on pace to exceed our initial synergy targets of $30 million. The CWT team is doing an excellent job working both incremental cost synergy opportunities and seeking to drive revenue synergies given it's now a broader set of products. We remain excited about acquisition prospects within the Building Envelope and we're working in active pipeline of opportunities to broaden our suite of energy-efficient solutions. And fourth, a returns-focused capital allocation strategy that includes deploying over $3 billion into capital expenditures share repurchases and dividends. Since the launch of Vision 2025, we have deployed over $2.8 billion into these areas. Turning to our 2022 year-to-date actions, we've made capital investments of over $130 million into our businesses to drive innovation and the Carlisle Experience is exemplified by the third quarter launch of our first industry-leading 16-foot TPO line in Carlisle PA and we remain on track to deploy $175 million in capital expenditures this year. We've also made share repurchases totaling more than $200 million and paid approximately $96 million in dividends in 2022. To that point, we were very proud to raise our dividend 39% to $3 in the third quarter, which continues our 46-year trend of annual dividend increases. This 39% increase is Carlisle's largest in the past 25 years and reflects our strong sustainable financial position and confidence in continued growth of Carlisle's earnings and cash flow. While the pillars of our soon-to-be achieved Vision 2025 have proven to be sound, I want to reiterate that these are core to Carlisle. With these cultural and strategic pillars in place, we are proud of our accelerated execution of Vision 2025 and remain committed to our approach to sustainable value creation for all stakeholders. Please turn to Slide 4 and let's look at the drivers of our record performance in third quarter and year-to-date sales and earnings. First US non-residential construction demand remains strong and we are optimistic that the underlying trends will overcome well-known pressures seen in the global economy. Re-roofing demand also continues to be a reliable, significant and sustainable driver for growth and new construction still a tailwind. Notably we are on track for double-digit volume growth at CCM for the second straight year. Fortunately, material availability has improved meaningfully in the past few months and as such, we are seeing a normalization of buying patterns by our customers. Additionally, the need for energy-efficient building solutions to help mitigate rising energy costs and collectively help reduce the planet's carbon footprint will continue to be a driver. Second, pricing at all of our businesses continues to be positive as we focus on earning price for the value we create for our customers through the Carlisle Experience. Our continued and growing investment in new product innovation, world-class manufacturing capabilities and best-in-class customer service encompass the value proposition that our partners have come to rely on from Carlisle. And architects and building owners know they'll benefit from our innovative energy-efficient building solutions that the market increasingly demands. Third, residential markets are facing increased pressure due to interest rate hikes, significant inflation and at the consumer level a reduction in building products expenditures. While impactful in the short-term, we believe that longer-term fundamentals in residential markets remain attractive, given the undersupply of homes in the US and growing demand for energy-efficient building solutions, particularly given recent supporting legislation and rising energy costs. Fourth, aerospace markets continue their recovery, driving record backlogs at CIT and increased profitability on the back of restructuring actions taken over the past few years. We're very optimistic about the prospects for continued recovery in the aerospace markets, supported by a shortage of aircraft, which has caused the US airlines to cut back on flights as they struggle to cope with the rebound in passenger travel both domestic and international. Finally, we remain firmly committed to sustainability. Please turn to Slide 5. The recent publication of our third corporate sustainability report is another milestone in our ESG journey. Carlisle's three pillars of environmental sustainability, energy-efficient products and solutions, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in our manufacturing operations and the reduction of waste entering landfills are central to our efforts to achieve our sustainability goals. We also announced on October 17, a special stock option grant to all eligible employees, representing Carlisle's third broad-based stock option or cash equivalent grant to employees in the last 12 years. We believe that it is beneficial for all employees to have ownership and participate in the success of the company. This grant provides a significant incentive for the team to drive actions that will help Carlisle achieve its long-term objectives. Additionally, through the Inflation Reduction Act that was signed into law in August, the building industry can take advantage of extended and expanded incentives through energy-efficient building practices. More than $300 billion will be invested in energy and climate reform through energy tax incentives, investments in clean energy production and tax credits aimed at reducing carbon emissions. These increased incentives for US builders, installers, homeowners and commercial building owners who demonstrate reduced energy use should drive increased demand for Carlisle building products and energy-efficient solutions. Lastly, we continue to make significant strides towards aligning our greenhouse gas reduction strategy with the Science Based Targets initiative or SBTi, which defines and promotes best practices and science-based targets that help provide companies with a clearly defined path to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement goals. We are on pace to submit our alignment goals for approval by the end of 2022. Please turn to Slide 6 where we highlight our record performance in the third quarter of 2022. Revenue increased 36% year-over-year with organic revenue up 28%. All segments contributed to this record growth. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 89% year-over-year to $5.66 driven by higher volumes price Henry's contribution and COS initiatives, which more than offset inflation and supply chain disruptions. And with that I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide more detail about the businesses, additional financial details and our updated outlook for the remainder of 2022. Kevin? \nKevin Zdimal: Thank you, Chris. For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 7. CCM drove revenue growth of 39% with excellent leverage. This performance was driven by continued strong demand in US commercial roofing capturing price earned by delivering on the Carlisle Experience and new product sales, partially offset by what we consider near-term softness in our Architectural Metals business, potentially more persistent challenges in our European business due to the effects of a recession and ongoing energy crisis and unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 32.5%, a record performance in the third quarter by our CCM team was driven by volume price and COS and partially offset by raw material and labor inflation and unfavorable mix. Moving to Slide 8. Sales at CWT increased 44% year-over-year. This growth was achieved despite ongoing but improving supply constraints in pockets of incremental softness in demand, namely in residential markets. As we pass the one-year mark of our Henry acquisition the largest acquisition in Carlisle's history, we continue to execute on our synergy strategies, drive the principles of the Carlisle Experience and are in the process of rolling out COS throughout CWT to drive further leverage in our operations. Moving to slide 9, CIT revenue increased 25% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2022, with balanced growth in its Commercial Aerospace and Medical Technology platforms. We continue to see domestic travel approach pre-pandemic levels and as a result have seen CIT experienced record backlog. We expect to see continued rising demand for narrow-body aircraft and eventually wide bodies as domestic and international travel continues to recover. Leveraging these positives, our team delivered a nice lift in profitability in the third quarter versus the first half of 2022 aided by previous restructuring efforts. Turning to CFT on slide 10, CFT generated organic revenue of 10% year-over-year, partially offset by a 7% year-over-year FX headwind. With over half of CFT sales being international we expect a strong U.S. dollar to continue to be a headwind to sales growth near term but fundamentals remain intact. We remain confident that commercial and operational improvements combined with a strong backlog will deliver revenue growth and incremental margins in the mid-40% range. Slides 11 and 12 provide details about our record third quarter consolidated results for revenue and adjusted EPS. Moving to slides 13 and 14, Carlisle ended the third quarter of 2022 with $625 million of cash on hand with cash generated from continuing operations totaling $366 million capital expenditures of $48 million, share repurchases of $26 million and dividends paid of $39 million during the quarter. We currently have 4.2 million shares remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1.6 times, down from three times at the end of 2021 which as a result of the Henry acquisition was elevated compared to our target net debt-to-EBITDA range of one-time to two-times. Given the repayment of our $350 million senior notes on October 17th and our expected EBITDA growth for the balance of this year we expect to maintain our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio within this target range. On slide 15, we have our updated 2022 financial outlook. At CCM, we expect to deliver a record full year in 2022, and expect year-over-year revenue growth in the 35% to 40% range. At CWT, we continue to expect revenue to grow approximately 60% year-over-year. At CIT, we now expect revenues to exceed 20% in 2022. At CFT, we now expect mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2022 due to foreign translation headwinds. Finally, on a consolidated basis for Carlisle, despite the significant headwinds and volatility the economy has experienced in September we expect to deliver a record year in 2022 with a full year revenue growth in the 35% to 40% range. Given strong fundamentals across our businesses staying ahead of inflation with proactive pricing actions and driving strong leverage through COS we maintain our expectations for total Carlisle adjusted EBITDA margins to expand approximately 650 basis points. With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks.\nChris Koch: In closing, I want to express again how pleased I am with the hard work and perseverance of Carlisle employees. Their resilience and experience will continue to provide Carlisle with a competitive advantage as we navigate in this highly complex environment. Despite numerous macroeconomic challenges, the Carlisle team continues to deliver our culture of continuous improvement, focused on delivering solid results. Our outstanding third quarter demonstrates Carlisle's progress towards achieving our goals as laid out in Vision 2025, including delivering $15 of GAAP earnings per share three years earlier than originally contemplated. While we will be vigilant and monitor the macroeconomic environment and the drivers of each business we continue to be optimistic about the direction of Carlisle. And as Kevin mentioned we expect a record fourth quarter and a record 2022. This concludes our formal comments. We are now ready for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have from the phone lines today comes from Tim Wojs of Baird. Please go ahead when you are ready.\nTim Wojs: Yeah. Hey, guys. Good afternoon.\nChris Koch: Good afternoon, Tim.\nTim Wojs: Maybe just to, kind of, start on the market. I guess when you look at the non-residential parts of your business I mean have you seen any changes within order rates or backlogs or anything like that over the last 60 days to 90 days? And then I guess on the residential side could you kind of quantify what your exposure is on the resi side and kind of what your assumptions within that market are for the next few quarters? \nChris Koch: Yes. Tim, I'll start off and then Jim and Kevin can weigh in. And on the non-resi we really start to see things improve on the materials side as I talked about in supply chain. And in fact our MSP program which was really in the non-resi core commercial businesses that we had had to put in place due to the significant demand and the need to allocate due to lack of capacity across the industry started to unwind in September as things start to improve. And obviously when that happens people get more secure in the ability to source product. And so we started to see some changes in the buying patterns in the sense of the fact that we now could bring things in and people didn't have to look so far out. Remember when we -- I think we talked on the last call or it might have been some time in the third quarter or second quarter we mentioned that the -- we were taking orders out into 2023. So there was an extremely long view from contractors. And I think really because of the improvements in the supply chain we've started to see people get back to a more normal cadence which is a definite change. It's a good change though. On the non-resi side the mix there for Carlisle is about 85-15. When we look at the two businesses CWT, I'm thinking it's around 50-50 with the addition of Henry there. And then on the CCM side, we're at about 90-10. So I don't know James if you want to add anything to that? \nJim Giannakouros: Yes. Just as a reminder too on the fourth quarter piece as we normalize that's compared to last year where things were not normal and we had a very busy fourth quarter last year. So seasonality will start returning more to what it has been historically. \nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay. And then as you kind of get back to normal seasonality I mean does that have any implications in terms of kind of how you guys have kind of moved to a pricing upon shipment type strategy, or how do you kind of think of that kind of unfolding over the next call it 12 months? \nChris Koch: Yes. Well I don't think it changes anything in pricing Tim. As we said pricing has continued to be strong.\nTim Wojs: Okay.\nChris Koch: We don't see any changes in actual pricing. I mean as far as we can see forward we did have the actions in September that were increases and we've had other actions that we're going to start to lap in 2023, but no real change in pricing. I think the only thing is that comment you mentioned the detail around at time of shipment with the MSP unwinding in that allocation process yes we'll be relaxing that and going back to more normal kind of terms and conditions for our non-residential customers. \nTim Wojs: Okay. And then one last question just on the EBITDA guidance for the year has anything really changed there? I'm just trying to -- I think, Kevin you said that it wasn't changed but there's some squiggly lines and pluses and things. I'm just trying to understand if that changed at all?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. We remain confident on the year-over-year improvement of 650 basis points. So no change from the previous guidance there. \nTim Wojs: Okay. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Bryan Blair of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBryan Blair: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.\nChris Koch: Hey, good afternoon, Bryan.\nBryan Blair: I was hoping you could parse out -- quantify if possible the top line and margin impact of the headwinds in Architectural Metals and Europe in Q3, or I guess equivalently isolate US commercial roofing performance in the quarter. Just curious how Q3 looked relative to Q2 for the core single-ply business?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. So we don't break out the individual business units within the segments. Overall, obviously, though the third quarter for CCM and core roofing is the majority of that segment. I mean we had significant improvement year-over-year over 750 basis points improvement for the quarter.\nChris Koch: Yes. And I think it's safe to say Bryan that the European situation is not one that anybody would say has improved over the last quarter. I would just add that.\nBryan Blair: Okay. Fair enough. And kind of nuanced point, it was called out unfavorable mix within CCM EBITDA margin and that's obviously relative to very strong year-on-year expansion. I would think with single-ply outgrowing the other business lines that that would be inherently favorable. So within that, what is the unfavorable mix call out?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. So, we have mix on -- certainly, there's different pieces besides the membrane insulation, there's also accessories. So that's a piece of it of driving that mix change.\nBryan Blair: Okay. That's fair. And I guess any early-stage feedback you can offer on the commercial rollout of your 16-foot TPO line? I know that we are early days there but there's quite a bit of excitement around that. So just curious what you're hearing from the channel.\nChris Koch: Yes. I mean a lot of good things. We did a lot of work to understand how we handle at the job site not a problem. We have rolled it out. Obviously there's still pretty very good demand for TPO in the marketplace. The team is in the process of educating contractors, talking about how to use it on the job site people are getting used to using it. That's the rollout. But the demand certainly is there. And I think it's just a great example Bryan, I'm glad you asked it, of one of these ways that we're going to seek to maintain that Carlisle Experience and obviously the margins that come with it where we're pricing to value because that 16-foot line is taking labor off the roof. It's allowing contractors to get their jobs done faster and move on to other jobs. And we know the same things are holding true today that held true three months ago and six months ago labor is constrained. So everything we can do to get contractors to put down a high-quality Carlisle roof and then move on and get more jobs done. We know that means obviously good things for us both in terms of sales and margins. So, yes, it's going well. And obviously as with anything it takes time to spool up and get rolling.\nBryan Blair: Excellent. Appreciate the color. Thanks guys.\nChris Koch: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Loop Capital. Please go ahead when you are ready Garik.\nGarik Shmois: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the full year revenue guidance at CCM. I think you were at 40% before it's now 35% to 40%. Just to be clear was that mostly on the roofing part of the business or loosening of the allocation was a bigger component of that fine tuning of the guide on what you're seeing in Europe and in the Metals business?\nJim Giannakouros: Yes. I'll take that one Garik. It's Jim. Yes. I mean has more to do with just encapsulating what's going to happen in 4Q and reflecting the buying pattern normalization that we're seeing in the marketplace, right? And so, 40% is still in play but we thought it prudent to expand it to 35% to 40%, just because there is that the timing variance that we're seeing currently in the second half. And then obviously, as Kevin pointed out, seasonality is coming into play and we haven't had to talk about seasonality for several quarters now. \nGarik Shmois: Got it. Okay. And then just lastly just on inflation, maybe you could touch on what you're seeing there? And if any of the cost baskets have changed since the last quarter? \nChrist Koch: Yes, I'll take that. I think we look at inflation in the marketplace. And obviously it's continuing. We have had -- I think Garik as you know relatively consistent price increases now for however long dealing with those raw material -- that raw material inflation. And we've also tried to separate out the value from the cost and put that down. I think the thing we are going to see those things normalize and supply becomes more available and we mentioned the CTW reduction from 50 to 10. There is pressure now I think on the supply chain to reduce costs in general which is the intent of the Fed actions and other things is to reduce inflation and we are seeing signs of that. So, we do anticipate that really beginning here in Q4 and carrying over into 2023. \nGarik Shmois: Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead when you're ready Dan.\nDan Oppenheim: I guess wondering in terms of CIT given sort of the strong backlog in aero and medicine. Wondering sort of how do you think about the opportunity to boost margins from that in terms of strength for revenue and such what it translates into margins that you look ahead into 2023 and such? \nChrist Koch: Yes. I'll just take it a general thing and then Jim can -- or Kevin can give a little more specific but I think it's very positive for CIT moving forward. I mean one of the biggest issues for us has been right getting back -- getting these planes certified and back up and flying. We know the demand is there. We know that the restructuring actions that CIT has taken over the last two years are taking effect. But one of the big issues for us is the production of say the 787. That's been a significant contributor on the sales and profitability line. And obviously with that plane not delivering the type of output from Boeing that we've seen in the past that mix is suppressing margin. So, I would anticipate as we roll into 2023 that we'll get some of that 787 mix back is that plane -- and I'm optimistic for that, but I believe this will happen. We'll be back certified and flying and they'll be producing at a good rate and that should change the mix and enhance the profitability as well. So, obviously volume. They've done a good job on price. They've taken restructuring actions. And then we get back to a more normal mix. And I think 2023 looks pretty good for CIT. \nDan Oppenheim: Great. And I guess then secondly just wondering given the comments about sort of the optimism about non-res sort of overcoming some of the recent pressure. That's more sort of an expectation over time rather than I guess wondering if there's anything you've seen more recently that sort of would reinforce that in terms of improvement but sort of my sense would be that's more sort of weakness the quarter went on but just curious if there is anything that sort of supports the optimism right now? \nChrist Koch: Yes. We think contractors are busy. I talked about labor constraints. We also look at ABI. We look at Dodge. We look at the reports that we see. One data point we're seeing now basically nine months of contracted backlog. I think we were at seven or eight when we came into 2022. So, that's a positive. I think this thing in the first quarter really is we had the big dip in the spring of 2020 where COVID hit, we then progressed through that, came back with some pretty high demand. And obviously, as we got back to work and we see this everywhere we see people coming back into the workplace, we see going back to football games and all this stuff. We see this return to normalization. And obviously there's going to be a period where some of that gets balanced out. And that's what I think we're seeing in the fourth quarter. So, the underlying demand in the contractor work and obviously we've talked about re-roofing being a big driver for Carlisle over time. And none of that re-roofing slowed up while we were pursuing a lot of new construction in 2022 and 2021. So, yes I think -- I don't think really anything has changed on the demand side and we're just having this kind of I guess return to normalization that everyone is seeing and working through it in the fourth quarter.\nDan Oppenheim: Great. Thank you.\nChrist Koch: Yes.\nOperator: We now have John Joyner of BMO. Please go ahead when you\u2019re ready.\nJohn Joyner: Hi, good afternoon. Congrats on another good quarter. So -- and my guess is, that you would actually welcome some normalization and ultimately getting away from carrying, I guess such a large backlog. But -- and maybe you mentioned this, but how much visibility do you have going into next year? And then kind of in the same vein, how do you see the delta between the price increases that you've been put -- that you put in place versus oil prices that have moderated, but kind of stabilized at this roughly oil level? \nChris Koch: John, I'll let Jim, talk about visibility and I think he's going to have some favorable comments there. But on that oil -- that we've done I think we've said this before and I don't think we've done it in the last couple of years, because of what we've been through. But we did a lot of work on the correlation between oil and actually, the end products that we buy from suppliers. And while it can be I guess, a general guide in what can be happening we don't see a lot of connectivity or correlation. It actually was pretty low surprisingly when we looked at it. Due to some of the processing, and when we're cracking something depending on what demand is in other -- in the automotive industry or things like that for different parts of the petroleum distillate that we're buying. So, I don't think the oil pricing is going to have as big an impact, as maybe the general indicator of oil pricing in the economy. I think what's more important is to really look at what's happening in places like the Port of Long Beach, with trucking with statements like CWT coming from 50-plus suppliers on a watch list to 10, and our ability to access product and be more normal there. I think, it's just when people can plan more rationally and can level all their factories, and can plan for shipping on time. And these things tend to decrease, the extra cost for labor, it decreases the extra cost for overtime, freight things like that. So yes, I would just say, I don't think that oil is going to be a big driver on that price. Jim, do you want to handle the demand? \nJim Giannakouros: Yes, John. So, yes as far as the visibility obviously, we tie our view on -- it's tied to demand what our contractors asking for, and that nine months of backlog that Chris alluded to I mean that is what we focus on, right? And so when you come into a year, we thought we were going to grow 5% to 10% volumes this year. We're coming in at the high end of that if not in excess of that for the year. It's directly tied to that customer demand. And so when you think about going into 2023, similar view as far as the visibility. The visibility doesn't really extend beyond the summer. But certainly, as we are in this period of adjustment in normalizing buying patterns, the view going into 2023 is still volume strength, but that's basically where we kind of hang our hat on what we think volumes are going to be in the coming quarters. \nJohn Joyner: Okay. Got it. Got it. And maybe just one more. So, I mean after recently seen your 16-foot wide TPO membrane line in the innovation center there in Carlisle, I mean I think many people would be surprised honestly, by the advancements in roofing and related products that are occurring. So I guess, what are some of the other products that maybe target labor savings or other areas that maybe you could highlight that, you're excited about and that could be ultimately additive to organic growth? \nChris Koch: Sure. I think you look at a couple of them that came out recently that I'm still excited, about and I guess, they're recent enough that we can talk about them and the impact obviously, margin to sales is we've talked about our APEEL product. I still think that's a great one. We're adding that a clear layer of product on to the TPO sheet. And when we're done with the job, people are peeling it away and having an exceptionally clean brand-new roof with none of the traffic on it, where before you would have had people walking on dirt things like this, and then you'd have to bring pressure washing equipment up, you'd have to haul it up on the roof you risk puncturing the roof with the equipment, you've got people cleaning it water flowing up. And it just all takes time and it takes labor, and we don't have either one of those. We want our contractors moving onto the next job, not washing the previous job and using that labor to play more TPO, EPDM and PVC membranes. So I like that one. I -- we've had a lot of good response too on our VELCRO systems. Believe it or not, they are incredibly robust and we've seen that in some of the recent weather events that they performed very well. And that's one that takes out some of the adhesives and other things and saves time, and still produces a great membrane and adherence that we can use in a variety of situations. So I kind of like the innovation there. I think it's all really around that idea that we've got to get this labor force working more efficiently for our contractors. And so I think when you look out and you look at what are things our teams are working on you're going to see things like that. It's going to be mostly evolutionary, which I get excited about. I mean we are working on longer-term revolutionary things, like new membranes in that. But I think the real power for us comes in connecting with the contractor, understanding the voice of that customer, and for products just getting the job done with better quality, faster so they can go on, be assured of a high-quality warranty roof that they could pass on to the building owner, and it's going to last have confidence in that and then get on to other jobs and get them done faster. So I'm glad you visited that. I think it is amazing. When you look within the factory there are things that are going to help us with really creating more capacity in the space we have with ideas around the Internet of Things better and more robust sensing on pieces of equipment to produce a higher-quality product with less defects and things like that. So, all the way around it benefits us. And then you didn't mention this, but the Carlisle Experience and the customer experience, we're excited to have a more direct connection with the contractor through some technologies we have that hopefully will bring out in the next year or so that will help them do a better job of tracking shipments, will help them do a better job of understanding what they have ordering doing things like that creating those materials so that they can again work more efficiently and use their labor more effectively. So I'm glad you mentioned it and that's our goal and that's where you create value. And that's what we want to do is create value for everyone in the channel. That's the best interest of Carlisle. \nJohn Joyner: All right. Excellent. Yes. Thank you. Sounds exciting.\nChris Koch: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you, John. We now have Adam Baumgarten from Zelman & Associates. \nAdam Baumgarten : Hey, good afternoon everyone. Just a question on CWT maintained total revenue guidance for the year. I know last quarter you were calling for 20% organic revenue growth. Has that changed at all given the third quarter?\nKevin Zdimal: We're still in the range of that. I mean those are approximate numbers. But yes, that's what we're still striving to hit for the fourth quarter and full year.\nAdam Baumgarten : Okay. Got it. And then just on some of the residential softness in CWT that you cited just a couple things curious. Was there any difference in maybe the level of weakness between maybe the repair and remodel market or the home center market and new construction? And then as well was there any level of destocking in any of the channels during the quarter that may have impacted growth? \nChris Koch : I don't think we saw any destocking. In fact in some of our retail channels we're actually in the process of gaining shelf space and share, as we take some from other competitors. But Jim are you going to answer the -- address the first question? \nJim Giannakouros: I was just going to say that, yes, on the repair and remodel side that's more resilient on the new -- obviously, things are tightening up on the resi side right, Adam. So that's where we see the relative softness and we were seeing that through 3Q and we anticipate that will extend into 4Q. Hence Kevin is alluding to being within that range of call it that 60% total not enough for us to come off of that previous guide.\nChris Koch : And I think the other thing is we've got a pretty significant percentage of that residential homeowner that is dedicated to fixing leaks to making repairs and that kind of thing. And so I think there's some stickiness there that we'll see and maybe even some improvement as people are a little bit more restrained on their incomes. They might go to more of a Henry product to repair leaks and things like that, so.\nAdam Baumgarten : Okay. Great. Thank you.\nChris Koch : You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have the next question on the line from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead when you\u2019re ready.\nDavid MacGregor : Hey, good afternoon everyone.\nChris Koch : Good afternoon.\nDavid MacGregor : I can speak firsthand about the strength of the -- I can speak firsthand about the strength of the Henry product fixing leaks I was working on that last weekend here. I wanted to ask you about carryover pricing into 2023 in CCM and just how much of a benefit do you think 2023 pricing gets from 2022 pricing actions that carry over?\nJim Giannakouros: Yes. I mean -- this is Jim again. David. Yes, I mean if you look at the -- there were several price increases throughout the year with the last one being in early September. So if you just flatline that you could back into some math in that mid-single-digit plus tailwind into 2023, if you just flatline that and gave us that benefit throughout the throughout 2023.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. Good. Just on the CCM what can you say about the size of the jobs that you're seeing the size of the tickets? Are you seeing any meaningful change there, or are things pretty much continuing on trend? \nChris Koch: Yes, things are continuing on trend. Haven't had that called out that there's been any change in the size of the projects no. \nDavid MacGregor: Okay. Henry can you just talk about being above target in terms of your synergies and the stronger accretion and just what you think might be driving that? You mentioned a moment ago gaining share in retail. I'm guessing that's a contributing factor but anything else that you can call out? \nChris Koch: Yes, I think the teams did a good job. I go back and I think this is probably one of our best acquisition integrations we ever did. I think the team look back over the past and when they went into this integration had a very good playbook. We've actually taken that playbook and we've standardized and we're using it for all of our integrations now and it was really a cooperative effort between both the Henry team coming in and the CCM team.  I think the team's worked together. I think it was very helpful that we had Frank Ready on as the leader from Henry leading his part of the integration driving that, there's a lot of accountability on it. We had a person in charge of the acquisition integration as well as some outside resources to help with those things.  So I think it was really about a good job of identifying upfront what we could really attain and being reasonable and then having a plan and vision to execute it. So I really -- I think that's the key. And a lot of the savings are coming from places that I would say are not directly volume dependent. Obviously, you have to have volume there to run your business. But when you look at back-office operations when you look at supply chain consolidation things like that, I think they were things that just were identified and it really came down to the team executing on the work they've done. So I'm super pleased with that. They are ahead of the synergies and we'll finish the year ahead of the pathway to $30 million. And then on the accretion obviously that comes in, doing the kind of things that we were counting on from the Henry team which is like having a great brand name a great relationship with some major retailers that offered them the opportunity to go in and showcase Carlisle support and the additional capital and additional resources and that that we have to enable them to take on projects to apply capital.  And I think the Henry team has done a really good job of leveraging Carlisle as well as their own position to make the case that they're one of the premium, if not the premium supplier of their type of product to these major retailers and the homeowners. So I think the only downside on that on the accretion is just this impact on the homeowner with rising interest rates and people having to come back to normal and perhaps spending -- changing their spending habits from maybe what they were spending on in their home to now more services going out to eating things like that. But I mean there's not much I think the Henry team can do to overcome that. So... \nDavid MacGregor: Great. Thanks for that and congratulations.\nChris Koch: Thank you very much.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: We have no further questions on the line. So I'd like to hand it back to the team. \nChris Koch: Well thanks very much. That concludes our 2022 Q3 call. We appreciate everyone's attendance their great questions. We look forward to talking to you at the end of the fourth quarter and have a good end of the year. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Chris Koch",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2022 earnings call. The third quarter of 2022 was another superb quarter for Carlisle, as our teams across the globe continued to deliver on the Carlisle experience, utilized our continuous improvement culture to improve our processes and leveraged our position as a preferred supplier of solutions to our customers, from order entry to deliveries, to writing specifications, to the ongoing performance of our products in the Building Envelope. We also continue to see positive underlying trends, including positive multiyear re-roofing needs, solid new non-residential construction demand and increasing interest in energy-efficient solutions. Additionally, a much improved supply chain resulted in the emergence of a more orderly and normal operating environment than we have seen during the last two years. One example of this improvement is within our CWT business where we have gone from having 50-plus suppliers on our watch list to now having less than 10. While supply remains tight in many areas, we did see our customers have more confidence in the supply of our product, which drives a better and more efficient workplace and ultimately a reduction in the need for building inventory and extending lead times. As we enter the fourth quarter, despite the positive underlying trends I just mentioned, we continue to operate in a highly uncertain and volatile environment, which has really been the case since March of 2020. The continued effects of inflation and impact on the American consumer have been significant. The decision by the Fed to mitigate rising inflation with meaningful increases in interest rates has slowed the housing market due to a rapid increase in mortgage rates, which has raised borrowing costs for buyers and pushed many prospective buyers out of the market. In addition, most signs are pointing to a slowdown in US and global growth, which will likely impact jobs and investments for the near term. Coupling these factors with the coming US midterm elections and another potential 75 basis point increase by the Fed in November, there is no doubt the fourth quarter will continue to bring us volatility, uncertainty and a more cautious stance by consumers and businesses. Turning back to the performance of the quarter and a more focused eye on our work here at Carlisle, I am very pleased with the outstanding performance of our teams. They continue to show resilience and persevere in their work and have driven record year-to-date earnings to over $14 of diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis, well on our way to achieving our Vision 2025 annual EPS target of $15. Our accelerated path to achieving Vision 2025 is due to our teams' unyielding commitment to deliver the Carlisle experience and a resilient and continuous improvement culture, all the while focused on delivering results for our stakeholders. Please turn to slide three. Our record results continue to demonstrate that Vision 2025 which has provided the clarity and consistency of mission since its launch in 2018 has been a guiding beacon and well-defined path for Carlisle, particularly given extraordinary volatility in global markets over the past several years. In addition to our world-class teams and proven business model, we've relied on a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow generation to provide both financial and strategic flexibility to execute on our long-term plan and elevate the earnings power of Carlisle. A significant portion of our success has been driven by the multiyear process of reshaping our portfolio to pivot from a diversified industrial products company to a building products focus setting the stage for more focus, more simplification and a better understood path to accelerated and sustainable value creation. The pillars of Vision 2025 remain core to our strategy going forward. These include: first, drive mid single-digit organic growth. And in the third quarter, we delivered 28% organic revenue growth. Second, utilize the Carlisle Operating System or COS to drive leverage. We use COS to consistently drive efficiencies and enhance operating leverage by targeting cost savings of 1% to 2% of sales annually. In the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 75% nicely leveraging our sales growth. Third, build scale with synergistic accretive acquisitions. Under Vision 2025, we have streamlined and optimized our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to build scale in our highest returning building products businesses. CWT leadership continues to execute extremely well on delivering a smooth and efficient integration of Henry and is on pace to exceed our initial synergy targets of $30 million. The CWT team is doing an excellent job working both incremental cost synergy opportunities and seeking to drive revenue synergies given it's now a broader set of products. We remain excited about acquisition prospects within the Building Envelope and we're working in active pipeline of opportunities to broaden our suite of energy-efficient solutions. And fourth, a returns-focused capital allocation strategy that includes deploying over $3 billion into capital expenditures share repurchases and dividends. Since the launch of Vision 2025, we have deployed over $2.8 billion into these areas. Turning to our 2022 year-to-date actions, we've made capital investments of over $130 million into our businesses to drive innovation and the Carlisle Experience is exemplified by the third quarter launch of our first industry-leading 16-foot TPO line in Carlisle PA and we remain on track to deploy $175 million in capital expenditures this year. We've also made share repurchases totaling more than $200 million and paid approximately $96 million in dividends in 2022. To that point, we were very proud to raise our dividend 39% to $3 in the third quarter, which continues our 46-year trend of annual dividend increases. This 39% increase is Carlisle's largest in the past 25 years and reflects our strong sustainable financial position and confidence in continued growth of Carlisle's earnings and cash flow. While the pillars of our soon-to-be achieved Vision 2025 have proven to be sound, I want to reiterate that these are core to Carlisle. With these cultural and strategic pillars in place, we are proud of our accelerated execution of Vision 2025 and remain committed to our approach to sustainable value creation for all stakeholders. Please turn to Slide 4 and let's look at the drivers of our record performance in third quarter and year-to-date sales and earnings. First US non-residential construction demand remains strong and we are optimistic that the underlying trends will overcome well-known pressures seen in the global economy. Re-roofing demand also continues to be a reliable, significant and sustainable driver for growth and new construction still a tailwind. Notably we are on track for double-digit volume growth at CCM for the second straight year. Fortunately, material availability has improved meaningfully in the past few months and as such, we are seeing a normalization of buying patterns by our customers. Additionally, the need for energy-efficient building solutions to help mitigate rising energy costs and collectively help reduce the planet's carbon footprint will continue to be a driver. Second, pricing at all of our businesses continues to be positive as we focus on earning price for the value we create for our customers through the Carlisle Experience. Our continued and growing investment in new product innovation, world-class manufacturing capabilities and best-in-class customer service encompass the value proposition that our partners have come to rely on from Carlisle. And architects and building owners know they'll benefit from our innovative energy-efficient building solutions that the market increasingly demands. Third, residential markets are facing increased pressure due to interest rate hikes, significant inflation and at the consumer level a reduction in building products expenditures. While impactful in the short-term, we believe that longer-term fundamentals in residential markets remain attractive, given the undersupply of homes in the US and growing demand for energy-efficient building solutions, particularly given recent supporting legislation and rising energy costs. Fourth, aerospace markets continue their recovery, driving record backlogs at CIT and increased profitability on the back of restructuring actions taken over the past few years. We're very optimistic about the prospects for continued recovery in the aerospace markets, supported by a shortage of aircraft, which has caused the US airlines to cut back on flights as they struggle to cope with the rebound in passenger travel both domestic and international. Finally, we remain firmly committed to sustainability. Please turn to Slide 5. The recent publication of our third corporate sustainability report is another milestone in our ESG journey. Carlisle's three pillars of environmental sustainability, energy-efficient products and solutions, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in our manufacturing operations and the reduction of waste entering landfills are central to our efforts to achieve our sustainability goals. We also announced on October 17, a special stock option grant to all eligible employees, representing Carlisle's third broad-based stock option or cash equivalent grant to employees in the last 12 years. We believe that it is beneficial for all employees to have ownership and participate in the success of the company. This grant provides a significant incentive for the team to drive actions that will help Carlisle achieve its long-term objectives. Additionally, through the Inflation Reduction Act that was signed into law in August, the building industry can take advantage of extended and expanded incentives through energy-efficient building practices. More than $300 billion will be invested in energy and climate reform through energy tax incentives, investments in clean energy production and tax credits aimed at reducing carbon emissions. These increased incentives for US builders, installers, homeowners and commercial building owners who demonstrate reduced energy use should drive increased demand for Carlisle building products and energy-efficient solutions. Lastly, we continue to make significant strides towards aligning our greenhouse gas reduction strategy with the Science Based Targets initiative or SBTi, which defines and promotes best practices and science-based targets that help provide companies with a clearly defined path to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement goals. We are on pace to submit our alignment goals for approval by the end of 2022. Please turn to Slide 6 where we highlight our record performance in the third quarter of 2022. Revenue increased 36% year-over-year with organic revenue up 28%. All segments contributed to this record growth. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 89% year-over-year to $5.66 driven by higher volumes price Henry's contribution and COS initiatives, which more than offset inflation and supply chain disruptions. And with that I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide more detail about the businesses, additional financial details and our updated outlook for the remainder of 2022. Kevin? In closing, I want to express again how pleased I am with the hard work and perseverance of Carlisle employees. Their resilience and experience will continue to provide Carlisle with a competitive advantage as we navigate in this highly complex environment. Despite numerous macroeconomic challenges, the Carlisle team continues to deliver our culture of continuous improvement, focused on delivering solid results. Our outstanding third quarter demonstrates Carlisle's progress towards achieving our goals as laid out in Vision 2025, including delivering $15 of GAAP earnings per share three years earlier than originally contemplated. While we will be vigilant and monitor the macroeconomic environment and the drivers of each business we continue to be optimistic about the direction of Carlisle. And as Kevin mentioned we expect a record fourth quarter and a record 2022. This concludes our formal comments. We are now ready for questions. Good afternoon, Tim. Yes. Tim, I'll start off and then Jim and Kevin can weigh in. And on the non-resi we really start to see things improve on the materials side as I talked about in supply chain. And in fact our MSP program which was really in the non-resi core commercial businesses that we had had to put in place due to the significant demand and the need to allocate due to lack of capacity across the industry started to unwind in September as things start to improve. And obviously when that happens people get more secure in the ability to source product. And so we started to see some changes in the buying patterns in the sense of the fact that we now could bring things in and people didn't have to look so far out. Remember when we -- I think we talked on the last call or it might have been some time in the third quarter or second quarter we mentioned that the -- we were taking orders out into 2023. So there was an extremely long view from contractors. And I think really because of the improvements in the supply chain we've started to see people get back to a more normal cadence which is a definite change. It's a good change though. On the non-resi side the mix there for Carlisle is about 85-15. When we look at the two businesses CWT, I'm thinking it's around 50-50 with the addition of Henry there. And then on the CCM side, we're at about 90-10. So I don't know James if you want to add anything to that? Yes. Well I don't think it changes anything in pricing Tim. As we said pricing has continued to be strong. We don't see any changes in actual pricing. I mean as far as we can see forward we did have the actions in September that were increases and we've had other actions that we're going to start to lap in 2023, but no real change in pricing. I think the only thing is that comment you mentioned the detail around at time of shipment with the MSP unwinding in that allocation process yes we'll be relaxing that and going back to more normal kind of terms and conditions for our non-residential customers. Hey, good afternoon, Bryan. Yes. And I think it's safe to say Bryan that the European situation is not one that anybody would say has improved over the last quarter. I would just add that. Yes. I mean a lot of good things. We did a lot of work to understand how we handle at the job site not a problem. We have rolled it out. Obviously there's still pretty very good demand for TPO in the marketplace. The team is in the process of educating contractors, talking about how to use it on the job site people are getting used to using it. That's the rollout. But the demand certainly is there. And I think it's just a great example Bryan, I'm glad you asked it, of one of these ways that we're going to seek to maintain that Carlisle Experience and obviously the margins that come with it where we're pricing to value because that 16-foot line is taking labor off the roof. It's allowing contractors to get their jobs done faster and move on to other jobs. And we know the same things are holding true today that held true three months ago and six months ago labor is constrained. So everything we can do to get contractors to put down a high-quality Carlisle roof and then move on and get more jobs done. We know that means obviously good things for us both in terms of sales and margins. So, yes, it's going well. And obviously as with anything it takes time to spool up and get rolling. You bet. John, I'll let Jim, talk about visibility and I think he's going to have some favorable comments there. But on that oil -- that we've done I think we've said this before and I don't think we've done it in the last couple of years, because of what we've been through. But we did a lot of work on the correlation between oil and actually, the end products that we buy from suppliers. And while it can be I guess, a general guide in what can be happening we don't see a lot of connectivity or correlation. It actually was pretty low surprisingly when we looked at it. Due to some of the processing, and when we're cracking something depending on what demand is in other -- in the automotive industry or things like that for different parts of the petroleum distillate that we're buying. So, I don't think the oil pricing is going to have as big an impact, as maybe the general indicator of oil pricing in the economy. I think what's more important is to really look at what's happening in places like the Port of Long Beach, with trucking with statements like CWT coming from 50-plus suppliers on a watch list to 10, and our ability to access product and be more normal there. I think, it's just when people can plan more rationally and can level all their factories, and can plan for shipping on time. And these things tend to decrease, the extra cost for labor, it decreases the extra cost for overtime, freight things like that. So yes, I would just say, I don't think that oil is going to be a big driver on that price. Jim, do you want to handle the demand? Sure. I think you look at a couple of them that came out recently that I'm still excited, about and I guess, they're recent enough that we can talk about them and the impact obviously, margin to sales is we've talked about our APEEL product. I still think that's a great one. We're adding that a clear layer of product on to the TPO sheet. And when we're done with the job, people are peeling it away and having an exceptionally clean brand-new roof with none of the traffic on it, where before you would have had people walking on dirt things like this, and then you'd have to bring pressure washing equipment up, you'd have to haul it up on the roof you risk puncturing the roof with the equipment, you've got people cleaning it water flowing up. And it just all takes time and it takes labor, and we don't have either one of those. We want our contractors moving onto the next job, not washing the previous job and using that labor to play more TPO, EPDM and PVC membranes. So I like that one.

            "content": "Thank you, Chris. For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 7. CCM drove revenue growth of 39% with excellent leverage. This performance was driven by continued strong demand in US commercial roofing capturing price earned by delivering on the Carlisle Experience and new product sales, partially offset by what we consider near-term softness in our Architectural Metals business, potentially more persistent challenges in our European business due to the effects of a recession and ongoing energy crisis and unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 32.5%, a record performance in the third quarter by our CCM team was driven by volume price and COS and partially offset by raw material and labor inflation and unfavorable mix. Moving to Slide 8. Sales at CWT increased 44% year-over-year. This growth was achieved despite ongoing but improving supply constraints in pockets of incremental softness in demand, namely in residential markets. As we pass the one-year mark of our Henry acquisition the largest acquisition in Carlisle's history, we continue to execute on our synergy strategies, drive the principles of the Carlisle Experience and are in the process of rolling out COS throughout CWT to drive further leverage in our operations. Moving to slide 9, CIT revenue increased 25% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2022, with balanced growth in its Commercial Aerospace and Medical Technology platforms. We continue to see domestic travel approach pre-pandemic levels and as a result have seen CIT experienced record backlog. We expect to see continued rising demand for narrow-body aircraft and eventually wide bodies as domestic and international travel continues to recover. Leveraging these positives, our team delivered a nice lift in profitability in the third quarter versus the first half of 2022 aided by previous restructuring efforts. Turning to CFT on slide 10, CFT generated organic revenue of 10% year-over-year, partially offset by a 7% year-over-year FX headwind. With over half of CFT sales being international we expect a strong U.S. dollar to continue to be a headwind to sales growth near term but fundamentals remain intact. We remain confident that commercial and operational improvements combined with a strong backlog will deliver revenue growth and incremental margins in the mid-40% range. Slides 11 and 12 provide details about our record third quarter consolidated results for revenue and adjusted EPS. Moving to slides 13 and 14, Carlisle ended the third quarter of 2022 with $625 million of cash on hand with cash generated from continuing operations totaling $366 million capital expenditures of $48 million, share repurchases of $26 million and dividends paid of $39 million during the quarter. We currently have 4.2 million shares remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1.6 times, down from three times at the end of 2021 which as a result of the Henry acquisition was elevated compared to our target net debt-to-EBITDA range of one-time to two-times. Given the repayment of our $350 million senior notes on October 17th and our expected EBITDA growth for the balance of this year we expect to maintain our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio within this target range. On slide 15, we have our updated 2022 financial outlook. At CCM, we expect to deliver a record full year in 2022, and expect year-over-year revenue growth in the 35% to 40% range. At CWT, we continue to expect revenue to grow approximately 60% year-over-year. At CIT, we now expect revenues to exceed 20% in 2022. At CFT, we now expect mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2022 due to foreign translation headwinds. Finally, on a consolidated basis for Carlisle, despite the significant headwinds and volatility the economy has experienced in September we expect to deliver a record year in 2022 with a full year revenue growth in the 35% to 40% range. Given strong fundamentals across our businesses staying ahead of inflation with proactive pricing actions and driving strong leverage through COS we maintain our expectations for total Carlisle adjusted EBITDA margins to expand approximately 650 basis points. With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. Yes. We remain confident on the year-over-year improvement of 650 basis points. So no change from the previous guidance there. Yes. So we don't break out the individual business units within the segments. Overall, obviously, though the third quarter for CCM and core roofing is the majority of that segment. I mean we had significant improvement year-over-year over 750 basis points improvement for the quarter. Yes. So, we have mix on -- certainly, there's different pieces besides the membrane insulation, there's also accessories. So that's a piece of it of driving that mix change. We're still in the range of that. I mean those are approximate numbers. But yes, that's what we're still striving to hit for the fourth quarter and full year."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Giannakouros, Carlisle's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jim, please go ahead.\nJim Giannakouros: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Carlisle's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We released our second quarter financial results after the market closed today, and you can find both our press release and earnings call slide presentation in the Investor Relations section of our website, carlisle.com. On the call with me today are Chris Koch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Zdimal, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will begin with Chris giving an update on our progress and achieving our strategic plan, Vision 2025, highlights of our record second quarter and a discussion of current trends. Kevin will discuss the financial details and updated outlook for 2022. Following Chris and Kevin's remarks, we will open up the line for questions. But before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our press release and SEC filings. As Carlisle provides non-GAAP financial information we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve provided reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release, and in the appendix of our presentation materials, which again are available on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris.\nChristian Koch: Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2022 earnings call. As we enter the third quarter, we continue to operate in a highly uncertain environment, which has been the case each of these past three years. In addition to an ongoing global pandemic, tight labor markets and supply chain constraints, we are now seeing the global impact of the ongoing war in Ukraine, rising interest rates from a Federal Reserve concern with record inflation, and the uncertain outlook for the American consumer.  Despite this challenging environment, I am very pleased with the outstanding performance out teams delivered in the second quarter. Our positive performance depends on a Carlisle team that continues to deliver continues improvement mindset with a focus on results and an unrelenting commitment to deliver the Carlisle experience.  As a result, in the second quarter, we delivered another record performance including revenues, EBITDA and diluted EPS which moves us closer to delivering Vision 2025 including achieving $15 of earnings per share three years ahead of plan.  Please turn to Slide 3. Our record results continue to demonstrate that Vision 25 which has provided the clarity and consistency of mission since its launch in 2018 has been the right path for Carlisle even in these challenging times. In addition to our world-class team and proven business model, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve relied on a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow generation to provide both financial and strategic flexibility to execute our Vision 2025 roadmap.  A significant portion of our success has been driven by the multi-year process of reshaping our portfolio to pivot Carlisle to a diversified building products focus setting the stage for accelerated and sustainable value creation.  Allow me to update our progress on these strategic initiatives. Please turn to Slide 4. These initiatives include; drive 5% plus organic growth with operational leverage. In the second quarter, we delivered 42% organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth of 146%.  Utilize the Carlisle operating system, we use the Carlisle operating system to consistently drive efficiencies and enhance operating leverage by targeting cost savings of 1% to 2% of sales annually. We continue to execute on our Lean Sigma initiatives in the second quarter of 2022 and fully expect to be in our targeted range for this year.  Build scale with synergistic acquisitions. We continue to streamline and optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to build scale in our highest returning building businesses. With almost one year since our Henry purchase, the team continues to execute extremely well on delivering a smooth and efficient integration and is on pace to exceed our initial synergy targets of $30 million.  We remain excited about acquisition prospects within the building envelope and we are working an active pipeline of opportunities to augment our newest segment, CWT in a variety of construction products related verticals.  Continue to invest in and develop exceptional talent. Our Carlisle leadership system is a holistic approach to talent management that incorporates mutually reinforcing processes and tools for the selection and development of high caliber talent. In the second quarter, we held our week long Annual Leadership Summit with the current and future leaders of Carlisle with the aim of developing the next generation of leadership, while reinforcing the high standards expected of Carlisle leadership, we also discussed and developed ways to honestly assess our business performance and debated changes to facilitate continuous improvement in the organization and to enhance Carlisle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future performance.  Deploy over $3 billion into capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends through 2025. Notably, we are on an accelerated path here. Since the launch of Vision 2025, we have deployed over $2.7 billion into these areas.  Turning to our 2022 year-to-date actions, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made capital investments of over $80 million into our businesses, made share repurchases totaling $175 million and paid approximately $57 million in dividends in 2022.  Now let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn to the second quarter and look at the drivers of our record performance. First on Slide 5, re-roofing demand. Re-roofing is a necessity for building owners in order to maintain the integrity of their substantial investments. Re-roofing demand continues to be a reliable, significant and sustainable driver for growth at CCM as we continue to seek more efficient of energy as a nation, increased amounts of insulation have been added to the re-roofing system which expands our served market and increases the value of the roof to building owners. Specifically, one of the easiest ways to enhance the energy efficiency of a roof is by adding more insulation.  In fact, over the past decade the ratio of insulation to single-ply roofing membrane board feet increased an estimated 40%, clearly demonstrating the annual increase in insulation consumption. The increasing number of low sloped roofs requiring re-roofing with more energy-efficient solutions over the next decade underpins our confidence and CCM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to continue to generate above market growth.  This rising demand, coupled with our position as a key provider of energy-efficient solutions for buildings sets up CCM very well for additional growth.  Adding to these positive trends, we also expect continued high levels of backlog for the near future, much of this due to COVID-19 issues in 2020 and exacerbated by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages in 2021 and 2022.  Second, under the guide of Vision 2025, we continue to earn premium pricing in the marketplace by providing significant value to our customers through what we call the Carlisle Experience. Our continued and growing investment in new product innovation, the energy-efficiency benefits of our building envelope systems, our world-class manufacturing and distribution facilities and best-in-class customer service encompass the value proposition that our contractors have come to rely on from Carlisle.  Contractors in the other one they order from us, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get energy-efficient building solutions of the best quality in the right amount at the right place and at the right time.  Third, we continue to seek synergistic and accretive acquisitions. We continue to be pleased with the Henry integration where synergy targets are ahead of schedule and we are on pace to achieve approximately $1.50 of accretion in 2022. We are also pleased that the acquired Henry leadership team has taken on the role of managing our diverse set of building envelope solutions in our newest segment CWT.  The solutions within CWT now include Henry, Carlisle Polyurethane Systems and Carlisle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legacy Diversified Products. In February, we acquired MB Technology, a California-based provider of roofing underlayments and membranes as a strategic bolt-on to CWT. We are pleased that this innovative company won a grant from the State of California to develop a modified bitumen product called Ecotorch, which incorporates recycled tires into the membrane.  This type of commitment to sustainability reinforces the value Carlisle places in our acquisition targets. Given the success of Henry and the establishment of this new segment, we are actively seeking similar, but larger tuck-in opportunities to enhance CWT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already significant capabilities.  Four, since launching Vision 2025, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve remained focused on being a disciplined and superior capital allocator. Our strong operating cash flow enables Carlisle to remain financially and strategically flexible in order to drive value through a balanced and opportunistic approach to capital allocation. This approach includes investing in organic growth, returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and as I just mentioned, continuing to seek accretive acquisitions that enhance Carlisle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to create value for all our stakeholders.  Notably, we anticipate this August will mark Carlisle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 46th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. We are extremely proud to be approaching a half century of annually paying and increasing dividends, part of our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. We also remain on track to deploy $175 million in capital expenditures this year with a large share dedicated to fund growth products in our building products segments.  Fifth, we remain firmly committed to sustainability and ESG. Please turn to Slide 6. We are proud that our business model is squarely in the middle of global ESG trends as our products and systems enable a more efficient use of energy in buildings. Energy-efficient buildings can contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions on a large scale.  As evidenced by the fact that over 30% of GHT emissions annually are attributed to the operation of buildings. With our pivot to building products, and the accelerating demand for energy-efficient products in the broader market, Carlisle is enabling a more sustainable planet. Carlisle will help deliver a net zero future by supplying innovative energy-efficient products and solutions, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of construction materials and landfills.  One recent project to support this net zero mission includes the purchase of $1.6 million worth of equipment to recycle production scrap at our Dixon, California EPS plant. This investment will enable the diversion of 140 tons of waste from landfills annually. And more broadly, Carlisle is targeting the incorporation of more than 1 million tons of recycled materials and production scrap into our production stream by 2030 diverting their material from landfills.  Additionally, we continue to make significant strides towards aligning our GHT reduction strategy with the Science Based Targets Initiative or SBTI. SBTI defines and promotes best practices in science based targets to help provide companies with a clearly defined path to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement goals. Please turn to Slide 7 where we highlight our performance in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue increased 57% year-over-year with organic revenue up 42%. All segments contributed to this growth. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 185% year-over-year to $6.15 driven by higher volumes, price, Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contribution and lean sigma initiatives, which more than offset inflation and operational disruptions.  For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 8. CCM delivered an outstanding quarter weathering challenges across its supply chain, pervasive inflationary pressures and labor constraints. CCM drove solid top-line growth due to continued strong demand, favorable product mix, new product sales and captured price earned by delivering on the Carlisle Experience.  Contractor backlogs remained quite healthy and bid activity remains strong giving us confidence for continued strength in the second half of 202 and optimism for the future.  Moving to Slide 9, sales accelerated in the second quarter at our newly created segment Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies where revenue increased over 23% year-over-year on a pro-forma basis. Growth continued across all product lines despite supply constraints, which began to ease in the second quarter versus earlier this year.  We continue to drive the Carlisle Experience through CWT and its organization as we seek to earn the increased value of our products and services. As I mentioned earlier, the CWT team is executing well on a multi-faceted integration plan and is leveraging volume growth on plan.  Moving to Slide 10. CIT revenue increased 26% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2022 with balanced growth in its commercial aerospace and medical technologies platforms. Backlog continues to grow and notably remains higher than CIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pre-pandemic levels. We are encouraged by the TSA checkpoint numbers that show domestic air travel is nearing 2019 levels, driving increased demand for narrow body aircraft and eventually wide bodied aircraft as international travel returns to pre-COVID levels.  CIT continues to navigate supply chain disruptions, facility consolidation efforts, inflation, and mix headwinds. We do expect many of these influences to begin to abate in the second half of 2022, setting the stage for higher profitability.  Turning to CFT on Slide 11. CFT generated organic revenue growth of 5.5% year-over-year. We continue to be pleased by the progress CFT has made over the last couple of years including improved operational efficiencies and new product introductions.  We have also seen the team upgrade the customer service experience and earn strong price realization. We remain confident that commercial and operational improvements, combined with growing backlog will deliver strong revenue growth and incremental margins in the mid-40% range this year and as we continue to make progress towards our goal of 50% plus incremental margins in the coming years.  And with that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn it over to Kevin to discuss some additional financial details and our updated outlook for the remainder of 2022. Kevin? \nKevin Zdimal: Thank you, Chris. Chris has covered revenue growth in his comments, so I will move to the EPS bridge on Slide 13. EPS growth in the quarter was driven primarily by price, volume and mix more than offsetting the negative impact of materials and labor inflation. Additionally, the Henry acquisition contributed $0.47 of accretion in the quarter. Moving to Slides 14 and 15. Carlisle ended the second quarter of 2022 with $353 million of cash on hand, with cash generated from continuing operations, totaling $181 million. Capital expenditures of $52 million, share repurchases of $50 million and dividends paid of $28 million during the quarter. We currently have 4.3 million shares remaining from our last share repurchase authorization.  Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 2x, down from 3x at the end of 20201, which as a result of the Henry acquisition was elevated compared to our target net debt to EBITDA range of 1x to 2x. Our policy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet. However, for the right acquisition, we will take on additional debt and through earnings growth and debt reduction, drive our net debt to EBITDA ratio back to our target range within one to two years.  Given our anticipated repayment of $350 million senior notes in the second half of 2022, and expected EBITDA growth for the balance of this year, we expect to reduce our net debt to EBITDA ratio to approximately 1.5x by the end of this year.  On Slide 16, we have our updated 2022 financial outlook. At CCM, as Chris mentioned, we are seeing strong re-roofing and new construction demand, as well as increasing interest in our energy-efficient solutions. We now expect total revenue growth at CCM to be approximately 40% in 2022, up from our previous estimate of approximately 30%.  At CWT, we now expect revenue to grow approximately 60% year-over-year including 20% organically. Henry continues to contend with supply constraints. But as Chris mentioned earlier, is navigating that well. With integration efforts tracking above our deal model, we reiterate our accretion target of $1.50 for 2022. At CIT, we are encouraged by growing backlogs in both our aerospace and medical businesses, and thus increasing our revenue guidance to approximately 20% in 2022, up from our previous estimate of low double-digit growth.  At CFT, with orders coming in as expected, and with positive pricing and new product sales ramping up, we continue to expect approximately 10% revenue growth in 2022. Finally, on a consolidated basis for Carlisle, we now expect to deliver revenue growth of approximately 40% in 2022. Given the strong fundamentals across our businesses, staying ahead of inflation with proactive pricing actions and driving strong leverage through COS, we expect total Carlisle adjusted EBITDA margins to expand approximately 650 basis points in full year 2022, up from our previous estimate of approximately 500 basis points.  With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. Chris?\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Kevin. I want to express again how pleased I am with the outstanding performance delivered by the entire Carlisle team this quarter and thank them once again for their perseverance, especially as we operate in this challenging and uncertain environment. Despite these challenges, the Carlisle continues to deliver our culture of continuous improvement, focused on delivering results in an environment of mutual respect and trust.  The outstanding results in the second quarter clearly demonstrate Carlisle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exceeding expectations and is on pace to achieve much of what we set out to accomplish in Vision 2025 including our goal to deliver $15 of earnings per share. As a result of solid fundamentals across all of our businesses, our outlook remains optimistic for the rest of 2022.  This concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator:  Our first question is from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. \nBryan Blair : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. \nChristian Koch: Hey, good afternoon, Bryan. \nBryan Blair : Another exceptional quarter. Thinking about the revised sales outlook for CCM, I know your team isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to break out volume and price contribution by quarter for competitive reasons, but in terms of the step up to the guide, could you perhaps give us the weighting of the 10 points relative to moving from 30% to 40% for the year?\nKevin Zdimal: We are not splitting that out by segment, but more so looking at it overall. If you looked at total Carlisle, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say a third of the increase is related to over a third year-over-year growth is price and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or volume, sorry about that, a third is volume, two-thirds is price. \nBryan Blair : Okay. Fair enough. And for CCM and CWT, it would be great to hear how orders trended through Q2 and into July and whether price inflation general macro concerns, any other factors have started to impact the strength of runrate demand. We know that your business is extensively booked for the year. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of a 2023 consideration, whether there is anything currently signaling that there could be a pull back into next year? \nChristian Koch: Well, Bryan, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very challenging market as we highlighted in the script there. You can see more changes, I think the 75 basis point increase today was received well, but obviously that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to have some impact and I know there is concerns in the market as to whether the 75 basis point increase will tap down demand but not do anything because things like supply chain issues for the rest of the year.  So, look when we look at what our world looks like on a very North American kind of sector basis and construction with CWT and CCM as you said in our core non-resi business, look, you are right, we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 under our and what we were running an MSP program which is basically an allocation program this year tap all contractors that get some product we are out till the end of the year.  And we see ordering beginning already in 2023. So, we see those the current demand is continuing into Q3 and into Q4 obviously, we always are a little bit conscious of the fact that Q3 has burned us before weather with something like a hurricane, I think in 2018 that might have affected like in 2017. And then we have weather affecting obviously as we get close to the winter and we like a warmer fall, so that we keep more days on the roof. But, so the outlook, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of the same in Q3.  Obviously, we are lapping price increases that occurred last year. So the year-over-year comps will be down a little bit on that, but sequentially good. When we look at CWT and the new Weather Proofing Technologies group, really good trends there that I think even if we look at something like the home center market.  That team has delivered year in and year out. I mean, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just go back to, I am familiar with to say 2014 and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve continued to do things like increase the content of their products on the shelves and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but able to pass on pricing. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to garner new accounts in the home center market. And so, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to overcome some of these inter-quarter challenges that occur from time-to-time.  But the big things for us going forward remain on the supply chain side, can we get enough product to continue to maximize our capacity and address the demand that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out there and then obviously labor constraints remain.  I think they are going to be there for a while and with the supply constraints and with the labor constraints, it just sets up that this backlog probably doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get resolved right away and continues on into 2023. So, I think overall for us, pretty positive outlook for the remainder of the year and then hopefully continues into 2023. \nBryan Blair : That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very helpful color. And in terms of Henry, you mentioned supply constraints, is that what has led to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what I am assuming is a bit of conservatism and not taking up the accretion guide. You are pacing ahead, I realize there is more seasonal variability going into the fourth quarter, but with the synergy plan ahead run rate growth being very solid. I assume that you are very confident in the third quarter at a minimum is just conservatism in terms of what could play out with supply and seasonal variability going into Q4 that the $1.50 was not taken up. \nChristian Koch: Yeah, Bryan, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right. And I think some of that conservatism is well founded in the fact that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know them as well as we know our core businesses and while the team is doing a great job and providing great information and insight and just doing a heck of a job on the integration, I think, that sets right. We want to be able to conservative here and make sure we understand all the puts and takes as we go through the year. \nBryan Blair : All perfectly fair. Thanks guys. \nChristian Koch: Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky : Thanks. So maybe we could talk a little bit about your EBITDA margin expansion, your guidance by 150 basis points, could you just talk through how much of this is driven by positive price cost or maybe a little bit of detail by segment?\nKevin Zdimal : Yes. We did it on purpose to consolidate it, so we are not going to go into the segment-by-segment piece of it. But yeah, overall, as I think I pointed out on the volume being one-third and price being two-thirds, you should be able to do the math off that piece of it to get to the 650 basis points.\nSaree Boroditsky : Great. Thanks. And you talked a lot about increased energy-efficient solutions in insulation. Could you help quantify what that opportunity represents as older roofs are replaced with these new, more energy-efficient solutions?\nChristian Koch : Yeah. Saree, as we look out, I think there are two vectors here on insulation are for one is just a simple one we highlighted and I think if you think about just what we talked about that the board feet of insulation to membrane up 40% over the last ten years, that gives you an idea of what that trajectory looks like.  And obviously, there are a lot of places still in the United States that have not officially raised their code to double up on the insulation. There is not a lot of places that are just not doing it, but as we begin to get people more educated, and they see the benefits of this, I think that rate will continue. That's a good rate to look at.  And I think the other thing is we have to look at new technology, polyiso and EPS have been around for a while, and our teams are working on, every day the next-gen or generation of both membranes and insulation. And we think there are some interesting concepts out there that could increase our value, reduce time of installation, which is a big deal, obviously out there for contractors and so, improve the efficiency of our entire system.  So, I like that run rate right now that without any new technology that we've shown over the past ten years, I think that continues. And then, as we add new technology, that could really accelerate things from a dollar perspective and from a volume perspective. So, I'll just leave it there. I mean, I know that's not as clear as you probably want. But I think that past history is a good indicator of what we are seeing happen in the marketplace today.\nSaree Boroditsky : I appreciate the color. Congratulations on a great quarter and thanks for taking my questions.\nChristian Koch : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. \nMarius Morar : Hi, this is Marius for Adam. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned in your press release that you have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you added about $100 million of sales from new products and I was wondering whether you can maybe expand a bit more on that and talk about some - what those products are and what other opportunities are there? Thank you. \nChristian Koch : Yeah, sure. I just mentioned it with Saree there, a great question she had on what the future of insulation is and I think that's one of the areas that we are going to look at is how can we get better insulation, more efficient insulation to increase our value, decrease labor content per square foot installed. And really, those are the kind of things we're looking to do. We're really looking to help the contractor get the job done more efficiently, more effectively so they could take on more work and also use their labor more effectively. If you look at a couple of products that we've introduced in the last couple of years that I think are just outstanding products and are quite innovative, one is our APEEL product, where we are - got a piece of TPO membrane installed. There is a thin layer of film over it that when the job is completed, we can pull that back and you have the clean TPO white roof there.  In the past, without that, with all the workers that are on the roof and people installing things, you'd get a lot of dirt and they'd have to haul up pressure washers and things like that to clean it off and it just meant more labor, more time on the roof, more expense for the contractor. So we think that APEEL product does exactly what we want to do for the contractor and there is value there.  Another product we have is we have a velcro-adhered system in TPO that I also think is pretty innovative. And this is used in some pretty interesting installations. I remember a couple of years ago, I had a job. We were out talking to the contractor and they were going to put a roof on air traffic control center in the West and they really couldn't shut down the control center and so they needed something that could be put down without any adhesives or things like that. And so they use basically our TPO membrane with our velcro-adhered process and it's done mechanically there.  So, that's another one where we were able to complete a job in a difficult situation, please the end-user and make it easier on the contractor to get the job done, get off the roof and move on. So, another one is, obviously, our CAV-GRIP series where we continue to improve that. And that's an adhesive 2 component adhesive system we use and we've had great reception to that.  So those are a couple of examples I could keep going on, but that's probably enough for you to get an idea of the type of new products we're putting out there. But again, it really centers on improving the quality of the system, increasing the energy efficiency of the system and getting the contractor off the roof as quickly as possible allowing them to move on and make more money.\nMarius Morar : Thank you. And just a quick follow-up, has your outlook for inflation changed since last quarter? And if so, what are some of the buckets where you changed the most? Thank you.\nChristian Koch : I don't really think the outlook has changed. I can't give \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I am not going to give you the specifics on the outlook in terms of numbers. But what I will say is obviously, inflation on the supply chain side as much as we thought it would abate by this time, we are still seeing inflation in raw materials in the second quarter. We see it going into the third and fourth quarter and not abating to a big degree.  We still see labor inflation. I think that's pretty obvious for everyone out there that's been following the labor markets that there is more pressure on workers. We have a lot of open positions in the economy today. People are looking for more wages to offset the increases in healthcare costs or gasoline and community to work or things like that, rents and things like that.  So those pressures remain. So freight is another one and then obviously, fuel prices. So those four buckets, when you look at those and the impact they have on our customers and on our factories, those are the ones we focus in and they really haven't changed. There is still \u00e2\u0080\u0093 well, as you can see by what the Fed has done, they are still pretty high.\nMarius Morar : Thank you.\nChristian Koch : You are welcome. \nOperator: Our next question is from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed. \nGarik Shmois : Hi, thanks. Thank you. \nChristian Koch : Hey, Garik. \nGarik Shmois : Congrats on the great quarter. I wanted to ask first just on raw material availability. Just curious if there has been any improvement there? And just a follow-up to that, let's say there is improvement moving forward and maybe you do get some cost relief, I am just kind of curious as to how you're thinking about CCM prices moving forward if we are in this inflationary environment?\nChristian Koch : So availability got a little bit better in some areas and I think that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you see that manifested itself in a little bit higher sales because obviously, if \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with the orders we had in the backlog, if we can get the raw materials, we can produce more product and get it out the door. In terms of raw material pricing, again, we've said this now for a while, but I'll just reiterate it is we are really \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can see this with these new products, and you can see it with our philosophy in the Carlisle Experience, we are really pricing to the value of the products in the market. So, if we see a reduction in pricing in the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I don't see it happening this year, but if it happen next year, I think we are going back to that's a separate function on raw materials than it is. It's not going to be tied into the price of our products. They are not commodities. They provide a lot of value, and it's really our job to take that value and explain it to our end-users or contractors, architects or distributors, get them to understand that, that's a price you want to pay for that product because of the value it's returning. Garik, I'll give you one example. We're launching the 16-foot wide TPO membrane into the market here and when you think about what it's going to do for the contractor in terms of labor saving and efficiency, my guess is that people will be willing to pay a premium for that product and not be as connected to raw materials on that, again because we'll be able to show the value and demonstrate it to the buyer.\nGarik Shmois : Got it. That's helpful. My follow-up question is just on the residential side of the business, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CWT. Be it Henry or Spray Foam and just getting firmly concerned on the housing side are you seeing any change in order trends hopefully, and then just maybe help remind us how durable the residential part of CWT is if there is a slowdown in residential construction?\nChristian Koch : So right now, with the raw material supply, obviously, in the tight labor markets, when we look at CWT as a whole, the order backlog remains strong at the consolidated level. I mean, you do see signs of some softness emerging in some areas. I am not going to get into specifics there. But it's really not a softness to a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it's really coming off quite a high volume.  And so there is still very good demand and very good shipping going on and I think a good tone in the marketplace. I think the other thing is we talked about new products. We talked about the value. I mentioned a little bit about what we are doing in some of the home centers by trying to put more product into the aisles in that that we own. So we'd have to segregate that out too.  But I think the demand going forward for CWT is good. I think it's durable and I think that we will see some \u00e2\u0080\u0093 obviously, some issues there with resi construction as interest rates rise. I mean, I don't think we can avoid that. But I am not sure that's all together bad. I think that might help the raw materials catch-up, get a little relief there and then 2023 still looks pretty positive for us.\nKevin Zdimal : Yes. And this is Kevin. Half of their business is R&R as well. So you get that aftermarket business. So, 50% is new and 50% repair and replacement.\nGarik Shmois : Got it. Thanks again. Best of luck.\nChristian Koch : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Chan with Baird. Please proceed.\nJosh Chan : Hey, good afternoon, Chris, Kevin, Jim. Great quarter. On the strength in the CCM demand, could you guys talk about where you are seeing that relative to new construction versus reroof and any specific verticals that are driving the strength particularly?\nChristian Koch : Yeah. I mean we're seeing it, believe it or not, we're seeing it through the business. Demand has been pretty good right across the board, everything from architectural metals, to insulation, to commercial roofing. If you look at the different membranes, EPDM, PVC, TPO, I think those are all doing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they are doing a great job there.  When you look at verticals, warehouses are up, educational buildings, office, maybe flack up stores are up. I think right across the board, it's still good across everything. And the reason I think that is, is because obviously, we've got this pent-up demand that came with COVID. We got into COVID and things kind of got behind and then we see the huge surge in the supply chain problems. And so if you look at this backlog that just like we said is continuing on from the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 now the end of 2022 into 2023 and that means that the sales into those verticals are going to continue. And we don't really see that changing for the foreseeable future.  So, yeah, I'd like to highlight something that I didn't feel good about right now. But I don't really think there is anything in the foreseeable future, like I said in the beginning that we see back half of 2022, strong. Again, there are issues out there on inflation, that's keeping pressure on supply, supply chain might be a little bit better, but probably not completely resolved and we still see demand being strong.\nJosh Chan : That's great. That's good color there. And then on the CWT side, I think you guys mentioned the acquisition pipeline a few times in the prepared remarks. So, could you talk about when do you feel like you are organizationally ready to make another acquisition? And/or what areas are you looking at for the next transaction there?\nChristian Koch : Yeah, well, without going into anything too confidential, we don't want to tip anybody else off of our competitors. But what I would say is we've talked about expanding into the Building Envelope, CWT is doing the same thing. We are looking at different areas. We are looking at products that could further position us well in the home center market for the DIY or for the professional that shops there.  We look at increased products that could help us in the professional market where we are seeing the Henry team begin to integrate with the CCM team and spend more time at architects and we've got some great products on the Henry side, like the Blueskin, wraps and things like that. So we would look in those verticals. It might be house wraps.  It might be something like that. You can also see that we didn't wait very long after acquiring Henry to put our confidence in and Frank Ready and the team and go out and buy MB Technologies. It's a small business there in California, but adds some unique value to us and some unique products, and we think that team is doing well.  So, I'd say there's plenty of places for us in the Building Envelope to leverage the Carlisle Experience, to leverage our presence in the architectural community, to find brands that can help us penetrate different channels and really just be a more comprehensive solutions provider to the contractor, to the building owner, and to the architect. So, that's probably as much as I want to give you today.\nJosh Chan : That's great. Thanks, Chris, for the color and the time. \nChristian Koch : You bet. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. You may proceed.\nDavid MacGregor : Yeah, good afternoon everyone and congratulations on a strong quarter. \nChristian Koch : Thank you. \nKevin Zdimal : Thank you.\nDavid MacGregor : It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exciting to hear all the discussion around the innovation. I wish if we had more time, I'd probably ask you to talk more about embedding solar power generation capability into the roofing membrane. But maybe you could do another call and just focus on innovation and product opportunity.  I wanted to just ask you for an update on capacity investments such as if you could start off by just giving us some context on where we are now in terms of the capacity utilization or you're obviously on allocation. So I'm guessing it's pretty tight. But you're bringing on, I think, some TPO capacity next quarter and you've got some polyiso come on next year and probably a bunch of other things that I don't have in front of me.  But, just can you give us some sense of what the revenue opportunity is of just bringing that capacity on maybe at existing prices? And how we should think about that?\nChristian Koch : Yeah, I'll let Jim talk to you about that, the actual dollar revenue opportunity on those things. But where I'll go from a capacity thing as you know, you mentioned allocation. I want to be clear that the allocation that we have experienced, it has more to do in a lot of ways with raw materials than it does our capacity. We still have some capacity out there that we can utilize when we get raw materials and as you saw in the second quarter, we were able to do that and continue to increase volumes.  So, then we move to the two new lines \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we got the new TPO line. Then Carlisle PA and obviously, that's going to add some capacity in the industry or to the industry and to us. And I don't have exactly the dollar figure for that, so I'll let Jim handle that. And then Sikeston, obviously, we've got a new factory going on there and we have the possibility of putting two lines in there.  And so, without being too \u00e2\u0080\u0093 exposing too much of our strategy on capacity, that one or two lines can change the total amount of capacity that we put into the market. But we'll be prudent about it because there is no sense putting in overcapacity. We don't think that's good for the industry and we think the whole industry and ourselves have been pretty rational about not overbuilding there. So, I'll let Jim pick up on the dollar value. But the other thing I would tell you is, even though we won't have time for a technology discussion today, your comment on solar - we've already embedded solar into roofs. We have that capability. It was probably ten years ago that we were embedding solar into EPDM membranes and putting them on landfills.  We actually had an organization within Carlisle that did that, and it worked pretty well until the tax environment went away and it became unprofitable for people that were installing those roofs. But we do have that capability today and I just make note of that. Jim, do you want to follow-up with that?\nJim Giannakouros: Yeah, and as far as the capacity to kind of help you, David, it's our sixth \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the TPO manufacturing line number 6 that's getting fired up this year. And it's our ninth polyiso insulation facility. So without getting overly precise, that directionally should help you get to a range.\nDavid MacGregor : It does. Yeah. That does help. And then second question, just maybe somebody should ask about CIT, I guess, you mentioned, Chris, in your prepared remarks that you expect margin headwinds to abate in the second half. So, I just wanted to see if you could elaborate a little further on that.\nKevin Zdimal : Yes. We've done a lot of restructuring over the last couple of years in that business and as the airline travel is coming back, we are seeing the production of planes coming back, and that's going to be a positive to us. We think we have a lower overhead cost structure now and so our incrementals are going to be very strong there and we should start seeing that in the second half of this year and definitely into 2023.\nDavid MacGregor : So, it's really just about just leveraging what you've got there now or is there still sort of efficiency opportunity beyond just the productivity of having more volume?\nKevin Zdimal : Yes, there is efficiency as well that we've been investing in on the COS side, definitely in all our factories on that. We just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we got a big investment we've made in Tijuana, that's a beautiful facility down there. If you ever get a chance to visit as well as the mix, I mean, mix has a big impact on us as well. And we're seeing that as 787. We have more content on that plane than we do to the other planes. So as that eventually ramps up, that's going to be a big positive for us.\nDavid MacGregor : And just one last one, if I could. Just how should I think about kind of terminal velocity at the margin line there? What's achievable in terms of percentage margins at CIT once you get back into sort of full fighting form?\nChristian Koch : David, we used to talk about prior to COVID and then also prior to our switch to EBITDA, we used to be aspirational to 20-plus percent OI. And you can make the adjustment there on the EBITDA and where that would put you.  But that would be pretty consistent with some of our competitors and where they were and I might even say that's probably been - at least reinforced or maybe we might have even elevated it a little bit with the addition of the increased medical exposure and then the work that John Berlin and the team have done over the last two years to increase their \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or to decrease their footprint to make their existing facilities more efficient. But that kind of frames up where we were prior to COVID and all that. We were targeting a 20% plus OI for CIT.\nDavid MacGregor : Got it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very helpful. Thank you very much gentlemen.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse.\nDaniel Oppenheim : Thanks very much. Just wondering on the CCM side, with the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what you've had in terms of the growth north of 50% for the first half of the year and the talk of 40% through the full year that sort of implies significant slowing to about 25% in the second half. Understanding the environment is still uncertain. You talked about challenges potentially with weather, material availability and comping some pricing.  It doesn't sound as though there is anything else, but it's more of that conservatism around those issues. Is that fair?\nKevin Zdimal : That piece as well as \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so pricing, we had more pricing in the second half of last year than we did the first half of 2021. So, as you look at comps, we are not going to have as much year-over-year improvement.\nJim Giannakouros: And we also have volume, as well, Dan, when you think about 4Q was a record 4Q 2021. Volumes really ripped and that's where the acceleration really started coming into 2022 and so, it's both comps on both price and volume that is reflected in the updated guidance.\nDaniel Oppenheim : Great. Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: There are no more questions waiting at this time. So I'll pass the call back over to the management team for any closing remarks.\nChristian Koch : Thank you. Well, this concludes our second quarter 2020 earnings call. I want to thank everyone for your participation and your support of Carlisle. And once again, thank all of our employees who make it possible for us to deliver these results. We look forward to speaking with all of you at our next earnings call.\nOperator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Chris has covered revenue growth in his comments, so I will move to the EPS bridge on Slide 13. EPS growth in the quarter was driven primarily by price, volume and mix more than offsetting the negative impact of materials and labor inflation. Additionally, the Henry acquisition contributed $0.47 of accretion in the quarter. Moving to Slides 14 and 15. Carlisle ended the second quarter of 2022 with $353 million of cash on hand, with cash generated from continuing operations, totaling $181 million. Capital expenditures of $52 million, share repurchases of $50 million and dividends paid of $28 million during the quarter. We currently have 4.3 million shares remaining from our last share repurchase authorization.  Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 2x, down from 3x at the end of 20201, which as a result of the Henry acquisition was elevated compared to our target net debt to EBITDA range of 1x to 2x. Our policy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet. However, for the right acquisition, we will take on additional debt and through earnings growth and debt reduction, drive our net debt to EBITDA ratio back to our target range within one to two years.  Given our anticipated repayment of $350 million senior notes in the second half of 2022, and expected EBITDA growth for the balance of this year, we expect to reduce our net debt to EBITDA ratio to approximately 1.5x by the end of this year.  On Slide 16, we have our updated 2022 financial outlook. At CCM, as Chris mentioned, we are seeing strong re-roofing and new construction demand, as well as increasing interest in our energy-efficient solutions. We now expect total revenue growth at CCM to be approximately 40% in 2022, up from our previous estimate of approximately 30%.  At CWT, we now expect revenue to grow approximately 60% year-over-year including 20% organically. Henry continues to contend with supply constraints. But as Chris mentioned earlier, is navigating that well. With integration efforts tracking above our deal model, we reiterate our accretion target of $1.50 for 2022. At CIT, we are encouraged by growing backlogs in both our aerospace and medical businesses, and thus increasing our revenue guidance to approximately 20% in 2022, up from our previous estimate of low double-digit growth.  At CFT, with orders coming in as expected, and with positive pricing and new product sales ramping up, we continue to expect approximately 10% revenue growth in 2022. Finally, on a consolidated basis for Carlisle, we now expect to deliver revenue growth of approximately 40% in 2022. Given the strong fundamentals across our businesses, staying ahead of inflation with proactive pricing actions and driving strong leverage through COS, we expect total Carlisle adjusted EBITDA margins to expand approximately 650 basis points in full year 2022, up from our previous estimate of approximately 500 basis points.  With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. Chris? We are not splitting that out by segment, but more so looking at it overall. If you looked at total Carlisle, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll say a third of the increase is related to over a third year-over-year growth is price and a\u0302\u0080\u0093 or volume, sorry about that, a third is volume, two-thirds is price. Yes. We did it on purpose to consolidate it, so we are not going to go into the segment-by-segment piece of it. But yeah, overall, as I think I pointed out on the volume being one-third and price being two-thirds, you should be able to do the math off that piece of it to get to the 650 basis points. Yes. And this is Kevin. Half of their business is R&R as well. So you get that aftermarket business. So, 50% is new and 50% repair and replacement. Thank you. Yes. We've done a lot of restructuring over the last couple of years in that business and as the airline travel is coming back, we are seeing the production of planes coming back, and that's going to be a positive to us. We think we have a lower overhead cost structure now and so our incrementals are going to be very strong there and we should start seeing that in the second half of this year and definitely into 2023. Yes, there is efficiency as well that we've been investing in on the COS side, definitely in all our factories on that. We just a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we got a big investment we've made in Tijuana, that's a beautiful facility down there. If you ever get a chance to visit as well as the mix, I mean, mix has a big impact on us as well. And we're seeing that as 787. We have more content on that plane than we do to the other planes. So as that eventually ramps up, that's going to be a big positive for us. That piece as well as a\u0302\u0080\u0093 so pricing, we had more pricing in the second half of last year than we did the first half of 2021. So, as you look at comps, we are not going to have as much year-over-year improvement."

            "name": "Christian Koch",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2022 earnings call. As we enter the third quarter, we continue to operate in a highly uncertain environment, which has been the case each of these past three years. In addition to an ongoing global pandemic, tight labor markets and supply chain constraints, we are now seeing the global impact of the ongoing war in Ukraine, rising interest rates from a Federal Reserve concern with record inflation, and the uncertain outlook for the American consumer.  Despite this challenging environment, I am very pleased with the outstanding performance out teams delivered in the second quarter. Our positive performance depends on a Carlisle team that continues to deliver continues improvement mindset with a focus on results and an unrelenting commitment to deliver the Carlisle experience.  As a result, in the second quarter, we delivered another record performance including revenues, EBITDA and diluted EPS which moves us closer to delivering Vision 2025 including achieving $15 of earnings per share three years ahead of plan.  Please turn to Slide 3. Our record results continue to demonstrate that Vision 25 which has provided the clarity and consistency of mission since its launch in 2018 has been the right path for Carlisle even in these challenging times. In addition to our world-class team and proven business model, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve relied on a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow generation to provide both financial and strategic flexibility to execute our Vision 2025 roadmap.  A significant portion of our success has been driven by the multi-year process of reshaping our portfolio to pivot Carlisle to a diversified building products focus setting the stage for accelerated and sustainable value creation.  Allow me to update our progress on these strategic initiatives. Please turn to Slide 4. These initiatives include; drive 5% plus organic growth with operational leverage. In the second quarter, we delivered 42% organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth of 146%.  Utilize the Carlisle operating system, we use the Carlisle operating system to consistently drive efficiencies and enhance operating leverage by targeting cost savings of 1% to 2% of sales annually. We continue to execute on our Lean Sigma initiatives in the second quarter of 2022 and fully expect to be in our targeted range for this year.  Build scale with synergistic acquisitions. We continue to streamline and optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to build scale in our highest returning building businesses. With almost one year since our Henry purchase, the team continues to execute extremely well on delivering a smooth and efficient integration and is on pace to exceed our initial synergy targets of $30 million.  We remain excited about acquisition prospects within the building envelope and we are working an active pipeline of opportunities to augment our newest segment, CWT in a variety of construction products related verticals.  Continue to invest in and develop exceptional talent. Our Carlisle leadership system is a holistic approach to talent management that incorporates mutually reinforcing processes and tools for the selection and development of high caliber talent. In the second quarter, we held our week long Annual Leadership Summit with the current and future leaders of Carlisle with the aim of developing the next generation of leadership, while reinforcing the high standards expected of Carlisle leadership, we also discussed and developed ways to honestly assess our business performance and debated changes to facilitate continuous improvement in the organization and to enhance Carlislea\u0302\u0080\u0099s future performance.  Deploy over $3 billion into capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends through 2025. Notably, we are on an accelerated path here. Since the launch of Vision 2025, we have deployed over $2.7 billion into these areas.  Turning to our 2022 year-to-date actions, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve made capital investments of over $80 million into our businesses, made share repurchases totaling $175 million and paid approximately $57 million in dividends in 2022.  Now leta\u0302\u0080\u0099s turn to the second quarter and look at the drivers of our record performance. First on Slide 5, re-roofing demand. Re-roofing is a necessity for building owners in order to maintain the integrity of their substantial investments. Re-roofing demand continues to be a reliable, significant and sustainable driver for growth at CCM as we continue to seek more efficient of energy as a nation, increased amounts of insulation have been added to the re-roofing system which expands our served market and increases the value of the roof to building owners. Specifically, one of the easiest ways to enhance the energy efficiency of a roof is by adding more insulation.  In fact, over the past decade the ratio of insulation to single-ply roofing membrane board feet increased an estimated 40%, clearly demonstrating the annual increase in insulation consumption. The increasing number of low sloped roofs requiring re-roofing with more energy-efficient solutions over the next decade underpins our confidence and CCMa\u0302\u0080\u0099s ability to continue to generate above market growth.  This rising demand, coupled with our position as a key provider of energy-efficient solutions for buildings sets up CCM very well for additional growth.  Adding to these positive trends, we also expect continued high levels of backlog for the near future, much of this due to COVID-19 issues in 2020 and exacerbated by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages in 2021 and 2022.  Second, under the guide of Vision 2025, we continue to earn premium pricing in the marketplace by providing significant value to our customers through what we call the Carlisle Experience. Our continued and growing investment in new product innovation, the energy-efficiency benefits of our building envelope systems, our world-class manufacturing and distribution facilities and best-in-class customer service encompass the value proposition that our contractors have come to rely on from Carlisle.  Contractors in the other one they order from us, theya\u0302\u0080\u0099ll get energy-efficient building solutions of the best quality in the right amount at the right place and at the right time.  Third, we continue to seek synergistic and accretive acquisitions. We continue to be pleased with the Henry integration where synergy targets are ahead of schedule and we are on pace to achieve approximately $1.50 of accretion in 2022. We are also pleased that the acquired Henry leadership team has taken on the role of managing our diverse set of building envelope solutions in our newest segment CWT.  The solutions within CWT now include Henry, Carlisle Polyurethane Systems and Carlislea\u0302\u0080\u0099s legacy Diversified Products. In February, we acquired MB Technology, a California-based provider of roofing underlayments and membranes as a strategic bolt-on to CWT. We are pleased that this innovative company won a grant from the State of California to develop a modified bitumen product called Ecotorch, which incorporates recycled tires into the membrane.  This type of commitment to sustainability reinforces the value Carlisle places in our acquisition targets. Given the success of Henry and the establishment of this new segment, we are actively seeking similar, but larger tuck-in opportunities to enhance CWTa\u0302\u0080\u0099s already significant capabilities.  Four, since launching Vision 2025, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve remained focused on being a disciplined and superior capital allocator. Our strong operating cash flow enables Carlisle to remain financially and strategically flexible in order to drive value through a balanced and opportunistic approach to capital allocation. This approach includes investing in organic growth, returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and as I just mentioned, continuing to seek accretive acquisitions that enhance Carlislea\u0302\u0080\u0099s ability to create value for all our stakeholders.  Notably, we anticipate this August will mark Carlislea\u0302\u0080\u0099s 46th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. We are extremely proud to be approaching a half century of annually paying and increasing dividends, part of our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. We also remain on track to deploy $175 million in capital expenditures this year with a large share dedicated to fund growth products in our building products segments.  Fifth, we remain firmly committed to sustainability and ESG. Please turn to Slide 6. We are proud that our business model is squarely in the middle of global ESG trends as our products and systems enable a more efficient use of energy in buildings. Energy-efficient buildings can contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions on a large scale.  As evidenced by the fact that over 30% of GHT emissions annually are attributed to the operation of buildings. With our pivot to building products, and the accelerating demand for energy-efficient products in the broader market, Carlisle is enabling a more sustainable planet. Carlisle will help deliver a net zero future by supplying innovative energy-efficient products and solutions, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of construction materials and landfills.  One recent project to support this net zero mission includes the purchase of $1.6 million worth of equipment to recycle production scrap at our Dixon, California EPS plant. This investment will enable the diversion of 140 tons of waste from landfills annually. And more broadly, Carlisle is targeting the incorporation of more than 1 million tons of recycled materials and production scrap into our production stream by 2030 diverting their material from landfills.  Additionally, we continue to make significant strides towards aligning our GHT reduction strategy with the Science Based Targets Initiative or SBTI. SBTI defines and promotes best practices in science based targets to help provide companies with a clearly defined path to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement goals. Please turn to Slide 7 where we highlight our performance in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue increased 57% year-over-year with organic revenue up 42%. All segments contributed to this growth. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 185% year-over-year to $6.15 driven by higher volumes, price, Henrya\u0302\u0080\u0099s contribution and lean sigma initiatives, which more than offset inflation and operational disruptions.  For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 8. CCM delivered an outstanding quarter weathering challenges across its supply chain, pervasive inflationary pressures and labor constraints. CCM drove solid top-line growth due to continued strong demand, favorable product mix, new product sales and captured price earned by delivering on the Carlisle Experience.  Contractor backlogs remained quite healthy and bid activity remains strong giving us confidence for continued strength in the second half of 202 and optimism for the future.  Moving to Slide 9, sales accelerated in the second quarter at our newly created segment Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies where revenue increased over 23% year-over-year on a pro-forma basis. Growth continued across all product lines despite supply constraints, which began to ease in the second quarter versus earlier this year.  We continue to drive the Carlisle Experience through CWT and its organization as we seek to earn the increased value of our products and services. As I mentioned earlier, the CWT team is executing well on a multi-faceted integration plan and is leveraging volume growth on plan.  Moving to Slide 10. CIT revenue increased 26% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2022 with balanced growth in its commercial aerospace and medical technologies platforms. Backlog continues to grow and notably remains higher than CITa\u0302\u0080\u0099s pre-pandemic levels. We are encouraged by the TSA checkpoint numbers that show domestic air travel is nearing 2019 levels, driving increased demand for narrow body aircraft and eventually wide bodied aircraft as international travel returns to pre-COVID levels.  CIT continues to navigate supply chain disruptions, facility consolidation efforts, inflation, and mix headwinds. We do expect many of these influences to begin to abate in the second half of 2022, setting the stage for higher profitability.  Turning to CFT on Slide 11. CFT generated organic revenue growth of 5.5% year-over-year. We continue to be pleased by the progress CFT has made over the last couple of years including improved operational efficiencies and new product introductions.  We have also seen the team upgrade the customer service experience and earn strong price realization. We remain confident that commercial and operational improvements, combined with growing backlog will deliver strong revenue growth and incremental margins in the mid-40% range this year and as we continue to make progress towards our goal of 50% plus incremental margins in the coming years.  And with that, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll turn it over to Kevin to discuss some additional financial details and our updated outlook for the remainder of 2022. Kevin? Thanks, Kevin. I want to express again how pleased I am with the outstanding performance delivered by the entire Carlisle team this quarter and thank them once again for their perseverance, especially as we operate in this challenging and uncertain environment. Despite these challenges, the Carlisle continues to deliver our culture of continuous improvement, focused on delivering results in an environment of mutual respect and trust.  The outstanding results in the second quarter clearly demonstrate Carlislea\u0302\u0080\u0099s exceeding expectations and is on pace to achieve much of what we set out to accomplish in Vision 2025 including our goal to deliver $15 of earnings per share. As a result of solid fundamentals across all of our businesses, our outlook remains optimistic for the rest of 2022.  This concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Hey, good afternoon, Bryan. Well, Bryan, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I mean, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a very challenging market as we highlighted in the script there. You can see more changes, I think the 75 basis point increase today was received well, but obviously thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going to have some impact and I know there is concerns in the market as to whether the 75 basis point increase will tap down demand but not do anything because things like supply chain issues for the rest of the year.  So, look when we look at what our world looks like on a very North American kind of sector basis and construction with CWT and CCM as you said in our core non-resi business, look, you are right, we a\u0302\u0080\u0093 under our and what we were running an MSP program which is basically an allocation program this year tap all contractors that get some product we are out till the end of the year.  And we see ordering beginning already in 2023. So, we see those the current demand is continuing into Q3 and into Q4 obviously, we always are a little bit conscious of the fact that Q3 has burned us before weather with something like a hurricane, I think in 2018 that might have affected like in 2017. And then we have weather affecting obviously as we get close to the winter and we like a warmer fall, so that we keep more days on the roof. But, so the outlook, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s more of the same in Q3.  Obviously, we are lapping price increases that occurred last year. So the year-over-year comps will be down a little bit on that, but sequentially good. When we look at CWT and the new Weather Proofing Technologies group, really good trends there that I think even if we look at something like the home center market.  That team has delivered year in and year out. I mean, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll just go back to, I am familiar with to say 2014 and theya\u0302\u0080\u0099ve continued to do things like increase the content of their products on the shelves and a\u0302\u0080\u0093 but able to pass on pricing. Theya\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been able to garner new accounts in the home center market. And so, theya\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been able to overcome some of these inter-quarter challenges that occur from time-to-time.  But the big things for us going forward remain on the supply chain side, can we get enough product to continue to maximize our capacity and address the demand thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s out there and then obviously labor constraints remain.  I think they are going to be there for a while and with the supply constraints and with the labor constraints, it just sets up that this backlog probably doesna\u0302\u0080\u0099t get resolved right away and continues on into 2023. So, I think overall for us, pretty positive outlook for the remainder of the year and then hopefully continues into 2023. Yeah, Bryan, I think thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s right. And I think some of that conservatism is well founded in the fact that we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t know them as well as we know our core businesses and while the team is doing a great job and providing great information and insight and just doing a heck of a job on the integration, I think, that sets right. We want to be able to conservative here and make sure we understand all the puts and takes as we go through the year. Thanks. Yeah. Saree, as we look out, I think there are two vectors here on insulation are for one is just a simple one we highlighted and I think if you think about just what we talked about that the board feet of insulation to membrane up 40% over the last ten years, that gives you an idea of what that trajectory looks like.  And obviously, there are a lot of places still in the United States that have not officially raised their code to double up on the insulation. There is not a lot of places that are just not doing it, but as we begin to get people more educated, and they see the benefits of this, I think that rate will continue. That's a good rate to look at.  And I think the other thing is we have to look at new technology, polyiso and EPS have been around for a while, and our teams are working on, every day the next-gen or generation of both membranes and insulation. And we think there are some interesting concepts out there that could increase our value, reduce time of installation, which is a big deal, obviously out there for contractors and so, improve the efficiency of our entire system.  So, I like that run rate right now that without any new technology that we've shown over the past ten years, I think that continues. And then, as we add new technology, that could really accelerate things from a dollar perspective and from a volume perspective. So, I'll just leave it there. I mean, I know that's not as clear as you probably want. But I think that past history is a good indicator of what we are seeing happen in the marketplace today. Thank you. Yeah, sure. I just mentioned it with Saree there, a great question she had on what the future of insulation is and I think that's one of the areas that we are going to look at is how can we get better insulation, more efficient insulation to increase our value, decrease labor content per square foot installed. And really, those are the kind of things we're looking to do. We're really looking to help the contractor get the job done more efficiently, more effectively so they could take on more work and also use their labor more effectively. If you look at a couple of products that we've introduced in the last couple of years that I think are just outstanding products and are quite innovative, one is our APEEL product, where we are - got a piece of TPO membrane installed. There is a thin layer of film over it that when the job is completed, we can pull that back and you have the clean TPO white roof there.  In the past, without that, with all the workers that are on the roof and people installing things, you'd get a lot of dirt and they'd have to haul up pressure washers and things like that to clean it off and it just meant more labor, more time on the roof, more expense for the contractor. So we think that APEEL product does exactly what we want to do for the contractor and there is value there.  Another product we have is we have a velcro-adhered system in TPO that I also think is pretty innovative. And this is used in some pretty interesting installations. I remember a couple of years ago, I had a job. We were out talking to the contractor and they were going to put a roof on air traffic control center in the West and they really couldn't shut down the control center and so they needed something that could be put down without any adhesives or things like that. And so they use basically our TPO membrane with our velcro-adhered process and it's done mechanically there.  So, that's another one where we were able to complete a job in a difficult situation, please the end-user and make it easier on the contractor to get the job done, get off the roof and move on. So, another one is, obviously, our CAV-GRIP series where we continue to improve that. And that's an adhesive 2 component adhesive system we use and we've had great reception to that.  So those are a couple of examples I could keep going on, but that's probably enough for you to get an idea of the type of new products we're putting out there. But again, it really centers on improving the quality of the system, increasing the energy efficiency of the system and getting the contractor off the roof as quickly as possible allowing them to move on and make more money. I don't really think the outlook has changed. I can't give a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I am not going to give you the specifics on the outlook in terms of numbers. But what I will say is obviously, inflation on the supply chain side as much as we thought it would abate by this time, we are still seeing inflation in raw materials in the second quarter. We see it going into the third and fourth quarter and not abating to a big degree.  We still see labor inflation. I think that's pretty obvious for everyone out there that's been following the labor markets that there is more pressure on workers. We have a lot of open positions in the economy today. People are looking for more wages to offset the increases in healthcare costs or gasoline and community to work or things like that, rents and things like that.  So those pressures remain. So freight is another one and then obviously, fuel prices. So those four buckets, when you look at those and the impact they have on our customers and on our factories, those are the ones we focus in and they really haven't changed. There is still a\u0302\u0080\u0093 well, as you can see by what the Fed has done, they are still pretty high. You are welcome. Hey, Garik. So availability got a little bit better in some areas and I think that a\u0302\u0080\u0093 you see that manifested itself in a little bit higher sales because obviously, if a\u0302\u0080\u0093 with the orders we had in the backlog, if we can get the raw materials, we can produce more product and get it out the door. In terms of raw material pricing, again, we've said this now for a while, but I'll just reiterate it is we are really a\u0302\u0080\u0093 you can see this with these new products, and you can see it with our philosophy in the Carlisle Experience, we are really pricing to the value of the products in the market. So, if we see a reduction in pricing in the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I don't see it happening this year, but if it happen next year, I think we are going back to that's a separate function on raw materials than it is. It's not going to be tied into the price of our products. They are not commodities. They provide a lot of value, and it's really our job to take that value and explain it to our end-users or contractors, architects or distributors, get them to understand that, that's a price you want to pay for that product because of the value it's returning. Garik, I'll give you one example. We're launching the 16-foot wide TPO membrane into the market here and when you think about what it's going to do for the contractor in terms of labor saving and efficiency, my guess is that people will be willing to pay a premium for that product and not be as connected to raw materials on that, again because we'll be able to show the value and demonstrate it to the buyer. So right now, with the raw material supply, obviously, in the tight labor markets, when we look at CWT as a whole, the order backlog remains strong at the consolidated level. I mean, you do see signs of some softness emerging in some areas. I am not going to get into specifics there. But it's really not a softness to a a\u0302\u0080\u0093 it's really coming off quite a high volume.  And so there is still very good demand and very good shipping going on and I think a good tone in the marketplace. I think the other thing is we talked about new products. We talked about the value. I mentioned a little bit about what we are doing in some of the home centers by trying to put more product into the aisles in that that we own. So we'd have to segregate that out too.  But I think the demand going forward for CWT is good. I think it's durable and I think that we will see some a\u0302\u0080\u0093 obviously, some issues there with resi construction as interest rates rise. I mean, I don't think we can avoid that. But I am not sure that's all together bad. I think that might help the raw materials catch-up, get a little relief there and then 2023 still looks pretty positive for us. Thank you. Yeah. I mean we're seeing it, believe it or not, we're seeing it through the business. Demand has been pretty good right across the board, everything from architectural metals, to insulation, to commercial roofing. If you look at the different membranes, EPDM, PVC, TPO, I think those are all doing a\u0302\u0080\u0093 they are doing a great job there.  When you look at verticals, warehouses are up, educational buildings, office, maybe flack up stores are up. I think right across the board, it's still good across everything. And the reason I think that is, is because obviously, we've got this pent-up demand that came with COVID. We got into COVID and things kind of got behind and then we see the huge surge in the supply chain problems. And so if you look at this backlog that just like we said is continuing on from the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 now the end of 2022 into 2023 and that means that the sales into those verticals are going to continue. And we don't really see that changing for the foreseeable future.  So, yeah, I'd like to highlight something that I didn't feel good about right now. But I don't really think there is anything in the foreseeable future, like I said in the beginning that we see back half of 2022, strong. Again, there are issues out there on inflation, that's keeping pressure on supply, supply chain might be a little bit better, but probably not completely resolved and we still see demand being strong. Yeah, well, without going into anything too confidential, we don't want to tip anybody else off of our competitors. But what I would say is we've talked about expanding into the Building Envelope, CWT is doing the same thing. We are looking at different areas. We are looking at products that could further position us well in the home center market for the DIY or for the professional that shops there.  We look at increased products that could help us in the professional market where we are seeing the Henry team begin to integrate with the CCM team and spend more time at architects and we've got some great products on the Henry side, like the Blueskin, wraps and things like that. So we would look in those verticals. It might be house wraps.  It might be something like that. You can also see that we didn't wait very long after acquiring Henry to put our confidence in and Frank Ready and the team and go out and buy MB Technologies. It's a small business there in California, but adds some unique value to us and some unique products, and we think that team is doing well.  So, I'd say there's plenty of places for us in the Building Envelope to leverage the Carlisle Experience, to leverage our presence in the architectural community, to find brands that can help us penetrate different channels and really just be a more comprehensive solutions provider to the contractor, to the building owner, and to the architect. So, that's probably as much as I want to give you today. You bet. Thank you. Yeah, I'll let Jim talk to you about that, the actual dollar revenue opportunity on those things. But where I'll go from a capacity thing as you know, you mentioned allocation. I want to be clear that the allocation that we have experienced, it has more to do in a lot of ways with raw materials than it does our capacity. We still have some capacity out there that we can utilize when we get raw materials and as you saw in the second quarter, we were able to do that and continue to increase volumes.  So, then we move to the two new lines a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we got the new TPO line. Then Carlisle PA and obviously, that's going to add some capacity in the industry or to the industry and to us. And I don't have exactly the dollar figure for that, so I'll let Jim handle that. And then Sikeston, obviously, we've got a new factory going on there and we have the possibility of putting two lines in there.  And so, without being too a\u0302\u0080\u0093 exposing too much of our strategy on capacity, that one or two lines can change the total amount of capacity that we put into the market. But we'll be prudent about it because there is no sense putting in overcapacity. We don't think that's good for the industry and we think the whole industry and ourselves have been pretty rational about not overbuilding there. So, I'll let Jim pick up on the dollar value. But the other thing I would tell you is, even though we won't have time for a technology discussion today, your comment on solar - we've already embedded solar into roofs. We have that capability. It was probably ten years ago that we were embedding solar into EPDM membranes and putting them on landfills.  We actually had an organization within Carlisle that did that, and it worked pretty well until the tax environment went away and it became unprofitable for people that were installing those roofs. But we do have that capability today and I just make note of that. Jim, do you want to follow-up with that? David, we used to talk about prior to COVID and then also prior to our switch to EBITDA, we used to be aspirational to 20-plus percent OI. And you can make the adjustment there on the EBITDA and where that would put you.  But that would be pretty consistent with some of our competitors and where they were and I might even say that's probably been - at least reinforced or maybe we might have even elevated it a little bit with the addition of the increased medical exposure and then the work that John Berlin and the team have done over the last two years to increase their a\u0302\u0080\u0093 or to decrease their footprint to make their existing facilities more efficient. But that kind of frames up where we were prior to COVID and all that. We were targeting a 20% plus OI for CIT. Thank you. Well, this concludes our second quarter 2020 earnings call. I want to thank everyone for your participation and your support of Carlisle. And once again, thank all of our employees who make it possible for us to deliver these results. We look forward to speaking with all of you at our next earnings call."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Giannakouros, Carlisle's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jim, please go ahead.\nJim Giannakouros: Thank you, Selena. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Carlisle's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We released our first quarter financial results after the market closed today, and you can find both our press release and earnings call slide presentation in the Investor Relations section of our website, carlisle.com. On the call with me today are Chris Koch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Zdimal, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will begin with Chris updating our progress towards achieving our strategic plan, Vision 2025, highlights of our record first quarter and a discussion of current trends. Kevin will discuss the financial details and updated outlook for 2022. Following Chris and Kevin's remarks, we will open up the line for questions. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our press release and SEC filings. Carlisle provides non-GAAP financial information. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release, and in the appendix of our presentation materials, which are available on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris.\nChristian Koch: Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, as we mentioned in the press release, we are saddened by the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine, and the impact it is having on so many individuals and families around the world. We hope a quick resolution will come to the situation. Turning to our quarterly results, I'm pleased to announce Carlisle Companies delivered outstanding performance in what continues to be a very challenging environment. Before reviewing the performance in more detail, I'd like to thank our teams for their extraordinary efforts that drove our record operating results. Their commitment and significant efforts to minimize disruptions for our customers, contractors and distributor partners continue to be a competitive advantage for Carlisle. And it's helping to drive our business results to record levels. All of this despite significant issues within the supply chain, ongoing labor constraints and rising prices for raw materials, labor and services. Our goal at Carlisle is to drive continuous improvement and excellence throughout the organization, and ultimately to deliver on the promise of the Carlisle experience to our customers. Our record performance in the first quarter reflected our team's remarkable dedication to Carlisle and to delivering Vision 2025. Please turn to Slide 3. Our record results continue to demonstrate the Vision 2025, which has provided the clarity and consistency of mission to guide our efforts since its launch in 2018 with the right path for Carlisle's future. In addition to our world class team and proven business model, we relied on a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow generation to provide both financial and strategic flexibility to execute on our Vision 2025 roadmap to drive earnings in excess of $15 per share by 2025. A significant portion of our success has been driven by the multiyear process of reshaping our portfolio to a diversified building products focus, placing our emphasis on our highest performing businesses when setting Carlisle up for accelerated and sustainable future value creation. Allow me to update you on the drivers of our Vision 2025 strategy. These include drive 5% plus organic growth with operational leverage. In the first quarter, we delivered 45% organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth of over 150%; utilize the Carlisle operating system to consistently drive efficiencies, and operating leverage by targeting cost savings of 1% to 2% of sales annually. We delivered approximately 1% in the first quarter in line with our targeted range, build scale with synergistic acquisitions. We have streamlined and optimized our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to build scale in our highest returning building products businesses. Our recently announced segment structure including Construction Materials and Weather Proofing Technologies reinforce this objective, continue to invest in and develop exceptional talent. In 2021, we deployed the Carlisle leadership system, a holistic approach to talent management that incorporates mutually reinforcing processes and tools for the selection and development of high caliber talent. And deploy over $3 billion into capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends. With the addition of first quarter capital investments of over $30 million into our businesses, share repurchases totaling $125 million, dividends paid of $29 million. We have now deployed over $2.6 billion since the launch of Vision 2025. Now let's return to the first quarter and look at the drivers of our record performance. Please turn to Slide 4. First, sustainable nondiscretionary reroofing demand continues to be a driver at CCM. The number of low slope groups requiring reroofing with more energy efficient solutions over the next decade underpins our confidence and sustainable above market organic growth for the CCM segment. We expect CCM should continue to benefit from strong reroofing demand, solid new construction demand, and a growing push to install energy efficient solutions. In the near-term, we expect continued mid high single-digit annual volume growth boosted by pent up demand created by COVID-19 shutdowns, supply chain disruptions and continued labor shortages in the construction sector. Second, we continue to demonstrate price leadership. Under the guide of Vision 2025, we began to focus on earning price in the marketplace by delivering on the Carlisle experience, which means reliably providing our contractors, distributors and other channel partners with energy efficient building solutions of the best quality at the right place, at the right time. We wouldn't be able to provide the Carlisle experience or industry leading products without significant investment in employees, facilities, equipment and R&D, including over $1 billion of capital invested in our businesses over the past decade. Earning price for the value we create in the marketplace is contributing to the healthy profitability improvement we generated in the first quarter. And we expect continued contribution over the balance of the year. Third, we continue to seek synergistic and accretive acquisitions. Our newest segment, Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies was created soon after acquisition of the Henry company in September of 2021. Henry enhances CWT's total building envelope solutions value proposition. And with a balanced exposure to new construction and restoration, we've increased the size of our served markets and potential sales. Specifically, CWT's expanded portfolio is now more relevant to end users looking for increased energy efficiency, with approximately 70% of segment revenue, driven by sustainable solutions; added to a solid home center retail business. CWT has another avenue for growth. As we've upgraded our talent and processes around integrating acquired businesses into Carlisle over the last 3 years, I'm pleased to share with you that Henry's integration continues to go very well. Notably, we anticipate synergy capture beyond our initial $30 million target by 2025 and reiterate Henry's accretion estimate of $1.50 of EPS for 2022. Fourth, since launching Vision 2025, we've remained focused on being a disciplined and superior capital allocator. Our strong operating cash flow enables Carlisle to remain financially and strategically flexible in order to drive value through a balanced approach. This approach includes investing heavily in organic growth, returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, opportunistic share repurchases, and, as I just mentioned, continuing to seek accretive M&A. As a reminder, 2022 will be our 46th consecutive year of paying dividends and increasing dividends. And we remain on track to deploy $175 million in capital expenditures this year, with a large share dedicated to funding growth projects in our Building Products segment. Since we remain firmly committed to sustainability, and ESG, please turn to slide 5. We are proud that our business model is squarely in the middle of global ESG trends as our products enable a more efficient use of energy and buildings. More energy efficient buildings lower greenhouse gas emissions on a large scale, as evidenced by the fact that over 30% of GHG emissions annually are attributed to the operation of buildings. Approximately $2.5 billion of our sales last year were from LEED qualified products. And we estimate over 150 million megawatt hours of energy will be saved over the lifetime of those products in their buildings. As a further example, in the last 20 years Carlisle's insulation products have saved our customers nearly 290 million megawatt hours of energy or more than enough power to power every household in California for a year. With our pivot to building products and related sales expected to grow this year and beyond, Carlisle's contribution to creating a more sustainable planet will only accelerate. And to that end, we continue to make significant progress towards our goal of delivering a net zero commitment in 2022. I will now ask you to turn to Slide 6 where we highlight our performance in the first quarter of 2022. Revenue increased 59% year-over-year with organic revenue up 45%. All segments contributed to this growth. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 209% year-over-year to $4.26. As higher volumes, price and cost discipline more than offset inflation and operational disruptions, our teams faced during the quarter. For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 7. CCM delivered an outstanding quarter despite the severe challenges across its supply chain and the impact of labor and raw material constraints. CCM experienced solid top line growth due to continued strong demand, product mix, new product sales and capturing price earned by delivering on the Carlisle experience. Contractor backlogs are quite healthy when that activity remains very strong. Our contractors continue to note the material supply is their biggest challenge currently. And according to industry information source Associated Builders and Contractors, more than 75% of contractors are indicating that they have recently suffered some setback in delivering construction services with supply issues more challenging than labor. Given our investment in it, focus on sourcing materials and being held accountable to convert and ship our products with reliable delivery dates. CCM continues to be the market leader for our customers. Moving to Slide 8, sales were very strong in our newly created segment Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies, up approximately 30% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, driven by growth across all segments despite supply shortages. We continue to drive the Carlisle experience through CWT and its organization, especially at Henry, which gives us confidence that we will as a CCM earn the value of our products and services. Despite raw material supply and tight labor market challenges order volumes remain exceptionally strong, which we expect will average nicely in 2022. As we called out in the earnings release, we are very pleased with the integration and contribution of Henry to our results, and remain excited about the future of CWT under Frank Reddy and our new leadership team. Moving to Slide 9. CIT revenue increased 18.7% year-over-year in the first quarter of '22, with balanced growth and its commercial aerospace and medical technologies platforms. Backlog continues to grow across the major parts of CIT and now stands higher than pre-pandemic levels. We are encouraged by the recertification and accelerating deliveries of the 737 max and impending resumption of 787 deliveries later in the year. As we approach the summer travel season trends are also positive for international travel. This would be a welcome change for the past few years and longer term should support a resumption and wide body production. On to CFT. On Slide 10 CFT generated revenue growth of 8.1% year-over-year. We continue to be pleased by the progress CFT has made over the last year plus including increased introduction of new products, improved operational efficiencies, price realization, and an improved customer experience. We are confident combining these actions with growing backlog will deliver strong revenue growth and incremental margins in the mid 40% range this year. And we continue to make progress towards our goal of 50% plus incremental margins commonly seen in our competitors. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to discuss some additional financial details and our updated outlook for the remainder of 2022. Kevin?\nKevin Zdimal: Thank you, Chris. Chris has covered revenue growth in his comments, so I will move to the EPS bridge on Slide 12. I would highlight that our adjusted EPS growth in the quarter was driven primarily by volume, price, and mix more than offsetting the negative impact of materials and labor inflation. Additionally, the Henry acquisition contributed $0.32 of accretion in the quarter. Moving to Slide 13 and 14. Carlisle ended the first quarter of 2022 with $292 million of cash on hand, with cash generated from continuing operations, totaling $45 million. Capital expenditures of $31 million and share repurchases of $125 million during the quarter. We currently have 4.5 million shares remaining from our last share repurchase authorization of 5 million shares in 2021. Our net debt to EBITDA is 2.5x, down from 3x at the end of 20201, given our expected EBITDA growth for the balance of this year and are anticipated prepayments of our $350 senior notes in the second half of 2022. We expect to work net debt to EBITDA down to below 2x by the end of the year. On Slide 15, we have our updated 2022 financial outlook. At CCM, as Chris mentioned, we're seeing strong reroofing and new construction demand, as well as increasing interest in our energy efficient solutions. We expect total revenue growth at CCM to be approximately 30% in 2022. Notably, we don't expect CCM to experience typical seasonality as our teams are sourcing, manufacturing and selling all they can in this supply constrained environment. Additionally, we are not entering the spring with inventory levels we typically would have built in the winter months. At CWT, we expect revenue to grow approximately 55% to 60% year-over-year. including high-teens organically. Henry continues to contend with supply constraints. But as Chris mentioned earlier, is navigating that well. With integration efforts tracking above our original plan, we reiterate our accretion target of $1.50 for 2022. At CIT, we are encouraged by growing backlogs in both our aerospace and medical businesses, and thus increasing our revenue guidance to low double-digit growth in 2022. At CFT, with orders coming in as expected, we maintain our expectation for approximately 10% revenue growth in 2022. Finally, adding the pieces together for Carlisle as a whole, we expect to deliver revenue growth of over 30% in 2022.\nQ - Timothy Wojs: Given the strong fundamentals across our businesses, staying ahead of inflation with proactive pricing actions and driving strong leverage through COS. We expect total Carlisle adjusted EBITDA margins to expand approximately 500 basis points in full year 2022. You can see most of the other items on Slide 15 are unchanged with CapEx the exception. We now expect to spend $175 million on capital expenditures, up from our previous estimate of $150 million as we accelerate certain projects in our Building Product segments. With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. Chris?\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Kevin. In closing, we continue to deal with a complex, uncertain and evolving global marketplace complicated by the onset of the global pandemic in early 2020. Since then, we've experienced significant changes in the political environment and credible demand fluctuations that had serious implications for labor markets and raw materials. And since February of this year, an ongoing and deadly conflict in Eastern Europe. All of these things have made the workplace more challenging for our employees. And on behalf of Carlisle, I would like to thank them for their resilience, incredibly positive attitudes, and for living our culture of continuous improvement. While our businesses continue to navigate significant supply chain and inflationary challenges, solid demand fundamentals for all of our businesses remain intact. With all of our segments trending positively, and our teams executing extremely well, I am proud to disclose that with our record first quarter results, and our outlook for the remainder of 2022. That should markets remain stable and no further deterioration of the global economy occur, our expectation is that we will exceed our Vision 2025 goal of $15 of GAAP earnings per share this year. With that, we conclude our formal comments. And operator we are now ready for questions.\nOperator:  The first question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Please proceed.\nTimothy Wojs: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Nice job.\nKevin Zdimal: Hey, Tim. Good afternoon.\nTimothy Wojs: Thank you. Maybe just to start off here. When you think about just the volume growth relative to the price growth that you're seeing kind of in the CCM business and the CWT business. Is there any way to kind of, give us a flavor what you kind of saw on the volume side in the quarters and then kind of what's built into the respective guidance ranges for the year?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes, Tim. So, on the price volume, as we talked about in the last quarter that we're really not going to break that out now for competitive reasons. But we're trying to be more clear in different areas with CCM and CWT where we've broken that out into two different segments as well as trying to give you that full outlook on both the revenue side and the margin side. That's where we added the 500 basis points of margin expansion for the full year.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. Okay. And I guess when you think about just on the TTM side, and maybe even Waterproofing, just -- can you just give us some color on like orders and bidding and kind of the backlog activity and just kind of where you're seeing things extend to because it does seem like you're actually maybe even building backlog at this point, even though you're kind of delivering these types of numbers. So just kind of a little bit of an update on kind of what you're seeing there.\nChristian Koch: Yes, Tim. Chris here. So, the backlog, I think -- let's think about it a little bit of a different way, because we went through a new allocation process, which we're really looking at about five months. So, I think in terms of our orders, and what we're seeing, that's what the team is dealing with in order to allocate and make sure our distributors and contractors have good access to supply, so they give the immediate jobs done. Then we look at the broader industry, we touch on the trends in reroofing that we talked about, you and certainly us for a few years now in reroofing and now they just continue to build and then we add that new construction element in which I would say in the first quarter new construction remain healthy added to it. And then we've got the constraints on supply and that  labor. So, when we look out that, 2022, I think we've said before that we pretty much have visibility into the fact that there is as much as can be produced can be sold within 2022. And that is we've gone through the year has moved into 2023. So hopefully that gives you some color that demand backdrop and backlog are strong for a few quarters out.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. Okay, good. And then just last one I had just on Waterproofing technology itself, where do you see kind of the long-term margin opportunity within that segment? Now they're kind of breaking it out?\nChristian Koch: Well, I think our goals there are going to be we have to be the same as our core CCM business. And I think, with a team that's there and some refinement of the portfolio, I think, continuing there as well as some additional investment in new technology and new products. I think we can start approaching that 20% margin range plus that we've targeted in CCM in the past.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. Okay, good. I will hop back in queue. Congratulations guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman. Please proceed.\nMarius Morar: Hi. This is Marius actually for Adam. Thank you for taking my question. Just want to go back to the guidance for CCM. Obviously, it stayed at 30% and last quarter, it was also at 30%. The last quarter, I think also included CWT, so which doubled as of this quarter. So, I was just wondering if there was any change in the CCM guidance, just looking sort of like-for-like expectations there?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. A lot of that is just the mix and the scale of the businesses. When you look at CWT, it's a big piece. They didn't have Henry for. We acquired that in September. So that's when that came in. So, a little bit messy the comparison from that standpoint for when we reported in the first quarter. we had only talked the businesses combined. But now when we split them out, I mean it's definitely a pickup at both businesses that are improving, especially on the margin side.\nMarius Morar: So, it's safe to say that the growth for CCM last quarter was below 30% is what you were expecting?\nKevin Zdimal: Right. So, it was slightly below that, and now we are up to about 30%.\nMarius Morar: Got it. And then more of a sort of like historical background and then kind of like a longer-term question. Can you give us some insight into the pricing dynamics for CWT and how that compares versus CCM sort of like how is that -- are there differences in how that industry is structured compared to CCM? And have there been changes in the last few years? And where do you see it going from here? Thank you.\nJim Giannakouros: Hey, this is Jim. I'll take that one. As far as Henry, which is a nice chunk of the CW team, and you could think about it the way we talked about it in the -- at the end of last year that Henry's pricing discipline mirrored ours. They really stepped it up in 2017, 2018, just like we did. And so, the pricing philosophy in trying to stay ahead of raw material inflation, et cetera, mirrors that of our base CCM.\nMarius Morar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nBryan Blair: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Great start to the year.\nKevin Zdimal: Thanks, Bryan. Good afternoon.\nBryan Blair: Couple of quick clarification points. I first want to ask, Chris, you did say GAAP EPS in terms of 15 plus for 2022, is that correct?\nChristian Koch: Correct.\nBryan Blair: That's impressive. The other clarification point, Kevin, the 500 basis points margin expansion for the year, that\u2019s a consolidated figure, right?\nKevin Zdimal: Correct.\nBryan Blair: Okay. And can you break that out or provide us the insight into CCM and CWT margin expansion expectations?\nKevin Zdimal: The CCM is on the higher end between the two of those, and we are not going to go in and give exact margins by segment, but certainly, CCM is a bigger driver there?\nBryan Blair: Okay. That's fair. And Chris, you said that over time, CWT should close the gap to core CCM kind of profitability. As we think of the scaling of the platform over time organically, inorganically. What kind of incremental should be there? We've always thought of CCM inclusive of pretty aggressive growth investments we are seeing as having drop-through of 25%, 30% more recently more in the 30% range. Is that the right way to think about CWT going forward? Or are there other levers that can be pulled to bring that a bit higher?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. We think it's in that 30% plus maybe a little bit to that, but very similar from the CCM side.\nChristian Koch: Yes, Brian, and when we get into that, I think we've got a -- just to add some color to it. I think there's a significant opportunity for new products around this energy efficiency play with Henry. They had already started. And obviously, in their core or path down that way before we bought them. But there are significant opportunities for new product development that hopefully will create higher value in the marketplace and that translates hopefully into higher margins as well as we really have not gone -- we haven't completed even what I would say, the first 20% of the COS implementation in Henry because we just bought them and they're still working through that. So, there's some nice operational efficiencies to be gained there. And I think some other opportunities with the application of CapEx and automation and things like that. So, we really are excited about the pathway forward for both the sales growth and then op margin expansion there.\nBryan Blair: Okay. All great to hear. Congrats again.\nChristian Koch: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed.\nGarik Shmois: Hi. Thanks. Congrats on the great results. First of all, I wanted to ask if you could provide some more color on the cost basket, particularly for CCM, what you saw in the quarter and what the outlook is on the cost side?\nChristian Koch: Yes, Garik, good question. And last year, we were so pleased that we had substantial increases in raws, and it got offset. But if you just look at that cost basket from a raw materials perspective, it definitely increased substantially. Those trends have continued. When we talked, I think in our last call, we had hoped that we would start to see some relief as we got through into the third quarter on that front. And unfortunately, I think supply chain pressures and raw material prices are going to continue into the third and fourth quarter for this year. So, I don't think we're going to see relief on that side. And then labor, you see it in the papers every day that wages continue to increase. People are aware of inflation. And so, there's wage pressure out there, too. So, I think that cost basket continues the trends that we saw kind of post-COVID there in 2021.\nGarik Shmois: Okay, thanks. Follow-up question is related to CCM EBITDA margins. Just given really impressive results in the quarter, but also given how you're not expecting seasonality to be quite how it normally is during the year. To the extent that you could speak to the sustainability of this new EBITDA margin level for CCM. That would be helpful.\nChristian Koch: Yes. I think this is what, in a lot of ways, we have talked about over the past few years around the Carlisle experience and value creation, the new products that we've introduced, the efficiencies. We're putting in the 16-foot wide TPL line is coming out. We're investing in a new lead facility down in sites, Missouri for polyiso. We continue to invest in our people. I mean you know the story, R&D. And so, I think we are earning commensurate with the value we provided in the marketplace. And I think that is going to be sustainable based upon our investments in R&D. The trends we see in ESG building efficiency and really the reroofing picture that's been there to hold up demand. So, I think we are -- we are like where we are. And we think we are -- it's a reflection of all the investments and the hard work that the team has done over the last 10 years.\nKevin Zdimal: And to expand that --  I was just going to add on that there has been some inflation on the raw materials. So some of that will hit us in the second half of the year as well. But the goal is always to increase margins longer-term. So, there will be a little bit of a balance there as we go through the year.\nGarik Shmois: Okay, got it. Last question, if I can sneak one more in. Just on CWT and the exposure to it for residential construction, just given the concern with rising rates. Just curious if you're seeing any impact on your order book there?\nChristian Koch: Not really. I mean we continue to see strong demand for housing. I think we've seen some reports out from some of the builders that despite rates -- interest rates rising, there may be an increase in the monthly payment, but that there's still significant demand and houses are being snapped up pretty quickly. I think we know and you probably are well aware of this, that we don't have enough housing stock in the country. And so right now, we're not seeing any impact on our demand going forward.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. Thanks again.\nChristian Koch: Yes. You bet, Garik.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nDaniel Oppenheim: Great. Thanks very much. I think most have been answered. But just in terms of CCM in terms of the cost pressure into the thoughts on margins, -- as you think about the -- working through the course of this year and some of the inflationary pressures that have come more recently are you thinking in terms of just challenges -- in terms of implementing pricing as we go through sort of second quarter and then improving over the remainder of the year? How do you think about such trajectory of margins and CCM?\nChristian Koch: Yes. Maybe I'll let Kevin add on to this, too. But if I start with things like the pricing, you mentioned that first. I think we are seeing continued pressure on cost. And so obviously, the pricing actions will have to be there. And I think you might be aware that pricing action has been taken here since the first of the year and likely will continue if that persists. So, on that side, I think will be covered there. As we get to the third and fourth quarter, I said, I don't really see a lot of relief on this cost side. So, we'll see what happens. I mean, again, we haven't talked about China much or trucking and things like that, but there are capacity issues with getting labor back, but there are also things just around the transportation side that might affect us. So, we do get some raw materials that need to be transported and significant lengths and that can impact us as well. So, on price. But Kevin, do you want to add to that?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes, the only other piece of the first quarter, we did have some favorable mix. So that could have a bit of an impact on the second half of the year as well, but not overly significant.\nDaniel Oppenheim: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David McGregor with Longbow Research. Please proceed.\nDavid McGregor: Yes, good afternoon and congratulations on these wonderful results. I want to ask about incremental profitability. And if you've addressed this, I apologize because I had to get off the call for a few minutes. But you're talking about the 500 basis points of margin for 2022, which is helpful guidance. So we appreciate that. I'm just wondering if you can talk about incremental profitability of the CCM 30% or off the 55 to 60 CWT. So, we just triangulate against that.\nChristian Koch: The -- yes. So, as we talked, we're talking CWT previously on this call about a little bit more than 30% right in that 30% range and CCM would be a little bit higher than that in the current rate in this environment.\nDavid McGregor: Okay. All right. Thank you for that. And then we talked a lot here about CCM, CWT. Maybe I could ask about CIT for a moment. And it seems as though you're getting incrementally more optimistic about how the commercial aerospace side of that business plays out through the second half of this year. And into 2023, are you seeing actual orders coming through right now? Or is this just kind of talk about the build rate and the orders will come. I'm just trying to get a sense of just how tangible the -- so your sensitive optimism might be?\nChristian Koch: Yes. David, we are seeing orders. It's happening. And I think the nice thing is that when we talked earlier on, even when this started that we still felt that '24, '25 timeframe, things would come back. John and the team did a lot of work on restructuring and taking cost out of the organization. And so, as these orders are coming back, we're expecting that while there may be bumps, I mean, when the 787 gets exactly certified, I don't know. But if you have that North Star of 2025 as a return on this. We think it's kind of walking just like we thought it would. It was good to see 31 737 MAXs. It's up and flying again and production is back up. So that obviously will have an impact on demand. So yes, it is real orders and the team, I know is excited about continuing to see air travel pickup and profitability return to airlines and reinvestment in things like new aircraft, but also in things like retrofits around ARINC 791 and satellite Internet access and things like that, that we invested in before.\nDavid McGregor: That's great. And if I could just maybe squeeze 1 more in. Again, on CIT, there had been talk that once we got past the pandemic, you'd see a return of discretionary surgical procedures that would be good for the medical business. Are you seeing order flow off that as well?\nChristian Koch: Yes. In both cases, we're seeing actual orders and the team has more projects underway now. And so, I think, again, that's playing out just like most people would think, obviously, COVID put a huge -- had a huge impact on hospitals and the medical profession in a lot of different ways. And so it's nice to see that there's been some relief there and people are back to working on new products, which that's where we want to be targeted in the medical space.\nDavid McGregor: Thanks, Chris.\nChristian Koch: Yes. You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please proceed.\nKevin Hocevar: Hey, good afternoon, everybody and nice quarter. Maybe I'll start -- I know you're not breaking out volumes and price in CCM. But I'm curious you know what your volumes did, what the market did, at least you know what a single ply. So curious if you believe you're gaining share in the space just given how strong your results were there.\nChristian Koch: Yes, Kevin, there's been so much over the last -- that's going to -- you're probably not going to like this answer, but there's been so much flux in demand and supply chain issues in that. I would say that my personal feeling is that in the -- over the longer term, our market share has remained pretty constant amongst all the players. We get some ebbs and flows. A lot of that based on availability or certain areas where some might have a higher market share in a product line. But overall, I'd say if we look back 2, 3 years, the margin or margins, excuse me, the market share is relatively consistent.\nKevin Hocevar: And you mentioned an inability to -- just given how strong demand is an inability to build the normal level of inventories that normally would in the first quarter as you head into the spring. So, it sounds like you were selling everything you could make in the quarter. So, you got $881 million of sales in Construction Materials. Is that kind of what you can do quarterly? Is there no seasonality? Or would there still be some level of sequential pickup at least in pricing because I know you have another price increase out and maybe that's the only thing, but -- or does volume pick up sequentially too. I guess I'm just trying to understand seasonality -- the normal seasonality is out the window, but is there any seasonality where we see some level of uplift from first quarter levels in that business?\nKevin Zdimal: Well, again, I think you saw it as we went through the quarter. I mean, I think as -- if we can get -- it really depends on raw materials to me. If we can get raw materials, we obviously have the capacity to make more product. And then if the contractors can get more product and provided they can get more labor than they can get these jobs that are backlog completed. So, there is some opportunity to still grow. We are all just constrained by this -- the labor and I would say, raw material situation that we've had. So definitely more to come if the things line up and there could be then increased sales in the season. But as it stands now, I mean, you've got a forecast, and I'd say we're being conservative on our outlook towards raw materials getting a lot better in the second quarter. And again, like I said, it's probably more of a Q3, Q4 thing, and obviously, we'll keep you updated.\nKevin Hocevar: Yes. And maybe lastly, I mean I know that on commercial, there's not as much inventory that is held in the channel from distributors on compared to, say, residential roofing. But curious if you believe that kind of what you're selling is getting put on roofs quickly? Or is there any inventory out there in the channel? -- curious to take there.\nChristian Koch: Yes. I think there's inventory. I think if you went out, I think part of the inventory is may have an order and they're waiting on a component or something like that. So, they may have a little bit built up or they're anticipating some work that needs to be done and they've been able to get access to certain products that they want inventory. So, I think there is, in certain cases, inventory built up -- being built up. But what I would say is that inventory is allocated. I mean it's got a job in home to go to. And again, that's why I say if we can get some more access to raws and that we can get the flow moving there.\nKevin Hocevar: Yes. Okay. Thank you very much.\nChristian Koch: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Joyner with BMO. Please proceed.\nJohn Joyner: Hey, how is going. Thank you for taking my questions.\nChristian Koch: Hi, John.\nJohn Joyner: I think you might have broken my model. And Chris, just following up on your comment of exceeding $15 of EPS this year. I will give you the award for understatement of the day on that one.\nChristian Koch: Thank you.\nJohn Joyner: But anyway, my first question, I guess, is versus your internal assumptions, I mean, what surprised you the most in the quarter? I mean, was it just being able to get more product shipped, but because obviously, the top line exceeded expectations in the CCM business and such and then the margins widely exceeded expectations. But what surprised you?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes, it's Kevin. There wasn't one thing. I think it's across the board. It's just everything was very favorable from getting more raw material than we expected, led to the higher production, and then we were very efficient on that production through the Carlisle operating system. So, efficiencies were very positive. The raw material inflation led to the pricing, and that definitely helped the pricing realization that we're able to get throughout the quarter. And then as I mentioned, with some of that positive mix as well. So, when you put all those things together, that led to the superior beat as well as the full year increase in outlook.\nJohn Joyner: Okay. Thank you. And then I guess just kind of following up on that, when -- and I know we talked about this before, but when you look at the commercial roofing market overall, right? And just how the industry continues to stay rational. I mean, if I look at oil futures at $105, historically, Carlisle would be much more affected by that. And I guess that industry is rational. You're getting pricing, but so with demand, things are robust, it's understandable. But on the other side of this, how do you see this holding up? I mean I can probably answer it for you because I think I know what you would say, but -- how do you see it holding up? Do you see the industry just continuing to stay rational? And just any kind of comments overall on like kind of structural changes, say, over the past 5 years?\nChristian Koch: Yes. I think probably unintentional, but when we look back over a 10-year time frame and when we look at where capacity was added, the -- I would say, CAGR, if we look for even 2014 to 2021, I mean, I think when we look at the industry, probably really targeting that mid to high single digits, 6%, 7%, 8%. And when you look at our capacity, we've added from that time on, it takes a long time to put one of these plants in and get approval and do all of that. And I think people have done a good job of adding just the right amount of capacity to grow with the business. I mean we used to think that 1 building or factory would contribute about 5%. Obviously, as the industry has grown, that's probably getting to be less, maybe 3.5%, something like that. But I think it has been rational. I think it's because there's very good information and data on roofing and building starts and things like that. I think people have some pretty good intelligence around seeing what the industry capacity can be, what demand is going to be. And as we've said, we can track that reroofing pretty closely, and Jim has put out a model on that. So rational is one thing, and I think it's more rational around what the future holds. Now a couple of things that are happening now are new products around ESG that they're going to change things and may increase the CAGR from at least a dollar value as these things become less of a commodity product that are put on and now begin to contribute to systems around energy efficiency and more value is created that will probably encourage more R&D investment. And so, I think the trends continue. I'd like the reroofing trajectory that's out there and the fact that we've got visibility to 10 years or so of strong demand. I mean new construction as long as it stays positive, I think, is a real contributor I think there's opportunities around ESG, as I talked about. And then we've got a lot of opportunities on the margin side around COS, but also on factory automation, Internet of Things connectivity in the plants and things like that. So, we keep doing what we said we were going to do in Vision 2025, keep being good capital allocators, invest in R&D, invest in talent. And I think we've just got a really good marketplace that continues to evolve in a positive direction. So sorry for that long answer, John, but \u2026\nJohn Joyner: No, that's great. That's -- I appreciate it. So yes, that's all. I did take Joe, by the way, and he said, I will put it in Joel's terms. I thought it was a misprint. All right. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.\nChristian Koch: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Daniel Wang with Berenberg. Please proceed.\nDaniel Wang: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been answered, so I only got one for you guys. But is there an update on what the free cash flow conversion might look like this year? I think you guys had about 100% as our expectation last quarter, but I mean I missed in the prepared remarks.\nChristian Koch: Yes, that remains our expectation be, right around 100% for cash conversion.\nDaniel Wang: All right. Perfect. Thank you.\nChristian Koch: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. I would like to pass the conference back to Chairman and CEO of Carlisle Companies, Chris Koch, for closing remarks.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Selina, and thanks, everyone. This concludes our first quarter 2022 earnings call. And thanks for your participation and the questions. We look forward to speaking with you at the next earnings call. Goodbye.\nOperator: That concludes the Carlisle Companies first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Chris has covered revenue growth in his comments, so I will move to the EPS bridge on Slide 12. I would highlight that our adjusted EPS growth in the quarter was driven primarily by volume, price, and mix more than offsetting the negative impact of materials and labor inflation. Additionally, the Henry acquisition contributed $0.32 of accretion in the quarter. Moving to Slide 13 and 14. Carlisle ended the first quarter of 2022 with $292 million of cash on hand, with cash generated from continuing operations, totaling $45 million. Capital expenditures of $31 million and share repurchases of $125 million during the quarter. We currently have 4.5 million shares remaining from our last share repurchase authorization of 5 million shares in 2021. Our net debt to EBITDA is 2.5x, down from 3x at the end of 20201, given our expected EBITDA growth for the balance of this year and are anticipated prepayments of our $350 senior notes in the second half of 2022. We expect to work net debt to EBITDA down to below 2x by the end of the year. On Slide 15, we have our updated 2022 financial outlook. At CCM, as Chris mentioned, we're seeing strong reroofing and new construction demand, as well as increasing interest in our energy efficient solutions. We expect total revenue growth at CCM to be approximately 30% in 2022. Notably, we don't expect CCM to experience typical seasonality as our teams are sourcing, manufacturing and selling all they can in this supply constrained environment. Additionally, we are not entering the spring with inventory levels we typically would have built in the winter months. At CWT, we expect revenue to grow approximately 55% to 60% year-over-year. including high-teens organically. Henry continues to contend with supply constraints. But as Chris mentioned earlier, is navigating that well. With integration efforts tracking above our original plan, we reiterate our accretion target of $1.50 for 2022. At CIT, we are encouraged by growing backlogs in both our aerospace and medical businesses, and thus increasing our revenue guidance to low double-digit growth in 2022. At CFT, with orders coming in as expected, we maintain our expectation for approximately 10% revenue growth in 2022. Finally, adding the pieces together for Carlisle as a whole, we expect to deliver revenue growth of over 30% in 2022. Hey, Tim. Good afternoon. Yes, Tim. So, on the price volume, as we talked about in the last quarter that we're really not going to break that out now for competitive reasons. But we're trying to be more clear in different areas with CCM and CWT where we've broken that out into two different segments as well as trying to give you that full outlook on both the revenue side and the margin side. That's where we added the 500 basis points of margin expansion for the full year. Yes. A lot of that is just the mix and the scale of the businesses. When you look at CWT, it's a big piece. They didn't have Henry for. We acquired that in September. So that's when that came in. So, a little bit messy the comparison from that standpoint for when we reported in the first quarter. we had only talked the businesses combined. But now when we split them out, I mean it's definitely a pickup at both businesses that are improving, especially on the margin side. Right. So, it was slightly below that, and now we are up to about 30%. Thanks, Bryan. Good afternoon. Correct. The CCM is on the higher end between the two of those, and we are not going to go in and give exact margins by segment, but certainly, CCM is a bigger driver there? Yes. We think it's in that 30% plus maybe a little bit to that, but very similar from the CCM side. And to expand that --  I was just going to add on that there has been some inflation on the raw materials. So some of that will hit us in the second half of the year as well. But the goal is always to increase margins longer-term. So, there will be a little bit of a balance there as we go through the year. Yes, the only other piece of the first quarter, we did have some favorable mix. So that could have a bit of an impact on the second half of the year as well, but not overly significant. Well, again, I think you saw it as we went through the quarter. I mean, I think as -- if we can get -- it really depends on raw materials to me. If we can get raw materials, we obviously have the capacity to make more product. And then if the contractors can get more product and provided they can get more labor than they can get these jobs that are backlog completed. So, there is some opportunity to still grow. We are all just constrained by this -- the labor and I would say, raw material situation that we've had. So definitely more to come if the things line up and there could be then increased sales in the season. But as it stands now, I mean, you've got a forecast, and I'd say we're being conservative on our outlook towards raw materials getting a lot better in the second quarter. And again, like I said, it's probably more of a Q3, Q4 thing, and obviously, we'll keep you updated. Yes, it's Kevin. There wasn't one thing. I think it's across the board. It's just everything was very favorable from getting more raw material than we expected, led to the higher production, and then we were very efficient on that production through the Carlisle operating system. So, efficiencies were very positive. The raw material inflation led to the pricing, and that definitely helped the pricing realization that we're able to get throughout the quarter. And then as I mentioned, with some of that positive mix as well. So, when you put all those things together, that led to the superior beat as well as the full year increase in outlook."

            "name": "Christian Koch",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, as we mentioned in the press release, we are saddened by the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine, and the impact it is having on so many individuals and families around the world. We hope a quick resolution will come to the situation. Turning to our quarterly results, I'm pleased to announce Carlisle Companies delivered outstanding performance in what continues to be a very challenging environment. Before reviewing the performance in more detail, I'd like to thank our teams for their extraordinary efforts that drove our record operating results. Their commitment and significant efforts to minimize disruptions for our customers, contractors and distributor partners continue to be a competitive advantage for Carlisle. And it's helping to drive our business results to record levels. All of this despite significant issues within the supply chain, ongoing labor constraints and rising prices for raw materials, labor and services. Our goal at Carlisle is to drive continuous improvement and excellence throughout the organization, and ultimately to deliver on the promise of the Carlisle experience to our customers. Our record performance in the first quarter reflected our team's remarkable dedication to Carlisle and to delivering Vision 2025. Please turn to Slide 3. Our record results continue to demonstrate the Vision 2025, which has provided the clarity and consistency of mission to guide our efforts since its launch in 2018 with the right path for Carlisle's future. In addition to our world class team and proven business model, we relied on a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow generation to provide both financial and strategic flexibility to execute on our Vision 2025 roadmap to drive earnings in excess of $15 per share by 2025. A significant portion of our success has been driven by the multiyear process of reshaping our portfolio to a diversified building products focus, placing our emphasis on our highest performing businesses when setting Carlisle up for accelerated and sustainable future value creation. Allow me to update you on the drivers of our Vision 2025 strategy. These include drive 5% plus organic growth with operational leverage. In the first quarter, we delivered 45% organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth of over 150%; utilize the Carlisle operating system to consistently drive efficiencies, and operating leverage by targeting cost savings of 1% to 2% of sales annually. We delivered approximately 1% in the first quarter in line with our targeted range, build scale with synergistic acquisitions. We have streamlined and optimized our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to build scale in our highest returning building products businesses. Our recently announced segment structure including Construction Materials and Weather Proofing Technologies reinforce this objective, continue to invest in and develop exceptional talent. In 2021, we deployed the Carlisle leadership system, a holistic approach to talent management that incorporates mutually reinforcing processes and tools for the selection and development of high caliber talent. And deploy over $3 billion into capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends. With the addition of first quarter capital investments of over $30 million into our businesses, share repurchases totaling $125 million, dividends paid of $29 million. We have now deployed over $2.6 billion since the launch of Vision 2025. Now let's return to the first quarter and look at the drivers of our record performance. Please turn to Slide 4. First, sustainable nondiscretionary reroofing demand continues to be a driver at CCM. The number of low slope groups requiring reroofing with more energy efficient solutions over the next decade underpins our confidence and sustainable above market organic growth for the CCM segment. We expect CCM should continue to benefit from strong reroofing demand, solid new construction demand, and a growing push to install energy efficient solutions. In the near-term, we expect continued mid high single-digit annual volume growth boosted by pent up demand created by COVID-19 shutdowns, supply chain disruptions and continued labor shortages in the construction sector. Second, we continue to demonstrate price leadership. Under the guide of Vision 2025, we began to focus on earning price in the marketplace by delivering on the Carlisle experience, which means reliably providing our contractors, distributors and other channel partners with energy efficient building solutions of the best quality at the right place, at the right time. We wouldn't be able to provide the Carlisle experience or industry leading products without significant investment in employees, facilities, equipment and R&D, including over $1 billion of capital invested in our businesses over the past decade. Earning price for the value we create in the marketplace is contributing to the healthy profitability improvement we generated in the first quarter. And we expect continued contribution over the balance of the year. Third, we continue to seek synergistic and accretive acquisitions. Our newest segment, Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies was created soon after acquisition of the Henry company in September of 2021. Henry enhances CWT's total building envelope solutions value proposition. And with a balanced exposure to new construction and restoration, we've increased the size of our served markets and potential sales. Specifically, CWT's expanded portfolio is now more relevant to end users looking for increased energy efficiency, with approximately 70% of segment revenue, driven by sustainable solutions; added to a solid home center retail business. CWT has another avenue for growth. As we've upgraded our talent and processes around integrating acquired businesses into Carlisle over the last 3 years, I'm pleased to share with you that Henry's integration continues to go very well. Notably, we anticipate synergy capture beyond our initial $30 million target by 2025 and reiterate Henry's accretion estimate of $1.50 of EPS for 2022. Fourth, since launching Vision 2025, we've remained focused on being a disciplined and superior capital allocator. Our strong operating cash flow enables Carlisle to remain financially and strategically flexible in order to drive value through a balanced approach. This approach includes investing heavily in organic growth, returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, opportunistic share repurchases, and, as I just mentioned, continuing to seek accretive M&A. As a reminder, 2022 will be our 46th consecutive year of paying dividends and increasing dividends. And we remain on track to deploy $175 million in capital expenditures this year, with a large share dedicated to funding growth projects in our Building Products segment. Since we remain firmly committed to sustainability, and ESG, please turn to slide 5. We are proud that our business model is squarely in the middle of global ESG trends as our products enable a more efficient use of energy and buildings. More energy efficient buildings lower greenhouse gas emissions on a large scale, as evidenced by the fact that over 30% of GHG emissions annually are attributed to the operation of buildings. Approximately $2.5 billion of our sales last year were from LEED qualified products. And we estimate over 150 million megawatt hours of energy will be saved over the lifetime of those products in their buildings. As a further example, in the last 20 years Carlisle's insulation products have saved our customers nearly 290 million megawatt hours of energy or more than enough power to power every household in California for a year. With our pivot to building products and related sales expected to grow this year and beyond, Carlisle's contribution to creating a more sustainable planet will only accelerate. And to that end, we continue to make significant progress towards our goal of delivering a net zero commitment in 2022. I will now ask you to turn to Slide 6 where we highlight our performance in the first quarter of 2022. Revenue increased 59% year-over-year with organic revenue up 45%. All segments contributed to this growth. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 209% year-over-year to $4.26. As higher volumes, price and cost discipline more than offset inflation and operational disruptions, our teams faced during the quarter. For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 7. CCM delivered an outstanding quarter despite the severe challenges across its supply chain and the impact of labor and raw material constraints. CCM experienced solid top line growth due to continued strong demand, product mix, new product sales and capturing price earned by delivering on the Carlisle experience. Contractor backlogs are quite healthy when that activity remains very strong. Our contractors continue to note the material supply is their biggest challenge currently. And according to industry information source Associated Builders and Contractors, more than 75% of contractors are indicating that they have recently suffered some setback in delivering construction services with supply issues more challenging than labor. Given our investment in it, focus on sourcing materials and being held accountable to convert and ship our products with reliable delivery dates. CCM continues to be the market leader for our customers. Moving to Slide 8, sales were very strong in our newly created segment Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies, up approximately 30% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, driven by growth across all segments despite supply shortages. We continue to drive the Carlisle experience through CWT and its organization, especially at Henry, which gives us confidence that we will as a CCM earn the value of our products and services. Despite raw material supply and tight labor market challenges order volumes remain exceptionally strong, which we expect will average nicely in 2022. As we called out in the earnings release, we are very pleased with the integration and contribution of Henry to our results, and remain excited about the future of CWT under Frank Reddy and our new leadership team. Moving to Slide 9. CIT revenue increased 18.7% year-over-year in the first quarter of '22, with balanced growth and its commercial aerospace and medical technologies platforms. Backlog continues to grow across the major parts of CIT and now stands higher than pre-pandemic levels. We are encouraged by the recertification and accelerating deliveries of the 737 max and impending resumption of 787 deliveries later in the year. As we approach the summer travel season trends are also positive for international travel. This would be a welcome change for the past few years and longer term should support a resumption and wide body production. On to CFT. On Slide 10 CFT generated revenue growth of 8.1% year-over-year. We continue to be pleased by the progress CFT has made over the last year plus including increased introduction of new products, improved operational efficiencies, price realization, and an improved customer experience. We are confident combining these actions with growing backlog will deliver strong revenue growth and incremental margins in the mid 40% range this year. And we continue to make progress towards our goal of 50% plus incremental margins commonly seen in our competitors. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to discuss some additional financial details and our updated outlook for the remainder of 2022. Kevin? Thanks, Kevin. In closing, we continue to deal with a complex, uncertain and evolving global marketplace complicated by the onset of the global pandemic in early 2020. Since then, we've experienced significant changes in the political environment and credible demand fluctuations that had serious implications for labor markets and raw materials. And since February of this year, an ongoing and deadly conflict in Eastern Europe. All of these things have made the workplace more challenging for our employees. And on behalf of Carlisle, I would like to thank them for their resilience, incredibly positive attitudes, and for living our culture of continuous improvement. While our businesses continue to navigate significant supply chain and inflationary challenges, solid demand fundamentals for all of our businesses remain intact. With all of our segments trending positively, and our teams executing extremely well, I am proud to disclose that with our record first quarter results, and our outlook for the remainder of 2022. That should markets remain stable and no further deterioration of the global economy occur, our expectation is that we will exceed our Vision 2025 goal of $15 of GAAP earnings per share this year. With that, we conclude our formal comments. And operator we are now ready for questions. Yes, Tim. Chris here. So, the backlog, I think -- let's think about it a little bit of a different way, because we went through a new allocation process, which we're really looking at about five months. So, I think in terms of our orders, and what we're seeing, that's what the team is dealing with in order to allocate and make sure our distributors and contractors have good access to supply, so they give the immediate jobs done. Then we look at the broader industry, we touch on the trends in reroofing that we talked about, you and certainly us for a few years now in reroofing and now they just continue to build and then we add that new construction element in which I would say in the first quarter new construction remain healthy added to it. And then we've got the constraints on supply and that  labor. So, when we look out that, 2022, I think we've said before that we pretty much have visibility into the fact that there is as much as can be produced can be sold within 2022. And that is we've gone through the year has moved into 2023. So hopefully that gives you some color that demand backdrop and backlog are strong for a few quarters out. Well, I think our goals there are going to be we have to be the same as our core CCM business. And I think, with a team that's there and some refinement of the portfolio, I think, continuing there as well as some additional investment in new technology and new products. I think we can start approaching that 20% margin range plus that we've targeted in CCM in the past. Correct. Yes, Brian, and when we get into that, I think we've got a -- just to add some color to it. I think there's a significant opportunity for new products around this energy efficiency play with Henry. They had already started. And obviously, in their core or path down that way before we bought them. But there are significant opportunities for new product development that hopefully will create higher value in the marketplace and that translates hopefully into higher margins as well as we really have not gone -- we haven't completed even what I would say, the first 20% of the COS implementation in Henry because we just bought them and they're still working through that. So, there's some nice operational efficiencies to be gained there. And I think some other opportunities with the application of CapEx and automation and things like that. So, we really are excited about the pathway forward for both the sales growth and then op margin expansion there. All right. Thank you. Yes, Garik, good question. And last year, we were so pleased that we had substantial increases in raws, and it got offset. But if you just look at that cost basket from a raw materials perspective, it definitely increased substantially. Those trends have continued. When we talked, I think in our last call, we had hoped that we would start to see some relief as we got through into the third quarter on that front. And unfortunately, I think supply chain pressures and raw material prices are going to continue into the third and fourth quarter for this year. So, I don't think we're going to see relief on that side. And then labor, you see it in the papers every day that wages continue to increase. People are aware of inflation. And so, there's wage pressure out there, too. So, I think that cost basket continues the trends that we saw kind of post-COVID there in 2021. Yes. I think this is what, in a lot of ways, we have talked about over the past few years around the Carlisle experience and value creation, the new products that we've introduced, the efficiencies. We're putting in the 16-foot wide TPL line is coming out. We're investing in a new lead facility down in sites, Missouri for polyiso. We continue to invest in our people. I mean you know the story, R&D. And so, I think we are earning commensurate with the value we provided in the marketplace. And I think that is going to be sustainable based upon our investments in R&D. The trends we see in ESG building efficiency and really the reroofing picture that's been there to hold up demand. So, I think we are -- we are like where we are. And we think we are -- it's a reflection of all the investments and the hard work that the team has done over the last 10 years. Not really. I mean we continue to see strong demand for housing. I think we've seen some reports out from some of the builders that despite rates -- interest rates rising, there may be an increase in the monthly payment, but that there's still significant demand and houses are being snapped up pretty quickly. I think we know and you probably are well aware of this, that we don't have enough housing stock in the country. And so right now, we're not seeing any impact on our demand going forward. Yes. You bet, Garik. Yes. Maybe I'll let Kevin add on to this, too. But if I start with things like the pricing, you mentioned that first. I think we are seeing continued pressure on cost. And so obviously, the pricing actions will have to be there. And I think you might be aware that pricing action has been taken here since the first of the year and likely will continue if that persists. So, on that side, I think will be covered there. As we get to the third and fourth quarter, I said, I don't really see a lot of relief on this cost side. So, we'll see what happens. I mean, again, we haven't talked about China much or trucking and things like that, but there are capacity issues with getting labor back, but there are also things just around the transportation side that might affect us. So, we do get some raw materials that need to be transported and significant lengths and that can impact us as well. So, on price. But Kevin, do you want to add to that? The -- yes. So, as we talked, we're talking CWT previously on this call about a little bit more than 30% right in that 30% range and CCM would be a little bit higher than that in the current rate in this environment. Yes. David, we are seeing orders. It's happening. And I think the nice thing is that when we talked earlier on, even when this started that we still felt that '24, '25 timeframe, things would come back. John and the team did a lot of work on restructuring and taking cost out of the organization. And so, as these orders are coming back, we're expecting that while there may be bumps, I mean, when the 787 gets exactly certified, I don't know. But if you have that North Star of 2025 as a return on this. We think it's kind of walking just like we thought it would. It was good to see 31 737 MAXs. It's up and flying again and production is back up. So that obviously will have an impact on demand. So yes, it is real orders and the team, I know is excited about continuing to see air travel pickup and profitability return to airlines and reinvestment in things like new aircraft, but also in things like retrofits around ARINC 791 and satellite Internet access and things like that, that we invested in before. Yes. In both cases, we're seeing actual orders and the team has more projects underway now. And so, I think, again, that's playing out just like most people would think, obviously, COVID put a huge -- had a huge impact on hospitals and the medical profession in a lot of different ways. And so it's nice to see that there's been some relief there and people are back to working on new products, which that's where we want to be targeted in the medical space. Yes. You bet. Yes, Kevin, there's been so much over the last -- that's going to -- you're probably not going to like this answer, but there's been so much flux in demand and supply chain issues in that. I would say that my personal feeling is that in the -- over the longer term, our market share has remained pretty constant amongst all the players. We get some ebbs and flows. A lot of that based on availability or certain areas where some might have a higher market share in a product line. But overall, I'd say if we look back 2, 3 years, the margin or margins, excuse me, the market share is relatively consistent. Yes. I think there's inventory. I think if you went out, I think part of the inventory is may have an order and they're waiting on a component or something like that. So, they may have a little bit built up or they're anticipating some work that needs to be done and they've been able to get access to certain products that they want inventory. So, I think there is, in certain cases, inventory built up -- being built up. But what I would say is that inventory is allocated. I mean it's got a job in home to go to. And again, that's why I say if we can get some more access to raws and that we can get the flow moving there. You bet. Hi, John. Thank you. Yes. I think probably unintentional, but when we look back over a 10-year time frame and when we look at where capacity was added, the -- I would say, CAGR, if we look for even 2014 to 2021, I mean, I think when we look at the industry, probably really targeting that mid to high single digits, 6%, 7%, 8%. And when you look at our capacity, we've added from that time on, it takes a long time to put one of these plants in and get approval and do all of that. And I think people have done a good job of adding just the right amount of capacity to grow with the business. I mean we used to think that 1 building or factory would contribute about 5%. Obviously, as the industry has grown, that's probably getting to be less, maybe 3.5%, something like that. But I think it has been rational. I think it's because there's very good information and data on roofing and building starts and things like that. I think people have some pretty good intelligence around seeing what the industry capacity can be, what demand is going to be. And as we've said, we can track that reroofing pretty closely, and Jim has put out a model on that. So rational is one thing, and I think it's more rational around what the future holds. Now a couple of things that are happening now are new products around ESG that they're going to change things and may increase the CAGR from at least a dollar value as these things become less of a commodity product that are put on and now begin to contribute to systems around energy efficiency and more value is created that will probably encourage more R&D investment. And so, I think the trends continue. I'd like the reroofing trajectory that's out there and the fact that we've got visibility to 10 years or so of strong demand. I mean new construction as long as it stays positive, I think, is a real contributor I think there's opportunities around ESG, as I talked about. And then we've got a lot of opportunities on the margin side around COS, but also on factory automation, Internet of Things connectivity in the plants and things like that. So, we keep doing what we said we were going to do in Vision 2025, keep being good capital allocators, invest in R&D, invest in talent. And I think we've just got a really good marketplace that continues to evolve in a positive direction. So sorry for that long answer, John, but ... All right. Thank you. Yes, that remains our expectation be, right around 100% for cash conversion. You bet. Thanks, Selina, and thanks, everyone. This concludes our first quarter 2022 earnings call. And thanks for your participation and the questions. We look forward to speaking with you at the next earnings call. Goodbye."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mehul Patel, Carlisle's Vice President of Investor Relations. Mehul, please go ahead.\nMehul Patel: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Carlisle's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm Mehul Patel, Head of Investor Relations for Carlisle. We released our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results today, and you can find both our press release and the presentation for today's call in the Investor Relations section of our website. On the call with me today are Chris Koch, our Board Chair, President and CEO; along with Kevin Zdimal, our CFO. Today's call will begin with Chris. He will provide highlights of our results and accomplishments followed by Kevin, who will provide an overview on our financial performance and an update on our outlook for 2024. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the line for questions. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our press release and SEC filings. As Carlisle provides non-GAAP financial information, we provided reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and in the appendix of our presentation materials, which are available on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Koch: Thank you, Mehul. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on Carlisle's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Turning to Slide 3. I would like to start by extending my sincere appreciation to all of our team members for their dedication and commitment in executing our Vision 2025 strategy over the past five years and helping to drive significant progress and value creation during 2023. The past year represented a challenging and dynamic year for Carlisle. The first half of the year was impacted by continued destocking in our markets and the related challenges driven by supply chain constraints for many building products, including ours in 2022. Despite those first half challenges, markets began a return to a more normalized order pattern beginning in the third quarter of 2023. This resulted in the second half of 2023 that was marked by increasingly positive momentum. In addition to delivering a record fourth quarter, Carlisle finished 2023 with one of the most significant events in our 106-year history. The completion of our well-communicated pivot from a diversified industrial portfolio of businesses to a pure-play building products company. Accompanying that strategic pivot was the successful achievement of our goals under Vision 2025 and the much anticipated release of our Vision 2030 strategy, which builds on Vision 2025 as new key initiatives such as an increased emphasis on innovation, and further unlocks the full potential of our pure-play building products portfolio. We are very pleased to have finished 2023 on a record note despite the very dynamic and uncertain market conditions we experienced through the year. Our fourth quarter results surpassed the expectations we communicated on our last earnings call in October, largely driven by better-than-expected CCM sales and better profitability in CWT. We achieved record fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $4.17, which was an increase of 30% year-over-year. Our EBITDA margin of 26.4% improved by an impressive 440 basis points year-over-year on 2% lower sales, clearly demonstrating our ability to maintain our margins through economic cycles. In the fourth quarter, we benefited from more favorable weather conditions, solid contractor backlogs, stronger operating efficiencies and the power of the Carlisle experience to drive favorable price to value in our businesses. CCM and CWT continue to produce industry-leading margin and EBITDA results despite lower volumes and continue to deliver consistent value creation. The strength of our building products segment financials are now fully unmasked and on display with the pivot. Looking at our full year 2023 sales, despite a 16% decline in sales, we maintained an EBITDA margin in excess of 25%. Importantly, most of the lower volumes were mainly attributable to channel destocking, interest rate-driven project delays and weather headwinds we experienced predominantly in the first nine months of 2023. We are very pleased to be entering 2024 on a positive note with destocking behind us and with positive momentum. Furthermore, we achieved a stellar ROIC for the year of 27%, which is aligned with our stated goal under Vision 2030 of exceeding 25% per year. This performance is a testament to our focused execution at CCM and CWT. The efficiencies derived through the Carlisle Operating System, the Carlisle Experience and our ability to price our products consistent with the value they create for our customers, reinforced daily by delivering an innovative and compelling value proposition. Now let's turn to Slide 4 and 5. Following the release of our Vision 2030 strategy in December, we were pleased to announce in late January that we reached an agreement to sell our CIT business to Amphenol just over $2 billion. The sale of CIT represents the final step in our successful strategic pivot from a diversified portfolio of general industrial businesses to a premier pure-play building products company. This sale is an important milestone in that it showcases our financials and allows our building products segment's historical track record of growth and best-in-class returns to be clearly seen. With the expected proceeds from the CIT sale, combined with our 15% plus free cash flow margin, we now have an even stronger capital base that provides exceptional flexibility to execute on our highest returning capital allocation priorities and supports the investments contemplated in Vision 2030. In 2018, we embarked on our Vision 2025 journey with the goal of being superior capital allocators, while seeking to drive 5-plus percent organic growth, leveraging that growth into earnings, making synergistic acquisitions, driving efficiencies through the Carlisle Operating System, investing in talented people, returning capital to our shareholders and ultimately, creating value for all our shareholders. During 2021, to further demonstrate our desire to be a superior capital allocator, we made the decision to pivot our portfolio to our highest returning building products businesses. Since the introduction of Vision 2025, we have nearly doubled revenue in our building products segment, more than doubled the EBITDA in those segments and increased free cash flow by over 200%. Furthermore, we exceeded our earnings target of over $15 per share three years ahead of our commitment in our Vision 2025 plan. We are proud of these accomplishments, which we view as significant milestones that validate our strategies and actions over the last six years. And clearly demonstrate our commitment to an ROIC-focused capital allocation strategy. One of our key drivers of success is our ability to offer a compelling value proposition through what we call Carlisle Experience. The Carlisle Experience can be defined simply as getting the right product to the right place at the right time. In other words, delivering on our commitments to our customers. We complement the Carlisle Experience with a strong focus on innovation and specifically innovation that delivers energy efficient and labor-saving solutions. This focus has aligned well with the increasing demand for green buildings and products, the increasing need of customers to reduce GHG emissions and to conserve energy and the need for our customers to address the forecasted significant labor constraints through improved job site productivity. As we move on from the success of Vision 2025, we now turn our attention to Vision 2030 and our emphasis on our building products portfolio of businesses. As we stated in our Vision 2030 video released in December, we plan to continue to deliver on our foundational strategies that produce such positive results these last few years under Vision 2025. Coupled with major secular tailwinds, we are committed to delivering innovative building envelope solutions, driving above-market growth and unlocking additional value for shareholders in this next important phase of Carlisle's growth journey. The key pillars of Vision 2030 include enhanced levels of innovation, a continued emphasis on synergistic M&A, attracting and retaining top talent and holding steadfast to our sustainability commitments. As we look to fulfilling our commitments under Vision 2030, a key lever in our pursuit of higher margins will be increased spending on innovation. As such, Carlisle is differentiating itself with a goal of investing 3% of sales to drive the creation of new products and solutions that add value through advancements in sustainability, energy and labor efficiency. Additionally, we aim to continue to enhance our customer relationships through continued investments in the Carlisle Experience. This includes advancing our digital experience for customers and is exemplified by our recently released mobile-friendly customer success portal at CCM. This portal provides Carlisle customers with a unified and mobile platform for real-time engagement, including access to product catalogs, personalized pricing, order status, delivery tracking and enhanced communication with our customer service and operations teams. Overall, we delivered a strong finish to 2023, maintained our historically strong margins and exited the year on an extremely positive note. Our Vision 2030 strategy is in place, and we are now a focused and simplified building products company. We are motivated to leverage the industry mega trends, drive innovation and demonstrate margin resiliency through economic cycles to deliver superior ROIC and compounding EPS growth. With our solid foundation and a strong team in place, we are confident in achieving our goals set under Vision 2030. As we begin 2024, we are optimistic about the positive momentum building in our end markets. The inventory destocking headwinds we faced over the past year, largely in commercial roofing are now behind us, setting the stage for a more normalized buying profile in 2024. We expect combined benefits from the tailwind of prior year customer destocking and a strong backlog of reroofing projects due in part to constrained labor to collectively mitigate potential risks in the year ahead. As such, we have a positive growth outlook for 2024 that we believe is reasonable achievable and fully supported by our Vision 2030 strategic objectives. Kevin will touch further on our 2024 growth expectations and outlook later in the call. Now please turn to Slide 6 as I share some updates on our progress with Carlisle's sustainability initiatives. Sustainability is a core focus for our organization. We seek to positively impact the environment while creating value for all our stakeholders through our three-pillar sustainability strategy. The three pillars are: manufacturing energy-efficient products, minimizing our value chain greenhouse gas emissions and diverting waste and end-of-life materials from landfills. Under our first pillar, we provide end users access to solutions that drive energy efficiency in their buildings. As an example, adding 1 inch of Polyiso insulation to a 50,000 square foot roof can save building owners as much as $110,000 in avoided energy costs over the service life of the building. Our second pillar, reducing our operational and value chain emissions helps Carlisle reduce our carbon footprint and the negative environmental impacts. As an example, let's take our blowing agents in our spray foam operations. We finished the year converting over 50% of our HFC legacy spray foam products to a more environmentally friendly formulation amounting to over 250,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas is avoided, a compelling achievement. As a reminder, HFCs are 1,000x more carbon-intensive than HFOs. Carlisle also obtained five additional ISO 14001 certifications through 2023, bringing our enterprise-wide total to 26. Additionally, our Montgomery Polyiso plant recently obtained ISCC+ certification, clearing the plant to run bio-based MDI and polyol on a mass balanced approach. This is a pivotal achievement in Carlisle's ability to manufacture and extend the credits of bio-based Polyiso to its customers. Lastly, our third pillar focuses on the reduction of construction waste entering landfills. As an update here, Carlisle's rooftop takeoff program diverted over 1 million square feet or 120 metric tons of reclaimed insulation and membrane materials from landfills throughout 2023. We have also expanded incentives for the program, which we believe will further expedite this growth and adoption amongst our customers. I personally take great pride in Carlisle's sustainability legacy spanning over 100 years. Carlisle's commitment to operating efficiently, minimizing waste and offering solutions to empower end users and reducing energy consumption has been ingrained in our culture and will be essential to our success in the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details as well as our 2024 outlook. Kevin?\nKevin Zdimal: Thank you, Chris. Looking at our fourth quarter results on Slide 7. Despite a 1.9% decline in revenue, we were able to expand our EBITDA margins by 440 basis points to 26.4%. Furthermore, we achieved record fourth quarter earnings with an adjusted EPS of $4.17, an increase of 30% year-over-year. Looking at our segment highlights, starting with CCM on Slide 8. CCM delivered fourth quarter revenues of $816 million, up 1.9% from the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was driven by favorable weather and the return to normalization of order patterns, including the end of destocking in the channel. CCM EBITDA increased 12% to $255 million, with EBITDA margin up 270 basis points to 31.2%. This was driven by a combination of leveraging higher volume growth, favorable input costs and realizing cost savings through the Carlisle Operating System. Moving to Slide 9. Revenues at CWT decreased 11% year-over-year, primarily due to the well-known declines in residential demand and the exit of a noncore business in the first quarter of 2023. However, despite the revenue decline, we were able to drive EBITDA growth of 54% to $69 million. This represented an EBITDA margin of 22.2%, expanding at an impressive 940 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022. The margin improvement was bolstered by operational efficiencies gained through targeted restructuring actions, strategic sourcing and the realization of synergies from the Henry acquisition. Synergies now exceed $50 million, significantly above our deal model estimate of $30 million. Slide 10 provides a year-over-year fourth quarter adjusted EPS bridge items for your reference. Moving to Slides 11 through 13. Carlisle ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with $577 million of cash on hand. We had $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1 billion and invested $142 million in capital expenditures. Our free cash flow margin was 20% in 2023, and we ended the year with a solid net leverage of 1.6x, comfortably below our 2x to 3x long-term target. Our disciplined capital allocation framework remains focused on delivering ROIC in excess of 25%. As stated in Vision 2030, we continue to focus on being a superior capital allocator by investing in our high ROIC building products businesses, making synergistic acquisitions that deliver significant opportunities for value creation and repurchasing shares given our attractive valuation. We deployed $900 million towards share repurchases during 2023 and paid $160 million in dividends. This represented our 47th straight year of dividend increases. Expanding on share repurchases at the end of the fourth quarter, we have 7.4 million shares available under our share repurchase program. Notably, the $2 billion of expected proceeds from the CIT sale provides us with additional dollars and flexibility to execute further share repurchases and fund our high-returning capital allocation priorities. Overall, we believe our pristine balance sheet, conservative leverage profile and ample liquidity positions us to drive additional value creation in 2024 and beyond. Turn to Slide 14 to see our full year 2024 financial outlook. We expect 2024 revenues to increase by approximately 5% versus 2023 and EBITDA margins to expand by 50 basis points. We remain focused on disciplined pricing as we leverage greater operational efficiencies and effectively manage costs through our continuous improvement efforts. Additionally, we expect to deliver free cash flow margins of 15% and ROIC in excess of 25%. As such, we expect double-digit EPS growth in 2024. This is directly aligned with the objectives outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy and a positive first step towards a $40-plus EPS target. Looking at the components of the outlook. For CCM, we expect year-over-year revenue to grow approximately 6% in 2024. The primary drivers are the tailwinds from the return to normalization in order patterns that was absent during 2023 due to destocking. For CWT, we expect year-over-year revenue to grow approximately 4% in 2024. Strong sales execution on key growth initiatives and stronger trends in residential should more than offset any headwinds posed by nonresidential markets. With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks.\nChris Koch: Thanks, Kevin. In closing, I am grateful for the hard work and dedication of Carlisle's employees that was demonstrated throughout 2023. As they have in the past, our teams demonstrated their resilience, perseverance and a commitment to excellence and delivering value in a difficult environment. I would also like to specifically call out and thank John Berlin and the entire team at CIT for their many years of significant contributions to Carlisle. CIT was one of the longest owned assets in the Carlisle portfolio and began with our acquisition of the Tensolite Company in 1959. Through a commitment to innovation, industry-leading operations and a unique combination of organic growth and synergistic acquisitions, CIT embodied the key tenets of value creation at Carlisle. We wish John and the entire team the best as they become part of the Amphenol family. Turning to 2024. We have entered the year with significant positive momentum and a clear focus on the goals outlined in our recently launched Vision 2030 growth strategy. We are confident that our ability to innovate with a focus on energy efficiency and labor-saving solutions puts us on the right path to drive above-market growth and in return, drive superior financial results. The improved profitability by our simplified building products portfolio, a robust free cash flow engine and the expected proceeds from the sale of CIT leave us well positioned to achieve significant value creation for shareholders and deliver another year of industry-leading ROIC in excess of 25%. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird.\nTim Wojs: Maybe just to start on CCM. Is there a way to maybe bridge some of the underlying assumptions on the 6% revenue growth? So just really kind of interested in how much you're kind of baking in for the lapping of destocking kind of what the underlying implied kind of volume growth is? What would kind of be on the roof or sell-through? And then how are you thinking about pricing as well.\nKevin Zdimal: Yes, Tim. So overall, expecting CCM to be up about 6% in 2024. We have the destock benefit. That's about a 11% benefit -- and then pricing, we expect to be down really from the carryover from 2023, which was about 2% to 3%. And then the overall end market also down about 2% to 3%.\nTim Wojs: And then I guess on pricing, where do you think the industry kind of stands there? I guess we've heard mixed anecdotes around where kind of pricing stands. I'm just kind of curious how you see it. I mean, you said carryover pricing which would assume that maybe things have stabilized, but just kind of curious on your comments on price.\nChris Koch: Yes. I think, Tim, we thought 2023, given the significant sales declines, we thought pricing held up really well. through most of the year, it fluctuated, but I would say it was stable. When we look back, we've got a couple of components in there too. We've got the core roofing. We've got the CAM we've got Europe and we've got some mix. And so I think, overall, I'd characterize it as stable and going to this year, I think it will be pretty much the same thing as what Kevin was talking about with the 2% to 3%. But again, it's early. It's Q1. it's January. But I think definitely, given all the declines last year, I thought the pricing held in there and maybe that gets to some of this pricing to value and what we're providing and others are providing.\nTim Wojs: And then just on, I guess, reroofing, how visibility do you kind of walk into a year with on the reroofing side? I'm just trying to kind of think through the ability of a building owner or a contract that kind of pushed that around based on other dynamics. But how would you kind of think about kind of the underlying reroofing backlog and just your visibility to that as you go into '24.\nChris Koch: Well, I think it's still -- there's a good backlog. Obviously, when new construction was cooking there, we had some backlog. We've got the labor constraints. We tend to look at it at a macro level. We've gone through the chart with looking back 20 years and what's coming due. We know we have our share of the market that when it is warranted, we also know when those roofs are coming due. We think that the average roof in the industry is a 20-year roof based upon our warranties. I mean there are longer warranties you can buy, but on average, it could be about 20 years. So we track all that. I think the thing is you're talking about a very dispersed demand pallet across the entire United States is this reroofing. And you've got some things in there where you can patch and some people will repair and the place early. Others may delay a variety of functions. But I think overall, we try to get a sense through surveys. We talked about two surveys we did last year with about 600 contractors talking about what was happening in their markets around the country. And then obviously, Steve Schwar, Frank Reddy and their sales teams are out there every day talking to them. So we think the visibility is pretty good. I think those other things just create some difficulty in pinning it down. So as we go in, as Kevin said, we're looking at that 11% on the tailwind from destocking. And I think if we look at the industry in general, we're back at that mid-single digits that we've been at historically, the combination between reroofing and new construction, and we think reroofing is holding up well.\nTim Wojs: So then just to confirm, if volumes should be down 2% to 3%, and then just based on your mix, I mean, you probably have reroofing flat to upsell and then new construction kind of down in the high single digits or something like that?\nChris Koch: Yes, yes. I think going in the year, that's how we're thinking about it. A little pressure on new construction from interest rates and the economy and then reroofing, picking that up with the backlogs Yes, exactly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer.\nBryan Blair: Nice finish to the year.\nChris Koch: Bryan, thanks.\nBryan Blair: Your guidance strikes us as a touch conservative, especially given the momentum you have coming through Q4 and knowing the comps that you've asked, but it's early in leading some of certainty to the upside is certainly fine. But the level set on the framework, maybe walk us through how you're thinking about the cadence of sales and margins throughout the year. And if you can speak to those dynamics by segment, that would be extremely helpful.\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. So let's start with sales. And we're looking at sales is really what our historical seasonality has been. So if you go back pre-COVID, the three-year average on sales at CCM. The first quarter is typically about 20% of full year sales than the second quarter is about 29%. Third quarter was 27% and in the fourth quarter was 24%. And those were the historical averages, and we think '24 is going to be a more normal year, and that's what we're expecting on the CCM side. For CWT, they're pretty much the same on the quarterly. The only difference is the first half of the year, where CWT historically has been a little bit stronger in the first quarter, so about 22% of sales. And then 27% of sales in the second quarter and then the second half of the year was the same as CCM. Then if you look at the EBITDA margin, overall, we would expect the -- really the incrementals that we've talked about to drop through based on those sales numbers at CCM, it's about 40% incrementals. CWT, low to mid-30s and incrementals. Only difference of all of that is the first quarter for CWT that one just based on just how the numbers are playing out, if you look at a CWT should increase a couple of hundred basis points in Q1. So that's one exception to what I just talked about. And that improvement is really from the carryover of all the synergies that they picked up in '23.\nBryan Blair: How does price cost take out for CCM and CWT in 2023? And then what have you baked into guidance on that front? And just running the simple math, we assume that all of growth is well even based and thinking about the normalized incrementals that you just referenced, the 50 basis points seems to come exclusively from growth in that drop through, but I suspect price/cost remains a good guy for you guys coming into the year, and it's certainly a typically a lever for the Carlisle story. So just curious how you're thinking about that, but starting with how price cost [indiscernible].\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. For 2023, we had given a range in the third quarter, and we hit the top end of that range where we came in for CCM at $80 million benefit -- that's for the full year, CWT for the full year was $40 million benefit. As we get into 2024 as you said, maybe a little of the numbers were conservative. This is one where we're pretty much looking at price raws to be flat for both segments. And that's offsetting that 2%, right, 2% to 3% price down. So obviously, there's a benefit of the raws take that a flat number.\nBryan Blair: And then last one, staying on the margin bridge, how much of a step-up in R&D expense are you factoring in for this year? We know the 3% target kind of medium to long term. How's that being phased in? And what's the near-term focus for the team. We've kind of come to the conclusion that it's more evolutionary focus in terms of product development for the time being and perhaps more revolutionary over time? Just curious about the sale.\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. So R&D expense overall is about 80 basis points as a percent of sales, and we're looking to nearly double that in 2024. Everyone can hear the operator was dropped from the call. So we're just waiting to have the operator rejoin and then we'll resume the questions -- so if you can hear, please be patient, and we will get this issue resolve momentarily.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Glad we got a technical issue fix. So I want to talk a little bit about cash, you're about to receive almost $2 billion in proceeds. So just -- and you did a lot of share buybacks already, but what's the appetite this year for share repurchases? And then what are you seeing from an M&A pipeline perspective, ultimately, how are you thinking about the optimal capital structure for your business?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. So from the cash, one piece we do have in 2024 is $400 million of debt coming due in the fourth quarter. So we'll use some of the cash there. We have dividends, that's about $160 million. And then at that point, we'll invest in the R&D and some of the capital expenditures, capital expenditures, we put out $160 million to $180 million. And then it comes down to share buybacks versus acquisitions. We've been doing about $400 million a year in share buybacks. We'd expect to do that plus we're allocating right now is about half of the CIT proceeds to put that also towards share buybacks this year.\nChris Koch: I can talk about the pipeline, if you want to. Did you want to ask any more about the share repurchases. We get 3 things there. I think maybe just pause and make sure you get everything you need on share repurchases.\nSaree Boroditsky: No, that's good. M&A pipeline next would be great.\nChris Koch: Yes. And then we'll get this optimal capital structure. Yes. The M&A pipeline has been a little bit, I think, all the way around slow. We are seeing deals. We'd like to see more, hopefully, we see things free up a little bit more as the spring gets here, interest rates change a little bit. But I think we're following kind of the same pattern you're seeing with everyone else that just '23 was not a great year for M&A and probably not a great year for people selling their businesses. So we're still optimistic there are things out there we can add to the building products portfolio and the envelope. I mean, as a reminder, as we said in Vision 2030, we're going to be really, we have some really specific hurdles for of them. We want to have an organic growth story within the asset that we're buying. We want to make sure that there are really hard synergies like we had with Henry, not just sales synergies and things that are hope for, but real raw material savings and plant savings like we did with Henry. We want to have a really good management team. And this is the one that I think in the Henry acquisition has been the hardest in the past is to get that type of management team that we had coming in with Henry that just right off the bat picks up the integration playbook, which is number 4. And then they run with it, and we get -- I don't know if you've heard recently, but the synergies we estimate of $30 million with the Henry deal. Now we've exceeded $50 million. And a lot of that really is to that great management team that great integration playbook and now pause once they were acquired. So when you layer those things on, I think we're a little bit more picky than most, but I think Henry is a great example of what we want to do with M&A, and I think there are more out there like that, just harder to find. And then Kevin will pick up on the capital structure.\nKevin Zdimal: Yes, capital structure, we're looking to have net debt EBITDA in the range of 1x to 2x. And at times looks like above that if it's the right acquisition, like we did with Henry and then our plan is to pay that back within 18 to 24 months to get us back in that 1 to 2x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.\nSaree Boroditsky: And so I guess, given where kind of the M&A pipeline is, you talked about half of the proceeds for buyback within your guidance, you have about $20 million of net interest expense. But given that you're expecting to hold on to some of these cash proceeds, should you not realize some interest income on that? And how do you think about earnings interest income within your guidance?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. So interest expense is around $70 million. And then yes, we have about $50 million of interest income. So $70 million, $50 million and then the net $20 million.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: Great. Just wondering if you could just speak to a little bit more of your view of the market in CCM being down 2 to 3 points. I appreciate that the view is that the repair side could be flat to slightly up and the new down high single-digits or so. But just curious as where are you seeing maybe some upside or downside risk to that market outlook, would it be more repair versus new or anything you can add this into how you're assessing variance around the market outlook.\nChris Koch: Yes. I think, Garik, the biggest thing for me is this idea that this interest rate environment that we've been facing in the economy, I mean, we're not unique in this idea that we're going into the year. First, we hear there's going to be three interest rate cuts, okay, that's super positive. We like that. Then we hear now, we're going to pull back on that. I think cash carry came out, [indiscernible] said and said maybe it's too soon to talk about that. So we've got that. We've got the economy that everybody is on pins and needles about with, obviously, employment and other things like that. So I think as we sit here, the hard thing for us to do is to be sitting in January, which is in the first quarter, our lightest, as Kevin mentioned, 20% of overall sales and trying to forecast that with the real construction season is going to be in the spring and summer. So right now, we're saying, as we did on the 2030 video that things are relatively stable and they're moving along as we expect -- and so we're kind of looking at historical averages, really what we get from the market, what our sales teams are telling us what we're seeing in project pipeline. We also get to things like value but we actually read your reports. When you do your surveys and your pulse checks and those kind of things and take all into account. So I think the biggest thing for us is just -- it all feels optimistic right now, and we like that. But when we get down to granularity, I'm looking at the economy to be the biggest variable. And then we look at specifically into some of the verticals. And when you look at '24, we see that continued, I'd say, pressure on warehouses, specifically. But to call out one that seems to be the biggest decliner would probably be warehouses. I think Dodge has it somewhere in the high teens, low 20s forecast for '24. Education looks pretty good. Retail stores, health care, we still think there's a trend there. And seems to be happening with aging population that we'll see more long-term care. Medical seems to be good. There seems to be a lot of money in medical. And then we get the reshoring of manufacturing, which think Dodge estimated was somewhere around 8% in '23. And then I think the last 1 really is the office building. So we don't deal on the tall buildings that we had Citicorp and there was a lot of distress there with the work from home, but we're more in the low 3, 4-story buildings, and we think that's good and suburban office buildings have been pretty good. So that's kind of how we see the verticals then. I think we just layer in the reroofing on top of that. And obviously, that's a little bit less vertical dependent and more dependent on the age of the -- so again, optimistic about '24. I think specifically, if we are -- continue to see the economy perform as it is, and we do get a couple of cuts that could be a pretty good year going forward, especially with the fact that I would say that there's been -- we have the destocking, but we haven't really had in this winter period, a return to restocking, which typically back four or five years ago before COVID, the result was a load-in in the spring in the March, April time frame. So there may be some of that to -- if the economy turns around and things look good.\nGarik Shmois: I appreciate the plug. I guess a follow-up question is just on CWT, maybe similar, you touched on some of these things in the prior answer. But coming down to 3Q, you specifically indicated that there were some more project delays than you anticipated and CWT, certainly is more on the commercial side than residential. But just curious has that maybe pacing continued? Or maybe from the sounds of it, you're seeing some stabilization, but just wondering if you could address some of those project delays in CWT and what occurred in the fourth quarter.\nMehul Patel: Yes. Garik, it's Mehul here. I'll take that one. So overall, to your point, 2023 was very challenging, given the dynamic nature of the macro environment. That's what impacted the project delays in 2023. The way we see it now, it's basically stabilized. I think more or less, the economy is kind of what it is around higher interest rates and what's going on with nonresidential. So I'd characterize it as being stable. And then overall, on the CWT side, specifically on the commercial side, we're mainly focused around the institutions, medical, education and government. So those tend to be a little bit more stable as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Just to start off with a quick one -- any sense of what benefit the extended days in December may have represented to the quarter?\nChris Koch: Yes, we think it picked up probably about two days of positive weather.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. Two days. Secondly, I wanted to ask you about market share in CCM. And clearly, during the pandemic, you guys won share. And so I guess the question is, if the market is stabilizing, how do you defend that share now that they want it back, and they're likely prepared to use price to get it? And then maybe within the context of that answer, you can just talk about what you expect in terms of CCM market share in 2024.\nChris Koch: Yes. I think for market share, I don't know, I don't want to get contentious. I would say that during COVID, I would say there were a couple of phases to it. And maybe in the first phase when we came out, if you might recall, we had actually built inventory going into COVID when others were declining. And when we came out, we captured a lot of share. So there was demand we had at others weren't able to provide. And that was part -- attributed to our belief of the Carlisle experience, providing a lot of value to our contractors, the right place, right product, right time, right? So we picked up share then. Then we did get through and is the time went on. We had others that implemented different types of techniques to get out into the market and to sell things. They handle their approach to direct sales to contractor may be different? Or are they funded distribution in a different way. And I think you're right. As we chose a path under, I think we call it our MSP program, we made some decisions. And one decision was we felt it was better to I would say, be more democratic in our approach to funding distributors, we didn't put all the eggs with the biggest distributors of contract because we make sure that all of our long-standing customers got a little bit so that everybody could survive. So we may have suffered a little bit there. And then I think there was some pricing as we came out into '23, that some attempts to gain share through that in the first quarter -- in the first quarter of the year, which could acerbated the destocking. But ultimately, things guide, as we've already touched on, it was a very stable year for pricing so things came back. And so really, when I look at the time I've been a COO to now 2014 to '24, I would say that overall market shares have remained relatively stable. There's ebbs and flows in each segment is very specific TPOs different than EPDM. EPDM is different than PBC. But on the whole, I think one of the reasons it stays relatively stable for us is our great network of architect specifications, distributors and then this warranty and specifying these things and viewing the whole thing as a system, which is what Mehul talks a lot about with Henry as well. This idea that we're having a specified system. So I don't think '24 will be any different. I think '24 will probably play out in a similar way and market share will be relatively consistent around the big buckets of our business. The three roofing membranes, the insulation, the accessories at ESI and seals of that.\nDavid MacGregor: And then the last question I had for you was just with regard to the backlog that you referenced in your prepared remarks. Can you size that roof in backlog for us? And what would it normally be -- so to what extent are you above normalized levels? And -- and how are you thinking about [indiscernible] on that?\nChris Koch: I would or -- I guess without -- I don't want to share too much, and I would go back to maybe more of a public figure. And I think it's -- ABI, I think. Contractor -- so that's steady 8.6 that Kevin referenced is pretty similar to what we've seen for the last few years. 9.1, I think, was there for a while. I don't think it's really dipped below 8.5. So I think backlog has remained relatively consistent, which is kind of what we talked about with labor constraints that people aren't paying resume, but there's a healthy backlog of demand there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten from Zelman.\nAdam Baumgarten: Just looking at the margin guidance, the EBITDA margin expanding overall 50 bps -- is that a bit more weighted or higher than the total company at CWT given the stronger starters, is it relatively balanced across both businesses for the year?\nChris Koch: Yes, it's relatively balanced across both CCM and CWT.\nAdam Baumgarten: And then just a couple of others. One, you mentioned the positive weather in 4Q just a moment ago was weather a headwind perhaps in January? And then also just on CapEx, kind of coming up a good amount, and I know you guys noted some growth investments. Can you give maybe some more specifics on where you're spending that incremental CapEx?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes, CapEx is going to be a couple of key areas. One, the R&D. We're going to continue to invest in the innovation and doing expansion there. We have, certainly with COS, there's always cost reduction programs, whether it's through automation and those types of investments. And we also for future growth. There will be some capacity, not new lines or anything like that, but additional investments that will enhance some of our growth overall.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. And just on the January or if that was anything notable.\nKevin Zdimal: Not really. I would say not that we've heard from the division. I think one thing is this rain in California, and this atmospheric River that they talk about. I know Frank in the CWT team do a lot there on the retail side. Once those kind of things hit, obviously, leaks appear and things like that, and that tends to be something that gets stocked up. So probably have more of an impact here as we get into February a little bit further.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Please continue.\nChris Koch: Thanks, operator. Well, that concludes our fourth quarter '23 conference call. I appreciate all the questions and the interest, and we look forward to talking to everyone soon. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Koch",
            "content": "Thank you, Mehul. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on Carlisle's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Turning to Slide 3. I would like to start by extending my sincere appreciation to all of our team members for their dedication and commitment in executing our Vision 2025 strategy over the past five years and helping to drive significant progress and value creation during 2023. The past year represented a challenging and dynamic year for Carlisle. The first half of the year was impacted by continued destocking in our markets and the related challenges driven by supply chain constraints for many building products, including ours in 2022. Despite those first half challenges, markets began a return to a more normalized order pattern beginning in the third quarter of 2023. This resulted in the second half of 2023 that was marked by increasingly positive momentum. In addition to delivering a record fourth quarter, Carlisle finished 2023 with one of the most significant events in our 106-year history. The completion of our well-communicated pivot from a diversified industrial portfolio of businesses to a pure-play building products company. Accompanying that strategic pivot was the successful achievement of our goals under Vision 2025 and the much anticipated release of our Vision 2030 strategy, which builds on Vision 2025 as new key initiatives such as an increased emphasis on innovation, and further unlocks the full potential of our pure-play building products portfolio. We are very pleased to have finished 2023 on a record note despite the very dynamic and uncertain market conditions we experienced through the year. Our fourth quarter results surpassed the expectations we communicated on our last earnings call in October, largely driven by better-than-expected CCM sales and better profitability in CWT. We achieved record fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $4.17, which was an increase of 30% year-over-year. Our EBITDA margin of 26.4% improved by an impressive 440 basis points year-over-year on 2% lower sales, clearly demonstrating our ability to maintain our margins through economic cycles. In the fourth quarter, we benefited from more favorable weather conditions, solid contractor backlogs, stronger operating efficiencies and the power of the Carlisle experience to drive favorable price to value in our businesses. CCM and CWT continue to produce industry-leading margin and EBITDA results despite lower volumes and continue to deliver consistent value creation. The strength of our building products segment financials are now fully unmasked and on display with the pivot. Looking at our full year 2023 sales, despite a 16% decline in sales, we maintained an EBITDA margin in excess of 25%. Importantly, most of the lower volumes were mainly attributable to channel destocking, interest rate-driven project delays and weather headwinds we experienced predominantly in the first nine months of 2023. We are very pleased to be entering 2024 on a positive note with destocking behind us and with positive momentum. Furthermore, we achieved a stellar ROIC for the year of 27%, which is aligned with our stated goal under Vision 2030 of exceeding 25% per year. This performance is a testament to our focused execution at CCM and CWT. The efficiencies derived through the Carlisle Operating System, the Carlisle Experience and our ability to price our products consistent with the value they create for our customers, reinforced daily by delivering an innovative and compelling value proposition. Now let's turn to Slide 4 and 5. Following the release of our Vision 2030 strategy in December, we were pleased to announce in late January that we reached an agreement to sell our CIT business to Amphenol just over $2 billion. The sale of CIT represents the final step in our successful strategic pivot from a diversified portfolio of general industrial businesses to a premier pure-play building products company. This sale is an important milestone in that it showcases our financials and allows our building products segment's historical track record of growth and best-in-class returns to be clearly seen. With the expected proceeds from the CIT sale, combined with our 15% plus free cash flow margin, we now have an even stronger capital base that provides exceptional flexibility to execute on our highest returning capital allocation priorities and supports the investments contemplated in Vision 2030. In 2018, we embarked on our Vision 2025 journey with the goal of being superior capital allocators, while seeking to drive 5-plus percent organic growth, leveraging that growth into earnings, making synergistic acquisitions, driving efficiencies through the Carlisle Operating System, investing in talented people, returning capital to our shareholders and ultimately, creating value for all our shareholders. During 2021, to further demonstrate our desire to be a superior capital allocator, we made the decision to pivot our portfolio to our highest returning building products businesses. Since the introduction of Vision 2025, we have nearly doubled revenue in our building products segment, more than doubled the EBITDA in those segments and increased free cash flow by over 200%. Furthermore, we exceeded our earnings target of over $15 per share three years ahead of our commitment in our Vision 2025 plan. We are proud of these accomplishments, which we view as significant milestones that validate our strategies and actions over the last six years. And clearly demonstrate our commitment to an ROIC-focused capital allocation strategy. One of our key drivers of success is our ability to offer a compelling value proposition through what we call Carlisle Experience. The Carlisle Experience can be defined simply as getting the right product to the right place at the right time. In other words, delivering on our commitments to our customers. We complement the Carlisle Experience with a strong focus on innovation and specifically innovation that delivers energy efficient and labor-saving solutions. This focus has aligned well with the increasing demand for green buildings and products, the increasing need of customers to reduce GHG emissions and to conserve energy and the need for our customers to address the forecasted significant labor constraints through improved job site productivity. As we move on from the success of Vision 2025, we now turn our attention to Vision 2030 and our emphasis on our building products portfolio of businesses. As we stated in our Vision 2030 video released in December, we plan to continue to deliver on our foundational strategies that produce such positive results these last few years under Vision 2025. Coupled with major secular tailwinds, we are committed to delivering innovative building envelope solutions, driving above-market growth and unlocking additional value for shareholders in this next important phase of Carlisle's growth journey. The key pillars of Vision 2030 include enhanced levels of innovation, a continued emphasis on synergistic M&A, attracting and retaining top talent and holding steadfast to our sustainability commitments. As we look to fulfilling our commitments under Vision 2030, a key lever in our pursuit of higher margins will be increased spending on innovation. As such, Carlisle is differentiating itself with a goal of investing 3% of sales to drive the creation of new products and solutions that add value through advancements in sustainability, energy and labor efficiency. Additionally, we aim to continue to enhance our customer relationships through continued investments in the Carlisle Experience. This includes advancing our digital experience for customers and is exemplified by our recently released mobile-friendly customer success portal at CCM. This portal provides Carlisle customers with a unified and mobile platform for real-time engagement, including access to product catalogs, personalized pricing, order status, delivery tracking and enhanced communication with our customer service and operations teams. Overall, we delivered a strong finish to 2023, maintained our historically strong margins and exited the year on an extremely positive note. Our Vision 2030 strategy is in place, and we are now a focused and simplified building products company. We are motivated to leverage the industry mega trends, drive innovation and demonstrate margin resiliency through economic cycles to deliver superior ROIC and compounding EPS growth. With our solid foundation and a strong team in place, we are confident in achieving our goals set under Vision 2030. As we begin 2024, we are optimistic about the positive momentum building in our end markets. The inventory destocking headwinds we faced over the past year, largely in commercial roofing are now behind us, setting the stage for a more normalized buying profile in 2024. We expect combined benefits from the tailwind of prior year customer destocking and a strong backlog of reroofing projects due in part to constrained labor to collectively mitigate potential risks in the year ahead. As such, we have a positive growth outlook for 2024 that we believe is reasonable achievable and fully supported by our Vision 2030 strategic objectives. Kevin will touch further on our 2024 growth expectations and outlook later in the call. Now please turn to Slide 6 as I share some updates on our progress with Carlisle's sustainability initiatives. Sustainability is a core focus for our organization. We seek to positively impact the environment while creating value for all our stakeholders through our three-pillar sustainability strategy. The three pillars are: manufacturing energy-efficient products, minimizing our value chain greenhouse gas emissions and diverting waste and end-of-life materials from landfills. Under our first pillar, we provide end users access to solutions that drive energy efficiency in their buildings. As an example, adding 1 inch of Polyiso insulation to a 50,000 square foot roof can save building owners as much as $110,000 in avoided energy costs over the service life of the building. Our second pillar, reducing our operational and value chain emissions helps Carlisle reduce our carbon footprint and the negative environmental impacts. As an example, let's take our blowing agents in our spray foam operations. We finished the year converting over 50% of our HFC legacy spray foam products to a more environmentally friendly formulation amounting to over 250,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas is avoided, a compelling achievement. As a reminder, HFCs are 1,000x more carbon-intensive than HFOs. Carlisle also obtained five additional ISO 14001 certifications through 2023, bringing our enterprise-wide total to 26. Additionally, our Montgomery Polyiso plant recently obtained ISCC+ certification, clearing the plant to run bio-based MDI and polyol on a mass balanced approach. This is a pivotal achievement in Carlisle's ability to manufacture and extend the credits of bio-based Polyiso to its customers. Lastly, our third pillar focuses on the reduction of construction waste entering landfills. As an update here, Carlisle's rooftop takeoff program diverted over 1 million square feet or 120 metric tons of reclaimed insulation and membrane materials from landfills throughout 2023. We have also expanded incentives for the program, which we believe will further expedite this growth and adoption amongst our customers. I personally take great pride in Carlisle's sustainability legacy spanning over 100 years. Carlisle's commitment to operating efficiently, minimizing waste and offering solutions to empower end users and reducing energy consumption has been ingrained in our culture and will be essential to our success in the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details as well as our 2024 outlook. Kevin? Thanks, Kevin. In closing, I am grateful for the hard work and dedication of Carlisle's employees that was demonstrated throughout 2023. As they have in the past, our teams demonstrated their resilience, perseverance and a commitment to excellence and delivering value in a difficult environment. I would also like to specifically call out and thank John Berlin and the entire team at CIT for their many years of significant contributions to Carlisle. CIT was one of the longest owned assets in the Carlisle portfolio and began with our acquisition of the Tensolite Company in 1959. Through a commitment to innovation, industry-leading operations and a unique combination of organic growth and synergistic acquisitions, CIT embodied the key tenets of value creation at Carlisle. We wish John and the entire team the best as they become part of the Amphenol family. Turning to 2024. We have entered the year with significant positive momentum and a clear focus on the goals outlined in our recently launched Vision 2030 growth strategy. We are confident that our ability to innovate with a focus on energy efficiency and labor-saving solutions puts us on the right path to drive above-market growth and in return, drive superior financial results. The improved profitability by our simplified building products portfolio, a robust free cash flow engine and the expected proceeds from the sale of CIT leave us well positioned to achieve significant value creation for shareholders and deliver another year of industry-leading ROIC in excess of 25%. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Yes. I think, Tim, we thought 2023, given the significant sales declines, we thought pricing held up really well. through most of the year, it fluctuated, but I would say it was stable. When we look back, we've got a couple of components in there too. We've got the core roofing. We've got the CAM we've got Europe and we've got some mix. And so I think, overall, I'd characterize it as stable and going to this year, I think it will be pretty much the same thing as what Kevin was talking about with the 2% to 3%. But again, it's early. It's Q1. it's January. But I think definitely, given all the declines last year, I thought the pricing held in there and maybe that gets to some of this pricing to value and what we're providing and others are providing. Well, I think it's still -- there's a good backlog. Obviously, when new construction was cooking there, we had some backlog. We've got the labor constraints. We tend to look at it at a macro level. We've gone through the chart with looking back 20 years and what's coming due. We know we have our share of the market that when it is warranted, we also know when those roofs are coming due. We think that the average roof in the industry is a 20-year roof based upon our warranties. I mean there are longer warranties you can buy, but on average, it could be about 20 years. So we track all that. I think the thing is you're talking about a very dispersed demand pallet across the entire United States is this reroofing. And you've got some things in there where you can patch and some people will repair and the place early. Others may delay a variety of functions. But I think overall, we try to get a sense through surveys. We talked about two surveys we did last year with about 600 contractors talking about what was happening in their markets around the country. And then obviously, Steve Schwar, Frank Reddy and their sales teams are out there every day talking to them. So we think the visibility is pretty good. I think those other things just create some difficulty in pinning it down. So as we go in, as Kevin said, we're looking at that 11% on the tailwind from destocking. And I think if we look at the industry in general, we're back at that mid-single digits that we've been at historically, the combination between reroofing and new construction, and we think reroofing is holding up well. Yes, yes. I think going in the year, that's how we're thinking about it. A little pressure on new construction from interest rates and the economy and then reroofing, picking that up with the backlogs Yes, exactly. Bryan, thanks. I can talk about the pipeline, if you want to. Did you want to ask any more about the share repurchases. We get 3 things there. I think maybe just pause and make sure you get everything you need on share repurchases. Yes. And then we'll get this optimal capital structure. Yes. The M&A pipeline has been a little bit, I think, all the way around slow. We are seeing deals. We'd like to see more, hopefully, we see things free up a little bit more as the spring gets here, interest rates change a little bit. But I think we're following kind of the same pattern you're seeing with everyone else that just '23 was not a great year for M&A and probably not a great year for people selling their businesses. So we're still optimistic there are things out there we can add to the building products portfolio and the envelope. I mean, as a reminder, as we said in Vision 2030, we're going to be really, we have some really specific hurdles for of them. We want to have an organic growth story within the asset that we're buying. We want to make sure that there are really hard synergies like we had with Henry, not just sales synergies and things that are hope for, but real raw material savings and plant savings like we did with Henry. We want to have a really good management team. And this is the one that I think in the Henry acquisition has been the hardest in the past is to get that type of management team that we had coming in with Henry that just right off the bat picks up the integration playbook, which is number 4. And then they run with it, and we get -- I don't know if you've heard recently, but the synergies we estimate of $30 million with the Henry deal. Now we've exceeded $50 million. And a lot of that really is to that great management team that great integration playbook and now pause once they were acquired. So when you layer those things on, I think we're a little bit more picky than most, but I think Henry is a great example of what we want to do with M&A, and I think there are more out there like that, just harder to find. And then Kevin will pick up on the capital structure. Yes. I think, Garik, the biggest thing for me is this idea that this interest rate environment that we've been facing in the economy, I mean, we're not unique in this idea that we're going into the year. First, we hear there's going to be three interest rate cuts, okay, that's super positive. We like that. Then we hear now, we're going to pull back on that. I think cash carry came out, [indiscernible] said and said maybe it's too soon to talk about that. So we've got that. We've got the economy that everybody is on pins and needles about with, obviously, employment and other things like that. So I think as we sit here, the hard thing for us to do is to be sitting in January, which is in the first quarter, our lightest, as Kevin mentioned, 20% of overall sales and trying to forecast that with the real construction season is going to be in the spring and summer. So right now, we're saying, as we did on the 2030 video that things are relatively stable and they're moving along as we expect -- and so we're kind of looking at historical averages, really what we get from the market, what our sales teams are telling us what we're seeing in project pipeline. We also get to things like value but we actually read your reports. When you do your surveys and your pulse checks and those kind of things and take all into account. So I think the biggest thing for us is just -- it all feels optimistic right now, and we like that. But when we get down to granularity, I'm looking at the economy to be the biggest variable. And then we look at specifically into some of the verticals. And when you look at '24, we see that continued, I'd say, pressure on warehouses, specifically. But to call out one that seems to be the biggest decliner would probably be warehouses. I think Dodge has it somewhere in the high teens, low 20s forecast for '24. Education looks pretty good. Retail stores, health care, we still think there's a trend there. And seems to be happening with aging population that we'll see more long-term care. Medical seems to be good. There seems to be a lot of money in medical. And then we get the reshoring of manufacturing, which think Dodge estimated was somewhere around 8% in '23. And then I think the last 1 really is the office building. So we don't deal on the tall buildings that we had Citicorp and there was a lot of distress there with the work from home, but we're more in the low 3, 4-story buildings, and we think that's good and suburban office buildings have been pretty good. So that's kind of how we see the verticals then. I think we just layer in the reroofing on top of that. And obviously, that's a little bit less vertical dependent and more dependent on the age of the -- so again, optimistic about '24. I think specifically, if we are -- continue to see the economy perform as it is, and we do get a couple of cuts that could be a pretty good year going forward, especially with the fact that I would say that there's been -- we have the destocking, but we haven't really had in this winter period, a return to restocking, which typically back four or five years ago before COVID, the result was a load-in in the spring in the March, April time frame. So there may be some of that to -- if the economy turns around and things look good. Yes, we think it picked up probably about two days of positive weather. Yes. I think for market share, I don't know, I don't want to get contentious. I would say that during COVID, I would say there were a couple of phases to it. And maybe in the first phase when we came out, if you might recall, we had actually built inventory going into COVID when others were declining. And when we came out, we captured a lot of share. So there was demand we had at others weren't able to provide. And that was part -- attributed to our belief of the Carlisle experience, providing a lot of value to our contractors, the right place, right product, right time, right? So we picked up share then. Then we did get through and is the time went on. We had others that implemented different types of techniques to get out into the market and to sell things. They handle their approach to direct sales to contractor may be different? Or are they funded distribution in a different way. And I think you're right. As we chose a path under, I think we call it our MSP program, we made some decisions. And one decision was we felt it was better to I would say, be more democratic in our approach to funding distributors, we didn't put all the eggs with the biggest distributors of contract because we make sure that all of our long-standing customers got a little bit so that everybody could survive. So we may have suffered a little bit there. And then I think there was some pricing as we came out into '23, that some attempts to gain share through that in the first quarter -- in the first quarter of the year, which could acerbated the destocking. But ultimately, things guide, as we've already touched on, it was a very stable year for pricing so things came back. And so really, when I look at the time I've been a COO to now 2014 to '24, I would say that overall market shares have remained relatively stable. There's ebbs and flows in each segment is very specific TPOs different than EPDM. EPDM is different than PBC. But on the whole, I think one of the reasons it stays relatively stable for us is our great network of architect specifications, distributors and then this warranty and specifying these things and viewing the whole thing as a system, which is what Mehul talks a lot about with Henry as well. This idea that we're having a specified system. So I don't think '24 will be any different. I think '24 will probably play out in a similar way and market share will be relatively consistent around the big buckets of our business. The three roofing membranes, the insulation, the accessories at ESI and seals of that. I would or -- I guess without -- I don't want to share too much, and I would go back to maybe more of a public figure. And I think it's -- ABI, I think. Contractor -- so that's steady 8.6 that Kevin referenced is pretty similar to what we've seen for the last few years. 9.1, I think, was there for a while. I don't think it's really dipped below 8.5. So I think backlog has remained relatively consistent, which is kind of what we talked about with labor constraints that people aren't paying resume, but there's a healthy backlog of demand there. Yes, it's relatively balanced across both CCM and CWT. Thanks, operator. Well, that concludes our fourth quarter '23 conference call. I appreciate all the questions and the interest, and we look forward to talking to everyone soon. Thanks very much."

            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Looking at our fourth quarter results on Slide 7. Despite a 1.9% decline in revenue, we were able to expand our EBITDA margins by 440 basis points to 26.4%. Furthermore, we achieved record fourth quarter earnings with an adjusted EPS of $4.17, an increase of 30% year-over-year. Looking at our segment highlights, starting with CCM on Slide 8. CCM delivered fourth quarter revenues of $816 million, up 1.9% from the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was driven by favorable weather and the return to normalization of order patterns, including the end of destocking in the channel. CCM EBITDA increased 12% to $255 million, with EBITDA margin up 270 basis points to 31.2%. This was driven by a combination of leveraging higher volume growth, favorable input costs and realizing cost savings through the Carlisle Operating System. Moving to Slide 9. Revenues at CWT decreased 11% year-over-year, primarily due to the well-known declines in residential demand and the exit of a noncore business in the first quarter of 2023. However, despite the revenue decline, we were able to drive EBITDA growth of 54% to $69 million. This represented an EBITDA margin of 22.2%, expanding at an impressive 940 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022. The margin improvement was bolstered by operational efficiencies gained through targeted restructuring actions, strategic sourcing and the realization of synergies from the Henry acquisition. Synergies now exceed $50 million, significantly above our deal model estimate of $30 million. Slide 10 provides a year-over-year fourth quarter adjusted EPS bridge items for your reference. Moving to Slides 11 through 13. Carlisle ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with $577 million of cash on hand. We had $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1 billion and invested $142 million in capital expenditures. Our free cash flow margin was 20% in 2023, and we ended the year with a solid net leverage of 1.6x, comfortably below our 2x to 3x long-term target. Our disciplined capital allocation framework remains focused on delivering ROIC in excess of 25%. As stated in Vision 2030, we continue to focus on being a superior capital allocator by investing in our high ROIC building products businesses, making synergistic acquisitions that deliver significant opportunities for value creation and repurchasing shares given our attractive valuation. We deployed $900 million towards share repurchases during 2023 and paid $160 million in dividends. This represented our 47th straight year of dividend increases. Expanding on share repurchases at the end of the fourth quarter, we have 7.4 million shares available under our share repurchase program. Notably, the $2 billion of expected proceeds from the CIT sale provides us with additional dollars and flexibility to execute further share repurchases and fund our high-returning capital allocation priorities. Overall, we believe our pristine balance sheet, conservative leverage profile and ample liquidity positions us to drive additional value creation in 2024 and beyond. Turn to Slide 14 to see our full year 2024 financial outlook. We expect 2024 revenues to increase by approximately 5% versus 2023 and EBITDA margins to expand by 50 basis points. We remain focused on disciplined pricing as we leverage greater operational efficiencies and effectively manage costs through our continuous improvement efforts. Additionally, we expect to deliver free cash flow margins of 15% and ROIC in excess of 25%. As such, we expect double-digit EPS growth in 2024. This is directly aligned with the objectives outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy and a positive first step towards a $40-plus EPS target. Looking at the components of the outlook. For CCM, we expect year-over-year revenue to grow approximately 6% in 2024. The primary drivers are the tailwinds from the return to normalization in order patterns that was absent during 2023 due to destocking. For CWT, we expect year-over-year revenue to grow approximately 4% in 2024. Strong sales execution on key growth initiatives and stronger trends in residential should more than offset any headwinds posed by nonresidential markets. With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. Yes, Tim. So overall, expecting CCM to be up about 6% in 2024. We have the destock benefit. That's about a 11% benefit -- and then pricing, we expect to be down really from the carryover from 2023, which was about 2% to 3%. And then the overall end market also down about 2% to 3%. Yes. So let's start with sales. And we're looking at sales is really what our historical seasonality has been. So if you go back pre-COVID, the three-year average on sales at CCM. The first quarter is typically about 20% of full year sales than the second quarter is about 29%. Third quarter was 27% and in the fourth quarter was 24%. And those were the historical averages, and we think '24 is going to be a more normal year, and that's what we're expecting on the CCM side. For CWT, they're pretty much the same on the quarterly. The only difference is the first half of the year, where CWT historically has been a little bit stronger in the first quarter, so about 22% of sales. And then 27% of sales in the second quarter and then the second half of the year was the same as CCM. Then if you look at the EBITDA margin, overall, we would expect the -- really the incrementals that we've talked about to drop through based on those sales numbers at CCM, it's about 40% incrementals. CWT, low to mid-30s and incrementals. Only difference of all of that is the first quarter for CWT that one just based on just how the numbers are playing out, if you look at a CWT should increase a couple of hundred basis points in Q1. So that's one exception to what I just talked about. And that improvement is really from the carryover of all the synergies that they picked up in '23. Yes. For 2023, we had given a range in the third quarter, and we hit the top end of that range where we came in for CCM at $80 million benefit -- that's for the full year, CWT for the full year was $40 million benefit. As we get into 2024 as you said, maybe a little of the numbers were conservative. This is one where we're pretty much looking at price raws to be flat for both segments. And that's offsetting that 2%, right, 2% to 3% price down. So obviously, there's a benefit of the raws take that a flat number. Yes. So R&D expense overall is about 80 basis points as a percent of sales, and we're looking to nearly double that in 2024. Everyone can hear the operator was dropped from the call. So we're just waiting to have the operator rejoin and then we'll resume the questions -- so if you can hear, please be patient, and we will get this issue resolve momentarily. Yes. So from the cash, one piece we do have in 2024 is $400 million of debt coming due in the fourth quarter. So we'll use some of the cash there. We have dividends, that's about $160 million. And then at that point, we'll invest in the R&D and some of the capital expenditures, capital expenditures, we put out $160 million to $180 million. And then it comes down to share buybacks versus acquisitions. We've been doing about $400 million a year in share buybacks. We'd expect to do that plus we're allocating right now is about half of the CIT proceeds to put that also towards share buybacks this year. Yes, capital structure, we're looking to have net debt EBITDA in the range of 1x to 2x. And at times looks like above that if it's the right acquisition, like we did with Henry and then our plan is to pay that back within 18 to 24 months to get us back in that 1 to 2x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Yes. So interest expense is around $70 million. And then yes, we have about $50 million of interest income. So $70 million, $50 million and then the net $20 million. Yes, CapEx is going to be a couple of key areas. One, the R&D. We're going to continue to invest in the innovation and doing expansion there. We have, certainly with COS, there's always cost reduction programs, whether it's through automation and those types of investments. And we also for future growth. There will be some capacity, not new lines or anything like that, but additional investments that will enhance some of our growth overall. Not really. I would say not that we've heard from the division. I think one thing is this rain in California, and this atmospheric River that they talk about. I know Frank in the CWT team do a lot there on the retail side. Once those kind of things hit, obviously, leaks appear and things like that, and that tends to be something that gets stocked up. So probably have more of an impact here as we get into February a little bit further."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mehul Patel, Carlisle's Vice President of Investor Relations. Mehul, please go ahead. \nMehul Patel : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Carlisle's Third Quarter Call. I'm Mehul Patel, Head of Investor Relations for Carlisle. We released our third quarter financial results today, and you can find both our press release and the presentation for today's call in the Investor Relations section of our website.  On the call with me today are Chris Koch, our Board Chair, President and CEO; along with Kevin Zdimal, our CFO. Today's call will begin with Chris. He will provide highlights of our third quarter results and accomplishments, followed by Kevin, who will provide an overview on our financial performance and an update on our outlook for 2023. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for questions.  Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our press release and SEC filings. As Carlisle provides non-GAAP financial information, we provided reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and in the appendix of our presentation materials, which are also available on our website.  With that, I will turn the call over to Chris. \nChristian Koch : Thank you, Mehul. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on Carlisle's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. In the third quarter, we reached a significant milestone in Carlisle's 105-year history, moving from a diversified industrial portfolio of businesses to a building products portfolio of businesses. The pending sale of CIT will mark the final step in the successful completion of our pivot to become a best-in-class pure-play building products company.  Our journey to become a focused building products portfolio began in 2021 when we, as part of our superior capital allocation methodology, made the strategic decision to enhance Vision 2025 and the future of Carlisle by allocating our future cash flow and human capital into investments that would reinforce and expand our businesses that have consistently delivered the highest returns.  We're confident that a focused portfolio of innovative products, services and solutions in the building envelope space that drive energy efficiency, labor reduction, and are priced to the value provided, will benefit our employees, customers and communities while allowing our shareholders to capitalize on industry-leading returns.  Importantly, we deliver products, services and solutions with a clear value proposition and a significant financial return for end users and contractors alike, ensuring their businesses operate more effectively. When coupled with the Carlisle experience, these innovative products, services and solutions will create a significant and clear differentiation for Carlisle and the competitive building envelope marketplace of today and tomorrow.  This new building products focus of Carlisle and the accompanying key strategic actions will build on the strong foundation of Vision 2025, and will form the key principles of our next strategic plan, Vision 2030, which will be released in December, we are proud of what our team has accomplished under Vision 2025, and look forward to sharing with all of you the next phase of value creation at Carlisle with the December launch of Vision 2030.  Turning to our third quarter results on Slide 3. In the third quarter, excluding CIT, Carlisle achieved consolidated sales of $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $340 million and adjusted EPS of $4.68 per share. Our sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the effect of increasing interest rates driven by the ongoing Federal Reserve actions.  In addition to the interest rate impact, the third quarter was also negatively impacted by tighter lending standards and increasingly conservative sentiment at contractors and distributors with respect to their inventory levels as we enter the traditionally lighter fourth and first quarters. We are nonetheless pleased that despite the sales declines, our third quarter margin performance, pricing position, and market share remain consistent with our expectations.  CCM and CWT together delivered remarkable EBITDA margin performance of 27% in the quarter, marking a 100 basis point improvement year-over-year as well as a sequential improvement from the second quarter. CCM delivered a second consecutive quarter of 30%-plus EBITDA margins, and CWT drove a solid 90 basis point improvement in EBITDA margins sequentially. This performance showcases our ability to maintain strong margins throughout economic cycles.  Our market position, brand strength and price discipline, complemented by the value we provide to customers through the Carlisle Experience and efficiency gains driven by the Carlisle Operating System are, and will remain pillars of strength for Carlisle's future under Vision 2030.  At CCM, our team remains focused on executing their proven long-term strategies which have yielded consistent success over the last 2 decades. This focus involves maintaining our brand strength through the Carlisle experience, solving end user problems through innovation and driving efficiencies through COS and operational excellence.  One additional market note, the destocking headwinds we faced over the past 4 quarters were largely in commercial roofing are behind us, setting the stage for a more normal 2024 buying profile.  CWT delivered another exceptional quarter with 37% growth in EBITDA year-over-year. Revenues performed largely as expected, reflecting the impact of the challenging residential housing market but offset by the nondiscretionary R&R exposure derived from CWT's commercial and residential roof coating solutions. The CWT team continues to excel in realizing synergies related to the Henry acquisition achieving operational efficiencies through COS and factory consolidations, and enhancing margins through system selling initiatives.  Building on this solid performance in the third quarter, we expect the positive EBITDA growth story to continue with CWT, especially as we continue to invest in operating efficiencies and scale volume through investments and share gain initiatives.  Please turn to Slide 4. While we acknowledge the near-term challenges driven by higher interest rates, tighter lending conditions and industry-wide concerns over the timing of restocking actions, we remain exceedingly bullish on Carlisle longer-term value creation runway.  As I mentioned earlier, with our pivot to a pure-play building products portfolio now essentially complete, we are a more efficient and focused organization, positioned extremely well to benefit from the attractive long-term secular trends that include a robust reroofing cycle, increasing demand for energy-efficient buildings, a significant need for solutions that increase labor efficiency on the roof, and the desire for innovation to deliver value throughout the construction process, and ultimately, building ownership.  I want to spend a minute to highlight our key drivers of success and why we are positioned to win within this backdrop. CCM is benefiting from a multiyear backlog of reroofing projects in the U.S. with 40% of total roof square footage requiring replacement in the next 10 years. This backlog is helping to ensure consistent and reliable demand.  CWT's revenue with 50% derived from repair and remodel demand across the building envelope and in both commercial and residential markets provides balanced exposure to mitigate the ebbs and flows of the economic cycles. 65% of Carlisle's sales are derived from lead certified products, clearly demonstrating the growing demand for energy-efficient solutions and integrated systems to reduce carbon-related emissions from buildings.  We have a growing pipeline of innovative products and are significantly increasing our investment in R&D to develop more environmentally sustainable products with improved performance and integrated system solutions that are easier to install. In 2023, we have delivered $290 million of sales from products introduced in the last 3 years.  The Carlisle Experience has established us as a premium brand with a recognized value proposition backed by high-quality products and exceptional service, ensuring we deliver the right products at the right place and at the right time.  And lastly, we have significant financial flexibility, thanks to our robust balance sheet and strong cash flow generation, allowing us to fund disciplined value-creating acquisitions, internal growth initiatives, and provide for the consistent and reliable return of capital to shareholders through almost a half century of growing dividends, and in the last 5 years, significant and opportunistic share repurchases.  Please refer now to Slides 5 and 6 for our progress on sustainability. Sustainability is a very important focus for Carlisle. As an organization, Carlisle is committed to being a responsible environmental stakeholder, and we strongly believe that creating a more sustainable environment is also productive and economically beneficial for our shareholders.  In December of last year, we announced our goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. While 2050 is still quite a few years away, we recognize the need to start taking action today to meet this target on time. To hold ourselves accountable and show measurable short-term progress, we created two near-term emissions reduction targets by 2030 in conjunction with the Science Based Targets initiatives also known as SBTi.  First, we committed to a 38% reduction in both our Scope 1 production GHG emissions from the manufacturer of our products, and our Scope 2 operational GHG emissions from purchased energy in our operations. We also committed to a 48% reduction in our Scope 3 upstream and downstream GHG emission intensity as we transition to lower carbon feedstocks.  To reach of these targets, we focused on three pillars. The first pillar is manufacturing energy-efficient products. As an example, in 2022, Carlisle sold more than $3.5 billion worth of lead qualified products to the residential and commercial building industry. Our customers will save as much as 155 million-megawatt hours over the lifetime of those products, which is enough energy to power almost 14 million homes in the U.S. for a year.  In addition, we converted over 50% of our spray foam blowing agents from traditional HFC formulas to more environmentally friendly HFO formulations. As a reminder, HFCs are 1,000x more carbon-intensive than HFOs. So this action resulted in reductions of almost 10,000 tons of Scope 1 GHG emissions and over 200,000 tons of Scope 3 emissions, while at the same time, contributed to over $2 million in annual cost savings. This transition from HFCs to HFO comes 13 years ahead of the mandated EPA HFC phasedown requirements, positioning Carlisle as a leader in the spray foam insulation sustainability landscape.  The second pillar is lowering emissions across our facilities and manufacturing processes. Carlisle's leadership in driving environmental management in our factories is reflected by our qualifying an additional nine facilities this year to ISO 14001, the environmental management standard. We now have 42% of Carlisle facilities qualified to ISO 14001.  This year, we also launched energy management programs at our Montgomery, New York, and Tooele, Utah plants to drive the necessary enhancements to be prepared for ISO 50001 certification by the end of 2025. Both programs are yielding significant waste and energy savings, ultimately reducing our carbon footprint and returning value to our shareholders.  Earlier this year, we invested over $125 million in our new Sikeston, Missouri polyiso facility. This investment in Sikeston represents the latest in manufacturing advances and is another example of our commitment to reduce emissions from our facilities through the latest advancements in green building technology including solar power generation and energy base load control systems. We are extremely pleased that Sikeston meets the highest sustainability standards, including lead platinum specifications.  We are also pleased that pending final certification by the United States Green Building Council, Sikeston will be the first LEED v4 platinum manufacturing facility in the entire country. The LEED v4 standard is a performance-based approach to efficiency management that calls for measurable results throughout a building's life cycle, and we are proud to lead our industry in this transformation.  Our third pillar is reducing landfill waste. This includes developing programs and partnerships to recycle and upcycle materials away from landfills. As an example, Carlisle was piloting a program to recover and recycle roofing materials, which has helped divert 95,000 metric tons of waste from landfills since inception of the program this year.  These are just a few examples of our ongoing sustainability efforts, and I encourage all of you to take a look at our 2022 corporate sustainability report, which we published at the end of August and is posted on our website. It contains superb information, including clear examples of how our products reduce carbon footprint in buildings, reduce emissions in our operations and how we plan to reduce waste to landfills.  Please turn to Slide 7. Our earnings power and margin sustainability in this challenging environment demonstrates the success of Vision 2025. As a reminder, the pillars for sustainable value creation at Carlisle under Vision 2025 included one, drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; two, utilize COS to drive continuous improvement, and drive greater efficiency; three, build scale with synergistic and accretive acquisitions; four, maintain a returns-focused capital allocation strategy, including organic investment to drive growth, a disciplined approach to M&A and returning capital to shareholders.  And notably, thus far in 2023, we've returned $699 million to shareholders with share repurchases of $580 million and $119 million paid in dividends. And of course, none of this could be possible without continuing to rely on, invest in, and develop exceptional talent.  With Vision 2025 targets achieved, and the pivot effectively complete, we will now turn to Vision 2030, the next phase in our 105-year journey as a company. Vision 2030 will continue to build upon Vision 2025, but with a focus on building products. As I mentioned earlier, Vision 2030 will be released in December, and we'll provide comprehensive details about our path to further value creation for all Carlisle stakeholders.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details as well as our updated outlook for the fourth quarter. Kevin? \nKevin Zdimal : Thank you, Chris. For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 8. CCM delivered third quarter revenues of $914 million, down 16% from the prior year. The decline was due to the remaining destock of $50 million that we expected in challenging end markets driven by higher interest rates, tighter lending conditions and project delays.  Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 32% as we maintained pricing discipline while holding share, which drove positive price/cost in the quarter. In addition, CCM drove cost reductions through operating efficiencies supported by our continuous improvement culture in the Carlisle operating system.  Moving to Slide 9. Revenues at CWT decreased 15%, primarily due to residential demand weakness and project delays. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.4%, expanding 890 basis points from the third quarter of 2022. The CWT team continues to excel in realizing synergies with the Henry acquisition, achieving operational efficiencies through COS and enhancing margins through system selling initiatives.  Slide 10 provides a year-over-year bridge items to the third quarter adjusted EPS.  Moving to Slides 11 and 12, Carlisle ended the third quarter of 2023 with $108 million of cash on hand. We repaid our $300 million senior notes on September 1 and have $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We generated cash flow from continuing operations of $390 million and invested $30 million in capital expenditures. We deployed $330 million toward share repurchases, and paid $42 million in dividends. As of the end of the third quarter, we have 8.6 million shares available for repurchase under our share repurchase program.  Turning to Slide 13. We have provided our updated Q4 2023 financial outlook. For CCM, we expect year-over-year revenue to decline 3% to 5% in the fourth quarter. For CWT, we expect year-over-year revenue to decline approximately 10% in the fourth quarter. For the total company, we expect year-over-year revenue for the fourth quarter to decline 5% to 7%. We attribute the lower revenue primarily to the challenging markets and overall economic uncertainty, which is causing project delays.  Given the solid execution by our teams across Carlisle, EBITDA margins are expected to increase approximately 200 basis points year-over-year despite the lower volume expectations. We remain focused on disciplined pricing, which is leading to better price/cost capture this year, operational efficiencies and managing costs through our continuous improvement efforts.  With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. \nChristian Koch : Thanks, Kevin. In closing, I once again would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the excellent work done by all of Carlisle employees in the third quarter. Their perseverance and commitment to Vision 2025 has allowed us to continue to deliver solid results and maintain an optimistic outlook for the future.  And that concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. \nTimothy Wojs : Maybe just to start, I know you gave us the guidance ranges for Q4 with the segments in kind of a total company. I was kind of curious if there were any kind of base case kind of planning assumptions that you'd be able to kind of share on '24 at all, just kind of high-level puts and takes as we kind of think about revenue and margins. \nChristian Koch : Yes, Tim, it kind of early, as you know, we're going through our 2024 planning right now and wrapping things up with the division. So we still need to get their final looks in that. We'd like to update in greater detail when we launch Vision 2030 in December. So there'll be somewhat 11 other months, and we'll have that under our belt. Where we'll be able to give you a little more perspective on our outlook for '24.  But I think Kevin will share a few things that might help with our perspective on where we think '24 is going. \nKevin Zdimal : Yes. So on the -- we do have some tailwinds from the destocking. So that will be a positive for 2024. Pricing that's remained stable where we are in the third quarter, expect that to continue into the fourth quarter and into 2024. So maybe down a couple of percentage overall for 2024. The end market demand, as Chris says, too early to discuss that piece of it. \nChristian Koch : So Tim, I think on the pricing thing, too, if I give a couple of things to Kevin's thing. I've been very surprised at all the -- we've heard a lot of feedback in the markets around competitor action. But one thing that's been good going into '24 is as you saw our margins held the same, our pricing was, in fact, basically flat in core CCM for the third quarter. And we've had real stability there. So I think there's been this rationality in the market despite a lot of talk from all of the competitors despite volumes being down. And I think that's a positive sign going into in 2024.  I do think raws, if we give a little perspective there, maybe a little bit of pressure there. I think, again, that's dependent on what's happening in the Middle East. And although we don't have a direct correlation to oil prices, you know that a lot of our raws come out or indirectly related to oil.  So that -- and then we've got some good gains that are continuing with CWT. I think that trend you saw in the third quarter with Frank Ready and the CWT team, they're taking action on a bunch of fronts that should help us continue to see that margin expansion and get more to our aspirational levels, which are a lot closer to CCM for CWT. And then I think last, we continue to work on innovation and I know that should be -- there should be some good tailwinds, even though they're not huge with new products, both in CCM and CWT. \nTimothy Wojs : Okay. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just given the announcement you guys made last month around selling CIT and kind of moving that to discontinued operations. I mean can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on what that sale price or that process looks like? And maybe kind of give us a little bit of a time frame there? \nChristian Koch : Yes. I think first of all, pretty conventional process. We -- I think most of the interest would have been and is from strategics. We have a few parties in the process. Process is going very smoothly. We're happy with it. I think we would like to have a contract signed sometime in the fourth quarter. And so you can -- that kind of if you work back from that, you can probably tell where we are in the process based on our announcement when we have done it.  And then I think we probably closed right after the first of the year, if we can close sooner than that, that would be great. But now it's going well and good interest and exciting process. It's a great business, and we've been pleased by the response. \nTimothy Wojs : Okay. Okay. Good. And then -- just a last one for me. I don't think the fluid sale is reflected in the end of the quarter balance sheet. And I think you were expected or expecting to use the proceeds from that for buybacks. So I guess, what would your buyback assumption be in the fourth quarter? I mean could you actually buyback -- you used all of the proceeds in the fourth quarter to buy stock back? Or does that lead in the first half? \nKevin Zdimal : Yes. So our plan that we talked about on the last call was $900 million for the year, and that was based on -- we were planning on $400 million, and the additional $500 million for CFT. So that's really the number that we're looking at is a total of $900 million. And you're correct, we closed on officially first week of October. But that number of $900 million stays the same. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer. \nBryan Blair : I appreciate all the detail on run rate CCM dynamics. Just to level set, what is your team seeing in the first month of Q4? Does that align with the down 3% to 5% guidance? Or is there some reliance on further easing of comps in November and December? \nChristian Koch : No, I think October, actually, we were pleased with how October is shaping up. Obviously, with this dynamic environment, I think we have the same concerns you do as to when, what's happening, but it's been positive both from a billings bookings perspective and what we're seeing going into November. \nBryan Blair : Understood. Price/cost remains a good guy. What has been realized year-to-date? And is there an updated full year guide on that front? \nKevin Zdimal : Yes. So we gave a range last time for CCM at $60 million to $80 million for the full year, and we expect we can narrow that range to $70 million to $80 million for the year. And yes, about 3/4 of that has been realized at this point? \nBryan Blair : Got it. Appreciate that detail. And then last one, the step-up in CWT margin has been nice. And there's obviously a lot of noise playing out quarter-by-quarter. But if we balance the second and third quarter of last year, relative to this year, 650 basis points or so, margin expansion. How should we think of the breakout of the drivers there? Clearly, price/cost has been again, a good guy for that segment, synergies are reading through. I believe you've exited a less profitable or unprofitable business.  Just curious if you can provide any detail on what the drivers are there and what we should expect going forward, Chris, I believe you said that the aspirational margin target is much closer to CCM. So that's quite compelling if you can make that happen. \nChristian Koch : Yes. Kevin will hit you with a couple of other ones, but I was really pleased. One thing I'd like to note is -- and I give a lot of credit to Frank here and the team coming in and Mehul is part of that, coming right into Carlisle from Henry and getting all the synergies we need. And I think there's still more to be taken out there on synergies. That will be one driver.  And then looking at the business, and Frank did a really nice job of quickly acting to, we exited a business, a rubber business. We consolidated a few factories and the teams jumped on board with COS. Now COS is one where I see a lot of potential, because the COS, we've done a lot with plans and assessments, and we're just starting to get into spending that capital. And I think there's a long runway there with COS. So that's a positive. But I think you'll continue to see streamlining of the operations, better operations themselves, operating efficiency through COS.  And then Kevin has got a couple of other things he'll touch on. \nKevin Zdimal : Yes, Chris, at the key highlights there, but the other one was selling initiatives. They're doing a good job on that piece of it. Obviously, you don't see at all with what's happening in resi right now, but that's been a positive. And yes, we expect continued improvement into 2024 and into 2025 as well from that number. So year-over-year improvement in each of the upcoming years. \nChristian Koch : And we've got a little bit of jumping back and forth. We got a little -- we've got some new products too that are very exciting that Frank has. And Henry won the -- they were supplier of the year at Home Depot recently. And I think that's another channel that is new to all of us here at Carlisle, and I know probably new to you, too, but Frank is doing a good job of finding ways to create opportunities with the Carlisle products and bring them potentially into that channel as well as look at potential acquisitions that could help us strengthen our position there. So overall, we've got a lot of nice kind of vectors going on here to drive to that aspirational margin of, let's say, 30, 30 plus. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. \nSaree Boroditsky : Obviously, a large portion of CCM is driven by reroofing demand. Can you just talk about the appetite in the ability of building owners to push out jobs if they decide to patch a roof. And if they do patch it, how much time does that buy them? \nChristian Koch : Well, we've got Mehul here who, and by the way Saree, good afternoon, we have Mehul who's the Henry expert on patching and roof coatings. And I think he can touch on that. I think one of the things for me that's always been a constraining item is the amount of routes that we put on that are under warranty. And I know Henry has a warranty related to their roof coatings. But I think when we talk about roof warranties, the thing that to me in terms of how far can you push out is always how far do you want to risk that warranty.  And generally, our warranties are 20 years or so, people start looking at getting these roofs, reroofed at the 17, 18, 19 year time frame. And obviously, with the labor constraints we have today that can be extended. But I think you can push it out a little bit, but ultimately, it's really about the value of what's underneath in your business.  You don't want leaks in data centers. You don't want leaks in hospitals or education facilities and those kind of things. And so I think that pushing it out creates a really -- it's a pretty big risk profile for people to do it. But when they do it, and I think it's again probably a small percentage in most cases. Now with tougher economic times, remember, there will be more. But hopefully, they'll use Henry coatings.  And Mehul, maybe you want to talk about how long those Henry coatings can sustain the life of a roof. \nMehul Patel : Yes, absolutely. So Saree, on the Henry side, they offer several roof coating applications. They have roof mastics, which they could do in the short term, by themselves 1 or 2 seasons to restore an existing roof that's not in horrible shape, that's not damage you're leaking. There are silicon roof coating applications that could extend it further maybe 5 years or so. But a lot of these roofs that are getting completely replaced, they're probably past that cycle and you're going to require 1 or 2 years of that temporary roof patching solution that Henry offers. \nSaree Boroditsky : Understood. And then just to make things clear in the guidance, I think in your 4Q 2023 outlook for adjusted EBITDA up 200 basis points. What's the base case for that? Is that with CIT and CFT? Without? Can you just help us understand where we're coming from with the up to 200 basis points? \nKevin Zdimal : Yes, that's we're taking CIT out of both the '22 and '23 number. \nSaree Boroditsky : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess last one. Can you talk about the competitive environment into next year, just given these potential market headwinds that you've discussed? And maybe think about a framework for how we think about price/cost if we do see lower market end market demand given some of your commentaries on oil prices. \nChristian Koch : Well, I think you've seen a pretty competitive market this year. I think we have to complement the teams that we're competing against. I mean, as we said when Elevate was for sale at that time Firestone, and Holcim purchased them, we get good operators that would come in, and I think they've lived up to that.  And certainly, their acquisition of Malarkey and Duro-Last and these things, they've proven they know how to run a good playbook there. GAF is always a good competitor, great quality company. And so I think we won't see any real changes in the competition. It's tough. It's been tough. And everybody will continue to invest in R&D, I'm sure and continue to invest in their channel and in factories. So I don't really see much change there.  On the price/cost, I think -- as I said, I think we've had pretty good stability there. We may see some opportunity for some price action if raws were to take a dramatic increase due to what we're seeing in the Middle East or some other disruption. But I don't really see that right now.  So I think all in all, to me, it's going to be a little bit of more in the same. And I just reserve the right there that we're here in October. And we'll have more color on that as we get closer to December, and we get through things. So we'll be able to give you more of that. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. \nGarik Shmois: Just on the margin outlook for the fourth quarter, with the 200 basis points of expansion you're expecting. Would you expect CCM margins to be up year-on-year in the fourth quarter? Or is all the gains coming from CWT just given how strong the margin ramp has been there? \nKevin Zdimal : It's a balanced piece between CCM and CWT where, as I said earlier or last quarter, we're looking at CCM to target 30% for the year on EBITDA. So that implies improvement in the fourth quarter. And then, yes, absolutely with CWT, they continue to improve. Last quarter, say, up to 350 basis points. We're probably more like 400 basis point to 450 basis point improvement year-over-year for the full year for CWT. \nGarik Shmois : Perfect. That's helpful. I wanted to ask just in some of the discussions around project delays and CWT, I just want to get more clarity there. Is that mostly on the residential side, given that was the kind of the category that was softer? Or are you seeing project delays on nonresidents impacting that segment? \nChristian Koch : I'd say it's more on the commercial side. And I'd say more -- you got the factors, the commercial lending standards, things like that are tightening up. We're finding that people need more than one debt source when they got to do these where they used to be able to do it with one.  And then I think labor, Garik, is always the constraint in all of this. We don't see really labor pools changing much. We think labor continues to be what it is, and we don't see a lot of people being added to the labor roles in the construction industry over the next few years, which, again, is why we place so much emphasis on the Carlisle Experience and on labor-saving products because we think that's still a gating item. \nGarik Shmois : Got it. Okay. Last one for me, just on inventories in CCM in the channel, encouraging to hear the destocking, some largely run its course finally. As you look to '24, certainly, a little bit early, but would you expect distributors to manage their inventory in more normal seasonal patterns or just given some of the macro uncertainties at this point as a base case would be prudent to expect distribution to take a more conservative view on their inventories for the time being. \nChristian Koch : Well, inventory is a use of cash, right? So when you have the interest rate levels we have today and with people borrowing and things like that, I think they're going to be managing their inventory levels pretty tightly. It's going to be a line item. I think every CEO and business leader is going to be looking at as we get into Q4 and through to Q1, just because, again, those are seasonally light, and I think they would be managing the inventories tightly anyway.  So maybe you can say that's the double whammy of having a seasonally like couple of quarters coupled with some higher interest rates. But I think as we go into the year, I think we are thinking that 2024 is going to look a lot more like a normal year. We've had the COVID experience and the destocking experience and we get back to some level of normalcy and see inventory levels get back up to where they've been historically, say, in 2019 to service what we still think is a really positive outlook for the industry longer term. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. \nDavid MacGregor : I wanted to -- just quickly, I think I caught the price/cost numbers for CCM, but I missed them if you said them for CWT, what would those look like? \nKevin Zdimal : CWT, overall for the full year, we're $40 million plus. \nDavid MacGregor : $40 million plus, okay. And then just a question on industry capacity, both for TPO and for polyiso, we get into 2024, will industry capacity be up in percentage terms for each of those 2 categories versus 2022 or 2021, looking back over 2, 3 years? . \nChristian Koch : Well, I'm looking back as to what's been added. And I think we've always said this industry has been pretty rational in terms of adding lines. We did add our sites in line for polyiso. We did add our 16-foot line in Carlisle for TPO. Obviously, no change in EPDM in the industry. A couple of years ago, we saw Eco had a facility, I think, in Maryland, and I think GAF might have added one in Eastern Pennsylvania for TPL and polyiso. So I think that's it. PVC no real additions there that I can think of.  So I think industry capacity is still compared to the historical averages. We're right in line with where we probably should be given market growth in that. I don't see any massive additional capacity being added or having been added. So I'd say... \nDavid MacGregor : I mean, when you can think about what you've added, what GAF has added, is there any way to express that as a percentage over a base maybe 2 years ago or. \nChristian Koch : Well, we used to say that one factory, at least in TPO or polyiso, also added about 5% to 7% capacity of the industry. I think that's probably -- as the industry has grown, I mean, I think that's still probably a good number. \nDavid MacGregor : Okay. That's really helpful. Last question for me is just you're passing that pivot point now. So congratulations on all the progress on getting to where you are now.  Presumably, there's quite a substantial inorganic growth chapter ahead of you. I wonder if you could just talk conceptually about where within your business, you see maybe the opportunities as you pursue that building envelope vision, what is the big sort of white space opportunities for you within that building envelope opportunity? \nChristian Koch : Yes, we could -- that's an extended discussion because the building envelope space stretches from windows, doors, garage doors, I mean you've got shingles, you've got nails. We could get into all sorts of stuff. But I think for us, if you think about our core and what we do well, it would -- it's really going to be around that core building envelope, other roofing ideas, things down the wall, getting into the wall.  But again, that -- an idea that I think when we look at things, it's going to be either -- it's going to have synergies either in channel. So is it something that helps us with the channel. And obviously, my comments on the retail piece and the big box stores in that. And having said that Frank has opened up a new channel for us there. There's some interesting opportunities there.  We look at new products, and there are some things in roofing and there are some things in wall cladding and things like that, that we think we have certain processes and raw materials that could be added to that like insulated metal building panels or one that obviously -- we do metal and we do polyiso and those kind of things. So that could be one that we would look at.  But I think you're going to find that there's enough for us with channel and with core synergies there too, in products too. keep it pretty close to what we're doing now. We think there's enough that -- it's not going to be too far afield. I don't see us getting into nails, for example, or getting into some piece of equipment related to cranes or something like that, right? So it will be a more CCM, CWT looking acquisition, adhesive, sealants, as I said, roofing materials, metal, things like that. \nDavid MacGregor : Where are acquisition multiples right now, Chris? \nChristian Koch : They're moving, I think. This is one of the interesting things. I think we all knew they were pretty high for the last couple of years, and I think they're moving down, I think, for types of businesses we look at. probably in the 8% to 10% range, maybe 9% to 11%, something like that, depending. But I think there's also value to be had a little bit lower as people get more realistic about the surge that came with COVID and what's happening in the market.  I also think, seeing things in the private equity markets around wanting to seeing extended monetization events, the time keeps extending. And so we think there may be some opportunities to generate some lower multiple and opportunities for exit by looking in that space. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten from Zelman. \nAdam Baumgarten : If we think about where you stand today and assuming stable price, stable costs, on the input side, how would that look in terms of the impact of next year at this point? \nChristian Koch : I guess -- sorry, you're breaking up there. I think you said if we look at stable prices, stable costs, how does it look for next year. Again, we don't want to get too far into what next year looks like right now given what's happening in the markets. But again, our view on pricing is been that this year was a pretty tumultuous year as well, and pricing was relatively stable, and raws were relatively stable. In fact, we're kind of beneficial.  But again, I think we're going to have to wait and see what happens in the markets. But our view into the fourth quarter, as Kevin dictated or indicated is good, another stable quarter. Q1, we think, Q1 of last year wasn't the best quarter. I think we were down in the high 500s in terms of revenue on that. So this year, if our exit point is maybe somewhere in the 650, 660, 670 range for fourth quarter then. We think that brings more stability into the year could get off to a good start. And then we I think if we can keep interest rates at a reasonable level, and we can get some confidence back in the economy and stability, I think it could be a good year. \nAdam Baumgarten : Okay. And then I guess if we think about demand into the fourth quarter, given your implied guidance, and if we strip out the destocking in 3Q, it seems like 4Q is maybe a little bit lighter than usual. If you could just kind of walk through the moving pieces there, if there's still some other kind of one-off type like factors in that guidance? \nKevin Zdimal : Yes, really no one-off things. It's just more of the things we talked about with some of the project delays would be the biggest piece, and that's all around the interest rates and market uncertainty that for economic uncertainty that people try to delay some of those jobs. \nOperator: Thank you. Mr. Koch, there are no further questions at this time. Please proceed. \nChristian Koch : Okay. I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call. And we look forward to, first of all, launching our Vision 2030 in December and sharing all those details with you. And we'll be in touch on that. And then following up with our fourth quarter call as we end the fourth quarter and move into 2024. So thanks very much, and look forward to talking to all of you very soon. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for participating. You may all disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Chris. For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 8. CCM delivered third quarter revenues of $914 million, down 16% from the prior year. The decline was due to the remaining destock of $50 million that we expected in challenging end markets driven by higher interest rates, tighter lending conditions and project delays.  Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 32% as we maintained pricing discipline while holding share, which drove positive price/cost in the quarter. In addition, CCM drove cost reductions through operating efficiencies supported by our continuous improvement culture in the Carlisle operating system.  Moving to Slide 9. Revenues at CWT decreased 15%, primarily due to residential demand weakness and project delays. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.4%, expanding 890 basis points from the third quarter of 2022. The CWT team continues to excel in realizing synergies with the Henry acquisition, achieving operational efficiencies through COS and enhancing margins through system selling initiatives.  Slide 10 provides a year-over-year bridge items to the third quarter adjusted EPS.  Moving to Slides 11 and 12, Carlisle ended the third quarter of 2023 with $108 million of cash on hand. We repaid our $300 million senior notes on September 1 and have $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We generated cash flow from continuing operations of $390 million and invested $30 million in capital expenditures. We deployed $330 million toward share repurchases, and paid $42 million in dividends. As of the end of the third quarter, we have 8.6 million shares available for repurchase under our share repurchase program.  Turning to Slide 13. We have provided our updated Q4 2023 financial outlook. For CCM, we expect year-over-year revenue to decline 3% to 5% in the fourth quarter. For CWT, we expect year-over-year revenue to decline approximately 10% in the fourth quarter. For the total company, we expect year-over-year revenue for the fourth quarter to decline 5% to 7%. We attribute the lower revenue primarily to the challenging markets and overall economic uncertainty, which is causing project delays.  Given the solid execution by our teams across Carlisle, EBITDA margins are expected to increase approximately 200 basis points year-over-year despite the lower volume expectations. We remain focused on disciplined pricing, which is leading to better price/cost capture this year, operational efficiencies and managing costs through our continuous improvement efforts.  With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. Yes. So on the -- we do have some tailwinds from the destocking. So that will be a positive for 2024. Pricing that's remained stable where we are in the third quarter, expect that to continue into the fourth quarter and into 2024. So maybe down a couple of percentage overall for 2024. The end market demand, as Chris says, too early to discuss that piece of it. Yes. So our plan that we talked about on the last call was $900 million for the year, and that was based on -- we were planning on $400 million, and the additional $500 million for CFT. So that's really the number that we're looking at is a total of $900 million. And you're correct, we closed on officially first week of October. But that number of $900 million stays the same. Yes. So we gave a range last time for CCM at $60 million to $80 million for the full year, and we expect we can narrow that range to $70 million to $80 million for the year. And yes, about 3/4 of that has been realized at this point? Yes, Chris, at the key highlights there, but the other one was selling initiatives. They're doing a good job on that piece of it. Obviously, you don't see at all with what's happening in resi right now, but that's been a positive. And yes, we expect continued improvement into 2024 and into 2025 as well from that number. So year-over-year improvement in each of the upcoming years. Yes, that's we're taking CIT out of both the '22 and '23 number. It's a balanced piece between CCM and CWT where, as I said earlier or last quarter, we're looking at CCM to target 30% for the year on EBITDA. So that implies improvement in the fourth quarter. And then, yes, absolutely with CWT, they continue to improve. Last quarter, say, up to 350 basis points. We're probably more like 400 basis point to 450 basis point improvement year-over-year for the full year for CWT. CWT, overall for the full year, we're $40 million plus. Yes, really no one-off things. It's just more of the things we talked about with some of the project delays would be the biggest piece, and that's all around the interest rates and market uncertainty that for economic uncertainty that people try to delay some of those jobs."

            "name": "Christian Koch",
            "content": "Thank you, Mehul. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on Carlisle's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. In the third quarter, we reached a significant milestone in Carlisle's 105-year history, moving from a diversified industrial portfolio of businesses to a building products portfolio of businesses. The pending sale of CIT will mark the final step in the successful completion of our pivot to become a best-in-class pure-play building products company.  Our journey to become a focused building products portfolio began in 2021 when we, as part of our superior capital allocation methodology, made the strategic decision to enhance Vision 2025 and the future of Carlisle by allocating our future cash flow and human capital into investments that would reinforce and expand our businesses that have consistently delivered the highest returns.  We're confident that a focused portfolio of innovative products, services and solutions in the building envelope space that drive energy efficiency, labor reduction, and are priced to the value provided, will benefit our employees, customers and communities while allowing our shareholders to capitalize on industry-leading returns.  Importantly, we deliver products, services and solutions with a clear value proposition and a significant financial return for end users and contractors alike, ensuring their businesses operate more effectively. When coupled with the Carlisle experience, these innovative products, services and solutions will create a significant and clear differentiation for Carlisle and the competitive building envelope marketplace of today and tomorrow.  This new building products focus of Carlisle and the accompanying key strategic actions will build on the strong foundation of Vision 2025, and will form the key principles of our next strategic plan, Vision 2030, which will be released in December, we are proud of what our team has accomplished under Vision 2025, and look forward to sharing with all of you the next phase of value creation at Carlisle with the December launch of Vision 2030.  Turning to our third quarter results on Slide 3. In the third quarter, excluding CIT, Carlisle achieved consolidated sales of $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $340 million and adjusted EPS of $4.68 per share. Our sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the effect of increasing interest rates driven by the ongoing Federal Reserve actions.  In addition to the interest rate impact, the third quarter was also negatively impacted by tighter lending standards and increasingly conservative sentiment at contractors and distributors with respect to their inventory levels as we enter the traditionally lighter fourth and first quarters. We are nonetheless pleased that despite the sales declines, our third quarter margin performance, pricing position, and market share remain consistent with our expectations.  CCM and CWT together delivered remarkable EBITDA margin performance of 27% in the quarter, marking a 100 basis point improvement year-over-year as well as a sequential improvement from the second quarter. CCM delivered a second consecutive quarter of 30%-plus EBITDA margins, and CWT drove a solid 90 basis point improvement in EBITDA margins sequentially. This performance showcases our ability to maintain strong margins throughout economic cycles.  Our market position, brand strength and price discipline, complemented by the value we provide to customers through the Carlisle Experience and efficiency gains driven by the Carlisle Operating System are, and will remain pillars of strength for Carlisle's future under Vision 2030.  At CCM, our team remains focused on executing their proven long-term strategies which have yielded consistent success over the last 2 decades. This focus involves maintaining our brand strength through the Carlisle experience, solving end user problems through innovation and driving efficiencies through COS and operational excellence.  One additional market note, the destocking headwinds we faced over the past 4 quarters were largely in commercial roofing are behind us, setting the stage for a more normal 2024 buying profile.  CWT delivered another exceptional quarter with 37% growth in EBITDA year-over-year. Revenues performed largely as expected, reflecting the impact of the challenging residential housing market but offset by the nondiscretionary R&R exposure derived from CWT's commercial and residential roof coating solutions. The CWT team continues to excel in realizing synergies related to the Henry acquisition achieving operational efficiencies through COS and factory consolidations, and enhancing margins through system selling initiatives.  Building on this solid performance in the third quarter, we expect the positive EBITDA growth story to continue with CWT, especially as we continue to invest in operating efficiencies and scale volume through investments and share gain initiatives.  Please turn to Slide 4. While we acknowledge the near-term challenges driven by higher interest rates, tighter lending conditions and industry-wide concerns over the timing of restocking actions, we remain exceedingly bullish on Carlisle longer-term value creation runway.  As I mentioned earlier, with our pivot to a pure-play building products portfolio now essentially complete, we are a more efficient and focused organization, positioned extremely well to benefit from the attractive long-term secular trends that include a robust reroofing cycle, increasing demand for energy-efficient buildings, a significant need for solutions that increase labor efficiency on the roof, and the desire for innovation to deliver value throughout the construction process, and ultimately, building ownership.  I want to spend a minute to highlight our key drivers of success and why we are positioned to win within this backdrop. CCM is benefiting from a multiyear backlog of reroofing projects in the U.S. with 40% of total roof square footage requiring replacement in the next 10 years. This backlog is helping to ensure consistent and reliable demand.  CWT's revenue with 50% derived from repair and remodel demand across the building envelope and in both commercial and residential markets provides balanced exposure to mitigate the ebbs and flows of the economic cycles. 65% of Carlisle's sales are derived from lead certified products, clearly demonstrating the growing demand for energy-efficient solutions and integrated systems to reduce carbon-related emissions from buildings.  We have a growing pipeline of innovative products and are significantly increasing our investment in R&D to develop more environmentally sustainable products with improved performance and integrated system solutions that are easier to install. In 2023, we have delivered $290 million of sales from products introduced in the last 3 years.  The Carlisle Experience has established us as a premium brand with a recognized value proposition backed by high-quality products and exceptional service, ensuring we deliver the right products at the right place and at the right time.  And lastly, we have significant financial flexibility, thanks to our robust balance sheet and strong cash flow generation, allowing us to fund disciplined value-creating acquisitions, internal growth initiatives, and provide for the consistent and reliable return of capital to shareholders through almost a half century of growing dividends, and in the last 5 years, significant and opportunistic share repurchases.  Please refer now to Slides 5 and 6 for our progress on sustainability. Sustainability is a very important focus for Carlisle. As an organization, Carlisle is committed to being a responsible environmental stakeholder, and we strongly believe that creating a more sustainable environment is also productive and economically beneficial for our shareholders.  In December of last year, we announced our goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. While 2050 is still quite a few years away, we recognize the need to start taking action today to meet this target on time. To hold ourselves accountable and show measurable short-term progress, we created two near-term emissions reduction targets by 2030 in conjunction with the Science Based Targets initiatives also known as SBTi.  First, we committed to a 38% reduction in both our Scope 1 production GHG emissions from the manufacturer of our products, and our Scope 2 operational GHG emissions from purchased energy in our operations. We also committed to a 48% reduction in our Scope 3 upstream and downstream GHG emission intensity as we transition to lower carbon feedstocks.  To reach of these targets, we focused on three pillars. The first pillar is manufacturing energy-efficient products. As an example, in 2022, Carlisle sold more than $3.5 billion worth of lead qualified products to the residential and commercial building industry. Our customers will save as much as 155 million-megawatt hours over the lifetime of those products, which is enough energy to power almost 14 million homes in the U.S. for a year.  In addition, we converted over 50% of our spray foam blowing agents from traditional HFC formulas to more environmentally friendly HFO formulations. As a reminder, HFCs are 1,000x more carbon-intensive than HFOs. So this action resulted in reductions of almost 10,000 tons of Scope 1 GHG emissions and over 200,000 tons of Scope 3 emissions, while at the same time, contributed to over $2 million in annual cost savings. This transition from HFCs to HFO comes 13 years ahead of the mandated EPA HFC phasedown requirements, positioning Carlisle as a leader in the spray foam insulation sustainability landscape.  The second pillar is lowering emissions across our facilities and manufacturing processes. Carlisle's leadership in driving environmental management in our factories is reflected by our qualifying an additional nine facilities this year to ISO 14001, the environmental management standard. We now have 42% of Carlisle facilities qualified to ISO 14001.  This year, we also launched energy management programs at our Montgomery, New York, and Tooele, Utah plants to drive the necessary enhancements to be prepared for ISO 50001 certification by the end of 2025. Both programs are yielding significant waste and energy savings, ultimately reducing our carbon footprint and returning value to our shareholders.  Earlier this year, we invested over $125 million in our new Sikeston, Missouri polyiso facility. This investment in Sikeston represents the latest in manufacturing advances and is another example of our commitment to reduce emissions from our facilities through the latest advancements in green building technology including solar power generation and energy base load control systems. We are extremely pleased that Sikeston meets the highest sustainability standards, including lead platinum specifications.  We are also pleased that pending final certification by the United States Green Building Council, Sikeston will be the first LEED v4 platinum manufacturing facility in the entire country. The LEED v4 standard is a performance-based approach to efficiency management that calls for measurable results throughout a building's life cycle, and we are proud to lead our industry in this transformation.  Our third pillar is reducing landfill waste. This includes developing programs and partnerships to recycle and upcycle materials away from landfills. As an example, Carlisle was piloting a program to recover and recycle roofing materials, which has helped divert 95,000 metric tons of waste from landfills since inception of the program this year.  These are just a few examples of our ongoing sustainability efforts, and I encourage all of you to take a look at our 2022 corporate sustainability report, which we published at the end of August and is posted on our website. It contains superb information, including clear examples of how our products reduce carbon footprint in buildings, reduce emissions in our operations and how we plan to reduce waste to landfills.  Please turn to Slide 7. Our earnings power and margin sustainability in this challenging environment demonstrates the success of Vision 2025. As a reminder, the pillars for sustainable value creation at Carlisle under Vision 2025 included one, drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; two, utilize COS to drive continuous improvement, and drive greater efficiency; three, build scale with synergistic and accretive acquisitions; four, maintain a returns-focused capital allocation strategy, including organic investment to drive growth, a disciplined approach to M&A and returning capital to shareholders.  And notably, thus far in 2023, we've returned $699 million to shareholders with share repurchases of $580 million and $119 million paid in dividends. And of course, none of this could be possible without continuing to rely on, invest in, and develop exceptional talent.  With Vision 2025 targets achieved, and the pivot effectively complete, we will now turn to Vision 2030, the next phase in our 105-year journey as a company. Vision 2030 will continue to build upon Vision 2025, but with a focus on building products. As I mentioned earlier, Vision 2030 will be released in December, and we'll provide comprehensive details about our path to further value creation for all Carlisle stakeholders.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details as well as our updated outlook for the fourth quarter. Kevin? Thanks, Kevin. In closing, I once again would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the excellent work done by all of Carlisle employees in the third quarter. Their perseverance and commitment to Vision 2025 has allowed us to continue to deliver solid results and maintain an optimistic outlook for the future.  And that concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Yes, Tim, it kind of early, as you know, we're going through our 2024 planning right now and wrapping things up with the division. So we still need to get their final looks in that. We'd like to update in greater detail when we launch Vision 2030 in December. So there'll be somewhat 11 other months, and we'll have that under our belt. Where we'll be able to give you a little more perspective on our outlook for '24.  But I think Kevin will share a few things that might help with our perspective on where we think '24 is going. So Tim, I think on the pricing thing, too, if I give a couple of things to Kevin's thing. I've been very surprised at all the -- we've heard a lot of feedback in the markets around competitor action. But one thing that's been good going into '24 is as you saw our margins held the same, our pricing was, in fact, basically flat in core CCM for the third quarter. And we've had real stability there. So I think there's been this rationality in the market despite a lot of talk from all of the competitors despite volumes being down. And I think that's a positive sign going into in 2024.  I do think raws, if we give a little perspective there, maybe a little bit of pressure there. I think, again, that's dependent on what's happening in the Middle East. And although we don't have a direct correlation to oil prices, you know that a lot of our raws come out or indirectly related to oil.  So that -- and then we've got some good gains that are continuing with CWT. I think that trend you saw in the third quarter with Frank Ready and the CWT team, they're taking action on a bunch of fronts that should help us continue to see that margin expansion and get more to our aspirational levels, which are a lot closer to CCM for CWT. And then I think last, we continue to work on innovation and I know that should be -- there should be some good tailwinds, even though they're not huge with new products, both in CCM and CWT. Yes. I think first of all, pretty conventional process. We -- I think most of the interest would have been and is from strategics. We have a few parties in the process. Process is going very smoothly. We're happy with it. I think we would like to have a contract signed sometime in the fourth quarter. And so you can -- that kind of if you work back from that, you can probably tell where we are in the process based on our announcement when we have done it.  And then I think we probably closed right after the first of the year, if we can close sooner than that, that would be great. But now it's going well and good interest and exciting process. It's a great business, and we've been pleased by the response. No, I think October, actually, we were pleased with how October is shaping up. Obviously, with this dynamic environment, I think we have the same concerns you do as to when, what's happening, but it's been positive both from a billings bookings perspective and what we're seeing going into November. Yes. Kevin will hit you with a couple of other ones, but I was really pleased. One thing I'd like to note is -- and I give a lot of credit to Frank here and the team coming in and Mehul is part of that, coming right into Carlisle from Henry and getting all the synergies we need. And I think there's still more to be taken out there on synergies. That will be one driver.  And then looking at the business, and Frank did a really nice job of quickly acting to, we exited a business, a rubber business. We consolidated a few factories and the teams jumped on board with COS. Now COS is one where I see a lot of potential, because the COS, we've done a lot with plans and assessments, and we're just starting to get into spending that capital. And I think there's a long runway there with COS. So that's a positive. But I think you'll continue to see streamlining of the operations, better operations themselves, operating efficiency through COS.  And then Kevin has got a couple of other things he'll touch on. And we've got a little bit of jumping back and forth. We got a little -- we've got some new products too that are very exciting that Frank has. And Henry won the -- they were supplier of the year at Home Depot recently. And I think that's another channel that is new to all of us here at Carlisle, and I know probably new to you, too, but Frank is doing a good job of finding ways to create opportunities with the Carlisle products and bring them potentially into that channel as well as look at potential acquisitions that could help us strengthen our position there. So overall, we've got a lot of nice kind of vectors going on here to drive to that aspirational margin of, let's say, 30, 30 plus. Well, we've got Mehul here who, and by the way Saree, good afternoon, we have Mehul who's the Henry expert on patching and roof coatings. And I think he can touch on that. I think one of the things for me that's always been a constraining item is the amount of routes that we put on that are under warranty. And I know Henry has a warranty related to their roof coatings. But I think when we talk about roof warranties, the thing that to me in terms of how far can you push out is always how far do you want to risk that warranty.  And generally, our warranties are 20 years or so, people start looking at getting these roofs, reroofed at the 17, 18, 19 year time frame. And obviously, with the labor constraints we have today that can be extended. But I think you can push it out a little bit, but ultimately, it's really about the value of what's underneath in your business.  You don't want leaks in data centers. You don't want leaks in hospitals or education facilities and those kind of things. And so I think that pushing it out creates a really -- it's a pretty big risk profile for people to do it. But when they do it, and I think it's again probably a small percentage in most cases. Now with tougher economic times, remember, there will be more. But hopefully, they'll use Henry coatings.  And Mehul, maybe you want to talk about how long those Henry coatings can sustain the life of a roof. Well, I think you've seen a pretty competitive market this year. I think we have to complement the teams that we're competing against. I mean, as we said when Elevate was for sale at that time Firestone, and Holcim purchased them, we get good operators that would come in, and I think they've lived up to that.  And certainly, their acquisition of Malarkey and Duro-Last and these things, they've proven they know how to run a good playbook there. GAF is always a good competitor, great quality company. And so I think we won't see any real changes in the competition. It's tough. It's been tough. And everybody will continue to invest in R&D, I'm sure and continue to invest in their channel and in factories. So I don't really see much change there.  On the price/cost, I think -- as I said, I think we've had pretty good stability there. We may see some opportunity for some price action if raws were to take a dramatic increase due to what we're seeing in the Middle East or some other disruption. But I don't really see that right now.  So I think all in all, to me, it's going to be a little bit of more in the same. And I just reserve the right there that we're here in October. And we'll have more color on that as we get closer to December, and we get through things. So we'll be able to give you more of that. I'd say it's more on the commercial side. And I'd say more -- you got the factors, the commercial lending standards, things like that are tightening up. We're finding that people need more than one debt source when they got to do these where they used to be able to do it with one.  And then I think labor, Garik, is always the constraint in all of this. We don't see really labor pools changing much. We think labor continues to be what it is, and we don't see a lot of people being added to the labor roles in the construction industry over the next few years, which, again, is why we place so much emphasis on the Carlisle Experience and on labor-saving products because we think that's still a gating item. Well, inventory is a use of cash, right? So when you have the interest rate levels we have today and with people borrowing and things like that, I think they're going to be managing their inventory levels pretty tightly. It's going to be a line item. I think every CEO and business leader is going to be looking at as we get into Q4 and through to Q1, just because, again, those are seasonally light, and I think they would be managing the inventories tightly anyway.  So maybe you can say that's the double whammy of having a seasonally like couple of quarters coupled with some higher interest rates. But I think as we go into the year, I think we are thinking that 2024 is going to look a lot more like a normal year. We've had the COVID experience and the destocking experience and we get back to some level of normalcy and see inventory levels get back up to where they've been historically, say, in 2019 to service what we still think is a really positive outlook for the industry longer term. Well, I'm looking back as to what's been added. And I think we've always said this industry has been pretty rational in terms of adding lines. We did add our sites in line for polyiso. We did add our 16-foot line in Carlisle for TPO. Obviously, no change in EPDM in the industry. A couple of years ago, we saw Eco had a facility, I think, in Maryland, and I think GAF might have added one in Eastern Pennsylvania for TPL and polyiso. So I think that's it. PVC no real additions there that I can think of.  So I think industry capacity is still compared to the historical averages. We're right in line with where we probably should be given market growth in that. I don't see any massive additional capacity being added or having been added. So I'd say... Well, we used to say that one factory, at least in TPO or polyiso, also added about 5% to 7% capacity of the industry. I think that's probably -- as the industry has grown, I mean, I think that's still probably a good number. Yes, we could -- that's an extended discussion because the building envelope space stretches from windows, doors, garage doors, I mean you've got shingles, you've got nails. We could get into all sorts of stuff. But I think for us, if you think about our core and what we do well, it would -- it's really going to be around that core building envelope, other roofing ideas, things down the wall, getting into the wall.  But again, that -- an idea that I think when we look at things, it's going to be either -- it's going to have synergies either in channel. So is it something that helps us with the channel. And obviously, my comments on the retail piece and the big box stores in that. And having said that Frank has opened up a new channel for us there. There's some interesting opportunities there.  We look at new products, and there are some things in roofing and there are some things in wall cladding and things like that, that we think we have certain processes and raw materials that could be added to that like insulated metal building panels or one that obviously -- we do metal and we do polyiso and those kind of things. So that could be one that we would look at.  But I think you're going to find that there's enough for us with channel and with core synergies there too, in products too. keep it pretty close to what we're doing now. We think there's enough that -- it's not going to be too far afield. I don't see us getting into nails, for example, or getting into some piece of equipment related to cranes or something like that, right? So it will be a more CCM, CWT looking acquisition, adhesive, sealants, as I said, roofing materials, metal, things like that. They're moving, I think. This is one of the interesting things. I think we all knew they were pretty high for the last couple of years, and I think they're moving down, I think, for types of businesses we look at. probably in the 8% to 10% range, maybe 9% to 11%, something like that, depending. But I think there's also value to be had a little bit lower as people get more realistic about the surge that came with COVID and what's happening in the market.  I also think, seeing things in the private equity markets around wanting to seeing extended monetization events, the time keeps extending. And so we think there may be some opportunities to generate some lower multiple and opportunities for exit by looking in that space. I guess -- sorry, you're breaking up there. I think you said if we look at stable prices, stable costs, how does it look for next year. Again, we don't want to get too far into what next year looks like right now given what's happening in the markets. But again, our view on pricing is been that this year was a pretty tumultuous year as well, and pricing was relatively stable, and raws were relatively stable. In fact, we're kind of beneficial.  But again, I think we're going to have to wait and see what happens in the markets. But our view into the fourth quarter, as Kevin dictated or indicated is good, another stable quarter. Q1, we think, Q1 of last year wasn't the best quarter. I think we were down in the high 500s in terms of revenue on that. So this year, if our exit point is maybe somewhere in the 650, 660, 670 range for fourth quarter then. We think that brings more stability into the year could get off to a good start. And then we I think if we can keep interest rates at a reasonable level, and we can get some confidence back in the economy and stability, I think it could be a good year. Okay. I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call. And we look forward to, first of all, launching our Vision 2030 in December and sharing all those details with you. And we'll be in touch on that. And then following up with our fourth quarter call as we end the fourth quarter and move into 2024. So thanks very much, and look forward to talking to all of you very soon."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Giannakouros, Carlisle's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jim, please go ahead.\nJames Giannakouros: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Carlisle's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. We released our second quarter financial results after the market closed today, and you can find both our press release and earnings call slide presentation in the Investor Relations section of our website, carlisle.com. On the call with me today are Chris Koch, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Zdimal, Carlisle's Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will begin with Chris providing highlights of our second quarter results and a discussion of our current business outlook, and Kevin will discuss additional financial details and our updated outlook for 2023. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the line for questions. But before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our press release and SEC filings. As Carlisle provides non-GAAP financial information, we provided reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and in the appendix of our presentation materials, which are available on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris.\nChristian Koch: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2023 earnings call. The second quarter proved to be a nice recovery story for Carlisle with our performance evidence of the team's collective efforts to improve earnings and create value for all our stakeholders. We are grateful to all Carlisle employees for their continued perseverance in the face of significant challenges and for their contributions to making the second quarter a success. Most important is our team's commitment to continuously improving our businesses. As you know, in 2021, we decided to pivot Carlisle's portfolio of diversified industrial businesses towards becoming a building product's pure play. Our recently announced sale of CFT represents another important step towards fulfilling that goal. Our Building Products businesses represented over 90% of our segment EBITDA from continuing operations in the second quarter of this year, providing further evidence that our pivot is almost complete. We continue to believe that a pivot towards an innovative building products portfolio with a focus on providing energy-efficient solutions will allow our shareholders to benefit from the significant trends in greenhouse gas reduction and increased demand for green buildings and products, especially ones that require less labor to install. Our recently announced sale of CFT continues one of the themes we brought to Carlisle under Vision 2025. That being our desire to be a superior capital allocator and in turn, drive superior shareholder returns. This goal was a primary factor in our decision to use the proceeds of the announced sale of CFT towards share repurchases this year. When combined with our share repurchases to date, our total capital devoted to buybacks in 2023 will be approximately $900 million. At CCM, despite continued channel destocking activity in the second quarter, our teams collectively drove improved sales and excellent profitability. Margins improved significantly from a combination of volume increases, price discipline, cost management and efficiency gains through COS. The last 3 quarters of destocking at our distributors and contractors has been a challenge that was made more difficult by the uncertainty related to its quantity and duration. As we enter the second half of 2023, we have performed substantial work to understand the levels of inventory of distributors and contractors and reconcile that with current demand levels. Based on this work, we believe that the vast majority of destocking issues related to supply chain constraints from 2021 and 2022 are now behind us. In CCM, as in all of our Carlisle segments, we entered the second half of 2023 with our efforts focused on leveraging solid underlying demand, capturing raw material gains and maintaining a positive price/cost relationship. Taken together, these areas of focus give us confidence that we will deliver another solid earnings performance for Carlisle shareholders in the third quarter. Our outlook would be even more optimistic if it weren't for some near-term headwinds impacting the Building Products businesses. First and foremost, well-known and well-published information about this year's extreme temperatures across much of North America have negatively impacted contractors' days on the roof. Here in the Phoenix area, for example, we have had over 26 days of 110 degree-plus temperatures and excessive heat warnings. These elevated temperatures have played a role in our contractor's ability to safely install roofs on schedule. Certainly, every roofing contractor in Carlisle sphere of business is putting employee safety and well-being first. In addition to the unique weather situation, we have seen an uptick in delays in projects due to growing economic uncertainty, tighter financing conditions and the ever-present tight labor market for roofing contractors. Even with these headwinds, we still anticipate continued strong demand for our energy-efficient building products, particularly for non-residential reroofing products. We remain very bullish on Carlisle's value creation runway given strong and sustainable underlying reroofing demand, accelerating price to value gains through new and innovative products and an increasing awareness by architects, building owners, contractors, local governments and others for the need to drive efficient energy usage, upgrade the energy efficiency of our buildings and decrease carbon emissions. Additionally, we believe that in both the nonresidential and residential construction markets, our ability to exceed the expectations of our customers and distribution partners through the combination of the Carlisle experience and our Carlisle Operating System will drive significant opportunities for share and margin gains that will deliver increased returns for our shareholders. Our confidence in Carlisle's future rests on a multiyear backlog of reroofing projects in the U.S., supporting a healthy baseline of activity for our largest business, CCM, which has recently been further enhanced by the Inflation Reduction Act and its emphasis on utilizing a significant pool of assets to drive investment and energy savings. Solid nondiscretionary repair and remodel demand throughout the residential building envelope that makes up approximately 50% of CWT revenue and provides reliable through-the-cycle sales growth. Our industry-leading ability to meet the well-known growing need for energy-efficient solutions for buildings and to drive a reduction in carbon-related emissions from buildings that as many of you know, account for close to 40% of global energy emissions. Carlisle's robust pipeline of proprietary innovative new products coming to market, accelerated by our increased investment in R&D. Our collective team's subscription to delivering the best-in-class Carlisle experience to all our stakeholders. And the financial flexibility and strategic optionality afforded us by Carlisle's fortress balance sheet and excellent cash flow generating ability. This strong financial position allows for Carlisle's disciplined, value-creating acquisition strategy, ability to comfortably fund internal growth initiatives and consistent and reliable return of capital to shareholders in the form of a growing dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. Turning to our results. Please turn to Slide 3. In the second quarter, we delivered consolidated sales of $1.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $385 million and adjusted EPS of $5.18. I'm very pleased with the second quarter results as they are a superb reflection of our earnings power as a company and have resumed the continuous improvement trends we were on, especially as it relates to margins. CCM's channel destocking was, as we believe, transitory. And while it was a challenge and caused some temporary impacts to CCM, it did not affect our fundamental business model. We remain focused on delivering products that support increasing demand for energy-efficient buildings and meeting contractors' needs for innovative labor-reducing products. Turning to CWT. Revenues in the second quarter were generally in line with our expectations, while profitability was exceptionally strong. The CWT team continues to execute exceptionally well on realizing the synergies planned with the Henry acquisition and an outstanding job of integrating the legacy CCM businesses into the new segment of CWT. Needless to say, these efforts are delivering returns ahead of the original deal model. The team is also doing an excellent job of taking cost out through footprint reduction, leveraging customer relationships to drive increased sales across their businesses, improving efficiencies in our plants and managing price cost effectively. Building on the solid performance in the second quarter, we expect this positive EBITDA growth story to continue for the rest of the year and now expect CWT's EBITDA to grow year-over-year despite the organic revenue declines expected for 2023, a truly outstanding accomplishment in a tough environment and with a relatively new management team. At CIT, we continue to benefit from the restructuring actions taken during the COVID pandemic that are now returning significant margin dollars to CIT as aircraft build rates rebound. The team has done an excellent job optimizing its manufacturing footprint and improving on its product mix, which positions us well to leverage the recovery that is underway in aircraft production. CIT's backlog is notably higher than pre-pandemic levels, giving us confidence that CIT has significant growth potential for the foreseeable future. Taken together, CIT is leveraging sales extremely well in 2023 with EBITDA up 520 basis points year-over-year in the second quarter, and we expect to continue that solid leverage going forward. Please turn to Slide 4. In line with our strategy to pivot to a pure-play premier building products company, we signed a definitive agreement to sell Carlisle Fluid Technologies for $520 million with an intention to redeploy this capital into share repurchases in 2023. The sale of CFT represents another significant step forward in our efforts to build a diversified portfolio of premier energy efficient building envelope solutions and demonstrates our commitment to being capital allocators of the highest order. On a pro forma basis, we now expect sales from our Building Products businesses to constitute approximately 84% of consolidated Carlisle revenue in 2023, this up from 56% in 2016. Please turn to Slide 5. We I'm pleased to share with all of you on the call today that our newest polyiso manufacturing facility in Sikeston, Missouri is operational and began shipping product for sale in July. In addition to employing the latest advancements in green building technology such as solar power generation and energy base load control systems, the facility will lower the carbon footprint of our supply chain and will improve lead times to customers. We're proud that Sikeston was designed and built to the highest current sustainability standards, including LEED Platinum specifications, which is a globally recognized symbol of certified sustainability achievement. Please turn to Slide 6. Our results continue to demonstrate that Vision 2025 has been the right strategy for Carlisle. In addition to our world-class teams and proven business model, we've benefited from a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow generation to provide both financial and strategic flexibility to execute and achieve our ambitious goals. Our business portfolio transformation sets the stage for a more focused, higher returning and better understood path for future sustainable value creation at Carlisle. The pillars of Vision 2025 are really well-established and remain core to Carlisle's strategy going forward. Over the last few years, despite the multiple challenges our teams have faced we continue to be guided by the clarity of mission as outlined by our strategic vision first announced 5 years ago. As we approach the completion of many of the milestones and goals of Vision 2025 last year, including exceeding our goal of $15 of GAAP EPS, we were simultaneously working on the successor to Vision 2025, a new strategic plan that will be introduced formally later this year. Vision 2030 will be a plan committed to many of the same principles and pillars we use to establish Vision 2025. And with it will come new levels of performance and expectations that are a required part of our culture of continuous improvement and of our Lean Sigma initiatives under COS. As a reminder, the foundational pillars of sustainable value creation at Carlisle under Vision 2025 include: one, drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; two, utilize the Carlisle Operating System, or COS, to drive continuous improvement and greater efficiency in our operations; three, build scale with synergistic accretive acquisitions; four, maintain a returns-focused capital allocation strategy, including organic investment to drive growth, a disciplined approach to our aforementioned M&A strategy and returning capital to our shareholders. Notably, thus far in 2023, we've returned $327 million to shareholders with share repurchases of $250 million and $77 million paid in dividends. And of course, none of this could be possible without continuing to rely on, invest in and develop our exceptional talent. Through the execution of Vision 2025, Carlisle has built a solid foundation leveraging a diversified workplace, decentralized management style, entrepreneurial spirit and a culture of continuous improvement, which will continue to guide our value creation journey in 2023 and beyond and absolutely be core to our Vision 2030 strategic plan. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details as well as our updated 2023 outlook. Kevin?\nKevin Zdimal: Thank you, Chris. For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 7. CCM delivered second quarter revenues of $948 million, down 15% from the prior year. The decline was due to continued destocking in the channel, disruptive weather and some project delays. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 31% as we had positive price costs in the quarter. Moving to Slide 8. Revenue at CWT decreased 20%, primarily due to continued softness in residential demand. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.5%, expanding 390 basis points from the second quarter of 2022. Echoing Chris' comments earlier, the team continues to benefit from its focus on integration of Henry, accelerated capture targeted synergies, effectively rolling out COS and significant investment in operations throughout CWT to drive greater efficiencies in our businesses. Moving to Slide 9. CIT revenue increased 3% in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting strength primarily in our commercial aerospace platforms as we benefit from the rebound in demand for new aircraft. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 520 basis points to 18%, driven by price realization, leverage on restructuring activities and efficiencies gained from COS. Slide 10 provides a year-over-year bridge items to second quarter adjusted EPS. Moving to Slides 11 and 12, Carlisle ended the second quarter of 2023 with $379 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We generated cash flow from continuing operations of $196 million and invested $30 million in capital expenditures. We deployed $200 million toward share repurchases and paid $38 million in dividends. As of the end of the second quarter, we have 2.3 million shares available for repurchase under our share repurchase program. Turning to Slide 13. We have provided our updated 2023 financial outlook. For both CCM and CWT, we now expect revenue to decline year-over-year in the low teens range for the full year 2023. For CIT, we now expect revenue to increase year-over-year in the mid-single-digit range. For total company, we now expect year-over-year revenue to decline in the low double digits. We attribute the lower revenue expectations for the same items that prove to be headwinds in the second quarter, namely destocking in the channel, disruptive weather and some project delays. Given the solid execution by our teams across Carlisle, we now have a more favorable outlook on full year EBITDA margins. Despite the double-digit revenue decline, we expect consolidated margins to decline only 50 basis points year-over-year in 2023. We remain focused on disciplined pricing, which is leading to better price/cost capture this year, operational efficiencies and managing costs through our continuous improvement efforts. With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Kevin. In closing, I once again would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the excellent work by all of our Carlisle employees in the second quarter. Their perseverance and just plain hard work has returned us to delivering the results we've come to expect. I'd like to take a moment to share some important organizational changes that are occurring this week. First, all of you know Jim Giannakouros, our Vice President of Investor Relations. Jim has decided to leave Carlisle to pursue other opportunities. Jim was a covering analyst when I became CEO back in 2016, and I remember the dinner we had in New York in May of 2018, where I asked him if he wanted to join Carlisle and make our Investor Relations department the best there could be in the industry. Since then, he has made significant contributions, enhancing and professionalizing our Investor Relations function here at Carlisle, as well as having an extremely positive influence on the corporate and segment finance teams. Jim has lived up to the promise of developing a truly world-class Investor Relations department, and he will truly be missed. I wish him nothing but success and happiness in his future endeavors. And I know all of my fellow Carlisle employees feel the same way. Thank you, Jim. Stepping into the role of Vice President of Investor Relations will be Mehul Patel, who joined us when we acquired Henry Company in 2021. Mehul was most recently Vice President of Finance for CWT, and many of you may have already met him as he's been representing Carlisle at investor conferences and road shows for the past year. I am very excited to have Mehul backfill Jim's role, and I know he will do an excellent job with the investment community. Additionally, Kelly Kamienski, who has been at Carlisle since 2016 and most recently serving as our Chief Accounting Officer, will be taking on the role of Vice President of Finance for CWT and replacing her in her role as CAO will be Steve Aldrich, who has been at Carlisle since 2012 in various finance positions most recently as our Vice President of FP&A. I'd like to congratulate Kelly, Mehul and Steve on all their accomplishments and wish them the best of luck in their new roles. With Vision 2025 objectives and our core values well ingrained throughout Carlisle, I remain extremely optimistic for the long-term success of Carlisle. We will continue to benefit from the flexibility afforded us by an incredible brand and reputation and take advantage of our strong capital position and superb cash flow generating capabilities. Despite near-term and potentially growing economic challenges, we will continue to drive a culture of, first, a pursuit of excellence in everything we do, of continuous improvement of an entrepreneurial mindset and a commitment to superior capital allocation. We also believe the secular growth afforded us by both nondiscretionary reroofing demand and increasing needs for improving the energy efficiencies of buildings pave the way for long term and significant value creation. We'll continue to take the necessary actions to navigate an increasingly complex operating environment, continue to deliver the Carlisle experience to our customers and create value for all stakeholders of the company. And that concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Blair from Openheimer.\nBryan Blair: I was just hoping you could thread a little more color, walk us through how the quarter played out for CCM, specifically in terms of destocking, we know has been a headwind for a while. How did that influence April and May operations relative to June? What's your sense of where channel inventory now stands? And how does that impact your progression into Q3?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes, several things there. The first on the destock. Yes, so that destock going into the quarter, we were expecting around $100 million and we're slightly above that for the quarter, about $120 million in the second quarter of destock, remaining destocking. We think we have around $50 million to go in the third quarter. That continues from some of that, the weather and as Chris mentioned, as far as labor on the roof has been a challenge for the contractors. So that's delayed a piece of that. As far as going through the quarter, I mean, April, May, June, no significant differences. I mean, it ramped up in the second quarter as we'd expect versus a fourth or the first quarter. So nothing of note there.\nBryan Blair: Okay. Understood. And we can obviously back into a second half figure given your revised CCM sales outlook for the full year, but how should we think of the sales cadence Q3, Q4? Obviously, there's noise that has impacts operations through Q2, a bit into Q3 that you just walked through? And then easy comps start to kick in, in Q4. If you could quantify expectations anymore that would be helpful.\nChristian Koch: Yes, Brian, Chris, I think that Q3 is going to look a lot like Q2 with a couple of exceptions. Obviously, Kevin talked about that. A little bit of continued destocking. Obviously, one of the things that we haven't talked about that should be talked about is that in addition to the destocking now we have this idea of restocking. The demand is still there, but I think there are a couple of things that before Kevin gets into a few more items on this that I think to be aware of, which is that I think there's been a hesitation to load in the type of stock that we've seen in the past. So my assessment after doing the work is that we're going to see a little bit of a slow start post July 5, but the demand will pick up as people get more comfortable with the quarter as we get closer to the end of the year and jobs, obviously, start to whether it has less of an impact on the jobs and those pick up as well as distributors get a bit more comfortable bringing inventory. And I think with interest rates rising, obviously, the carrying cost of having inventory is higher. Also, we have this idea that's been put out there, you all analysts have talked about it, too, that there might be some pressure from some of our competitors to lower price, which we didn't see in the quarter, by the way, pricing was flat. But I think that might be causing people to pause a little bit to say, will I be able -- will I be putting in high-cost inventory when there might be lower cost of coming. I don't see that happening, but that concern could be there. And then I think we also have to look that -- it's been a very good, I think, as you saw by COS' results with their residential shingle business. It's been good for them, bad for weather, but a good spring in terms of roofing in the resi side. And I think that also has consumed a little bit of that working capital that goes to inventory in the form of increased resi shingles and that. So I think when we look at the third quarter, it plays out the same as kind of the second quarter demand. Underlying demand is still good. Pricing should be flat, and we still see the trends continuing. So just a little color from me there. But Kevin, I don't know if you want to add anything.\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. So that all shakes out to the third quarter being a couple of percent. 2%, 3% better than the second quarter. Then as you look to the fourth quarter, typically, we're down fourth quarter versus the third, about 15%, but without the destock in the fourth quarter, it will be less than that 15% down in the fourth quarter.\nBryan Blair: Very helpful color. Margin performance was definitely a highlight of Q2 and that was across the board. But with the scale of CCM, obviously, are needle moving to have some margin upside relative to expectations. I assume that price cost was a solid lever there. Kevin, I believe last quarter, you guided to $40 million to $60 million full year benefit for price cost. Wondering if you could give us an updated figure on that and also offer a little directional insight as to how we should think about the margin cadence through the year and netting to the 50 basis points improvement on a consolidated basis relative to the prior guide.\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. So on the price cost, as you said, we were at $40 million to $60 million in our previous guidance there. Now we think we're around $60 million to $80 million. So we've upped that number and that dropped right to the bottom line, we're talking down 50 basis points this year. So maybe looking at those margins, we think we can get to CCM margins right to about 30% this year for the full year. And then as you look to CWT, I think we can get them to up maybe 350 to 400 basis points on the year. And then CIT would be up to about 17% for the full year, so 250 to 300 basis point improvement there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird.\nTimothy Wojs: Yes, Jim, good working for you with you, and best wishes on the new ventures. Maybe just starting off, Chris, just on the backlog I guess how -- what are you kind of hearing when you're talking to contractors and distributors about the backlog? And I guess when you think about days on the roof, and maybe the heat plan having an impact on some of that? I mean, how do you kind of triangulate between that versus just maybe kind of a weaker demand backdrop?\nChristian Koch: Yes, Tim, we -- thanks for that question, by the way, and thanks for acknowledging Jim, and I appreciate that. We did a lot of work in the second quarter. I'm not going to go to all the detail, it'd be too long in this call, but we could take it up later around. We spent a lot of money and a lot of time and effort into understanding that. And a lot of that came out of the fourth quarter and the first quarter, where we didn't feel we had all the information we should have had. So we've done a couple of things. One was we enacted a Net Promoter Score for Carlisle, and that's been very helpful to us. That's ties into what was actually happening in our perception vis-a-vis our competitors done by a world-class organization. We talked over 600 contractors, distributors and other point. So we've got a very good data set there started that basically back in April. At the same time, we started to look at this backlog thing. We really wanted to understand -- obviously, we didn't understand completely in Q4, the level of inventory that was out there. We think we had a good handle on distribution. I think what we missed in some ways was the inventory that was on the contractor and maybe at the job site. So as we went through, we did that. And that also was about probably about 600 contacts, 500, 600 contacts that we've been updating through the quarter. So I think we've got a good handle on where the backlog is. I got a good confidence there on this statement that people have been reducing it. I think it would be misleading to say it's over. That's a tempting thing to say the destocking is over. It will spill into Q3, what I would say is there are pockets of that, though, obviously, all distributors are not alike. And you go to the Northeast and there was a lot of rain in the second quarter, and we think that impacted it. So maybe they didn't destock as fast as somebody might have somewhere else. So I think we've got a good handle on backlog. I think the backlog is, as I said, coming down, and I really do believe that part of this issue with a little bit lower demand to us in Q3 and Q4 is really going to relate to that idea of how quickly the distributors want to stock back up. And we're getting back to normal. When we look at the fourth quarter, we just see the same demand patterns going. We -- that Kevin has talked about on numerous occasions, and you'll have the graphs on that. But I think when we get to '24, we're going to see that normal cadence in that idea of that a more traditional load in from distribution as we get into the season in '24. Really, as you know, that's kind of been missing through the whole thing. We missed it when COVID hit, hit in February, we never got the big load in. And we really rolled right into that heavy demand through '22 where everything went out to distribution and not really in an organized fashion. It was more of whatever you could get. So I feel pretty confident about what we're seeing and that the underlying demand is really good. I'll give you 2 other things on that, and I'm extending the question. But this demand when Jim talked about reroofing. I mean we know that's there. We've talked about it. We understand the length of life of a roof. We understand how roofing building owners feel about warranties on that. And I think our reroofing estimates are pretty good. When we move to this energy efficiency thing, I just saw a couple of data points that air conditioners, for example, Department of Energy just released today, 6% of all electricity consumed in the United States or produced those electric -- or those air conditioners. You're putting that on a grid that already has issues, and then we've got significant warming trends. And then I saw that GM, Hyundai and Honda are building another 30,000 plugs by 2030. But would take us to 60,000 in 2030 to drive electric vehicles. But in fact, we need 182,000. So I think when we look at what the solution is going to be, it's going to be around green, it's the insulation, it's going to be around making buildings tighter, and that falls right into what CCM and Henry deliver. And so I think we've seen that, and I feel very good about that underlying demand and that, that will continue. And then just quickly on the days on the roof, a couple of data points. People we've heard throughout the Southern states from Southern California to Florida, we've heard that they're trying to work earlier but shortened days as you start to get into the new, 1:00 it's just too hot on a roof. And so we've seen some compression there, and you can't really do it in the dark, so you get some compression on the workday. And then something I heard recently was people are also trying to get the work done in 3 days and that there may be some changes in order pattern during the summer here, where we're seeing a lot of activity, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But then as we get to Thursday, Friday, the crews are just not as effective. They're worn out, they're hot and people are handling it that way. So when we think about how many days on the roof, I can't give you a number for that, but it's got to be kind of like what we would see with a heavy rain or something like that, where we would probably, say, 2 to 3 days in the quarter.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. Okay. All right. No, that's all helpful. I appreciate that. And then maybe just on CWT. Just I guess what drove the margin upside, I guess, there in the quarter? And I guess, as you think about kind of the full year kind of margin expectations in that business, I mean, is that a good jumping off point on a go-forward basis?\nChristian Koch: Tim, we have a hole with us. We didn't announce them in the beginning of the call, and I think I'm going to turn that call over there to Mehal. I don't have a shot at it, and then we'll give Kevin back them up.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Perfect. Thanks, Chris. Tim, nice to meet you. Great question, Tim. So overall, for CWT, as Kevin mentioned, over a really strong performance on margin. To your first question, in terms of what's driving it. There are several factors. One is really strong pricing discipline. We're leveraging our investments in sales excellence and ability to influence in-market demand with our mostly internal sales force. So on a declining raw material environment, that's creating a positive tailwind for us. The second thing is dampening out inefficiencies from 2022. Obviously, there are significant supply chain challenges, the sub-optimized our ability to supply from the optimal plant. So that's correct in now, and we're doing a good job getting back to normal there. The fourth thing, Kevin and Chris talked about synergies. We're doing a really good job executing that above the deal model. So that's creating a positive tailwind. And then lastly, really strong performance on our plants in a declining volume environment. We're really taking advantage in making the right calls, right adjustments, really variabilizing our costs as much as possible, which is helping us in a declining volume environment. Lastly, to your question in terms of a jumping off point, all these things I mentioned, they're going to stay. So I think this is a good margin for us for 2024, and there's continuing to be upside as well, right? As we try to continue to drive continuous improvement, the COS system that Carlisle has. The Henry team is embracing it, that's going to continue to provide tailwinds for us to drive margins up even further Year 2, Year 3 and forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: Just wanted to follow up just on the CCM margins in the 30% that you're speaking to for this year. Just curious if you could speak to maybe your confidence in that as a jumping off moving forward in light of some of the competitive pressures, Chris, that you acknowledged recognizing your pricing is flat right now, but it seems like maybe the market is bracing for lower price?\nChristian Koch: Yes. I think it's a good -- I think it's very sustainable. In fact, I would be disappointed if we didn't return to some of the margins we've seen in -- that we saw in '22. I think some of the things that we've talked about, number one, I know there are one-off bidding that people are talking about in terms of pricing -- lack of pricing discipline. But what I'd tell you is those tend to be infrequent and that the general consensus out there is that there is good pricing discipline. I think we have -- as we talked about earlier, when we saw some management changes in one of our competitors, and we saw a different organization to purchase one of our competitors. I think -- and I'll give them both compliments. I think those were upgrades into both situations. And so those parties are understand what value creation is about and how to drive value creation for those companies, which I'm assuming they want to do. We also look at new products. We've got things like the 16-foot line. We've got our cab Group 2. We've got the appeal product. We continue to work on new coatings in Henry. We continue to make gains in different channels. And I think what we're finding is that our products and the value proposition we have are really becoming ROI-based. This idea of energy efficiency and that a roof is not just a roof, but roof now is a key component of lowering energy consumption and driving an ROIC means that you start to shift off of this idea that we have some -- in some way, a roof can be exchanged between Carlisle or someone else. I mean, each one of us is going to bring added value through that. We talked about the Carlisle experience. I think the Carlisle experience to a certain degree, was a very positive in terms of pricing. I think in the pre-2019, we used to say we would get -- there was a 5% to 7% premium to our products on the Carlisle experience just because contractors could rely on the right product at the right place at the right time. And when you were spending 1/3 on materials and 2/3 on labor, if you have labor sitting around, it wasn't a good value, you'd be better to pay the 5% to a company that gets you the product when you need it. Obviously, COVID came along, changed that, up ended it. There was a lot of confusion. And as we return and as we talk about this third quarter and people wanted to be more efficient with their inventory, obviously, we pay kind of a penalty because if you deliver faster and you can supply just-in-time product, there's kind of a weird benefit to -- that benefit the penalty on that, which is that people then will rely on us and not put us into inventory. So we're still going to be working on the Carlisle experience, and we still think in an increasing demand world like we have around ESG and other things that new products, superior customer service will continue to differentiate products. And so I like that. On the other side, on the COGS side, you can see what we're doing in raw materials. We're using them a lot more efficiently. You can see what we're doing in automation in Sikeston, view visit, which we hope people will visit the Sikeston facility, you are seeing the latest generation of ISopolyyther production, and it is extremely efficient. And so I think when you look at those things, we look at the margins in '22 and think that's what we're aspirational to. So I don't really look out to the next few years and think we'll see any being lower than the margins we've seen this year of 30%.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. No, that's helpful. My follow-up question is on CWT. I was wondering if you could maybe go into the revenue guidance revision in a little bit more detail and I can appreciate the, I guess, weaker housing market, but the builders have been certainly more optimistic of late. So just wondering if you're seeing any of that as an opportunity? And just any additional color on the change in the CWT revenue guidance would be great.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. So Tim, a couple of things. One is project delays that is impacting the CWT business, both on the commercial and residential side. So that's a key driver for the change in overall guidance. The second thing, there is still some destocking to a lesser degree, not even close to what we're seeing on the CCM side. But nonetheless, similar reasons is negatively impacting CWT. And then lastly, with raws coming down, there are still pockets for reducing price, but nonetheless, it's still a positive from a price cost standpoint.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. Okay.\nChristian Koch: Garik, that was Mehul by the way.\nGarik Shmois: Yes. I appreciate the answer. And of course, I'll give my best to Jim as well and look forward to catching up down the road and working with Mehul in the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: So maybe switch have focused on 2024 a bit. So given the impact of destocking this year in CCM, how should we think of this as a tailwind into next year? And if we're in a flattish demand environment, what could you see from sales growth in that segment?\nChristian Koch: Saree, thanks. I'll turn it over to Jim for a more technical answer to this. But I think right now -- and you know what my answer is going to be, and I'm sorry, but it's like '24 is too far out. We don't really want to make any statements around, I don't think the -- getting too refined. What I would say is, I think directionally, you are correct. I mean, obviously, with the -- if you think about legacy demand in the CCM markets being in that, let's call it, that mid-single-digit historical as a market growth. And then we saw COVID take it down and then we saw the rebound in '22, and we get back to that mid-single digits for the market. And we see that happening. Obviously, not having the inventory and getting through the destocking should produce a nice tailwind in 2024 for us. And then we still do think that with the macro trends rode the Investment Reduction Act, things like this, the reshoring, the things we're hearing that in '24 should be, I'll call it, a more normal and also a more productive year than I'd say '23 was on the top line.\nSaree Boroditsky: Given that more productive outlook into 2024, obviously, margins, I think you mentioned 30% of CCM for this year. How do we think the operating -- how do we think about operating leverage as we head into next year then as you start to see the benefit of some growth?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes, we should see 40% incrementals on that growth. And as you said, I'm adding the Chris' piece on the top line, that destock should have a plus 10% impact on '24 versus '23.\nSaree Boroditsky: Perfect. I appreciate the color. And today, Jim, you'll be very missed, and we wish you the best of luck in your next endeavor.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse.\nDaniel Oppenheim: I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more in terms of -- I guess, curious about the project delays that were mentioned. I think residential is what, 1/4 of CWT, but only a portion of that is the new residential. And I guess, sort of wondering about it overall, like the significance of sort of in the revenue guidance of lower volumes from residential versus product delays versus some of the pricing?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. So this is Mehul here again. For CWT, the project delays overall. I mean it's not like a significant amount of the change, I would say, from a percentage standpoint, I would attribute maybe 20% of it project delays, and that's going to come through a combination of labor, just the availability of labor on the construction side, the challenges getting labor. So projects are getting extended out and taking longer to get on to the next project. The second thing is financing, right, both on the commercial side, which is also another 25% of our in-market exposure for commercial starts. Financing is creating project delays just from taking longer to get projects financed.\nDaniel Oppenheim: Got it. That's great. And then on the margin side, you talked about some of the continuous improvement and sort of being in tailwinds with some of the restructuring. Are all the benefits to the restructuring sort of in place now is that what we saw in the margins this quarter will sort of be set? Or was that sort of still some to come as we go into 3Q here?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes, it will continue to benefit us as we go forward. And now my earlier comment on we still have continuous runway to continue to expand margins on CWT.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten from Zelman & Associates.\nAdam Baumgarten: Just on the project delays, maybe on the commercial side, are there any specific end market verticals that are weaker than others as you look across it? And also, are you seeing flat out project cancellations at this point?\nChristian Koch: Adam, yes, good question. I haven't seen really anything on cancellations. I'm sure there are probably some out there, but I would say they'd probably be the third sigma, where somebody, it's not really related to anything other than they're just not good business people, and that's a bad joke. But we do -- if I say there aren't any there, somebody will find one. When we look at the segments, I think this year, we've seen some negative impact on the warehouses. I think that's been somewhat well publicized around what's happening with Amazon warehouses and things like that. There's been a little bit down there, although we have places around the country like Phoenix here where warehouses continue to be established. So there might be some movement there regionally. Education has been a good story this year, especially starting the year, educational work has actually improved pretty significantly since 2021 and is at about the same pace of growth as 2022. We look at office buildings. Obviously, that's another one that's pretty well advertised around work from home and that although I would say that the decline is less than I would have thought. And I think we attribute a lot of that to when you're putting a flat roof on an office building like us that we think of, they tend to be 3, 4-story buildings, 1 story building may be manufacturing attached or something like that or warehousing. And so I think we have a little bit of a less of a work-from-home impact than, say, the Central Business District of San Francisco or Manhattan where we're seeing some tough times in office buildings, but doesn't really reflect the low slope group. Stores have been kind of a little bit down, but not too bad. And then health care has actually been a good story. And I think that's another vertical that as we look at an aging population and we look at extended care and we look at our health care system, I think we'll continue to see money put into expansions. I know here in town. We've got a lot of expansions with the Mayo Clinic. And I think in Rochester as well, they've talked about a big building expansion. So that one is doing well. And then I think when you look at more of the multifamily housing and that, obviously, there's not enough of that stock in this country, and I think that will continue to be a good tailwind with the impact, though, of interest rates probably causing some of those projects to come into question if rates stay at your 20-year highlight there as announced today. Hopefully, that gives you enough color.\nAdam Baumgarten: Yes, great. That's helpful. And then just some of the step-up in share repurchases you guys are implying in the back half. Any guidance on how you expect that to phase in, in 3Q and 4Q?\nKevin Zdimal: Relatively balanced based on what we have remaining to purchase.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Jim, good luck to you, ma'am. Sorry to fly. Exactly. So I wanted to just ask you about the main components within your cost basket. We talked about price cost, and thank you for the detail on that. But if we could just isolate the cost basket for a second and just talk about how prices you may see trending on the main components there?\nChristian Koch: Well, I don't think we really like to get into that. But I would say you can look at that's obviously a big one that we track. I think there's a mistaken correlation there that a lot of people have to the price of oil. I mean MDI really more correlates to what's happening in the cracking facility and what demand major chemical companies are seeing in petroleum companies on other feedstocks that come off of that. But MDI is seeing some reduction. I think we look at polyethylene, that's another one. EPS is a big one. We've got our synthetic and natural rubbers that we see some oils. I think just overall, again, we're seeing very positive there. I mean, in a sense, it relates to some of the demand factors that are occurring throughout the world. I don't think that a poor European economy hurts us because I think that takes out some demand and people are looking for places to put their production. I think China is certainly the chemical, petrochemical industry in Taiwan and in China is probably also looking for places to put that. So I think generally, we're seeing those declines again. MDI has been a pretty good one. I'll leave it at that. But I think overall, as you look to the second half of the year, you could see why we've upped that. And to Kevin's point, it's 60 to 80, but we're probably looking more at the upper end of that range, more like the 80 than the 60. So I know that didn't give you enough, but hopefully, that helps you from a directional perspective.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Okay. And then just with respect to CWT, you talked about the fact that -- or Mehul talked about the fact that there was still some inventory there. to deal with. I'm just wondering if we see an upturn in residential orders coming through, how much of a delay are we looking at before you actually see that business at your block? I guess that we have to turn.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. Typically, for us, once a residential project has started, our products would go on somewhere between 5 and 6 months after the start. So you kind of think of that in terms of where residential starts are and improvement there in terms of how long it takes us to trickle through for our products to go on the project. I think as far as inventory goes, yes, I think as in the residential market, it seems like it's kind of bottomed right now as it improves, it should help us on the inventory side, definitely.\nChristian Koch: Yes. And David, the only thing I would say and Nehul not have a lot more about it than me, but I think one of the things we have to segregate and CWT is this idea of putting it on new construction and then this idea of repair and remodel. So we can see in half of our business upticks in demand as quickly as a weather event occurred in California on a Friday and on Saturday morning or Sunday morning, we could have an out-of-stock position on Home Depot and be having to respond to that. So I think as you spend more time with behold understanding that the difference between that new construction and that whole side of it, then that repair and remodel that we do a lot of work taking care of roofs before they get a new roof put on. So I think that's an important relationship to understand because it does impact what happens to sales. I think a 5- to 6-month delay on probably is a little bit at the long end on the -- when you aggregate the whole business.\nBryan Blair: Yes, absolutely. So when we talk about the residential starts, you got to remember, that's 25% of the business. The other 25% on the residential side, and there's also 25% on the commercial side at all R&R. And a big component of that is really nondiscretionary roof coating projects. Products that when you have a leak on your roof, you're not going to have a choice but to use those products. The demand should be stronger in those areas, especially when there's weather events and high rain events.\nDavid MacGregor: Great. Okay. Last question for me is just on the operating leverage. And clearly, you guys have done a tremendous job this quarter of managing decremental margins. There's been quite a bit of discussion on price costs. So I think we're good there. But just on the volume leverage, I know there was a previous question, maybe I'll come out of a slightly different way here. But I'm just trying to get a sense of -- you've clearly found something different in terms of managing your fixed costs and your leverage. And I'm just trying to get a sense of how sustainable that might be going forward and whether we should be talking about updating our sense of what volume leverage is in these individual businesses.\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. CCM side, certainly, I think that new number for incrementals for sure, is a 40%. I mean some of that was a little bit higher than that on some of the decrementals just from some of the absorption issues that you have there. But going forward, we're expecting that 40% on the CCM side. And as far as CIT, they should also be in the 40%-plus range. And then CWT is a little bit lower than that, right? We're in the 30%.\nChristian Koch: Yes. And David, I will look back to when we started in '16 at where we were in adjusted EBITDA. When we talk about sustainability, I think this is really where -- and I'm glad you brought it up because it talks about the power of COS and the power of what we're doing from a Lean Sigma perspective, what our leadership is doing around continuous improvement, automation, things like this. I mean those margins -- those adjusted EBITDA margins at CCM back in '16 were probably in that 21% range. We're now 22, you're up over 30. And it's been a pretty steady progression to get there, go from 21 to 30, 1 through 23 and 24 and that. And so I think that, to me, when I look back at that almost 8-year run of continuous improvement across a variety of volume levels tells me that these are very sustainable. And the team knows for me that we got to get better every day. So I think we would continue to think we'll have more gains. And obviously, as you get into the 30s, they get tougher and tougher to get, but the team continues to add to the remarkable EBITDA journey -- positive journey that they've had.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand over to Chris. Please continue.\nChristian Koch: Well, thanks, JP. I appreciate it. This concludes our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I want to thank everybody for their participation. I do want to once again thank Jim for all the good times and great work he's done and everything he's contributed been a big part of Carl and I know going forward, he'll be very interested in what we do, and we'll be keeping in touch. And then Mehul thanks for being on the call and taking up those questions so quickly, you're in. So here we go. And thanks, everybody. We look forward to speaking to you at the next earnings call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Zdimal",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 7. CCM delivered second quarter revenues of $948 million, down 15% from the prior year. The decline was due to continued destocking in the channel, disruptive weather and some project delays. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 31% as we had positive price costs in the quarter. Moving to Slide 8. Revenue at CWT decreased 20%, primarily due to continued softness in residential demand. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.5%, expanding 390 basis points from the second quarter of 2022. Echoing Chris' comments earlier, the team continues to benefit from its focus on integration of Henry, accelerated capture targeted synergies, effectively rolling out COS and significant investment in operations throughout CWT to drive greater efficiencies in our businesses. Moving to Slide 9. CIT revenue increased 3% in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting strength primarily in our commercial aerospace platforms as we benefit from the rebound in demand for new aircraft. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 520 basis points to 18%, driven by price realization, leverage on restructuring activities and efficiencies gained from COS. Slide 10 provides a year-over-year bridge items to second quarter adjusted EPS. Moving to Slides 11 and 12, Carlisle ended the second quarter of 2023 with $379 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We generated cash flow from continuing operations of $196 million and invested $30 million in capital expenditures. We deployed $200 million toward share repurchases and paid $38 million in dividends. As of the end of the second quarter, we have 2.3 million shares available for repurchase under our share repurchase program. Turning to Slide 13. We have provided our updated 2023 financial outlook. For both CCM and CWT, we now expect revenue to decline year-over-year in the low teens range for the full year 2023. For CIT, we now expect revenue to increase year-over-year in the mid-single-digit range. For total company, we now expect year-over-year revenue to decline in the low double digits. We attribute the lower revenue expectations for the same items that prove to be headwinds in the second quarter, namely destocking in the channel, disruptive weather and some project delays. Given the solid execution by our teams across Carlisle, we now have a more favorable outlook on full year EBITDA margins. Despite the double-digit revenue decline, we expect consolidated margins to decline only 50 basis points year-over-year in 2023. We remain focused on disciplined pricing, which is leading to better price/cost capture this year, operational efficiencies and managing costs through our continuous improvement efforts. With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. Yes, several things there. The first on the destock. Yes, so that destock going into the quarter, we were expecting around $100 million and we're slightly above that for the quarter, about $120 million in the second quarter of destock, remaining destocking. We think we have around $50 million to go in the third quarter. That continues from some of that, the weather and as Chris mentioned, as far as labor on the roof has been a challenge for the contractors. So that's delayed a piece of that. As far as going through the quarter, I mean, April, May, June, no significant differences. I mean, it ramped up in the second quarter as we'd expect versus a fourth or the first quarter. So nothing of note there. Yes. So that all shakes out to the third quarter being a couple of percent. 2%, 3% better than the second quarter. Then as you look to the fourth quarter, typically, we're down fourth quarter versus the third, about 15%, but without the destock in the fourth quarter, it will be less than that 15% down in the fourth quarter. Yes. So on the price cost, as you said, we were at $40 million to $60 million in our previous guidance there. Now we think we're around $60 million to $80 million. So we've upped that number and that dropped right to the bottom line, we're talking down 50 basis points this year. So maybe looking at those margins, we think we can get to CCM margins right to about 30% this year for the full year. And then as you look to CWT, I think we can get them to up maybe 350 to 400 basis points on the year. And then CIT would be up to about 17% for the full year, so 250 to 300 basis point improvement there. Yes, we should see 40% incrementals on that growth. And as you said, I'm adding the Chris' piece on the top line, that destock should have a plus 10% impact on '24 versus '23. Relatively balanced based on what we have remaining to purchase. Yes. CCM side, certainly, I think that new number for incrementals for sure, is a 40%. I mean some of that was a little bit higher than that on some of the decrementals just from some of the absorption issues that you have there. But going forward, we're expecting that 40% on the CCM side. And as far as CIT, they should also be in the 40%-plus range. And then CWT is a little bit lower than that, right? We're in the 30%."

The second quarter proved to be a nice recovery story for Carlisle with our performance evidence of the team's collective efforts to improve earnings and create value for all our stakeholders. We are grateful to all Carlisle employees for their continued perseverance in the face of significant challenges and for their contributions to making the second quarter a success. Most important is our team's commitment to continuously improving our businesses. As you know, in 2021, we decided to pivot Carlisle's portfolio of diversified industrial businesses towards becoming a building product's pure play. Our recently announced sale of CFT represents another important step towards fulfilling that goal. Our Building Products businesses represented over 90% of our segment EBITDA from continuing operations in the second quarter of this year, providing further evidence that our pivot is almost complete. We continue to believe that a pivot towards an innovative building products portfolio with a focus on providing energy-efficient solutions will allow our shareholders to benefit from the significant trends in greenhouse gas reduction and increased demand for green buildings and products, especially ones that require less labor to install. Our recently announced sale of CFT continues one of the themes we brought to Carlisle under Vision 2025. That being our desire to be a superior capital allocator and in turn, drive superior shareholder returns. This goal was a primary factor in our decision to use the proceeds of the announced sale of CFT towards share repurchases this year. When combined with our share repurchases to date, our total capital devoted to buybacks in 2023 will be approximately $900 million. At CCM, despite continued channel destocking activity in the second quarter, our teams collectively drove improved sales and excellent profitability. Margins improved significantly from a combination of volume increases, price discipline, cost management and efficiency gains through COS. The last 3 quarters of destocking at our distributors and contractors has been a challenge that was made more difficult by the uncertainty related to its quantity and duration. As we enter the second half of 2023, we have performed substantial work to understand the levels of inventory of distributors and contractors and reconcile that with current demand levels. Based on this work, we believe that the vast majority of destocking issues related to supply chain constraints from 2021 and 2022 are now behind us. In CCM, as in all of our Carlisle segments, we entered the second half of 2023 with our efforts focused on leveraging solid underlying demand, capturing raw material gains and maintaining a positive price/cost relationship. Taken together, these areas of focus give us confidence that we will deliver another solid earnings performance for Carlisle shareholders in the third quarter. Our outlook would be even more optimistic if it weren't for some near-term headwinds impacting the Building Products businesses. First and foremost, well-known and well-published information about this year's extreme temperatures across much of North America have negatively impacted contractors' days on the roof. Here in the Phoenix area, for example, we have had over 26 days of 110 degree-plus temperatures and excessive heat warnings. These elevated temperatures have played a role in our contractor's ability to safely install roofs on schedule. Certainly, every roofing contractor in Carlisle sphere of business is putting employee safety and well-being first. In addition to the unique weather situation, we have seen an uptick in delays in projects due to growing economic uncertainty, tighter financing conditions and the ever-present tight labor market for roofing contractors. Even with these headwinds, we still anticipate continued strong demand for our energy-efficient building products, particularly for non-residential reroofing products. We remain very bullish on Carlisle's value creation runway given strong and sustainable underlying reroofing demand, accelerating price to value gains through new and innovative products and an increasing awareness by architects, building owners, contractors, local governments and others for the need to drive efficient energy usage, upgrade the energy efficiency of our buildings and decrease carbon emissions. Additionally, we believe that in both the nonresidential and residential construction markets, our ability to exceed the expectations of our customers and distribution partners through the combination of the Carlisle experience and our Carlisle Operating System will drive significant opportunities for share and margin gains that will deliver increased returns for our shareholders. Our confidence in Carlisle's future rests on a multiyear backlog of reroofing projects in the U.S., supporting a healthy baseline of activity for our largest business, CCM, which has recently been further enhanced by the Inflation Reduction Act and its emphasis on utilizing a significant pool of assets to drive investment and energy savings. Solid nondiscretionary repair and remodel demand throughout the residential building envelope that makes up approximately 50% of CWT revenue and provides reliable through-the-cycle sales growth. Our industry-leading ability to meet the well-known growing need for energy-efficient solutions for buildings and to drive a reduction in carbon-related emissions from buildings that as many of you know, account for close to 40% of global energy emissions. Carlisle's robust pipeline of proprietary innovative new products coming to market, accelerated by our increased investment in R&D. Our collective team's subscription to delivering the best-in-class Carlisle experience to all our stakeholders. And the financial flexibility and strategic optionality afforded us by Carlisle's fortress balance sheet and excellent cash flow generating ability. This strong financial position allows for Carlisle's disciplined, value-creating acquisition strategy, ability to comfortably fund internal growth initiatives and consistent and reliable return of capital to shareholders in the form of a growing dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. Turning to our results. Please turn to Slide 3. In the second quarter, we delivered consolidated sales of $1.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $385 million and adjusted EPS of $5.18. I'm very pleased with the second quarter results as they are a superb reflection of our earnings power as a company and have resumed the continuous improvement trends we were on, especially as it relates to margins. CCM's channel destocking was, as we believe, transitory. And while it was a challenge and caused some temporary impacts to CCM, it did not affect our fundamental business model. We remain focused on delivering products that support increasing demand for energy-efficient buildings and meeting contractors' needs for innovative labor-reducing products. Turning to CWT. Revenues in the second quarter were generally in line with our expectations, while profitability was exceptionally strong. The CWT team continues to execute exceptionally well on realizing the synergies planned with the Henry acquisition and an outstanding job of integrating the legacy CCM businesses into the new segment of CWT. Needless to say, these efforts are delivering returns ahead of the original deal model. The team is also doing an excellent job of taking cost out through footprint reduction, leveraging customer relationships to drive increased sales across their businesses, improving efficiencies in our plants and managing price cost effectively. Building on the solid performance in the second quarter, we expect this positive EBITDA growth story to continue for the rest of the year and now expect CWT's EBITDA to grow year-over-year despite the organic revenue declines expected for 2023, a truly outstanding accomplishment in a tough environment and with a relatively new management team. At CIT, we continue to benefit from the restructuring actions taken during the COVID pandemic that are now returning significant margin dollars to CIT as aircraft build rates rebound. The team has done an excellent job optimizing its manufacturing footprint and improving on its product mix, which positions us well to leverage the recovery that is underway in aircraft production. CIT's backlog is notably higher than pre-pandemic levels, giving us confidence that CIT has significant growth potential for the foreseeable future. Taken together, CIT is leveraging sales extremely well in 2023 with EBITDA up 520 basis points year-over-year in the second quarter, and we expect to continue that solid leverage going forward. Please turn to Slide 4. In line with our strategy to pivot to a pure-play premier building products company, we signed a definitive agreement to sell Carlisle Fluid Technologies for $520 million with an intention to redeploy this capital into share repurchases in 2023. The sale of CFT represents another significant step forward in our efforts to build a diversified portfolio of premier energy efficient building envelope solutions and demonstrates our commitment to being capital allocators of the highest order. On a pro forma basis, we now expect sales from our Building Products businesses to constitute approximately 84% of consolidated Carlisle revenue in 2023, this up from 56% in 2016. Please turn to Slide 5. We I'm pleased to share with all of you on the call today that our newest polyiso manufacturing facility in Sikeston, Missouri is operational and began shipping product for sale in July. In addition to employing the latest advancements in green building technology such as solar power generation and energy base load control systems, the facility will lower the carbon footprint of our supply chain and will improve lead times to customers. We're proud that Sikeston was designed and built to the highest current sustainability standards, including LEED Platinum specifications, which is a globally recognized symbol of certified sustainability achievement. Please turn to Slide 6. Our results continue to demonstrate that Vision 2025 has been the right strategy for Carlisle. In addition to our world-class teams and proven business model, we've benefited from a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow generation to provide both financial and strategic flexibility to execute and achieve our ambitious goals. Our business portfolio transformation sets the stage for a more focused, higher returning and better understood path for future sustainable value creation at Carlisle. The pillars of Vision 2025 are really well-established and remain core to Carlisle's strategy going forward. Over the last few years, despite the multiple challenges our teams have faced we continue to be guided by the clarity of mission as outlined by our strategic vision first announced 5 years ago. As we approach the completion of many of the milestones and goals of Vision 2025 last year, including exceeding our goal of $15 of GAAP EPS, we were simultaneously working on the successor to Vision 2025, a new strategic plan that will be introduced formally later this year. Vision 2030 will be a plan committed to many of the same principles and pillars we use to establish Vision 2025. And with it will come new levels of performance and expectations that are a required part of our culture of continuous improvement and of our Lean Sigma initiatives under COS. As a reminder, the foundational pillars of sustainable value creation at Carlisle under Vision 2025 include: one, drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; two, utilize the Carlisle Operating System, or COS, to drive continuous improvement and greater efficiency in our operations; three, build scale with synergistic accretive acquisitions; four, maintain a returns-focused capital allocation strategy, including organic investment to drive growth, a disciplined approach to our aforementioned M&A strategy and returning capital to our shareholders. Notably, thus far in 2023, we've returned $327 million to shareholders with share repurchases of $250 million and $77 million paid in dividends. And of course, none of this could be possible without continuing to rely on, invest in and develop our exceptional talent. Through the execution of Vision 2025, Carlisle has built a solid foundation leveraging a diversified workplace, decentralized management style, entrepreneurial spirit and a culture of continuous improvement, which will continue to guide our value creation journey in 2023 and beyond and absolutely be core to our Vision 2030 strategic plan. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details as well as our updated 2023 outlook. Kevin? Thanks, Kevin. In closing, I once again would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the excellent work by all of our Carlisle employees in the second quarter. Their perseverance and just plain hard work has returned us to delivering the results we've come to expect. I'd like to take a moment to share some important organizational changes that are occurring this week. First, all of you know Jim Giannakouros, our Vice President of Investor Relations. Jim has decided to leave Carlisle to pursue other opportunities. Jim was a covering analyst when I became CEO back in 2016, and I remember the dinner we had in New York in May of 2018, where I asked him if he wanted to join Carlisle and make our Investor Relations department the best there could be in the industry. Since then, he has made significant contributions, enhancing and professionalizing our Investor Relations function here at Carlisle, as well as having an extremely positive influence on the corporate and segment finance teams. Jim has lived up to the promise of developing a truly world-class Investor Relations department, and he will truly be missed. I wish him nothing but success and happiness in his future endeavors. And I know all of my fellow Carlisle employees feel the same way. Thank you, Jim. Stepping into the role of Vice President of Investor Relations will be Mehul Patel, who joined us when we acquired Henry Company in 2021. Mehul was most recently Vice President of Finance for CWT, and many of you may have already met him as he's been representing Carlisle at investor conferences and road shows for the past year. I am very excited to have Mehul backfill Jim's role, and I know he will do an excellent job with the investment community. Additionally, Kelly Kamienski, who has been at Carlisle since 2016 and most recently serving as our Chief Accounting Officer, will be taking on the role of Vice President of Finance for CWT and replacing her in her role as CAO will be Steve Aldrich, who has been at Carlisle since 2012 in various finance positions most recently as our Vice President of FP&A. I'd like to congratulate Kelly, Mehul and Steve on all their accomplishments and wish them the best of luck in their new roles. With Vision 2025 objectives and our core values well ingrained throughout Carlisle, I remain extremely optimistic for the long-term success of Carlisle. We will continue to benefit from the flexibility afforded us by an incredible brand and reputation and take advantage of our strong capital position and superb cash flow generating capabilities. Despite near-term and potentially growing economic challenges, we will continue to drive a culture of, first, a pursuit of excellence in everything we do, of continuous improvement of an entrepreneurial mindset and a commitment to superior capital allocation. We also believe the secular growth afforded us by both nondiscretionary reroofing demand and increasing needs for improving the energy efficiencies of buildings pave the way for long term and significant value creation. We'll continue to take the necessary actions to navigate an increasingly complex operating environment, continue to deliver the Carlisle experience to our customers and create value for all stakeholders of the company. And that concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Yes, Brian, Chris, I think that Q3 is going to look a lot like Q2 with a couple of exceptions. Obviously, Kevin talked about that. A little bit of continued destocking. Obviously, one of the things that we haven't talked about that should be talked about is that in addition to the destocking now we have this idea of restocking. The demand is still there, but I think there are a couple of things that before Kevin gets into a few more items on this that I think to be aware of, which is that I think there's been a hesitation to load in the type of stock that we've seen in the past. So my assessment after doing the work is that we're going to see a little bit of a slow start post July 5, but the demand will pick up as people get more comfortable with the quarter as we get closer to the end of the year and jobs, obviously, start to whether it has less of an impact on the jobs and those pick up as well as distributors get a bit more comfortable bringing inventory. And I think with interest rates rising, obviously, the carrying cost of having inventory is higher. Also, we have this idea that's been put out there, you all analysts have talked about it, too, that there might be some pressure from some of our competitors to lower price, which we didn't see in the quarter, by the way, pricing was flat. But I think that might be causing people to pause a little bit to say, will I be able -- will I be putting in high-cost inventory when there might be lower cost of coming. I don't see that happening, but that concern could be there. And then I think we also have to look that -- it's been a very good, I think, as you saw by COS' results with their residential shingle business. It's been good for them, bad for weather, but a good spring in terms of roofing in the resi side. And I think that also has consumed a little bit of that working capital that goes to inventory in the form of increased resi shingles and that. So I think when we look at the third quarter, it plays out the same as kind of the second quarter demand. Underlying demand is still good. Pricing should be flat, and we still see the trends continuing. So just a little color from me there. But Kevin, I don't know if you want to add anything. Yes, Tim, we -- thanks for that question, by the way, and thanks for acknowledging Jim, and I appreciate that. We did a lot of work in the second quarter. I'm not going to go to all the detail, it'd be too long in this call, but we could take it up later around. We spent a lot of money and a lot of time and effort into understanding that. And a lot of that came out of the fourth quarter and the first quarter, where we didn't feel we had all the information we should have had. So we've done a couple of things. One was we enacted a Net Promoter Score for Carlisle, and that's been very helpful to us. That's ties into what was actually happening in our perception vis-a-vis our competitors done by a world-class organization. We talked over 600 contractors, distributors and other point. So we've got a very good data set there started that basically back in April. At the same time, we started to look at this backlog thing. We really wanted to understand -- obviously, we didn't understand completely in Q4, the level of inventory that was out there. We think we had a good handle on distribution. I think what we missed in some ways was the inventory that was on the contractor and maybe at the job site. So as we went through, we did that. And that also was about probably about 600 contacts, 500, 600 contacts that we've been updating through the quarter. So I think we've got a good handle on where the backlog is. I got a good confidence there on this statement that people have been reducing it. I think it would be misleading to say it's over. That's a tempting thing to say the destocking is over. It will spill into Q3, what I would say is there are pockets of that, though, obviously, all distributors are not alike. And you go to the Northeast and there was a lot of rain in the second quarter, and we think that impacted it. So maybe they didn't destock as fast as somebody might have somewhere else. So I think we've got a good handle on backlog. I think the backlog is, as I said, coming down, and I really do believe that part of this issue with a little bit lower demand to us in Q3 and Q4 is really going to relate to that idea of how quickly the distributors want to stock back up. And we're getting back to normal. When we look at the fourth quarter, we just see the same demand patterns going. We -- that Kevin has talked about on numerous occasions, and you'll have the graphs on that. But I think when we get to '24, we're going to see that normal cadence in that idea of that a more traditional load in from distribution as we get into the season in '24. Really, as you know, that's kind of been missing through the whole thing. We missed it when COVID hit, hit in February, we never got the big load in. And we really rolled right into that heavy demand through '22 where everything went out to distribution and not really in an organized fashion. It was more of whatever you could get. So I feel pretty confident about what we're seeing and that the underlying demand is really good. I'll give you 2 other things on that, and I'm extending the question. But this demand when Jim talked about reroofing. I mean we know that's there. We've talked about it. We understand the length of life of a roof. We understand how roofing building owners feel about warranties on that. And I think our reroofing estimates are pretty good. When we move to this energy efficiency thing, I just saw a couple of data points that air conditioners, for example, Department of Energy just released today, 6% of all electricity consumed in the United States or produced those electric -- or those air conditioners. You're putting that on a grid that already has issues, and then we've got significant warming trends. And then I saw that GM, Hyundai and Honda are building another 30,000 plugs by 2030. But would take us to 60,000 in 2030 to drive electric vehicles. But in fact, we need 182,000. So I think when we look at what the solution is going to be, it's going to be around green, it's the insulation, it's going to be around making buildings tighter, and that falls right into what CCM and Henry deliver. And so I think we've seen that, and I feel very good about that underlying demand and that, that will continue. And then just quickly on the days on the roof, a couple of data points. People we've heard throughout the Southern states from Southern California to Florida, we've heard that they're trying to work earlier but shortened days as you start to get into the new, 1:00 it's just too hot on a roof. And so we've seen some compression there, and you can't really do it in the dark, so you get some compression on the workday. And then something I heard recently was people are also trying to get the work done in 3 days and that there may be some changes in order pattern during the summer here, where we're seeing a lot of activity, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But then as we get to Thursday, Friday, the crews are just not as effective. They're worn out, they're hot and people are handling it that way. So when we think about how many days on the roof, I can't give you a number for that, but it's got to be kind of like what we would see with a heavy rain or something like that, where we would probably, say, 2 to 3 days in the quarter. Tim, we have a hole with us. We didn't announce them in the beginning of the call, and I think I'm going to turn that call over there to Mehal. I don't have a shot at it, and then we'll give Kevin back them up. Yes. I think it's a good -- I think it's very sustainable. In fact, I would be disappointed if we didn't return to some of the margins we've seen in -- that we saw in '22. I think some of the things that we've talked about, number one, I know there are one-off bidding that people are talking about in terms of pricing -- lack of pricing discipline. But what I'd tell you is those tend to be infrequent and that the general consensus out there is that there is good pricing discipline. I think we have -- as we talked about earlier, when we saw some management changes in one of our competitors, and we saw a different organization to purchase one of our competitors. I think -- and I'll give them both compliments. I think those were upgrades into both situations. And so those parties are understand what value creation is about and how to drive value creation for those companies, which I'm assuming they want to do. We also look at new products. We've got things like the 16-foot line. We've got our cab Group 2. We've got the appeal product. We continue to work on new coatings in Henry. We continue to make gains in different channels. And I think what we're finding is that our products and the value proposition we have are really becoming ROI-based. This idea of energy efficiency and that a roof is not just a roof, but roof now is a key component of lowering energy consumption and driving an ROIC means that you start to shift off of this idea that we have some -- in some way, a roof can be exchanged between Carlisle or someone else. I mean, each one of us is going to bring added value through that. We talked about the Carlisle experience. I think the Carlisle experience to a certain degree, was a very positive in terms of pricing. I think in the pre-2019, we used to say we would get -- there was a 5% to 7% premium to our products on the Carlisle experience just because contractors could rely on the right product at the right place at the right time. And when you were spending 1/3 on materials and 2/3 on labor, if you have labor sitting around, it wasn't a good value, you'd be better to pay the 5% to a company that gets you the product when you need it. Obviously, COVID came along, changed that, up ended it. There was a lot of confusion. And as we return and as we talk about this third quarter and people wanted to be more efficient with their inventory, obviously, we pay kind of a penalty because if you deliver faster and you can supply just-in-time product, there's kind of a weird benefit to -- that benefit the penalty on that, which is that people then will rely on us and not put us into inventory. So we're still going to be working on the Carlisle experience, and we still think in an increasing demand world like we have around ESG and other things that new products, superior customer service will continue to differentiate products. And so I like that. On the other side, on the COGS side, you can see what we're doing in raw materials. We're using them a lot more efficiently. You can see what we're doing in automation in Sikeston, view visit, which we hope people will visit the Sikeston facility, you are seeing the latest generation of ISopolyyther production, and it is extremely efficient. And so I think when you look at those things, we look at the margins in '22 and think that's what we're aspirational to. So I don't really look out to the next few years and think we'll see any being lower than the margins we've seen this year of 30%. Garik, that was Mehul by the way. Saree, thanks. I'll turn it over to Jim for a more technical answer to this. But I think right now -- and you know what my answer is going to be, and I'm sorry, but it's like '24 is too far out. We don't really want to make any statements around, I don't think the -- getting too refined. What I would say is, I think directionally, you are correct. I mean, obviously, with the -- if you think about legacy demand in the CCM markets being in that, let's call it, that mid-single-digit historical as a market growth. And then we saw COVID take it down and then we saw the rebound in '22, and we get back to that mid-single digits for the market. And we see that happening. Obviously, not having the inventory and getting through the destocking should produce a nice tailwind in 2024 for us. And then we still do think that with the macro trends rode the Investment Reduction Act, things like this, the reshoring, the things we're hearing that in '24 should be, I'll call it, a more normal and also a more productive year than I'd say '23 was on the top line. Adam, yes, good question. I haven't seen really anything on cancellations. I'm sure there are probably some out there, but I would say they'd probably be the third sigma, where somebody, it's not really related to anything other than they're just not good business people, and that's a bad joke. But we do -- if I say there aren't any there, somebody will find one. When we look at the segments, I think this year, we've seen some negative impact on the warehouses. I think that's been somewhat well publicized around what's happening with Amazon warehouses and things like that. There's been a little bit down there, although we have places around the country like Phoenix here where warehouses continue to be established. So there might be some movement there regionally. Education has been a good story this year, especially starting the year, educational work has actually improved pretty significantly since 2021 and is at about the same pace of growth as 2022. We look at office buildings. Obviously, that's another one that's pretty well advertised around work from home and that although I would say that the decline is less than I would have thought. And I think we attribute a lot of that to when you're putting a flat roof on an office building like us that we think of, they tend to be 3, 4-story buildings, 1 story building may be manufacturing attached or something like that or warehousing. And so I think we have a little bit of a less of a work-from-home impact than, say, the Central Business District of San Francisco or Manhattan where we're seeing some tough times in office buildings, but doesn't really reflect the low slope group. Stores have been kind of a little bit down, but not too bad. And then health care has actually been a good story. And I think that's another vertical that as we look at an aging population and we look at extended care and we look at our health care system, I think we'll continue to see money put into expansions. I know here in town. We've got a lot of expansions with the Mayo Clinic. And I think in Rochester as well, they've talked about a big building expansion. So that one is doing well. And then I think when you look at more of the multifamily housing and that, obviously, there's not enough of that stock in this country, and I think that will continue to be a good tailwind with the impact, though, of interest rates probably causing some of those projects to come into question if rates stay at your 20-year highlight there as announced today. Hopefully, that gives you enough color. Well, I don't think we really like to get into that. But I would say you can look at that's obviously a big one that we track. I think there's a mistaken correlation there that a lot of people have to the price of oil. I mean MDI really more correlates to what's happening in the cracking facility and what demand major chemical companies are seeing in petroleum companies on other feedstocks that come off of that. But MDI is seeing some reduction. I think we look at polyethylene, that's another one. EPS is a big one. We've got our synthetic and natural rubbers that we see some oils. I think just overall, again, we're seeing very positive there. I mean, in a sense, it relates to some of the demand factors that are occurring throughout the world. I don't think that a poor European economy hurts us because I think that takes out some demand and people are looking for places to put their production. I think China is certainly the chemical, petrochemical industry in Taiwan and in China is probably also looking for places to put that. So I think generally, we're seeing those declines again. MDI has been a pretty good one. I'll leave it at that. But I think overall, as you look to the second half of the year, you could see why we've upped that. And to Kevin's point, it's 60 to 80, but we're probably looking more at the upper end of that range, more like the 80 than the 60. So I know that didn't give you enough, but hopefully, that helps you from a directional perspective. Yes. And David, the only thing I would say and Nehul not have a lot more about it than me, but I think one of the things we have to segregate and CWT is this idea of putting it on new construction and then this idea of repair and remodel. So we can see in half of our business upticks in demand as quickly as a weather event occurred in California on a Friday and on Saturday morning or Sunday morning, we could have an out-of-stock position on Home Depot and be having to respond to that. So I think as you spend more time with behold understanding that the difference between that new construction and that whole side of it, then that repair and remodel that we do a lot of work taking care of roofs before they get a new roof put on. So I think that's an important relationship to understand because it does impact what happens to sales. I think a 5- to 6-month delay on probably is a little bit at the long end on the -- when you aggregate the whole business. Yes. And David, I will look back to when we started in '16 at where we were in adjusted EBITDA. When we talk about sustainability, I think this is really where -- and I'm glad you brought it up because it talks about the power of COS and the power of what we're doing from a Lean Sigma perspective, what our leadership is doing around continuous improvement, automation, things like this. I mean those margins -- those adjusted EBITDA margins at CCM back in '16 were probably in that 21% range. We're now 22, you're up over 30. And it's been a pretty steady progression to get there, go from 21 to 30, 1 through 23 and 24 and that. And so I think that, to me, when I look back at that almost 8-year run of continuous improvement across a variety of volume levels tells me that these are very sustainable. And the team knows for me that we got to get better every day. So I think we would continue to think we'll have more gains. And obviously, as you get into the 30s, they get tougher and tougher to get, but the team continues to add to the remarkable EBITDA journey -- positive journey that they've had. Well, thanks, JP. I appreciate it. This concludes our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I want to thank everybody for their participation. I do want to once again thank Jim for all the good times and great work he's done and everything he's contributed been a big part of Carl and I know going forward, he'll be very interested in what we do, and we'll be keeping in touch. And then Mehul thanks for being on the call and taking up those questions so quickly, you're in. So here we go. And thanks, everybody. We look forward to speaking to you at the next earnings call."

Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Carlisle's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We released our first quarter financial results after the market closed today. And you can find both our press release and earnings call slide presentation in the Investor Relations section of our website, carlisle.com. With me today are Chris Koch, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Zdimal, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will begin with Chris providing highlights of our first quarter results and a discussion of our current business outlook and Kevin will discuss additional financial details and update you on our outlook for 2023. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the line for questions. But before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties which are discussed in our press release and SEC filings. As Carlisle provides non-GAAP financial information, we've provided reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and in the appendix of our presentation materials which are available on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Koch: Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Please turn to Slide 3. Let me begin my commentary by complementing the global Carlisle team on their effort and hard work during a challenging first quarter. Their commitment to our continuous improvement culture and steadfast dedication to delivering the Carlisle experience to our customers are some of our greatest assets and positions Carlisle extremely well in our efforts to continue to create significant value for all of our stakeholders. On our year-end 2022 call, we noted that the first quarter would be a challenge due to tough year-over-year comparisons for CCM, the normalization of buying patterns in the channel, significant inventory of both distribution and contractors and potential weather disruptions occurring in much of the country. Our financial performance as a company in the first quarter of 2023 reflected these challenges that were faced, in fact, by the entire U.S. building products industry. The U.S. building industry's normalization of buying patterns and destocking that began in Q3 of 2022 has taken longer than anticipated and we now expect it to be substantially resolved in Q2 of this year. This return to normalization of buying patterns left distributors and contractors with increased inventory positions driven by supply chain constraints that were experienced for much of 2021 and 2022. But supply constraints across the building products industry were, for the most part, resolved in the third quarter of 2022. During Q4 of 2022 and Q1 of this year, we saw continued strong demand at the contractor level as well-known positive market trends continued. However, we did see distributors and contractors adjust their orders to Carlisle, reflecting their higher-than-normal inventory levels. The efforts to effectively work down that excess inventory during the quarter have had a substantial impact on what remains in the channel and much progress has been made during the last 2 quarters despite the negative effects of cold weather and greater precipitation prolonging the process. The unusual and impactful weather experienced in the first quarter continued well into March. Looking at Q2, we see weather patterns becoming more favorable for contractors, demand continuing to improve as the season picks up and orders for our products increasing substantially over Q1 levels. These factors are what gives us confidence in destocking effectively coming to an end in the second quarter. For the remainder of 2023 and longer term, we continue to see strong underlying demand in the nonresidential and residential construction markets, with secular positives such as growing demand for energy-efficient solutions for buildings, a robust pipeline of new products coming to market, driven by our increased investment in R&D, a multiyear backlog of reroofing projects supporting a healthy baseline of activity, resulting in a very positive outlook for improved sales and profitability. With that said, we are mindful of the potential for further headwinds, such as increased tightening in the financial markets, even higher interest rates and related sentiment around anticipated deteriorating economic conditions. And we will continue to be vigilant in anticipating any negative impacts that could be forthcoming. We are also aware that constrained labor markets continue to limit contractors' ability to effectively address 100% of their potential demand, an impediment we do not see being resolved anytime soon. And as an aside is a significant driver of our new technology focus to reduce time on the roof for installation. Turning to our results. We delivered consolidated sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $214 million and adjusted EPS of $2.57. While results reflect a short-term disruption to our earnings growth expectations, particularly when compared against very difficult year-over-year comparisons, we do not believe recent trends, heavily influenced by temporary destocking impacted by inclement weather will impact our intermediate or long-term financial results. Instead, we are focused on benefiting from several tailwinds for our Building Products segments. Please turn to Slide 4. First, building codes are becoming more eco-conscious, resulting in increased demand for energy-efficient building products. At the core of this is the thought that insulation is perhaps the best source of energy savings across the building envelope and a way to reduce expected pressure on the nation's electrical grid which we know is in need of substantial investment. Our polyiso sales have grown 40% faster than traditional membrane growth and we expect that to continue for the foreseeable future as roofing our value requirements continue to increase. Notably, we have made investments in polyiso over the past few years to be able to service this growing demand, including investment in our new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Sikeston, Missouri which begins production this summer. Our Sikeston facility is also on track to achieve LEED Platinum certification, a reflection of our commitment to being a more sustainable company. Second, we continue to innovate around 2 significant pain points for our industry: sustainability and labor efficiency. Since Carlisle transformed the commercial roofing industry with the introduction of its Sure-Seal EPDM Single Ply membrane decades ago, we've remained committed to innovation that addresses contractor labor constraints that pressures their ability to service demand effectively and cost efficiently. And by addressing those constraints, we improve contractor profitability. And helping our contractors become more profitable is a key way Carlisle can demonstrate the value of our products and services. Examples of recent product introductions that help our contractors become more profitable, can be found on Slide 5 and include our 16-foot TPO line where fewer seams reduce labor hours on the roof and deliver a faster installation. Our ReadyFlash coated glass phaser which reduces adhesion time, allowing work to be completed more quickly. And our XCI Class A plus wall insulation product that provides better fire resistance and competitive pricing. We look forward to introducing many more innovative products in the coming months and years, leveraging our growing investment in R&D. Third, given our commitment to our increasingly complex industry, we continue to invest in our training and education center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, helping construction professionals specify and install more challenging systems every day. We offer innovative world-class hands-on training opportunities focusing on the installation of Carlisle warranted roofing systems and related products and the best field practices, all to help solidify and enhance our contractor relationships. We aim to be the contractor's manufacturer of choice, competing on and earning a fair price for the value we create and we are excited about our new product launches this year that will again demonstrate our commitment to helping facilitate ease of installation for contractors. A fourth tailwind supporting our positive outlook in building products is sustainability. Long-term opportunities continue to build with a large push to reduce the energy intensity of buildings and our products are squarely positioned within the solution set available to building owners today. We also believe the concept of circularity is an essential part of our product future and we're working hard to introduce recyclable products and increasingly recycled content into new products. Additionally, while still in the early innings, we expect that the Inflation Reduction Act tax benefit for building efficiency upgrades incentivizes commercial and residential building owners to invest in energy-efficient renovations and retrofits, a supportive tailwind for the next decade. And lastly, nondiscretionary reroofing and the corresponding well find backlog of roofs to be reroofed in the next decade should continue to support a steady demand backdrop for CCM. Taken together with all of our tailwinds outlined, we believe Carlisle is truly a best-in-class differentiated building products company with a clear sustainable growth and value creation runway. And our portfolio pivot to building products reflects our confidence in this. Moving to Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies. With balanced exposures between residential and commercial and repair and replace versus new construction, results in the first quarter came in slightly better than expected for our Carlisle Weatherproofing Technology segment. The CWT team continues to integrate Henry ahead of our original deal model plans, obtain the projected deal synergies and is executing very well on consolidating opportunities across business lines and geographies. The team is also driving greater efficiencies in our plants and managing price cost effectively. Given this, we expect CWT's EBITDA to remain stable year-over-year despite the organic revenue declines we currently model for 2023. At CIT, backlog continues to grow, driven by increased airframe production. And more importantly, CIT continues to leverage their growth, capitalizing on the significant hard work done during the last few years in restructuring the business. These actions taken while in the COVID pandemic helped CIT emerge from this downturn stronger than before and are now paying off. With both wide and narrow-body aircraft production continuing to ramp, we should see reliable growth tailwinds in aerospace for the next several years at CIT. I'm also very pleased and proud that CIT was recognized recently as Airbus' Electrical Standard Parts Supplier of the Year for 2023. CIT received this recognition from Airbus for its robust commercial performance, high level of collaboration, strong project follow-up on new product introductions, operational performance and willingness to go the extra mile. CIT was chosen as this year's recipient out of 35 competing suppliers and is another example of customers benefiting and recognizing Carlisle commitment to innovation and the Carlisle experience across all platforms. Now on to CFT. Carlisle Fluid Technologies continues to be an improving story with significant profitability gains this quarter. Backlogs at CFT also continue to grow with strong incoming order rates for standard products contributing to this growth. CFT remains focused on new product launches, operational efficiencies and proactively managing price and mix, all of which are contributing to attractive leverage on strong revenue growth in 2023. Please turn to Slide 6. Our results continue to demonstrate that Vision 2025 has been the right strategy for Carlisle. In addition to our world-class teams and proven business model, we benefited from a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow generation to provide both financial and strategic flexibility to execute and achieve our ambitious goals. A significant portion of our success has been driven by the multiyear process of reshaping our portfolio to pivot from a diversified industrial products company to a higher returning building products portfolio of businesses, demonstrating our desire to be superior capital allocators. This transformation sets the stage for a more focused, higher returning and better understood path for future sustainable value creation at Carlisle. The pillars of Vision 2025 are well established and remain core to Carlisle's strategy going forward. Over the last few years, despite the multiple challenges our teams have faced, we continue to be guided by the clarity of mission as outlined by our strategic vision first announced in 2018 Vision 2025. As we approach the completion of many of the milestones and goals of Vision 2025 in the last year, we were simultaneously working on the successor to Vision 2025, a new strategic plan that will be introduced formally later this year. Vision 2030 will be a plan committed to many of the same principles and pillars we used to establish Vision 2025. And with it, will come new levels of performance and expectations that will represent our culture of continuous improvement. As a reminder, the foundational pillars for sustained value creation at Carlisle under Vision 2025 include drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, utilize the Carlisle Operating System, or COS, to drive continuous improvement and build greater efficiency in our operations, build scale with synergistic accretive acquisitions, maintain returns-focused capital allocation strategy including organic investment to drive growth, a disciplined approach to our aforementioned M&A strategy and returning capital to shareholders. Notably, thus far in 2023, we've returned nearly $90 million to shareholders with share repurchases of $50 million and $39 million paid in dividends. And of course, none of this could be possible without continuing to invest in and develop exceptional talent. Through the execution of Vision 2025, Carlisle has built a solid foundation, leveraging a diversified workplace, decentralized management style, entrepreneurial spirit and a culture of continuous improvement which will continue to guide our value creation journey in 2023 and beyond and will absolutely be core to our Vision 2030 strategic plan. Turning to Slide 7. I mentioned our commitment to sustainable innovation but I'd like to highlight some of our recent steps taken towards our Net-Zero pledge. Carlisle has had a century long legacy of responsible stewardship and stakeholder focus, all driven by our core cultural value of continuous improvement. We believe that creating a more sustainable environment is also productive for our shareholders. As an organization, Carlisle is committed to being a responsible environmental stakeholder with our 3 pillars of environmental sustainability. First, develop energy-efficient products and solutions to reduce the greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions from building operations and help lower operating costs for our customers; second, reduce material waste going into landfills. Our history of recycling began in the 1920s when we incorporated scrap rubber into our inner tube production. We continue that tradition today. And third, focus on lowering the GHG emissions of our operations and manufacturing processes with the implementation of enhanced energy conservation measures. Several months into our journey after announcing our commitment to achieve Net-Zero GHG emissions across our entire value chain by 2050, we continue to take important steps towards achieving this ambitious goal. For example, we've committed to purchasing several million pounds of bio-MDI and bio-polyol to test and develop bio-based raw materials into our production. We've also replaced approximately 25% of our sourced prime carbon black in certain products with recycled material. And lastly, we're piloting end-of-life management of tear-off EPDM roofs, where we collect and process it into consumer rubber products. These steps all further our progress towards our sustainability mission and we're just getting going. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details as well as our updated 2023 outlook. Kevin?\nKevin Zdimal: Thank you, Chris. For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 8. CCM delivered first quarter revenues of $576 million, down 35% from the prior year. The decline was due to the reasons Chris previously mentioned, including tough comps, destocking in the channel and project delays due to severe weather across the U.S. These were partially offset by positive price. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 24% was negatively impacted by lower year-over-year volumes and lower cost absorption, partially offset by price realization and savings from COS. Moving to Slide 9. Sales at CWT decreased 12% due to continued softness in residential demand, partially offset by strength in our retail businesses and price realization. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17%, notably down just 60 basis points from the first quarter of 2022. The team continues to focus on the integration of Henry, realizing the $30 million of stated synergies from the acquisition and rolling out COS and significant investment in operations throughout CWT to drive greater efficiencies in our businesses. Moving to Slide 10. CIT revenue increased 15% in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting strength primarily in our commercial aerospace platforms, as we continue to see orders ramp up and momentum build as global passenger demand continues to approach pre-pandemic levels. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded more than 400 basis points to 14%, driven by favorable volume, price realization, leverage on restructuring activities and efficiencies gained from COS. Turning to CFT on Slide 11. CFT generated growth of 2.3%, driven by positive pricing and favorable volume, partially offset by a 4% year-over-year headwind from FX. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded more than 700 basis points to 22%, driven by favorable volume, price and efficiencies gained from COS. Slide 12 provides a year-over-year bridge items to first quarter adjusted EPS. Moving to Slides 13 and 14. Carlisle ended the first quarter of 2023 with $424 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We generated cash flow from continuing operations of $147 million and invested $40 million in capital expenditures. We deployed $50 million towards share repurchases and paid $39 million in dividends. As of the end of the first quarter, we have 3.2 million shares available for repurchase under our share repurchase program. Turning to Slide 15. We have provided our updated 2023 financial outlook. As a result of our challenging first quarter and destocking persisting into the second quarter at CCM, we now expect consolidated revenue to decline mid-single digits for the full year 2023. The change in our revenue outlook is entirely in our CCM segment, as our revenue outlook for CWT, CIT and CFT remain unchanged. As a result of the revenue decline, we now expect margins to decline by approximately 100 basis points for the full year 2023. We remain focused on disciplined pricing, operational efficiencies and managing costs through our continuous improvement efforts. As a result of the revenue decline, we now expect margins to decline by approximately 100 basis points for the full year 2023. We remain focused on disciplined pricing, operational efficiencies and managing costs through our continuous improvement efforts. We also continue to invest in our businesses with expanding our R&D operations, improving the Carlisle experience that provide our customers with best-in-class customer service and cutting-edge information systems. Despite the deeper and longer period of destocking occurring in the first half of 2023, we are seeing momentum in the business with April orders showing very strong sequential improvement over the first quarter levels. This gives us confidence that the inventory in the channel will be level set by this summer and our shipments in the second half will better mirror the strong end market demand. With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks.\nChris Koch: Thanks, Kevin. In closing, I would once again like to express my thanks and appreciation for the excellent work by all of Carlisle's employees, especially over the last few years. From the onset in 2020 of the COVID pandemic to the fast and furious recovery in 2021 and 2022, to the recent challenges accompanying the destocking and return to normal buying patterns, Carlisle employees have shown incredible resilience, a remarkable flexibility and a deep concern for one another. Those characteristics contributed in no small way to the accomplishments the team has achieved since the launch of Vision 2025. As we move deeper into the year and with Vision 2025 objectives well ingrained throughout Carlisle, I remain extremely optimistic for the long-term success of Carlisle, as we leverage the flexibility afforded us by an incredible brand and reputation, a strong capital position and superb cash flow-generating capabilities. Despite near-term and potentially growing economic challenges, we will continue to drive a culture of continuous improvement, an entrepreneurial mindset and commitment to superior capital allocation. We will take the necessary actions to navigate this complex operating environment, continue to deliver the Carlisle experience to our customers and create value for all stakeholders of the company. And that concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer.\nBryan Blair: I was hoping you could offer a little more color to frame the challenging start to the year and then the time line to normalize CCM order patterns. Is there any way to quantify the impact of destocking and weather, respectively, in the first quarter and perhaps offer a little more detail on April order trends relative to normalized seasonality? Understandable that there's an inflection relative to a weak Q1 but relative to a normalized seasonal path to the year, what are you seeing? And what are you hearing from the channel early construction season?\nChris Koch: Sure, a lot of things there. We'll take them one by one. When you attribute the -- most of the volume decline is destocking with some weather. I mean, if we put a 70-30, 80-20, somewhere in there, with the bulk being destocking. When you look at when it's going to be completed, we look at out-the-door sales for our distributors, we look at contractor activity. In fact, over the last probably 2.5, 3 months, we've taken on a new initiative where we're actually doing our own. I know you guys do these surveys. We're doing our own surveys. We've contacted about 450 different endpoints across the company -- country, excuse me, because we have regional differences. And what we're seeing is that at the distributor out-the-door level, in a lot of cases, we're at 90-plus percent of what they were in 2022 last year. So when we look at that and we look at what's happening with our incoming bookings from distribution and other sources, we're seeing real positive momentum building right up from February through March and now into April, good positive trajectory. And so we believe that, that will take care of that destocking and that's where we make our comment that it should be done and tapering off by the end of the second quarter. And then we'll be back to that normal cadence with CCM.\nBryan Blair: And then, kind of a natural follow-on. In terms of the revised CCM sales guide, how should we think about Q2 and back half growth rates? And what's contemplated for volume and price along the way?\nKevin Zdimal: I think price and we're not breaking out price as much from volume but for the most part, flattish on price. And then -- so it's mostly revenue. And as far as second quarter and throughout the year, you'll see in the second quarter, we still have about $100 million of destock, so that's going to hit the second quarter. Third quarter, we'll be back to right more equal to last year's level and then fourth quarter last year were easy comp. So you should see double-digit improvement in the fourth quarter for CCM.\nBryan Blair: And with the inflection to growth in the back half, stability Q3 and rebound relative to a weak comp Q4, can CCM drives consolidated earnings growth, return to EPS growth during the back half with that setup?\nKevin Zdimal: In the second half of the year, certainly. As we look at the full year, we think we'll come up a little below or 30% EBITDA from last year. So we might be below that. Our new targets for CCM long term are 30% plus EBITDA margins. We expect to be back there in 2024.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.\nTim Wojs: Maybe just going back on price. Obviously, just given the challenges we've seen over the last couple of quarters of destocking and weather and things. I mean, how has the industry kind of reacted to that relative to kind of price? Have you -- I mean, I know one of your competitors put through an incremental price increase for July. But I guess how are -- how is the market on the price side? And have you seen anything get more competitive with the volume decline?\nChris Koch: Tim, maybe taking a couple of sections. I think, first of all, that you saw that price increase. And indeed, we had all -- or we had had price increases in the fourth quarter we had hoped to implement in 2023. And I would say those are probably not getting the traction that we would have hoped. I mean, you do your work as well and I think you're seeing that. In general, though, what I would say is that certainly pricing out of distribution in that for the bulk of the industry is pretty good. And as Kevin mentioned, we think it's going to be flat for the year. And I think that goes back to some of the improvements we've made over the last 5, 6 years on us being a market price leader, on bringing price discipline, on bringing value, pricing and talking about how we create value. And you heard in my comments about that and new products. And the interesting thing is with the changes in some of the leadership at other -- at our other competitors, I think we're also seeing a real desire to drive value and to get the value for that. So are there some deviations in price from time to time? Yes, they've happened. And we hear about them. I think on the whole, though, the market players are remaining pretty disciplined. And from time to time, people will cut deals or maybe they might go direct to a contractor and offer a special deal or something like that. We obviously try not to do that and have a price leadership position but there are those who do that. But for the most part, I think those things go on. And pricing, I've been pleased with where pricing is through April, that people have been holding in there. There's been good price discipline.\nTim Wojs: And then just maybe from a mix perspective, I mean, have you seen any variance in kind of the roofing systems that you're selling between like EPDM or TPO? And I'm just trying to think if one of the membranes is a higher install cost versus the other one. Have you seen any sort of like share shift or mix shift kind of happen within your portfolio?\nChris Koch: Where -- and Kevin and Jim can talk about this, too but where I saw the biggest shift, I think, was actually last year and maybe some of its blood over here with quotes that it had happened last year. But when TPO, as you know, was constrained, at least for us, we were sold out right through the year, I do think there is some shift and some players that sell PVC and greater amounts benefited from that. So there might have been some shift in Q4, maybe Q1 and fulfilling orders where PVC replaced TPO but that's kind of come back as the supply constraints came off. We had some issues for 2 years, all of us as an industry with fasteners -- metal fasteners. They were at a premium and people may have substituted adhesives or different. We do have a VELCRO roof we use and that might have seen some gains there. But I think on the margin, those were pretty minimal. And then we look at EPDM, our oldest brand. Things have remained relatively stable there. We don't see much market shifts there. So I think as we get through the year, things will go back and they'll normalize to that same type of mix around TPO, PVC, PDM, polyiso, EPS, those things. And really, all that disruption over the last 2 years will get sorted out.\nTim Wojs: And then just maybe last one. Just -- how is the cost basket kind of performing relative to your kind of initial expectations? And what's the expectation now for the year?\nKevin Zdimal: So costs, we're not seeing as much on a raw material that we thought we'd see entering the year and that certainly is factored into our change in margin guidance for the full year. I mean, we're still seeing probably $40 million to $60 million of benefit this year versus what we were higher than that going into the year.\nChris Koch: And Tim, most of that would be, I think, in the second half.\nOperator: The next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Obviously, contractor backlogs remained strong but there appears to be a lot of skepticism right now in nonresi. So could you just help frame a very downside scenario for us? Like maybe what would CCM look like today in a 2009-type scenario?\nChris Koch: I appreciate the question. I completely understand and agree with you. There's a lot of anxiety and concern. And I think part of it is this destocking occurring in Q4 or Q1. But those are the lowest months of the year for roofing for us in North America. And I think as we look into 2023, with what we see at the contractor and the backlog they have and what's happening out there, I just can't see a 2009 scenario occurring in 2023. I can't forecast obviously out into '24 but we're backlogged. There isn't enough labor. Again, I mentioned that in the commentary. So when we have these days off the roof due to weather, that just adds to the backlog and contractors need to get that work done, too. So again, there's a lot of angles we can go on how we're helping them with that but I just don't see that type of downside. It would have to be something pretty dramatic that would occur in the second half. And as Kevin mentioned, things improved from a comps perspective as well as we get into Q4. But to answer your question, Carlisle has always performed well on an EBITDA margin basis in the downturn. You can look at the data in 2020 and then we can go back to 9%. And we've, in fact, had great EBITDA margins that improved. So I would say that while I don't see it happening, if it did occur, we'd still be producing good cash flow and good EBITDA margins through that.\nSaree Boroditsky: And then, maybe skipping into another segment. CWT margins held in strong given the organic growth declines, how are you thinking about margin performance there as you go through the remainder of the year?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. As we look at year-over-year, we think there's definitely benefit and pick up we're going to get in the second half of the year. We could see a couple of hundred basis point full year, year-over-year improvement for CWT.\nOperator: The next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: I wanted to ask on the demand side for CCM just given there's a lot of distortions with inventory destocking, both for you, manufacturers, distributors. Just wondering, though, if you have a sense, just given your comments around strong contractor backlogs, what the underlying market demand is this year for contractors and roofing installations? And has that changed at all since the beginning of the year?\nChris Koch: I think, Garik, there may -- whether actually a practice has changed, I don't know. Obviously, one of the things that's out there are interest rates and the banking and that has affected the -- I think, the resi a bit. I don't think that's actually affected the nonresi in the quarter but certainly it creates concern. And again, destocking again, creates more anxiety in that. When we look at the places, I'd say, throughout the markets that are strong, if we got down to specific verticals, I think you've seen some decreases in warehouses have probably been a little bit under last year and we think that's going to continue. It's probably about where we thought it was. The educational side that we look at might be a little bit of a lower number than we had thought at the beginning of the year, not much, a percentage point or 2. I think stores, again, maybe some impact there but maybe that's more driven, too, by some of the move to online purchasing and doing the Internet sales thing. Healthcare has been good, been probably better than we thought. So when we look at it -- and even one other segment I would just say is even kind of the residential buildings that we deal on the bigger multifamily and that, pretty much in line with what we had. So I think when we look at where we were even out of last year, I think if you take all that together, we're probably flat right now. And I would say, where we are for this year, I don't see that being affected. As we get again into '24, there's a lot of things happening out there, a lot of moving parts that could affect it. But obviously, we'll have a call at the end of the second quarter. We'll be well into the season. And I think that, that call will be more telling than a first quarter call, well, with the destocking done and then with the season picking up.\nGarik Shmois: I wanted to follow up just on the pricing expectations, just to maybe get a little bit more clarity on the comment that you made that you expect pricing to be flat. Is that a comment for the second half of the year, as you've anniversaried the price increases in 2022, specifically? Or are you expecting year-on-year pricing for '23 to be flat? And if that's the case, I think that might be a little bit different than what was communicated on the last quarter call.\nChris Koch: Yes. Go ahead, Kevin.\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. So that's flat for the full year. I think on the earlier call, I mean, we were maybe up slightly. It wasn't a whole lot that we were putting to price that we had some carryover. But yes, what we're looking at now is flat for year-over-year.\nChris Koch: Yes. And Garik, when you look at that, the difference would be that we had that fourth quarter price increase and I think it's all attributed to. We thought there would be destocking ending sooner. We thought that price would gain a little more traction. I think you saw, as was mentioned earlier, one of our competitors adding a price in there as well. And I think there was thought that, that would hold. And that was what was our original assumption on the year for pricing being up. I don't know what we have, 1% or 2%. And then now we're back to flat and it really centers around that price increase not holding.\nGarik Shmois: Just one last question for me. Just on switching to CWT, the strength in retail in the quarter, was that related to any channel fill or timing benefits? Just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color what happened there.\nChris Koch: Yes. On the retail channel, if we're talking about retail in the same way, kind of big box thinking like that, most of the improvement there was around weather and what happens after weather, especially in the West where we've got a lot of population that was affected by rain. We tend to see a surge in our CWT products and the Henry products and that team addressed it in an unbelievable way because they have to pick up production. They've got to reallocate and divert product out there to make sure that those big box and retail stores get it. They did a heck of a job doing it. But that's really what that was attributed to and not any type of rollout. We have had some new product introductions occur but those don't tend to have the big load and like maybe you see some other companies. So yes, all related really to that weather.\nOperator: The next question is from John Joyner with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Joyner: So I'll ask about destocking. That's -- we can see how many times we can say that word. But I guess, other than areas like brake and friction, I mean, in the past, I don't really ever recall much discussion historically around destocking or restocking for CCM. So has there been any changes at CCM, as it relates to your channel partners? Or is it simply that maybe they bought too much inventory over the past year? I mean, maybe just help me understand that because I just don't recall discussions around destocking so much historically.\nChris Koch: Yes, I think you're right. That's a good one at CBF. I mean if we go back to 2008, 2009, I think there was a lot of inventory and then the bottom fell out on the -- at the Cats and Komatsus and that it was left with inventory. So a good call. That's a while ago. It brings back some memories. But as far as CCM is concerned, nothing has really changed. When we went into -- in '19, at least, we were still doing that kind of thing where in the winter, we make product for the season. Distributors will load in, we'd get through the season. And they'd have the inventory, they work it down, contractors work through the season. And once in a while, you'd see if we had an early spring or a late fall, our sales -- or our shipments in Q4 and Q1 would be a little bit better. In fact, I think prior to '19, Q1 had gotten successfully better every year for a few years by a single-digit improvement. So we go through COVID and things decline and then the surge comes back and there's supply chain issues that everybody had and were well known. And we saw what others saw as well which was people tended to, I'd hate to use the word hoard but I think they tended to do a couple of things: order -- putting multiple jobs at multiple suppliers to ensure they got product. They would grab product when they could and stock it. I think the idea that we had contractors building inventory was a very new concept for us. And that was one that we really missed, John, in the fourth quarter when we gave you the first estimate. I mean bad on us. We hadn't anticipated that other people were stocking as well. So to me, it's just going to take time to get through it which it has. And we now think we have good visibility to it. Once it's done, I think, unless we have another supply chain crisis of the magnitude we did under COVID which I don't anticipate, we'll be back to that normal cadence because really that system of how we order and how we introduce products and how we supply the market, I mean, CCM has been doing it for a lot of years, contractors, distributors. And I would think over time, they've gotten pretty efficient at it. So I would think we would go back to the way we used to do it which was probably the best practice. So I think it's just -- let's call it, a 1-year onetime aberration.\nJohn Joyner: And then, maybe just one more and I think I know the answer to this but I realize that you intend to focus on the kind of core building products businesses. But maybe just looking at CFT, the business actually performed quite well. I mean people were focusing on CCM, I get it but CFT performed quite well. So with the operational improvements that you have implemented at CFT, a lot of heavy lifting for that business, have you possibly rethought how you view CFT going forward with regard to how it fits within your portfolio strategy?\nChris Koch: No. I think it would be -- I think you're right to recognize the hard work that Fred Sutter and the team have done since he came into the business in terms of introducing new products, in terms of improving the sales force and operations and everything. And obviously, that's what we had in mind for CFT when we initially bought it. But I think when we look at being superior capital allocators and look at what the runway for ROIC performance and also magnitude in terms of effect on the P&L, it's still within the Building Products segment in CCM. That history and you know it, you have the data, it's hard to fight against. And while CFT is performing well, it's still a pretty small part of our business at $300 million. And it would be a tough time for them to get to the point where it would make better sense to allocate in a big way to that as opposed to driving to that core pivot to building products. So we think we've done the work and we think in terms of where we put our capital, the pivot to building products makes the most sense for us for the foreseeable future.\nJohn Joyner: I figured I knew the answer but I just wanted to ask.\nChris Koch: But thanks for recognizing the team. That's been a really nice turnaround from where we were a couple of years ago.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates.\nAdam Baumgarten: So just given some of the surveys you've done and do you have a better sense for -- of that, I think you said $100 million of inventory that needs to come out in 2Q, kind of how that splits between contractors and distributors. And then also just are there any specific products where within that $100 million, where they're more elevated than others within the portfolio?\nChris Koch: No breakdown on the contractor distributor. I don't think we got to that level of granularity and I apologize. We will continue to drive on these things. It's a new addition that we're going to do regularly, so we'll have -- we'll get better at it. But at this point, we don't have that breakdown. I still think the bulk of it, though, if I'm going off my gut, is the distribution and that the contractors probably at major contractors. And so I would say it's the bulk of its distribution. As far as products and any one that's out there, that's another one I couldn't -- I wouldn't want to even guess and I apologize.\nAdam Baumgarten: And then just the other one, maybe more high level. Just can you give a sense for the percentage of reroofing projects that are -- that you're financing?\nChris Koch: Jim and I just had a discussion on that. And I think on the reroofing, it's mostly coming out of kind of an expense budget. Remember, I think on the -- you know this, when a new construction, it's all part of a big project that's coming under one capital request and then there -- however they do it and the roofs included in that, it gets financed. But once it's sold to a customer and then it's at year 20 or 15 or 35 or whatever, that typically comes out of their operating budget to reroof the roof or the building owner's budget. So I would say it's probably pretty low as a specific percentage that are financed.\nAdam Baumgarten: And then just maybe some help on EBITDA margins were down about 500 basis points year-over-year in the first quarter and you guys are guiding to down 100 for the year. Maybe some help on kind of the quarterly progression there to get back to that down 100 would be great.\nKevin Zdimal: As we talked -- so you have the first quarter, obviously. What we did for margins and I guess you're looking overall at the business, when we see on margins by quarter that a lot of it's going to be absorption and you can just do it off of the volume, so whatever you're projecting by quarter for volume. You should be able to drop that to the bottom line. We're probably high 40s on decremental margins for the CCM business and that should help you get there by quarter.\nOperator: The next question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: I wanted to just ask about the guidance revision here. When you go from kind of low single-digit revenue growth to high single-digit revenue declines, it implies about a $400 million differential. I'm trying to reconcile that with the first quarter where you said $300 million, obviously, was the revenue delta. You said 70% to 80% of that would have been the destock. And you've got another $100 million coming in 2Q. I guess -- I'm trying to get a sense of just whether there's any catch-up coming here in the second half of the year from the weather portion or whether you're just being conservative with that $400 million change to their guide. Can you help me just think through that?\nChris Koch: Yes. I think one of the things just in general and certainly, Jim or Kevin can weigh on it. But I think there's a little conservative nature going into Q3 and 4 around how much we can catch up. Two things that I think about are very relevant here. We just talked about the weather and we always worry how long does that fall continue. The longer it continues, the better we can do because we've got contractors on the roof putting roofs in. That's probably the biggest one for -- well, maybe not be not the biggest. The other one is then the labor and we keep discussing labor and that really is a constraint around how much can we put down. And so again, the CCM team, I think we're almost tripling R&D investment to deal with that, so we can help with the catch-up because it's really been -- there's that multiyear backlog and we don't see the labor situation getting any better. And then, we see all these positive drivers around the Investment Act around reshoring, around energy efficiency. And we think for ourselves, not only do we have to catch up every year from weather and that but now, we have other things that are stimulating demand for the future and we think we're going to consume labor. So I mean that's really what drives a lot of our effort into new products and the investment there. But those are the 2 things that I would say make us a little conservative about how much we can catch up. Although like you and like all of our shareholders, we'd love to do some catch up as quickly as possible.\nDavid MacGregor: And I just want to clarify, you've talked on a number of different calls in the past about the fact that a good percentage of your business does not go through distribution but it goes directly to contractors. And you've already, I guess, commented and passing earlier in the call that the inventory surplus is occurring both at distributors and at contractors. And I guess I just was hoping you could give us an update in terms of just how should we think about the percentage of your business that is actually going through distributors with the products being distributed or is being delivered to a distributor versus direct to the job site and how that maybe has changed since maybe a year ago.\nChris Koch: Yes, that's a good question. I really appreciate the fact that you clarified that statement around how much we sell to a contractor and how much we deliver direct because there is a difference and that's what I made a comment earlier on pricing that I'm going to say 90-plus percent of our sales go through distribution, while delivery is probably in the 60% to 70% are shipped direct to the contractor. Did that change during COVID? I don't know that that did. My guess is it may have just because of some of the local constraints around PP&E on a job site with masking and that kind of stuff that it might have been more beneficial for the contractor to take it directly as opposed to come to a distributor, pick it up or interface with the distributor, employees delivering to the site. But I don't have any details on that. So my guess is that it hasn't changed much other than that.\nDavid MacGregor: Last question for me is just the extent of production curtailments that you've undertaken here to compensate for this. How would you quantify those production curtailments vis-\u00e0-vis the actual shipment reductions? In other words, I guess, what's happened to your finished goods inventories?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. We've cut back shifts and we've cut back temp labor, that piece of it. But train labor, we're holding on to that piece of it. We still are optimistic for the second half of the year and going into '24.\nChris Koch: Your comment about inventory, we really -- as I mentioned earlier, we build in the winter months. And so our inventory has not gone down. If anything, it's gone up in anticipation of the needs we're going to have in Q2 and Q3.\nDavid MacGregor: So if you do get a catch up, you've got inventory ready to go...\nChris Koch: Absolutely [indiscernible] TPO, the 16-foot line that gives us some additional capacity, too.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse.\nDan Oppenheim: I was wondering on the CCM side, given the weather issues that occurred in the first quarter which obviously prevented some of the reroofing but also the inventory issues [indiscernible]. As we get to sort of more normal conditions here in the second quarter with better weather and such and work through some of the inventory, do you think there's a potential that there is that more pent-up demand with it? And if so, is there the ability to service it in terms of labor and such? Or is there not so much of a catch-up? How do you sort of view the potential for that?\nChris Koch: Yes, I think that's what we just talked about and I'll just repeat it, though which is that we think there is a labor constraint. There is demand but the demand is really on top of probably some demand that was built up during COVID as well. And so this all has contributed to a backlog that already existed for roofs that were aging out, hitting their 17, 18, 19 year age and were needing to be reroofed. So the labor constraint, probably in that case, is the biggest one in Q2 and just can you get crews to put it down. So my guess is and maybe I'm being conservative about that, there won't be much catch-up in Q2 for contractors on job sites. Most of what we're talking about is there's catch-up from us being able to serve out of our inventory rather than serve that demand from distributor inventory that's already on hand of the contractor. So again, when we look at opportunities for catch-up, I'd point to Q4 and -- Q4 of 2023 and Q1 of '24 where a shortened winter season on either end would help give some days and some opportunity to catch up there.\nDan Oppenheim: And I guess on the CWT side, given that we've seen some decent signs in terms of residential construction here, any sort of more positive view? Like is still a little early but just are you feeling any better there in terms of trends over the course of this year than you might have recently?\nChris Koch: Yes, definitely. I mean, that was a tough blow to the resi market or to CWT on the resi side but we're optimistic coming into the season. I think a couple of things that also really bolster my excitement around CWT are: one, COS is getting fully implemented at Henry and Frank Ready and the team there just become believers in that. And our factors are getting more efficient. We've actually had a couple of sites that have been eliminated. And we've put that production into other sites. So we're getting more efficient there. We're driving automation there. And then new products are taking hold and we've got some new products coming out this spring that are -- that haven't been introduced before. A couple of new ones coming on now that really, again, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of what the contractor is doing. So that coupled with good disposable income and people that are interested in investing in their homes again for the summer months and making repairs in that. Yes, we're very positive on it. We still -- again, even with all the issues, the team is still delivering on their synergy number and along a lot of the other initiatives we had under the deal model. So yes, we're very optimistic about what they can do.\nOperator: There are no questions waiting at this time, so I'll pass the conference back over to Chris Koch for any additional remarks.\nChris Koch: Well, thanks, Frances. And that does conclude our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I want to thank everyone choosing for their participation, the great questions and the interest in Carlisle. And we look forward to speaking with you at our next earnings call. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the Carlisle Companies first quarter 2023 earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Koch",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Please turn to Slide 3. Let me begin my commentary by complementing the global Carlisle team on their effort and hard work during a challenging first quarter. Their commitment to our continuous improvement culture and steadfast dedication to delivering the Carlisle experience to our customers are some of our greatest assets and positions Carlisle extremely well in our efforts to continue to create significant value for all of our stakeholders. On our year-end 2022 call, we noted that the first quarter would be a challenge due to tough year-over-year comparisons for CCM, the normalization of buying patterns in the channel, significant inventory of both distribution and contractors and potential weather disruptions occurring in much of the country. Our financial performance as a company in the first quarter of 2023 reflected these challenges that were faced, in fact, by the entire U.S. building products industry. The U.S. building industry's normalization of buying patterns and destocking that began in Q3 of 2022 has taken longer than anticipated and we now expect it to be substantially resolved in Q2 of this year. This return to normalization of buying patterns left distributors and contractors with increased inventory positions driven by supply chain constraints that were experienced for much of 2021 and 2022. But supply constraints across the building products industry were, for the most part, resolved in the third quarter of 2022. During Q4 of 2022 and Q1 of this year, we saw continued strong demand at the contractor level as well-known positive market trends continued. However, we did see distributors and contractors adjust their orders to Carlisle, reflecting their higher-than-normal inventory levels. The efforts to effectively work down that excess inventory during the quarter have had a substantial impact on what remains in the channel and much progress has been made during the last 2 quarters despite the negative effects of cold weather and greater precipitation prolonging the process. The unusual and impactful weather experienced in the first quarter continued well into March. Looking at Q2, we see weather patterns becoming more favorable for contractors, demand continuing to improve as the season picks up and orders for our products increasing substantially over Q1 levels. These factors are what gives us confidence in destocking effectively coming to an end in the second quarter. For the remainder of 2023 and longer term, we continue to see strong underlying demand in the nonresidential and residential construction markets, with secular positives such as growing demand for energy-efficient solutions for buildings, a robust pipeline of new products coming to market, driven by our increased investment in R&D, a multiyear backlog of reroofing projects supporting a healthy baseline of activity, resulting in a very positive outlook for improved sales and profitability. With that said, we are mindful of the potential for further headwinds, such as increased tightening in the financial markets, even higher interest rates and related sentiment around anticipated deteriorating economic conditions. And we will continue to be vigilant in anticipating any negative impacts that could be forthcoming. We are also aware that constrained labor markets continue to limit contractors' ability to effectively address 100% of their potential demand, an impediment we do not see being resolved anytime soon. And as an aside is a significant driver of our new technology focus to reduce time on the roof for installation. Turning to our results. We delivered consolidated sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $214 million and adjusted EPS of $2.57. While results reflect a short-term disruption to our earnings growth expectations, particularly when compared against very difficult year-over-year comparisons, we do not believe recent trends, heavily influenced by temporary destocking impacted by inclement weather will impact our intermediate or long-term financial results. Instead, we are focused on benefiting from several tailwinds for our Building Products segments. Please turn to Slide 4. First, building codes are becoming more eco-conscious, resulting in increased demand for energy-efficient building products. At the core of this is the thought that insulation is perhaps the best source of energy savings across the building envelope and a way to reduce expected pressure on the nation's electrical grid which we know is in need of substantial investment. Our polyiso sales have grown 40% faster than traditional membrane growth and we expect that to continue for the foreseeable future as roofing our value requirements continue to increase. Notably, we have made investments in polyiso over the past few years to be able to service this growing demand, including investment in our new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Sikeston, Missouri which begins production this summer. Our Sikeston facility is also on track to achieve LEED Platinum certification, a reflection of our commitment to being a more sustainable company. Second, we continue to innovate around 2 significant pain points for our industry: sustainability and labor efficiency. Since Carlisle transformed the commercial roofing industry with the introduction of its Sure-Seal EPDM Single Ply membrane decades ago, we've remained committed to innovation that addresses contractor labor constraints that pressures their ability to service demand effectively and cost efficiently. And by addressing those constraints, we improve contractor profitability. And helping our contractors become more profitable is a key way Carlisle can demonstrate the value of our products and services. Examples of recent product introductions that help our contractors become more profitable, can be found on Slide 5 and include our 16-foot TPO line where fewer seams reduce labor hours on the roof and deliver a faster installation. Our ReadyFlash coated glass phaser which reduces adhesion time, allowing work to be completed more quickly. And our XCI Class A plus wall insulation product that provides better fire resistance and competitive pricing. We look forward to introducing many more innovative products in the coming months and years, leveraging our growing investment in R&D. Third, given our commitment to our increasingly complex industry, we continue to invest in our training and education center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, helping construction professionals specify and install more challenging systems every day. We offer innovative world-class hands-on training opportunities focusing on the installation of Carlisle warranted roofing systems and related products and the best field practices, all to help solidify and enhance our contractor relationships. We aim to be the contractor's manufacturer of choice, competing on and earning a fair price for the value we create and we are excited about our new product launches this year that will again demonstrate our commitment to helping facilitate ease of installation for contractors. A fourth tailwind supporting our positive outlook in building products is sustainability. Long-term opportunities continue to build with a large push to reduce the energy intensity of buildings and our products are squarely positioned within the solution set available to building owners today. We also believe the concept of circularity is an essential part of our product future and we're working hard to introduce recyclable products and increasingly recycled content into new products. Additionally, while still in the early innings, we expect that the Inflation Reduction Act tax benefit for building efficiency upgrades incentivizes commercial and residential building owners to invest in energy-efficient renovations and retrofits, a supportive tailwind for the next decade. And lastly, nondiscretionary reroofing and the corresponding well find backlog of roofs to be reroofed in the next decade should continue to support a steady demand backdrop for CCM. Taken together with all of our tailwinds outlined, we believe Carlisle is truly a best-in-class differentiated building products company with a clear sustainable growth and value creation runway. And our portfolio pivot to building products reflects our confidence in this. Moving to Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies. With balanced exposures between residential and commercial and repair and replace versus new construction, results in the first quarter came in slightly better than expected for our Carlisle Weatherproofing Technology segment. The CWT team continues to integrate Henry ahead of our original deal model plans, obtain the projected deal synergies and is executing very well on consolidating opportunities across business lines and geographies. The team is also driving greater efficiencies in our plants and managing price cost effectively. Given this, we expect CWT's EBITDA to remain stable year-over-year despite the organic revenue declines we currently model for 2023. At CIT, backlog continues to grow, driven by increased airframe production. And more importantly, CIT continues to leverage their growth, capitalizing on the significant hard work done during the last few years in restructuring the business. These actions taken while in the COVID pandemic helped CIT emerge from this downturn stronger than before and are now paying off. With both wide and narrow-body aircraft production continuing to ramp, we should see reliable growth tailwinds in aerospace for the next several years at CIT. I'm also very pleased and proud that CIT was recognized recently as Airbus' Electrical Standard Parts Supplier of the Year for 2023. CIT received this recognition from Airbus for its robust commercial performance, high level of collaboration, strong project follow-up on new product introductions, operational performance and willingness to go the extra mile. CIT was chosen as this year's recipient out of 35 competing suppliers and is another example of customers benefiting and recognizing Carlisle commitment to innovation and the Carlisle experience across all platforms. Now on to CFT. Carlisle Fluid Technologies continues to be an improving story with significant profitability gains this quarter. Backlogs at CFT also continue to grow with strong incoming order rates for standard products contributing to this growth. CFT remains focused on new product launches, operational efficiencies and proactively managing price and mix, all of which are contributing to attractive leverage on strong revenue growth in 2023. Please turn to Slide 6. Our results continue to demonstrate that Vision 2025 has been the right strategy for Carlisle. In addition to our world-class teams and proven business model, we benefited from a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow generation to provide both financial and strategic flexibility to execute and achieve our ambitious goals. A significant portion of our success has been driven by the multiyear process of reshaping our portfolio to pivot from a diversified industrial products company to a higher returning building products portfolio of businesses, demonstrating our desire to be superior capital allocators. This transformation sets the stage for a more focused, higher returning and better understood path for future sustainable value creation at Carlisle. The pillars of Vision 2025 are well established and remain core to Carlisle's strategy going forward. Over the last few years, despite the multiple challenges our teams have faced, we continue to be guided by the clarity of mission as outlined by our strategic vision first announced in 2018 Vision 2025. As we approach the completion of many of the milestones and goals of Vision 2025 in the last year, we were simultaneously working on the successor to Vision 2025, a new strategic plan that will be introduced formally later this year. Vision 2030 will be a plan committed to many of the same principles and pillars we used to establish Vision 2025. And with it, will come new levels of performance and expectations that will represent our culture of continuous improvement. As a reminder, the foundational pillars for sustained value creation at Carlisle under Vision 2025 include drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, utilize the Carlisle Operating System, or COS, to drive continuous improvement and build greater efficiency in our operations, build scale with synergistic accretive acquisitions, maintain returns-focused capital allocation strategy including organic investment to drive growth, a disciplined approach to our aforementioned M&A strategy and returning capital to shareholders. Notably, thus far in 2023, we've returned nearly $90 million to shareholders with share repurchases of $50 million and $39 million paid in dividends. And of course, none of this could be possible without continuing to invest in and develop exceptional talent. Through the execution of Vision 2025, Carlisle has built a solid foundation, leveraging a diversified workplace, decentralized management style, entrepreneurial spirit and a culture of continuous improvement which will continue to guide our value creation journey in 2023 and beyond and will absolutely be core to our Vision 2030 strategic plan. Turning to Slide 7. I mentioned our commitment to sustainable innovation but I'd like to highlight some of our recent steps taken towards our Net-Zero pledge. Carlisle has had a century long legacy of responsible stewardship and stakeholder focus, all driven by our core cultural value of continuous improvement. We believe that creating a more sustainable environment is also productive for our shareholders. As an organization, Carlisle is committed to being a responsible environmental stakeholder with our 3 pillars of environmental sustainability. First, develop energy-efficient products and solutions to reduce the greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions from building operations and help lower operating costs for our customers; second, reduce material waste going into landfills. Our history of recycling began in the 1920s when we incorporated scrap rubber into our inner tube production. We continue that tradition today. And third, focus on lowering the GHG emissions of our operations and manufacturing processes with the implementation of enhanced energy conservation measures. Several months into our journey after announcing our commitment to achieve Net-Zero GHG emissions across our entire value chain by 2050, we continue to take important steps towards achieving this ambitious goal. For example, we've committed to purchasing several million pounds of bio-MDI and bio-polyol to test and develop bio-based raw materials into our production. We've also replaced approximately 25% of our sourced prime carbon black in certain products with recycled material. And lastly, we're piloting end-of-life management of tear-off EPDM roofs, where we collect and process it into consumer rubber products. These steps all further our progress towards our sustainability mission and we're just getting going. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details as well as our updated 2023 outlook. Kevin? Thanks, Kevin. In closing, I would once again like to express my thanks and appreciation for the excellent work by all of Carlisle's employees, especially over the last few years. From the onset in 2020 of the COVID pandemic to the fast and furious recovery in 2021 and 2022, to the recent challenges accompanying the destocking and return to normal buying patterns, Carlisle employees have shown incredible resilience, a remarkable flexibility and a deep concern for one another. Those characteristics contributed in no small way to the accomplishments the team has achieved since the launch of Vision 2025. As we move deeper into the year and with Vision 2025 objectives well ingrained throughout Carlisle, I remain extremely optimistic for the long-term success of Carlisle, as we leverage the flexibility afforded us by an incredible brand and reputation, a strong capital position and superb cash flow-generating capabilities. Despite near-term and potentially growing economic challenges, we will continue to drive a culture of continuous improvement, an entrepreneurial mindset and commitment to superior capital allocation. We will take the necessary actions to navigate this complex operating environment, continue to deliver the Carlisle experience to our customers and create value for all stakeholders of the company. And that concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Sure, a lot of things there. We'll take them one by one. When you attribute the -- most of the volume decline is destocking with some weather. I mean, if we put a 70-30, 80-20, somewhere in there, with the bulk being destocking. When you look at when it's going to be completed, we look at out-the-door sales for our distributors, we look at contractor activity. In fact, over the last probably 2.5, 3 months, we've taken on a new initiative where we're actually doing our own. I know you guys do these surveys. We're doing our own surveys. We've contacted about 450 different endpoints across the company -- country, excuse me, because we have regional differences. And what we're seeing is that at the distributor out-the-door level, in a lot of cases, we're at 90-plus percent of what they were in 2022 last year. So when we look at that and we look at what's happening with our incoming bookings from distribution and other sources, we're seeing real positive momentum building right up from February through March and now into April, good positive trajectory. And so we believe that, that will take care of that destocking and that's where we make our comment that it should be done and tapering off by the end of the second quarter. And then we'll be back to that normal cadence with CCM. Tim, maybe taking a couple of sections. I think, first of all, that you saw that price increase. And indeed, we had all -- or we had had price increases in the fourth quarter we had hoped to implement in 2023. And I would say those are probably not getting the traction that we would have hoped. I mean, you do your work as well and I think you're seeing that. In general, though, what I would say is that certainly pricing out of distribution in that for the bulk of the industry is pretty good. And as Kevin mentioned, we think it's going to be flat for the year. And I think that goes back to some of the improvements we've made over the last 5, 6 years on us being a market price leader, on bringing price discipline, on bringing value, pricing and talking about how we create value. And you heard in my comments about that and new products. And the interesting thing is with the changes in some of the leadership at other -- at our other competitors, I think we're also seeing a real desire to drive value and to get the value for that. So are there some deviations in price from time to time? Yes, they've happened. And we hear about them. I think on the whole, though, the market players are remaining pretty disciplined. And from time to time, people will cut deals or maybe they might go direct to a contractor and offer a special deal or something like that. We obviously try not to do that and have a price leadership position but there are those who do that. But for the most part, I think those things go on. And pricing, I've been pleased with where pricing is through April, that people have been holding in there. There's been good price discipline. Where -- and Kevin and Jim can talk about this, too but where I saw the biggest shift, I think, was actually last year and maybe some of its blood over here with quotes that it had happened last year. But when TPO, as you know, was constrained, at least for us, we were sold out right through the year, I do think there is some shift and some players that sell PVC and greater amounts benefited from that. So there might have been some shift in Q4, maybe Q1 and fulfilling orders where PVC replaced TPO but that's kind of come back as the supply constraints came off. We had some issues for 2 years, all of us as an industry with fasteners -- metal fasteners. They were at a premium and people may have substituted adhesives or different. We do have a VELCRO roof we use and that might have seen some gains there. But I think on the margin, those were pretty minimal. And then we look at EPDM, our oldest brand. Things have remained relatively stable there. We don't see much market shifts there. So I think as we get through the year, things will go back and they'll normalize to that same type of mix around TPO, PVC, PDM, polyiso, EPS, those things. And really, all that disruption over the last 2 years will get sorted out. And Tim, most of that would be, I think, in the second half. I appreciate the question. I completely understand and agree with you. There's a lot of anxiety and concern. And I think part of it is this destocking occurring in Q4 or Q1. But those are the lowest months of the year for roofing for us in North America. And I think as we look into 2023, with what we see at the contractor and the backlog they have and what's happening out there, I just can't see a 2009 scenario occurring in 2023. I can't forecast obviously out into '24 but we're backlogged. There isn't enough labor. Again, I mentioned that in the commentary. So when we have these days off the roof due to weather, that just adds to the backlog and contractors need to get that work done, too. So again, there's a lot of angles we can go on how we're helping them with that but I just don't see that type of downside. It would have to be something pretty dramatic that would occur in the second half. And as Kevin mentioned, things improved from a comps perspective as well as we get into Q4. But to answer your question, Carlisle has always performed well on an EBITDA margin basis in the downturn. You can look at the data in 2020 and then we can go back to 9%. And we've, in fact, had great EBITDA margins that improved. So I would say that while I don't see it happening, if it did occur, we'd still be producing good cash flow and good EBITDA margins through that. I think, Garik, there may -- whether actually a practice has changed, I don't know. Obviously, one of the things that's out there are interest rates and the banking and that has affected the -- I think, the resi a bit. I don't think that's actually affected the nonresi in the quarter but certainly it creates concern. And again, destocking again, creates more anxiety in that. When we look at the places, I'd say, throughout the markets that are strong, if we got down to specific verticals, I think you've seen some decreases in warehouses have probably been a little bit under last year and we think that's going to continue. It's probably about where we thought it was. The educational side that we look at might be a little bit of a lower number than we had thought at the beginning of the year, not much, a percentage point or 2. I think stores, again, maybe some impact there but maybe that's more driven, too, by some of the move to online purchasing and doing the Internet sales thing. Healthcare has been good, been probably better than we thought. So when we look at it -- and even one other segment I would just say is even kind of the residential buildings that we deal on the bigger multifamily and that, pretty much in line with what we had. So I think when we look at where we were even out of last year, I think if you take all that together, we're probably flat right now. And I would say, where we are for this year, I don't see that being affected. As we get again into '24, there's a lot of things happening out there, a lot of moving parts that could affect it. But obviously, we'll have a call at the end of the second quarter. We'll be well into the season. And I think that, that call will be more telling than a first quarter call, well, with the destocking done and then with the season picking up. Yes. Go ahead, Kevin. Yes. And Garik, when you look at that, the difference would be that we had that fourth quarter price increase and I think it's all attributed to. We thought there would be destocking ending sooner. We thought that price would gain a little more traction. I think you saw, as was mentioned earlier, one of our competitors adding a price in there as well. And I think there was thought that, that would hold. And that was what was our original assumption on the year for pricing being up. I don't know what we have, 1% or 2%. And then now we're back to flat and it really centers around that price increase not holding. Yes. On the retail channel, if we're talking about retail in the same way, kind of big box thinking like that, most of the improvement there was around weather and what happens after weather, especially in the West where we've got a lot of population that was affected by rain. We tend to see a surge in our CWT products and the Henry products and that team addressed it in an unbelievable way because they have to pick up production. They've got to reallocate and divert product out there to make sure that those big box and retail stores get it. They did a heck of a job doing it. But that's really what that was attributed to and not any type of rollout. We have had some new product introductions occur but those don't tend to have the big load and like maybe you see some other companies. So yes, all related really to that weather. Yes, I think you're right. That's a good one at CBF. I mean if we go back to 2008, 2009, I think there was a lot of inventory and then the bottom fell out on the -- at the Cats and Komatsus and that it was left with inventory. So a good call. That's a while ago. It brings back some memories. But as far as CCM is concerned, nothing has really changed. When we went into -- in '19, at least, we were still doing that kind of thing where in the winter, we make product for the season. Distributors will load in, we'd get through the season. And they'd have the inventory, they work it down, contractors work through the season. And once in a while, you'd see if we had an early spring or a late fall, our sales -- or our shipments in Q4 and Q1 would be a little bit better. In fact, I think prior to '19, Q1 had gotten successfully better every year for a few years by a single-digit improvement. So we go through COVID and things decline and then the surge comes back and there's supply chain issues that everybody had and were well known. And we saw what others saw as well which was people tended to, I'd hate to use the word hoard but I think they tended to do a couple of things: order -- putting multiple jobs at multiple suppliers to ensure they got product. They would grab product when they could and stock it. I think the idea that we had contractors building inventory was a very new concept for us. And that was one that we really missed, John, in the fourth quarter when we gave you the first estimate. I mean bad on us. We hadn't anticipated that other people were stocking as well. So to me, it's just going to take time to get through it which it has. And we now think we have good visibility to it. Once it's done, I think, unless we have another supply chain crisis of the magnitude we did under COVID which I don't anticipate, we'll be back to that normal cadence because really that system of how we order and how we introduce products and how we supply the market, I mean, CCM has been doing it for a lot of years, contractors, distributors. And I would think over time, they've gotten pretty efficient at it. So I would think we would go back to the way we used to do it which was probably the best practice. So I think it's just -- let's call it, a 1-year onetime aberration. No. I think it would be -- I think you're right to recognize the hard work that Fred Sutter and the team have done since he came into the business in terms of introducing new products, in terms of improving the sales force and operations and everything. And obviously, that's what we had in mind for CFT when we initially bought it. But I think when we look at being superior capital allocators and look at what the runway for ROIC performance and also magnitude in terms of effect on the P&L, it's still within the Building Products segment in CCM. That history and you know it, you have the data, it's hard to fight against. And while CFT is performing well, it's still a pretty small part of our business at $300 million. And it would be a tough time for them to get to the point where it would make better sense to allocate in a big way to that as opposed to driving to that core pivot to building products. So we think we've done the work and we think in terms of where we put our capital, the pivot to building products makes the most sense for us for the foreseeable future. But thanks for recognizing the team. That's been a really nice turnaround from where we were a couple of years ago. No breakdown on the contractor distributor. I don't think we got to that level of granularity and I apologize. We will continue to drive on these things. It's a new addition that we're going to do regularly, so we'll have -- we'll get better at it. But at this point, we don't have that breakdown. I still think the bulk of it, though, if I'm going off my gut, is the distribution and that the contractors probably at major contractors. And so I would say it's the bulk of its distribution. As far as products and any one that's out there, that's another one I couldn't -- I wouldn't want to even guess and I apologize. Jim and I just had a discussion on that. And I think on the reroofing, it's mostly coming out of kind of an expense budget. Remember, I think on the -- you know this, when a new construction, it's all part of a big project that's coming under one capital request and then there -- however they do it and the roofs included in that, it gets financed. But once it's sold to a customer and then it's at year 20 or 15 or 35 or whatever, that typically comes out of their operating budget to reroof the roof or the building owner's budget. So I would say it's probably pretty low as a specific percentage that are financed. Yes. I think one of the things just in general and certainly, Jim or Kevin can weigh on it. But I think there's a little conservative nature going into Q3 and 4 around how much we can catch up. Two things that I think about are very relevant here. We just talked about the weather and we always worry how long does that fall continue. The longer it continues, the better we can do because we've got contractors on the roof putting roofs in. That's probably the biggest one for -- well, maybe not be not the biggest. The other one is then the labor and we keep discussing labor and that really is a constraint around how much can we put down. And so again, the CCM team, I think we're almost tripling R&D investment to deal with that, so we can help with the catch-up because it's really been -- there's that multiyear backlog and we don't see the labor situation getting any better. And then, we see all these positive drivers around the Investment Act around reshoring, around energy efficiency. And we think for ourselves, not only do we have to catch up every year from weather and that but now, we have other things that are stimulating demand for the future and we think we're going to consume labor. So I mean that's really what drives a lot of our effort into new products and the investment there. But those are the 2 things that I would say make us a little conservative about how much we can catch up. Although like you and like all of our shareholders, we'd love to do some catch up as quickly as possible. Yes, that's a good question. I really appreciate the fact that you clarified that statement around how much we sell to a contractor and how much we deliver direct because there is a difference and that's what I made a comment earlier on pricing that I'm going to say 90-plus percent of our sales go through distribution, while delivery is probably in the 60% to 70% are shipped direct to the contractor. Did that change during COVID? I don't know that that did. My guess is it may have just because of some of the local constraints around PP&E on a job site with masking and that kind of stuff that it might have been more beneficial for the contractor to take it directly as opposed to come to a distributor, pick it up or interface with the distributor, employees delivering to the site. But I don't have any details on that. So my guess is that it hasn't changed much other than that. Your comment about inventory, we really -- as I mentioned earlier, we build in the winter months. And so our inventory has not gone down. If anything, it's gone up in anticipation of the needs we're going to have in Q2 and Q3. Absolutely [indiscernible] TPO, the 16-foot line that gives us some additional capacity, too. Yes, I think that's what we just talked about and I'll just repeat it, though which is that we think there is a labor constraint. There is demand but the demand is really on top of probably some demand that was built up during COVID as well. And so this all has contributed to a backlog that already existed for roofs that were aging out, hitting their 17, 18, 19 year age and were needing to be reroofed. So the labor constraint, probably in that case, is the biggest one in Q2 and just can you get crews to put it down. So my guess is and maybe I'm being conservative about that, there won't be much catch-up in Q2 for contractors on job sites. Most of what we're talking about is there's catch-up from us being able to serve out of our inventory rather than serve that demand from distributor inventory that's already on hand of the contractor. So again, when we look at opportunities for catch-up, I'd point to Q4 and -- Q4 of 2023 and Q1 of '24 where a shortened winter season on either end would help give some days and some opportunity to catch up there. Yes, definitely. I mean, that was a tough blow to the resi market or to CWT on the resi side but we're optimistic coming into the season. I think a couple of things that also really bolster my excitement around CWT are: one, COS is getting fully implemented at Henry and Frank Ready and the team there just become believers in that. And our factors are getting more efficient. We've actually had a couple of sites that have been eliminated. And we've put that production into other sites. So we're getting more efficient there. We're driving automation there. And then new products are taking hold and we've got some new products coming out this spring that are -- that haven't been introduced before. A couple of new ones coming on now that really, again, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of what the contractor is doing. So that coupled with good disposable income and people that are interested in investing in their homes again for the summer months and making repairs in that. Yes, we're very positive on it. We still -- again, even with all the issues, the team is still delivering on their synergy number and along a lot of the other initiatives we had under the deal model. So yes, we're very optimistic about what they can do. Well, thanks, Frances. And that does conclude our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I want to thank everyone choosing for their participation, the great questions and the interest in Carlisle. And we look forward to speaking with you at our next earnings call. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Chris. For segment highlights, please turn to Slide 8. CCM delivered first quarter revenues of $576 million, down 35% from the prior year. The decline was due to the reasons Chris previously mentioned, including tough comps, destocking in the channel and project delays due to severe weather across the U.S. These were partially offset by positive price. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 24% was negatively impacted by lower year-over-year volumes and lower cost absorption, partially offset by price realization and savings from COS. Moving to Slide 9. Sales at CWT decreased 12% due to continued softness in residential demand, partially offset by strength in our retail businesses and price realization. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17%, notably down just 60 basis points from the first quarter of 2022. The team continues to focus on the integration of Henry, realizing the $30 million of stated synergies from the acquisition and rolling out COS and significant investment in operations throughout CWT to drive greater efficiencies in our businesses. Moving to Slide 10. CIT revenue increased 15% in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting strength primarily in our commercial aerospace platforms, as we continue to see orders ramp up and momentum build as global passenger demand continues to approach pre-pandemic levels. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded more than 400 basis points to 14%, driven by favorable volume, price realization, leverage on restructuring activities and efficiencies gained from COS. Turning to CFT on Slide 11. CFT generated growth of 2.3%, driven by positive pricing and favorable volume, partially offset by a 4% year-over-year headwind from FX. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded more than 700 basis points to 22%, driven by favorable volume, price and efficiencies gained from COS. Slide 12 provides a year-over-year bridge items to first quarter adjusted EPS. Moving to Slides 13 and 14. Carlisle ended the first quarter of 2023 with $424 million of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We generated cash flow from continuing operations of $147 million and invested $40 million in capital expenditures. We deployed $50 million towards share repurchases and paid $39 million in dividends. As of the end of the first quarter, we have 3.2 million shares available for repurchase under our share repurchase program. Turning to Slide 15. We have provided our updated 2023 financial outlook. As a result of our challenging first quarter and destocking persisting into the second quarter at CCM, we now expect consolidated revenue to decline mid-single digits for the full year 2023. The change in our revenue outlook is entirely in our CCM segment, as our revenue outlook for CWT, CIT and CFT remain unchanged. As a result of the revenue decline, we now expect margins to decline by approximately 100 basis points for the full year 2023. We remain focused on disciplined pricing, operational efficiencies and managing costs through our continuous improvement efforts. As a result of the revenue decline, we now expect margins to decline by approximately 100 basis points for the full year 2023. We remain focused on disciplined pricing, operational efficiencies and managing costs through our continuous improvement efforts. We also continue to invest in our businesses with expanding our R&D operations, improving the Carlisle experience that provide our customers with best-in-class customer service and cutting-edge information systems. Despite the deeper and longer period of destocking occurring in the first half of 2023, we are seeing momentum in the business with April orders showing very strong sequential improvement over the first quarter levels. This gives us confidence that the inventory in the channel will be level set by this summer and our shipments in the second half will better mirror the strong end market demand. With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. I think price and we're not breaking out price as much from volume but for the most part, flattish on price. And then -- so it's mostly revenue. And as far as second quarter and throughout the year, you'll see in the second quarter, we still have about $100 million of destock, so that's going to hit the second quarter. Third quarter, we'll be back to right more equal to last year's level and then fourth quarter last year were easy comp. So you should see double-digit improvement in the fourth quarter for CCM. In the second half of the year, certainly. As we look at the full year, we think we'll come up a little below or 30% EBITDA from last year. So we might be below that. Our new targets for CCM long term are 30% plus EBITDA margins. We expect to be back there in 2024. So costs, we're not seeing as much on a raw material that we thought we'd see entering the year and that certainly is factored into our change in margin guidance for the full year. I mean, we're still seeing probably $40 million to $60 million of benefit this year versus what we were higher than that going into the year. Yes. As we look at year-over-year, we think there's definitely benefit and pick up we're going to get in the second half of the year. We could see a couple of hundred basis point full year, year-over-year improvement for CWT. Yes. So that's flat for the full year. I think on the earlier call, I mean, we were maybe up slightly. It wasn't a whole lot that we were putting to price that we had some carryover. But yes, what we're looking at now is flat for year-over-year. As we talked -- so you have the first quarter, obviously. What we did for margins and I guess you're looking overall at the business, when we see on margins by quarter that a lot of it's going to be absorption and you can just do it off of the volume, so whatever you're projecting by quarter for volume. You should be able to drop that to the bottom line. We're probably high 40s on decremental margins for the CCM business and that should help you get there by quarter. Yes. We've cut back shifts and we've cut back temp labor, that piece of it. But train labor, we're holding on to that piece of it. We still are optimistic for the second half of the year and going into '24."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Nicole, and I will be your conference call operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mehul Patel, Carlisle's Vice President of Investor Relations. Mehul, please go ahead.\nMehul Patel: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Carlyle's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. I'm Mehul Patel, Vice President of Investor Relations for Carlisle. We released our third quarter 2024 financial results today, and you can find both our press release and the presentation for today's call in the Investor Relations section of our website. On the call with me today are Chris Koch, our Board Chair, President and CEO; along with Kevin Zdimal, our CFO. Today's call will begin with Chris providing key highlights of our third quarter results and some commentary on our progress towards Vision 2030 goal of $40 of EPS. Kevin will follow Chris and provide an overview on our third quarter and year-to-date financial performance and give an update on our most current outlook for the remainder of 2024. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the line for questions. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our press release and SEC filings. As Carlisle provides non-GAAP financial information we provided reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and in the appendix of our presentation materials, which are available on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Chris.\nChristian Koch: Thank you, Mehul. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on Carlisle's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. To start, I'd like to direct your attention to Slide 3 of the presentation. I'm pleased to share that Carlisle continued to demonstrate the outstanding performance we've seen in 2024, into the third quarter despite facing increased headwinds in the quarter, which negatively impacted sales, primarily in our residential end markets. Despite these challenges and the additional impact of two major hurricanes, the Carlisle team delivered record third quarter results in both EBITDA margin and earnings per share. Carlisle's performance throughout this year underscores the resilience of our business model, the robustness of our key initiatives and the perseverance of our team and the effective execution of our Vision 2030 strategies. The record achievements in profitability in the third quarter are even more rewarding and that our teams delivered the record third quarter results in an environment that, as mentioned, saw a weakening residential market when compared to our second quarter outlook, as well as disruptions tied to weather-related and port strike events. In the third quarter, Carlisle delivered sales of $1.3 billion, representing growth of 6% on a year-over-year basis despite the negative sales impact of CWT. Across both CCM and CWT, we maintained our strong focus on pricing discipline on driving a superior customer interface through the Carlisle experience and continued to deliver operating efficiencies through our well-known approach to driving continuous improvement, the Carlisle Operating System. These factors combined to deliver third quarter record bottom line results with adjusted EPS growing 24% to $5.78 and adjusted EBITDA margin expanding 60 basis points year-over-year to 27.6%, highlighting our commitment to continued margin expansion in both CCM and CWT. CCM continued the positive momentum generated in the first half of 2024 into the second half of the year with revenue growth of 9% and an impressive 110 basis points expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin, setting a new third quarter record of 32.8%. This growth was driven by the continued strength in reroofing demand, along with the benefits from inventory normalization in the channel and the acquisition of MTL. As we've discussed throughout the year, we anticipated a significant positive impact from inventory normalization in 2024, and we are pleased that it materialized as expected, and in the order of magnitude, we had forecasted at the start of the year. In the third quarter, in line with our original projections, we saw an approximately $50 million benefit of sales from CCM inventory normalization, which now completes the lapping benefit we expected this year and it was tied to the prior year's inventory destock. As a reminder, when we entered 2024, we had anticipated $375 million from a return to normal inventory levels. Now turning to CWT. While we were pleased with the progress of our new product introductions, retail channel expansion and overall share gains within CWT, higher interest rates and affordability challenges resulted in a further slowing in new housing activity and repair and remodel during the quarter. These negative factors drove a sales decline of 3% year-over-year in CWT, including an expected low single-digit price decline. That said, our long-term positive outlook for CWT is unchanged given the well-known need for additional housing, a forecasted return to a better interest rate environment and success in key growth initiatives across commercial waterproofing, new product introductions and expansion in the home center channel. Overall pricing in the third quarter remained relatively stable and in line with our expectations for both the CCM and CWT segments. Much of this was driven by our proactive approach, pricing discipline, and our commitment to value-based pricing. Furthermore, the team's focus on operational excellence and strategic growth initiatives leaves us well positioned to capitalize on market opportunities as they arrive. Now let's turn to Vision 2030. Our Vision 2030 strategy continues to guide our focus on key growth drivers, including energy efficiency, labor-saving solutions and capturing a larger share of the expanding reroofing market. We're doubling down on organic investments in innovation more than tripling our historical R&D investments to bring more energy efficient and labor-saving products to market faster. We also remain committed to our pivot to a pure-play building products platform and focused almost exclusively on the opportunities presented in the North American markets. Furthermore, we remain driven to be a superior capital allocator and demonstrated our commitment to returning capital to shareholders in the third quarter through our balanced approach of dividends and share repurchases. During quarter three, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $466 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.2 billion. These third quarter purchases put us well on track to achieve our planned goal of $1.4 billion in share repurchases in 2024. Additionally, we paid out $46 million in dividends this quarter and declared an 18% increase to our dividend in August, representing the 48th consecutive annual increase in dividends for Carlisle shareholders. These actions underpin our ongoing dedication to creating shareholder value and reflect our confidence in Carlisle's growth trajectory. Our robust cash flow generation and pristine balance sheet continue to provide us with the flexibility to reinvest in our businesses and the ability to deploy capital to drive organic growth, continuously improve our operations, pursue strategic acquisitions and actively return capital to our shareholders, all while maintaining our focus on driving long-term value creation. To close out Slide 3, while we are slightly lowering our full year 2024 outlook to 10% revenue growth for Carlisle, reflecting the ongoing challenges in the residential markets and the impact of the previously mentioned weather and strike events, we are pleased to reaffirm our expectation to achieve approximately 150 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. I will now speak briefly to Slides 4 through 8 as I discuss our recent progress against our Vision 2030 goals. As a reminder, our Vision 2030 strategy builds on the success of Vision 2025 and gives us a clear road map to drive value creation in the next chapter of Carlisle's ongoing story of success. Under Vision 2030, we are creating value for our shareholders through our portfolio of high-performing building envelope businesses with attractive secular trends. We are focusing on delivering the most innovative, energy-efficient and labor-saving products and solutions to our customers through investment in our ever-improving Carlisle experience, delivering well understood and consistent value for price leveraging a strong leadership focus and operating with a relentless focus on flawless execution, driven by our COS culture. As a reminder, Vision 2030 focuses on 6 pillars: the first is the Carlisle Operating System. Under Vision 2030, we will continue to drive our continuous improvement culture through the consistent application of COS across every function in the enterprise, with the goal to drive savings of 1% to 2% of sales annually through operation efficiencies. Second is the Carlisle experience. The Carlisle Experience has established us as a premium brand with a recognized value proposition backed by high-quality products and exceptional service. Our commitment to our customers is embodied in the Carlisle experience, which means, delivering the right products to the right place at the right time. We understand that we win with customers through superior products and solutions, exceptional service and labor savings efficiencies, and we price our products to reflect that value. Third is innovation. We plan to increase our spend on R&D to 3% of sales by 2030 and to accelerate the creation of new products and solutions that add value to our customers through advancements in sustainability, energy savings and labor efficiency. We will pursue innovation based on an intimate knowledge of our markets and a focus on innovation that responds to our customers' needs and opportunities to improve their businesses. Fourth is M&A. We will focus on existing and adjacent categories that allow us to enhance our building envelope portfolio. We will seek opportunities to acquire assets that meet our well-understood criteria of an embedded organic growth story. An opportunity to deliver hard cost synergies, a talented management team and the ability to deploy our Carlisle Integration Playbook. Fifth is our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Ultimately, as superior capital allocators, we seek to create value for our shareholders and deliver benefits for all our stakeholders. In line with our track record, we will continue to invest our cash responsibly into the highest ROIC opportunities. And lastly and perhaps more importantly, our sixth goal is attracting, motivating and retaining top performers to ensure we have the best talent to execute our strategic initiatives and drive above-market growth. By executing on our clearly stated initiatives and strategies, reinforced by the progress we have made this year, we are on target to deliver our goal of $40 of EPS by 2030, while achieving over 25% ROIC and generating free cash flow margins in excess of 15%. Our M&A strategy, a key pillar of Vision 2030 continues to progress as expected. We have a healthy pipeline of opportunities that can contribute to our Vision 2030 goal to grow and be a leading supplier of building envelope products and solutions. With the sale of CIT completed in May, I'm pleased to report that we've been able to deploy capital from the sale proceeds into meaningful acquisitions demonstrating our ability to execute on our strategic plans and create value through M&A as part of Vision 2030. This rapid and strategic deployment of capital underscores our commitment to strengthening and growing our positions within the building envelope. With our solid balance sheet and robust cash flow, we are well positioned to capture additional value through M&A over the Vision 2030 time frame. We see opportunities in both existing and complementary categories, including architectural metals, insulation, underlayments, sealants and adhesives and the many weather-proofing categories within CWT. As a reminder, our M&A playbook is built on four core criteria: an embedded organic growth story; hard cost synergies; a strong management team; and the deployment of our Carlisle integration playbook, our acquisition of MTL earlier this year and our recently announced agreement to acquire PlastiFab are recent examples of this strategy in action and the steady progress in M&A, we are making against our Vision 2030 goals. Let's focus on PlastiFab for a moment. The rationale for the acquisition of PlastiFab is straightforward. It aligns perfectly with our Vision 2030 strategy to enhance our best-in-class building envelope product portfolio. It establishes Carlisle as a leading manufacturer within the $1.5 billion North American expanded polystyrene insulation market and strategically provides vertically integrated polystyrene capabilities to our Insulfoam business while adding scale, supporting retail channel growth and filling key geographic gaps in the U.S. and Canada. We expect this acquisition to generate approximately $14 million in annual cost synergies and be accretive to our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.30 in 2025. Recently, our M&A strategy gained recognition in a Harvard Business Review article titled A Better Approach to Mergers and Acquisitions. Carlisle has built a detailed integration playbook with clear milestones and goals. This approach, coupled with our rigorous due diligence process gives us a competitive advantage in M&A execution. We were pleased to be able to share our approach to M&A through a well-distributed and well-respected periodical and hope it helps provide shareholders with more insight into our approach. Our success in M&A complements our intensified focus on innovation, another key driver in our Vision 2030 strategy. We're significantly increasing our R&D investment to $1 billion over the Vision 2030 time frame, aiming to drive 25% of our revenue from new products, up from 15% today. Our approach categorizes innovation into three types: business life cycle; evolutionary; and revolutionary, each receiving equal focus and investment of about 1% of sales. Business life cycle innovations, currently 80% of our efforts, focus on ongoing product improvements and cost reductions. Evolutionary innovations address specific and real current unmet customer needs. A great example is our new 16-foot TPO line. By doubling the width of the traditional eight foot TPO role, we reduce seams in the roof, which reduces the opportunities for leaks over the life of the roof. It also reduces labor by significantly increasing the square foot applied by the contractors installation team. Revolutionary innovations drive dramatic business inflections with longer-term development time lines. New reroofing insulation like our recently introduced denim-based UltraTouch product that's available at Home Depot is an example of a revolutionary product development idea. Our innovation efforts are already yielding results with products like Seam Shield and Blue Skin VP Tech gaining rapid market acceptance. Seam Shield reduces cleaning time by 70% while increasing weld strength directly addressing contractor pain points. Blue Skin VP Tech combines multiple components into a single product, improving energy efficiency and cutting installation time by 30%. And I'm particularly excited to highlight another innovative product that exemplifies our commitment to sustainability and customer value. Our Henry Roofguard roof coating was recently named a finalist for Home Depot's Innovative Product of the Year Award. This recognition not only showcases our progress in innovation, but also reinforces the strength of our relationships with key channel partners like Home Depot and is another example of delivering value to our customers based on extensive market input. Roof Guard represents our next-generation acrylic waterproof roof coating enhanced with urethane for improved performance its premium hybrid formula offers better weather protection, solar reflectivity and longevity compared to standard acrylic reflective roof coatings. This innovation not only addresses our customers' needs for energy efficiency, but also aligns perfectly with our sustainability goals. The success of products like Roof Guard have contributed to CWT's Henry brand being awarded Home Depot's Building Materials Vendor of the Year for the second time since 2022. This accolade underscores our commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction, serving as a prime example of the Carlisle experience in action, and we are very proud of the Henry team for being recognized by Home Depot again. These innovations not only enhance the Carlisle experience for our customer, but also drive margin expansion through pricing to value. They demonstrate how our focus on innovation is directly contributing to our Vision 2030 goals positioning us to meet evolving market needs while driving sustainable growth and profitability. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance year-to-date. As we progress towards our Vision 2030 goals, I am confident in our ability to continue delivering value for all our stakeholders. Our focus remains on demonstrating the strength of our margin resiliency through the Carlisle experience and driving superior returns on capital through our strategic initiatives. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details. Kevin?\nKevin Zdimal: Thank you, Chris. Our third quarter financial results continue to demonstrate Carlisle's strength and our effective execution. As shown on Slide 9, we delivered a solid third quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We grew sales to $1.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year, driven by robust reroofing activity, the return to normalization of inventory levels in our channels and the acquisition of MTL, which more than offset the negative impact from the slower residential end markets. We leveraged our top line performance to expand EBITDA margins by 60 basis points year-over-year to a record third quarter 27.6%. Furthermore, we grew adjusted EPS by 24% to a record third quarter $5.78 on reflecting the strong operating results, margin expansion and the benefits of our ongoing share repurchase program. Looking at our segment highlights, starting with CCM on Slide 10. CCM delivered third quarter revenues of $998 million, up 9% year-over-year. reflecting pent-up reroof demand, the benefit of inventory normalization and the acquisition of MTL. CCM's adjusted EBITDA increased 13% year-over-year to $328 million and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded an impressive 110 basis points year-over-year to a record third quarter 32.8%, reflecting strong volume leverage on sales growth, favorable raw materials and continued operational improvements driven by the Carlisle Operating System. Moving to Slide 11. Revenues at CWT were down 3% year-over-year to $335 million, primarily due to softer residential end markets and expected price declines in select product categories, partially offset by growth in our commercial business, share gain initiatives and the acquisition of Polar Industries. CWT\u2019s adjusted EBITDA decreased 14% year-over-year to $69 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 270 basis points year-over-year to 20.7% attributable to strategic investments in the business to support longer-term growth initiatives, as well as lower sales in the quarter as a result of broader residential market weakness from higher interest rates as consumers take a wait-and-see approach to home purchases and R&R. For your reference, Slide 12 provides a year-over-year third quarter adjusted EPS bridge. Moving to Slide 13. Our cash flow performance remains strong. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2024 was $597 million, up $22 million year-over-year, reflecting robust earnings growth and disciplined working capital management. We have invested $64 million in capital expenditures year-to-date. Moving to Slide 14. Our balance sheet remains solid with $1.5 billion in cash and $1 billion available under our revolving credit facility as of quarter end. This solid liquidity, along with a net leverage ratio of 0.5 times gives us the flexibility to invest in value-creating opportunities, while staying committed to delivering returns to our shareholders. Moving to Slide 15. In line with our Vision 2030 capital allocation strategy, we're reinvesting in our high ROIC building product businesses through growth CapEx and strategically deploying capital towards synergistic M&A opportunities to grow and enhance our building envelope portfolio, while also returning significant capital to shareholders. In the third quarter, we paid $46 million in dividends and repurchased $466 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to $1.2 billion. We have 4.5 million shares remaining under our current repurchase program. Carlisle's financial strength underpinned by consistent cash flow generation and prudent capital management remains a key competitive advantage. It enables us to balance investments in organic growth, strategic M&A and shareholder returns. While maintaining the flexibility to navigate evolving market dynamics. This financial resilience, combined with our operational excellence driven by the Carlisle Operating System reinforces our confidence in achieving our Vision 2030 objectives. Now moving to our full year financial outlook on Slide 16. As Chris previously noted, we now expect our full year 2024 outlook for revenue to grow approximately 10% over the prior year, and we are reaffirming our expectations for adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by approximately 150 basis points. This outlook includes an expectation for fourth quarter revenue to grow low single digit with an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 25% in the fourth quarter. As such, we expect record full year EPS in 2024, with growth in excess of 25% compared to the prior year. Additionally, we maintain our expectation to deliver free cash flow margins of at least 15% and ROIC in excess of 25%. This is directly aligned with the objectives outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy. To provide a tighter band on the outlook, I will provide outlook by segment for the fourth quarter. For CCM, we expect revenue to grow mid-single digit through a combination of volume growth and the benefit from the MTL acquisition, offsetting slightly lower pricing on year-over-year comps. For CWT, we expect fourth quarter revenue to decline low single digit versus a fourth quarter of 2023. The main drivers for CWT is key growth initiatives, partially offsetting the softer residential end markets. In summary, our third quarter results of revenue up 6% and adjusted EPS up 24% year-over-year to a record third quarter $5.78 and demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model, as well as our ability to execute effectively in a dynamic market environment. The progress we have made year-to-date reinforces the momentum we are building towards our Vision 2030 goals. As we look ahead, we are excited about the opportunities to further leverage our operational excellence, drive innovation and win in our end markets. With our strong financial position, disciplined capital allocation strategy and commitment to continued improvement through the Carlisle Operating System, we believe we are well equipped to deliver long-term value creation. With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks.\nChristian Koch: Thank you, Kevin. In conclusion, I want to reiterate our confidence in Carlisle's strategic direction under Vision 2030. As we move forward, our ability to innovate with a focus on energy efficiency and labor-saving solutions puts us on the right path to drive above-market growth and superior financial results. Our record third quarter results, cash flow generation and overall 2024 performance continue to give us confidence that we are firmly on track towards our Vision 2030 goals of $40 of EPS and 25% ROIC, 15% free cash flow margins, 25% EBITDA margins and mid-single-digit organic growth. The pivot of Carlisle's business model to an easier to understand and higher returning building products portfolio continues to provide many strong catalysts for growth. When combined with our robust free cash flow engine, strong balance sheet, enhanced focus on innovation, a robust pipeline of potential acquisitions and a proven M&A integration playbook, Carlisle is clearly positioned to create significant additional value for all our shareholders and reach our goal of $40 of EPS under Vision 2030. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my continued thanks to all of Carlyle's employees for their exceptional efforts and perseverance in this challenging environment. And once again, let me extend my sincere congratulations to the Henry team on their Home Depot Award. Thank you all as well for your continued support, investment and interest in Carlisle. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from Timothy Wojs from Baird. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Wojs: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for the time.\nChristian Koch: Good afternoon, Tim.\nTimothy Wojs: So maybe just on volumes. In the CCM business, if you could maybe kind of take a step back and kind of give us some color on where you think maybe either industry sales are or kind of where industry volumes are kind of in the third quarter and maybe year-to-date? And I guess as you look at next year, I mean, I know it's early, but how do you think about the volume kind of puts and takes to next year with new construction? And then it seems like re-roof continues to have some decent momentum.\nChristian Koch: Yes, I think you're right, Tim, I'll just take looking into 2025 first, and I'll see what Kevin wants to say about Q3. But I think 2025, we continue to be optimistic on that from a couple of perspectives. I think, obviously, there's a lot of economic uncertainty going to the elections. Obviously, there was hope for more interest rate cuts, it didn't materialize. I think people may be sitting on the sidelines there. We also are going into the fourth quarter after just having, basically, got back to normal on the inventory restocking and no one was going to really restock into the light quarters of the year too heavily. Then we add a little bit of weather. I think things stabilize after the election. Interest rate cuts, we think there may be some opportunity for some pricing. Obviously, we still see inflation in labor, medical costs, these things. As well as more innovation that we have coming out, the effects of some positive things on acquisition, some new channel opportunities for us. So I think 2025 for us, we would say it looks good. And then last, I'd say, we haven't had a load in into the construction season in quite a while. It probably isn't accurate, but I\u2019d say probably hasn't been since COVID. And that used to be a nice boost to the year. So I think there's some opportunities for some inventory improvements when people have confidence in the economy again. So with that, I'll turn it to Kevin and see what he'd like to say about the third quarter volumes.\nKevin Zdimal: Yes, in Q3 for CCM, I would say, the industry was up about 3%, which would have been the same for our CCM business. There was some things at the end of the quarter, as you know, with some of the weather events with the hurricanes, as well as the port strike that impacted us a little more than 1% in the quarter. So that would have been against that 3% volume that we would have seen.\nChristian Koch: Tim, one thing -- just one thing to add too. If I look across the verticals, warehouses, educational office, that kind of thing. Really, when we look in 2024, the big one that's been a drag and it was kind of that way in 2023 as well has been warehouses. Everything else is not in too bad a shape as far as how the volume is getting distributed. And I think you can -- and you're probably already aware of that, that we've seen that.\nTimothy Wojs: Yes. I mean, to your point, like new construction is down this year, right? So I mean -- and a lot of it is central -- a lot of it is kind of centered on the warehouse vertical. Right?\nChristian Koch: Yes.\nTimothy Wojs: Yes. Okay.\nChristian Koch: And I think the construction -- yes, okay. Enough.\nTimothy Wojs: No, that's fine. That's totally fine. And then just on just the M&A kind of funnel and the pipeline and I guess kind of the pace. I mean, you've done kind of two acquisitions or two tuck-in acquisitions here in the last couple of quarters. I mean, are there -- is there a pretty sizable pipeline of these tuck-in type acquisitions at a pretty attractive financial profiles because I mean if you're able to do a couple of these a year, I mean you could really start to get some momentum on the synergies and the capital deployment.\nChristian Koch: Yes. Actually, I still think prices are a little bit high versus what they were a few years ago. But after we get our synergies and a synergy-adjusted number, they've been looking really good. And it goes back to the four things we're looking for. We're looking for that organic growth story, we're looking for hard synergies, good management team. We've got those both in MTL and Plasti-Fab. The other thing is you said at the tuck-in, that ability to get those synergies, but also add a dimension to the two businesses. And I think it's really nice that MTL was a good acquisition for our existing CCM business around Drexel and Petersen, got a great manager in Tony Mallinger and things we're bringing -- efficiencies we're bringing to the existing business by adding MTL. And then you look at Plasti-Fab and it really reinforces that Frank Ready's concept that we built around national distribution, on being a national brand, on really enhancing the Carlisle Experience. I mean part of his core competency to Home Depot is a 24-hour delivery anywhere in the country. So when you look at Plasti-Fab, it begins to build out that EPS network as well. So they're really good fits, and we do see more of those. We do see more opportunities around the building envelope. And I think you'll see more of that from us certainly in 2025 and beyond.\nKevin Zdimal: The scale and size of them, we would expect to continue to deploy about $300 million to $500 million into these bolt-on acquisitions a year for the next few years.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. Okay. Great. And then, Kevin, just a clarification. That 3% industry volume number that you quoted, you guys were closer to mid-single digits, just to make sure the math works.\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. When you take into account some of the destock, then that puts us at the higher end there. Yes, I was excluding the destock impact.\nTimothy Wojs: Got you. Okay. It sounds good. I\u2019ll hop back in queue. Thanks, guys.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Hi, good evening. So maybe just turning to CCM margins, obviously, very strong performance in the quarter. You cited some positive raw material environment. Could you just talk about the price contribution to margins in the quarter and anything else that drove that expansion?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. So price-cost was neutral in the quarter for CCM. And as you said, it was very good margins, up over 100 basis points to a record. And for us, that really demonstrates the power of the business where we can get these record margins, expand the margins without getting price because that's been a lot of the story in past years as we needed to price to get the margins, but now with utilizing the Carlisle Operating System throughout CCM that's driving these higher margins.\nSaree Boroditsky: And then you guys don't usually talk a ton about storm activity, but just given some of the recent hurricanes, how do we think about the potential for additional construction demand versus having lower days on the roof in the short term?\nChristian Koch: Probably neutral, I would say. I think we definitely had some impact, at the end of September and then into October in factories primarily in Florida and around the Gulf. But obviously, we'll get some pickup from that. I mean we hope people recover quickly. There was a lot of damage. And I think more importantly than the -- if we talk about weather, the bigger impact as those wash out is probably around what kind of November, December, we have across the country, Saree, and whether we get a nice dry warm fall or we get wet weather and more snow early in the north. So that's always the factor. But I think for the most part, the opportunity and the impact kind of wash each other out in the quarter -- fourth quarter.\nSaree Boroditsky: Appreciate it. If I could just add one more. You've talked about the ramping of the R&D investments to 3% of sales. Can you just talk about how we see that spending step up and maybe what the contribution will be for next year? Thank you.\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. We would expect to increase around 50 basis points a year as we move forward to 2030. So we're not going to get to 3% next year or even the following year. It's more of this steady increase of it throughout the next five years.\nSaree Boroditsky: Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Saree.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Susan Maklari. Please go ahead.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. My first question is digging a little -- my first question is digging into the re-roof side of things again. Can you talk a little bit about what the latest survey of your contractors has shown. Has that changed any over the last quarter? And how are you thinking about their positioning as they look to the fall and year-end? And then how do you also within that, think about the opportunities to capture some of that business given the MTL and the other acquisitions?\nChristian Koch: Right. Well, the survey that we do really reflected everything. I think you've written, and others have written about more pressure on new and more pressure on the resi side of the business. And obviously, that's been reflected in more numbers than just ours, and I think it's pretty well understood. Very kind of positive on re-roofing as we look out. And we kind of bifurcate this into a near-term look at what re-roofing is doing. But in the long term, all those roofs that we've seen, and we've talked about this before that are put on in the 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, these all come back at a higher price and have to be re-roofed within 20 years. So the outlook for Q4 has been positive across the board. Obviously, we talked about the impact of what weather can do, and there can be some impact on the margins. And then going into 2025. I was actually surprised that the kind of initial indicators were positive, both on return to volume. And I think, again, I spoke to the uncertainty now and the macroeconomic conditions that are here. Uncertainty, people being concerned. But the 2025 looked more positive. And then surprisingly, there was some positive expectation around price that would be a positive as we headed into 2025. So early days, right? These are projections. This is across a wide group of contractors, but I think good news on that commercial side.\nSusan Maklari: Yes. Okay. And then can you talk a bit about your inventories within CCM, how those are going into the end of the year? And any thoughts on your production?\nChristian Koch: Yes. And Sue, before I get to inventories, you asked about MTL and what's happening. MTL continues to make great strides to integrate into the specifications at CCM. As always, a reminder, MTL has patents and things like this, and we're bringing those into our warranty. We're bringing our sales force teams together. I mean it's only been about six months but we're getting good traction there. We're seeing places where even Henry now is getting into the game where we will bid on a national chain, and we'll suddenly see that Henry might be in there and they're bringing MTL in or they're bringing CCM or vice versa. So there's really good synergies there. And I'm really pleased with how quickly Brian and his team have integrated and really started to push that whole idea of the building envelope platform that we want. On inventory, as you know, inventory turns have been better. We're fine. Our deliveries continue to increase in terms of on-time delivery rate. It's always been good, but it has gotten better as we moved through the quarter. And that's OTD to promise and then first-time fill rate. So I think we continue to have pretty good service, and it continues to get better in the quarter.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. All right. Thanks for all the color. Good luck with everything.\nChristian Koch: You bet. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Next question will be coming from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions.\nChristian Koch: Good afternoon, David.\nDavid MacGregor: Chris, can you just talk about the polyiso market? And it seems as though you've gotten a lot of new capacity that's a lot -- a relative large increase, I guess, in the amount of new capacity that's come to market in the last year. It seems like pricing has been a little slobby. How are you thinking about that market right now and how it can absorb that capacity over the next year or so?\nChristian Koch: Well, I think when we look at additions, maybe we take it into two different groups. We look at the -- our big -- the big three that -- us and our two big competitors have been here for a long time and use it as part of an integrated system. I mean we look at the re-roofing volumes over the coming years. We look at North America, getting some reshoring. We look at what we're doing with the need for energy efficiency, I think we'll be fine with what's been added. We do have others that have announced they're going to come in. I think this is an interesting statement. I think it's going to be polyiso in the market, but it's not the same type of capacity, as I would say, out of those players that have a fully warrantied system, national coverage, training centers tying it together with -- as I just mentioned to Sue, bringing in the metal and that kind of stuff. So we still are looking to be the provider of the building envelope solution. We're looking to add pieces like Plasti-Fab, which is an insulation company, obviously. And so I think there's been some capacity added and -- or at least talked about being added, and I don't understand how that might integrate into the markets we serve. We've had this happen before, I think, three years ago, maybe four years ago, we had a competitor from Canada come down and put a facility in Maryland, and it was a TPO and polyiso facility. And I think at the time, we'd had some questions around what's that going to do to the market. Obviously, we don't ever talk about that on our calls, and I would say the impact was negligible. So obviously, there's a lot more to being in this building envelope business than just showing up with a TPO line and a polyiso line. While that's a great start, I'm sure, for someone. We've got a lot of years of relationships and other things. Again, I like to think about Mehul and Frank talks about this too, VPTech's a great idea. It's not just having a piece of Blueskin or the vapor barrier, the EPS or the board, it's putting them all together and then selling through a highly talented sales network architects and contractors and builders. And so I think we're good. I think we've got a great outlook for North American construction markets. And so I think what we've added while seems to be quite a bit compared to what we're used to. I think we'll be okay with it.\nDavid MacGregor: Good. Thank you for that detail. That's a great answer. Can you just walk us through your outlook for each of your principal raw material inputs just in terms of price trends and what you're seeing there?\nChristian Koch: Yes. I think we had talked about MDI for the year being a little bit down. I know our TPO resins were a little bit up. EPDM resins -- or I should say polymers, down. So when we look overall, that's where we're getting to. Some savings that -- those that are down are overwhelming it. But for the most part, it's been stable through the year as much as we expected. I think some of it obviously depends on demand. And in the resi markets, obviously, has been down. But overall, relatively stable.\nDavid MacGregor: Good. Last question for me is just on CWT and you talked about EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA being down 14%. Can you just bifurcate for us the investments that were made there versus the volume deleverage?\nChristian Koch: Yes. When we looked at it, we try to break it into something that we all could -- there's a lot of moving parts. But basically, about a third of that was the continued deterioration in the resi markets. Both the resi, new and the R&R were both down about mid-single digits. Obviously, I'll say but you already know it, it's interest rates, affordability, election uncertainty. And then we had a little bit of an impact from the spray foam side of the business where a little bit of irrational pricing from some competitors that had a bit of an impact. But let's say that made up a third. And then the second third really was the investments and maybe I'll let Mehul go into what those investments were. He's our residential -- or I should say, CWT expert.\nKevin Zdimal: Sure. Thanks, Chris. Hi, Dave. How are you? So you've heard us talk about share gain initiatives within CWT across expansion in the Home Depot retail side of the business as well as expanding into the national builders with their full system offerings and then advanced waterproofing penetration. So those are areas where we're investing in the sales organization, adding people as well as equipment to drive our strategy there. In addition to that, we've had additional marketing and ad co-op programs at the retail channel as we expand into additional categories. And then you heard us talk about R&D as part of Vision 2030. So on CWT, you heard about products like Blueskin VPTech. We're investing in that in R&D. And then lastly, as part of our cross-selling and selling the full system across the different CWT businesses, we've been investing in IT and systems and tools to make it a better customer experience. So that kind of gives you an idea of where we're spending the additional money, and it's going to support further long-term growth and as we continue to grow, we should get a good return and see margins improve going forward.\nDavid MacGregor: Great. Thanks for the detail. Good luck.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, David\nOperator: Next question will be coming from Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer.\nBryan Blair: Good afternoon, guys.\nChristian Koch: Good afternoon, Bryan.\nBryan Blair: Chris, you mentioned likely neutral Q4, in fact, from the hurricanes. Obviously, there was some headwind from the first when that hit in Q3. Just to level set, what was the total impact between the port strikes and the initial impact of the first hurricane top line and margin to the extent that can be quantified?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. On the top line, it's about $10 million to $15 million of impact in the third quarter. And yes, to the bottom line, you can do our incrementals off of that. So 40% is the impact there for the third quarter. And then, yes, as Chris said, we don't see it coming back in the fourth quarter, getting that pick up. But 2025 is when we'll see more of the recovery of that piece that was slowed down due to the hurricanes right now. Obviously, in the southeast, the focus is on the essential jobs and the repairs. They're not doing as much work on new projects, but that's what we think will kick in, in 2025.\nBryan Blair: Okay. Understood. And Chris, you've walked through some of the puts and takes for CCM looking to 2025, maybe do the same with CWT. How are you thinking about recovery prospects, continued watch items, the related swing factors, et cetera?\nChristian Koch: Yes. Well, I think you've got a lot of really positive things. I mean, Mehul mentioned a couple of them. We've obviously expanded our retail channel. That was a great synergy that we don't build into the $30 million of synergies that we had in the Henry deal that came as a bonus. So the expansion into the retail channel has been good. We've talked about some of the different products, like I mentioned, the UltraTouch denim insulation. We've got some other projects that are going on. So I like that, Frank's VPTech, really, this [Technical Difficulty] economy and this affordability. I think a couple of interest rate cuts that will be needed will help. We've got to get people moving again, that affordability is an issue. We do know there's backlog in housing stock. So let's see that happen. CapEx gets deployed. So I think that as well as CapEx, and we haven't talked about it much on this call, but we did invest a lot into automation into CWT, things like auto fill, taking really labor out of the equation, automating that and increasing both the quality, reducing the waste and increasing the efficiency of our factories and Frank's done a nice job there. So again, to me, when we look at the quarter and we think about that one-third, two-thirds, I think, that one-third in the beginning, while it may not have been as impactful as these investments. Obviously, if the volume is there to run through it, the incrementals have been pretty good, and we were on a good pace to do that before we saw that further deterioration. So we look for this rebound in the resi and repair and remodel markets, and I think it will have a -- it will be there. Whether it happens in the first quarter, or not, I think I would look more towards the second half of the year, but we're confident it'll be there.\nBryan Blair: Okay. Thank you for all the color.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Just on the price-cost, any change to the outlook of flat for the year at this point?\nChristian Koch: No. Not on -- I assume you're talking on the CCM side.\nAdam Baumgarten: Yes. Just because I think you said it was flat in 3Q, right?\nChristian Koch: Yes.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. Cool. And then just on CCM specifically on pricing. Just curious what you saw throughout the quarter, especially kind of later in the quarter and into 4Q and maybe what you're hearing from your distribution customers around price competition?\nChristian Koch: Yes. And I think it's been pretty -- I wouldn't say it's widely disseminated. But I think for pricing, we're seeing relative stability. I mean, I think back to a few years ago, when there was a -- raw materials will go down and we would just see pricing tied to raw materials. And I think as we pushed price discipline and as we push price to value. It's been pretty good to see our competitors investing in and new factories investing in innovation, investing in their sales teams and really ensuring that they get paid for those investments they're making. So again, I think just what we got -- as I said earlier in the call, what we got out of our survey was relatively stable pricing environment throughout the year. I think Kevin had said at the beginning of the year, we would probably be down 2% for the year, and I think we're going to be pretty close to that despite all the issues that have gone on through the year. And then I think going into 2025, the feedback was that there might be some upside to pricing from our survey. So we'll see how that plays out, but that is a good thing when our contractor base and our other [indiscernible] our value chain are thinking like that.\nAdam Baumgarten: Great. Thanks a lot. Best of luck.\nChristian Koch: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question for today will be coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. So just two questions on CWT. Just first on pricing. It remains down, and I think that's fairly consistent with what you saw earlier in the year, but just wondering maybe similar to the earlier question on CCM, if the pricing cadence has changed at all in CWT?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes. It's steadily improved throughout the year where we're in the back half of the year is about 2% down. First half of the year was a little bit higher than that at CWT. So it has improved but we're expecting down a couple of percent in both Q3, which we had, as well as in Q4.\nMehul Patel: And Garik, one thing I will add, just going back to our last earnings call when we talked about additional pricing pressure on spray foam. Outside of that, everything is in line. There's no pricing pressure. We're holding prices stable, similar to CCM and declines that Kevin mentioned, that's pretty much in line with what we said on the last earnings call.\nGarik Shmois: Great. Appreciate the color there. And then just on the trends in CWT during the quarter and the outlook, just given the disconnect on what you're looking for coming out of 2Q, and I think it implied maybe mid-single-digit type revenue growth in the back half of the year, I kind of appreciate -- the residential, it remains weak. But any more color as to maybe either sales trends throughout the quarter or any specific product line or channels that just haven't materialized to the degree you expected?\nChristian Koch: Yes. I think when we look at each segment, it's been pretty good, as Mehul said, I mean, relative to what our expectations were and coming into the year and then even in the second quarter. And I really don't think we can underestimate the impact of the residential markets, the affordability, the fact that people aren't moving. And I think those -- I think earlier in the year, we had a lot of talk about even three interest rate cuts and then we got one, and that was it. And I think that kind of has helped -- or not helped, but it hurt people because they're saying, well, maybe I'll stick around and wait and see if things get better in 2025. So why act now when I could maybe do it later. And then I think the bigger impact from a product line perspective has just been probably a little more deterioration in spray foam than we thought in that one segment. And again, that's a tough one. It's a very compelling market. It's got a lot of energy efficiency benefits to it. It's a much better product from an R-value perspective. From a vapor barrier perspective, we're seeing a wide adoption in homebuilding, the sound deadening benefits. It's a great product, but we've had some industry changes over the last five years where there's been acquisitions by one group and some regional players that have maybe taken some different actions. And so pricing has been a little bit worse there than we thought. And I'd say that would be the one thing that -- or those two things are the things that really impacted that CWT pricing in the third quarter and looking into the fourth.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks and best of luck for Q4.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Garik.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the call over to Chris Koch for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, everybody. This concludes the third quarter call for Carlisle. Thanks for the participation. Thanks for the great questions. Look forward to speaking with you all on our next call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Zdimal",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Our third quarter financial results continue to demonstrate Carlisle's strength and our effective execution. As shown on Slide 9, we delivered a solid third quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We grew sales to $1.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year, driven by robust reroofing activity, the return to normalization of inventory levels in our channels and the acquisition of MTL, which more than offset the negative impact from the slower residential end markets. We leveraged our top line performance to expand EBITDA margins by 60 basis points year-over-year to a record third quarter 27.6%. Furthermore, we grew adjusted EPS by 24% to a record third quarter $5.78 on reflecting the strong operating results, margin expansion and the benefits of our ongoing share repurchase program. Looking at our segment highlights, starting with CCM on Slide 10. CCM delivered third quarter revenues of $998 million, up 9% year-over-year. reflecting pent-up reroof demand, the benefit of inventory normalization and the acquisition of MTL. CCM's adjusted EBITDA increased 13% year-over-year to $328 million and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded an impressive 110 basis points year-over-year to a record third quarter 32.8%, reflecting strong volume leverage on sales growth, favorable raw materials and continued operational improvements driven by the Carlisle Operating System. Moving to Slide 11. Revenues at CWT were down 3% year-over-year to $335 million, primarily due to softer residential end markets and expected price declines in select product categories, partially offset by growth in our commercial business, share gain initiatives and the acquisition of Polar Industries. CWT's adjusted EBITDA decreased 14% year-over-year to $69 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 270 basis points year-over-year to 20.7% attributable to strategic investments in the business to support longer-term growth initiatives, as well as lower sales in the quarter as a result of broader residential market weakness from higher interest rates as consumers take a wait-and-see approach to home purchases and R&R. For your reference, Slide 12 provides a year-over-year third quarter adjusted EPS bridge. Moving to Slide 13. Our cash flow performance remains strong. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2024 was $597 million, up $22 million year-over-year, reflecting robust earnings growth and disciplined working capital management. We have invested $64 million in capital expenditures year-to-date. Moving to Slide 14. Our balance sheet remains solid with $1.5 billion in cash and $1 billion available under our revolving credit facility as of quarter end. This solid liquidity, along with a net leverage ratio of 0.5 times gives us the flexibility to invest in value-creating opportunities, while staying committed to delivering returns to our shareholders. Moving to Slide 15. In line with our Vision 2030 capital allocation strategy, we're reinvesting in our high ROIC building product businesses through growth CapEx and strategically deploying capital towards synergistic M&A opportunities to grow and enhance our building envelope portfolio, while also returning significant capital to shareholders. In the third quarter, we paid $46 million in dividends and repurchased $466 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to $1.2 billion. We have 4.5 million shares remaining under our current repurchase program. Carlisle's financial strength underpinned by consistent cash flow generation and prudent capital management remains a key competitive advantage. It enables us to balance investments in organic growth, strategic M&A and shareholder returns. While maintaining the flexibility to navigate evolving market dynamics. This financial resilience, combined with our operational excellence driven by the Carlisle Operating System reinforces our confidence in achieving our Vision 2030 objectives. Now moving to our full year financial outlook on Slide 16. As Chris previously noted, we now expect our full year 2024 outlook for revenue to grow approximately 10% over the prior year, and we are reaffirming our expectations for adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by approximately 150 basis points. This outlook includes an expectation for fourth quarter revenue to grow low single digit with an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 25% in the fourth quarter. As such, we expect record full year EPS in 2024, with growth in excess of 25% compared to the prior year. Additionally, we maintain our expectation to deliver free cash flow margins of at least 15% and ROIC in excess of 25%. This is directly aligned with the objectives outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy. To provide a tighter band on the outlook, I will provide outlook by segment for the fourth quarter. For CCM, we expect revenue to grow mid-single digit through a combination of volume growth and the benefit from the MTL acquisition, offsetting slightly lower pricing on year-over-year comps. For CWT, we expect fourth quarter revenue to decline low single digit versus a fourth quarter of 2023. The main drivers for CWT is key growth initiatives, partially offsetting the softer residential end markets. In summary, our third quarter results of revenue up 6% and adjusted EPS up 24% year-over-year to a record third quarter $5.78 and demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model, as well as our ability to execute effectively in a dynamic market environment. The progress we have made year-to-date reinforces the momentum we are building towards our Vision 2030 goals. As we look ahead, we are excited about the opportunities to further leverage our operational excellence, drive innovation and win in our end markets. With our strong financial position, disciplined capital allocation strategy and commitment to continued improvement through the Carlisle Operating System, we believe we are well equipped to deliver long-term value creation. With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. Yes, in Q3 for CCM, I would say, the industry was up about 3%, which would have been the same for our CCM business. There was some things at the end of the quarter, as you know, with some of the weather events with the hurricanes, as well as the port strike that impacted us a little more than 1% in the quarter. So that would have been against that 3% volume that we would have seen. The scale and size of them, we would expect to continue to deploy about $300 million to $500 million into these bolt-on acquisitions a year for the next few years. Yes. When you take into account some of the destock, then that puts us at the higher end there. Yes, I was excluding the destock impact. Yes. So price-cost was neutral in the quarter for CCM. And as you said, it was very good margins, up over 100 basis points to a record. And for us, that really demonstrates the power of the business where we can get these record margins, expand the margins without getting price because that's been a lot of the story in past years as we needed to price to get the margins, but now with utilizing the Carlisle Operating System throughout CCM that's driving these higher margins. Yes. We would expect to increase around 50 basis points a year as we move forward to 2030. So we're not going to get to 3% next year or even the following year. It's more of this steady increase of it throughout the next five years. Sure. Thanks, Chris. Hi, Dave. How are you? So you've heard us talk about share gain initiatives within CWT across expansion in the Home Depot retail side of the business as well as expanding into the national builders with their full system offerings and then advanced waterproofing penetration. So those are areas where we're investing in the sales organization, adding people as well as equipment to drive our strategy there. In addition to that, we've had additional marketing and ad co-op programs at the retail channel as we expand into additional categories. And then you heard us talk about R&D as part of Vision 2030. So on CWT, you heard about products like Blueskin VPTech. We're investing in that in R&D. And then lastly, as part of our cross-selling and selling the full system across the different CWT businesses, we've been investing in IT and systems and tools to make it a better customer experience. So that kind of gives you an idea of where we're spending the additional money, and it's going to support further long-term growth and as we continue to grow, we should get a good return and see margins improve going forward. Yes. On the top line, it's about $10 million to $15 million of impact in the third quarter. And yes, to the bottom line, you can do our incrementals off of that. So 40% is the impact there for the third quarter. And then, yes, as Chris said, we don't see it coming back in the fourth quarter, getting that pick up. But 2025 is when we'll see more of the recovery of that piece that was slowed down due to the hurricanes right now. Obviously, in the southeast, the focus is on the essential jobs and the repairs. They're not doing as much work on new projects, but that's what we think will kick in, in 2025. Yes. It's steadily improved throughout the year where we're in the back half of the year is about 2% down. First half of the year was a little bit higher than that at CWT. So it has improved but we're expecting down a couple of percent in both Q3, which we had, as well as in Q4."

            "name": "Christian Koch",
            "content": "Thank you, Mehul. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on Carlisle's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. To start, I'd like to direct your attention to Slide 3 of the presentation. I'm pleased to share that Carlisle continued to demonstrate the outstanding performance we've seen in 2024, into the third quarter despite facing increased headwinds in the quarter, which negatively impacted sales, primarily in our residential end markets. Despite these challenges and the additional impact of two major hurricanes, the Carlisle team delivered record third quarter results in both EBITDA margin and earnings per share. Carlisle's performance throughout this year underscores the resilience of our business model, the robustness of our key initiatives and the perseverance of our team and the effective execution of our Vision 2030 strategies. The record achievements in profitability in the third quarter are even more rewarding and that our teams delivered the record third quarter results in an environment that, as mentioned, saw a weakening residential market when compared to our second quarter outlook, as well as disruptions tied to weather-related and port strike events. In the third quarter, Carlisle delivered sales of $1.3 billion, representing growth of 6% on a year-over-year basis despite the negative sales impact of CWT. Across both CCM and CWT, we maintained our strong focus on pricing discipline on driving a superior customer interface through the Carlisle experience and continued to deliver operating efficiencies through our well-known approach to driving continuous improvement, the Carlisle Operating System. These factors combined to deliver third quarter record bottom line results with adjusted EPS growing 24% to $5.78 and adjusted EBITDA margin expanding 60 basis points year-over-year to 27.6%, highlighting our commitment to continued margin expansion in both CCM and CWT. CCM continued the positive momentum generated in the first half of 2024 into the second half of the year with revenue growth of 9% and an impressive 110 basis points expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin, setting a new third quarter record of 32.8%. This growth was driven by the continued strength in reroofing demand, along with the benefits from inventory normalization in the channel and the acquisition of MTL. As we've discussed throughout the year, we anticipated a significant positive impact from inventory normalization in 2024, and we are pleased that it materialized as expected, and in the order of magnitude, we had forecasted at the start of the year. In the third quarter, in line with our original projections, we saw an approximately $50 million benefit of sales from CCM inventory normalization, which now completes the lapping benefit we expected this year and it was tied to the prior year's inventory destock. As a reminder, when we entered 2024, we had anticipated $375 million from a return to normal inventory levels. Now turning to CWT. While we were pleased with the progress of our new product introductions, retail channel expansion and overall share gains within CWT, higher interest rates and affordability challenges resulted in a further slowing in new housing activity and repair and remodel during the quarter. These negative factors drove a sales decline of 3% year-over-year in CWT, including an expected low single-digit price decline. That said, our long-term positive outlook for CWT is unchanged given the well-known need for additional housing, a forecasted return to a better interest rate environment and success in key growth initiatives across commercial waterproofing, new product introductions and expansion in the home center channel. Overall pricing in the third quarter remained relatively stable and in line with our expectations for both the CCM and CWT segments. Much of this was driven by our proactive approach, pricing discipline, and our commitment to value-based pricing. Furthermore, the team's focus on operational excellence and strategic growth initiatives leaves us well positioned to capitalize on market opportunities as they arrive. Now let's turn to Vision 2030. Our Vision 2030 strategy continues to guide our focus on key growth drivers, including energy efficiency, labor-saving solutions and capturing a larger share of the expanding reroofing market. We're doubling down on organic investments in innovation more than tripling our historical R&D investments to bring more energy efficient and labor-saving products to market faster. We also remain committed to our pivot to a pure-play building products platform and focused almost exclusively on the opportunities presented in the North American markets. Furthermore, we remain driven to be a superior capital allocator and demonstrated our commitment to returning capital to shareholders in the third quarter through our balanced approach of dividends and share repurchases. During quarter three, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $466 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.2 billion. These third quarter purchases put us well on track to achieve our planned goal of $1.4 billion in share repurchases in 2024. Additionally, we paid out $46 million in dividends this quarter and declared an 18% increase to our dividend in August, representing the 48th consecutive annual increase in dividends for Carlisle shareholders. These actions underpin our ongoing dedication to creating shareholder value and reflect our confidence in Carlisle's growth trajectory. Our robust cash flow generation and pristine balance sheet continue to provide us with the flexibility to reinvest in our businesses and the ability to deploy capital to drive organic growth, continuously improve our operations, pursue strategic acquisitions and actively return capital to our shareholders, all while maintaining our focus on driving long-term value creation. To close out Slide 3, while we are slightly lowering our full year 2024 outlook to 10% revenue growth for Carlisle, reflecting the ongoing challenges in the residential markets and the impact of the previously mentioned weather and strike events, we are pleased to reaffirm our expectation to achieve approximately 150 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. I will now speak briefly to Slides 4 through 8 as I discuss our recent progress against our Vision 2030 goals. As a reminder, our Vision 2030 strategy builds on the success of Vision 2025 and gives us a clear road map to drive value creation in the next chapter of Carlisle's ongoing story of success. Under Vision 2030, we are creating value for our shareholders through our portfolio of high-performing building envelope businesses with attractive secular trends. We are focusing on delivering the most innovative, energy-efficient and labor-saving products and solutions to our customers through investment in our ever-improving Carlisle experience, delivering well understood and consistent value for price leveraging a strong leadership focus and operating with a relentless focus on flawless execution, driven by our COS culture. As a reminder, Vision 2030 focuses on 6 pillars: the first is the Carlisle Operating System. Under Vision 2030, we will continue to drive our continuous improvement culture through the consistent application of COS across every function in the enterprise, with the goal to drive savings of 1% to 2% of sales annually through operation efficiencies. Second is the Carlisle experience. The Carlisle Experience has established us as a premium brand with a recognized value proposition backed by high-quality products and exceptional service. Our commitment to our customers is embodied in the Carlisle experience, which means, delivering the right products to the right place at the right time. We understand that we win with customers through superior products and solutions, exceptional service and labor savings efficiencies, and we price our products to reflect that value. Third is innovation. We plan to increase our spend on R&D to 3% of sales by 2030 and to accelerate the creation of new products and solutions that add value to our customers through advancements in sustainability, energy savings and labor efficiency. We will pursue innovation based on an intimate knowledge of our markets and a focus on innovation that responds to our customers' needs and opportunities to improve their businesses. Fourth is M&A. We will focus on existing and adjacent categories that allow us to enhance our building envelope portfolio. We will seek opportunities to acquire assets that meet our well-understood criteria of an embedded organic growth story. An opportunity to deliver hard cost synergies, a talented management team and the ability to deploy our Carlisle Integration Playbook. Fifth is our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Ultimately, as superior capital allocators, we seek to create value for our shareholders and deliver benefits for all our stakeholders. In line with our track record, we will continue to invest our cash responsibly into the highest ROIC opportunities. And lastly and perhaps more importantly, our sixth goal is attracting, motivating and retaining top performers to ensure we have the best talent to execute our strategic initiatives and drive above-market growth. By executing on our clearly stated initiatives and strategies, reinforced by the progress we have made this year, we are on target to deliver our goal of $40 of EPS by 2030, while achieving over 25% ROIC and generating free cash flow margins in excess of 15%. Our M&A strategy, a key pillar of Vision 2030 continues to progress as expected. We have a healthy pipeline of opportunities that can contribute to our Vision 2030 goal to grow and be a leading supplier of building envelope products and solutions. With the sale of CIT completed in May, I'm pleased to report that we've been able to deploy capital from the sale proceeds into meaningful acquisitions demonstrating our ability to execute on our strategic plans and create value through M&A as part of Vision 2030. This rapid and strategic deployment of capital underscores our commitment to strengthening and growing our positions within the building envelope. With our solid balance sheet and robust cash flow, we are well positioned to capture additional value through M&A over the Vision 2030 time frame. We see opportunities in both existing and complementary categories, including architectural metals, insulation, underlayments, sealants and adhesives and the many weather-proofing categories within CWT. As a reminder, our M&A playbook is built on four core criteria: an embedded organic growth story; hard cost synergies; a strong management team; and the deployment of our Carlisle integration playbook, our acquisition of MTL earlier this year and our recently announced agreement to acquire PlastiFab are recent examples of this strategy in action and the steady progress in M&A, we are making against our Vision 2030 goals. Let's focus on PlastiFab for a moment. The rationale for the acquisition of PlastiFab is straightforward. It aligns perfectly with our Vision 2030 strategy to enhance our best-in-class building envelope product portfolio. It establishes Carlisle as a leading manufacturer within the $1.5 billion North American expanded polystyrene insulation market and strategically provides vertically integrated polystyrene capabilities to our Insulfoam business while adding scale, supporting retail channel growth and filling key geographic gaps in the U.S. and Canada. We expect this acquisition to generate approximately $14 million in annual cost synergies and be accretive to our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.30 in 2025. Recently, our M&A strategy gained recognition in a Harvard Business Review article titled A Better Approach to Mergers and Acquisitions. Carlisle has built a detailed integration playbook with clear milestones and goals. This approach, coupled with our rigorous due diligence process gives us a competitive advantage in M&A execution. We were pleased to be able to share our approach to M&A through a well-distributed and well-respected periodical and hope it helps provide shareholders with more insight into our approach. Our success in M&A complements our intensified focus on innovation, another key driver in our Vision 2030 strategy. We're significantly increasing our R&D investment to $1 billion over the Vision 2030 time frame, aiming to drive 25% of our revenue from new products, up from 15% today. Our approach categorizes innovation into three types: business life cycle; evolutionary; and revolutionary, each receiving equal focus and investment of about 1% of sales. Business life cycle innovations, currently 80% of our efforts, focus on ongoing product improvements and cost reductions. Evolutionary innovations address specific and real current unmet customer needs. A great example is our new 16-foot TPO line. By doubling the width of the traditional eight foot TPO role, we reduce seams in the roof, which reduces the opportunities for leaks over the life of the roof. It also reduces labor by significantly increasing the square foot applied by the contractors installation team. Revolutionary innovations drive dramatic business inflections with longer-term development time lines. New reroofing insulation like our recently introduced denim-based UltraTouch product that's available at Home Depot is an example of a revolutionary product development idea. Our innovation efforts are already yielding results with products like Seam Shield and Blue Skin VP Tech gaining rapid market acceptance. Seam Shield reduces cleaning time by 70% while increasing weld strength directly addressing contractor pain points. Blue Skin VP Tech combines multiple components into a single product, improving energy efficiency and cutting installation time by 30%. And I'm particularly excited to highlight another innovative product that exemplifies our commitment to sustainability and customer value. Our Henry Roofguard roof coating was recently named a finalist for Home Depot's Innovative Product of the Year Award. This recognition not only showcases our progress in innovation, but also reinforces the strength of our relationships with key channel partners like Home Depot and is another example of delivering value to our customers based on extensive market input. Roof Guard represents our next-generation acrylic waterproof roof coating enhanced with urethane for improved performance its premium hybrid formula offers better weather protection, solar reflectivity and longevity compared to standard acrylic reflective roof coatings. This innovation not only addresses our customers' needs for energy efficiency, but also aligns perfectly with our sustainability goals. The success of products like Roof Guard have contributed to CWT's Henry brand being awarded Home Depot's Building Materials Vendor of the Year for the second time since 2022. This accolade underscores our commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction, serving as a prime example of the Carlisle experience in action, and we are very proud of the Henry team for being recognized by Home Depot again. These innovations not only enhance the Carlisle experience for our customer, but also drive margin expansion through pricing to value. They demonstrate how our focus on innovation is directly contributing to our Vision 2030 goals positioning us to meet evolving market needs while driving sustainable growth and profitability. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance year-to-date. As we progress towards our Vision 2030 goals, I am confident in our ability to continue delivering value for all our stakeholders. Our focus remains on demonstrating the strength of our margin resiliency through the Carlisle experience and driving superior returns on capital through our strategic initiatives. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details. Kevin? Thank you, Kevin. In conclusion, I want to reiterate our confidence in Carlisle's strategic direction under Vision 2030. As we move forward, our ability to innovate with a focus on energy efficiency and labor-saving solutions puts us on the right path to drive above-market growth and superior financial results. Our record third quarter results, cash flow generation and overall 2024 performance continue to give us confidence that we are firmly on track towards our Vision 2030 goals of $40 of EPS and 25% ROIC, 15% free cash flow margins, 25% EBITDA margins and mid-single-digit organic growth. The pivot of Carlisle's business model to an easier to understand and higher returning building products portfolio continues to provide many strong catalysts for growth. When combined with our robust free cash flow engine, strong balance sheet, enhanced focus on innovation, a robust pipeline of potential acquisitions and a proven M&A integration playbook, Carlisle is clearly positioned to create significant additional value for all our shareholders and reach our goal of $40 of EPS under Vision 2030. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my continued thanks to all of Carlyle's employees for their exceptional efforts and perseverance in this challenging environment. And once again, let me extend my sincere congratulations to the Henry team on their Home Depot Award. Thank you all as well for your continued support, investment and interest in Carlisle. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Good afternoon, Tim. Yes, I think you're right, Tim, I'll just take looking into 2025 first, and I'll see what Kevin wants to say about Q3. But I think 2025, we continue to be optimistic on that from a couple of perspectives. I think, obviously, there's a lot of economic uncertainty going to the elections. Obviously, there was hope for more interest rate cuts, it didn't materialize. I think people may be sitting on the sidelines there. We also are going into the fourth quarter after just having, basically, got back to normal on the inventory restocking and no one was going to really restock into the light quarters of the year too heavily. Then we add a little bit of weather. I think things stabilize after the election. Interest rate cuts, we think there may be some opportunity for some pricing. Obviously, we still see inflation in labor, medical costs, these things. As well as more innovation that we have coming out, the effects of some positive things on acquisition, some new channel opportunities for us. So I think 2025 for us, we would say it looks good. And then last, I'd say, we haven't had a load in into the construction season in quite a while. It probably isn't accurate, but I'd say probably hasn't been since COVID. And that used to be a nice boost to the year. So I think there's some opportunities for some inventory improvements when people have confidence in the economy again. So with that, I'll turn it to Kevin and see what he'd like to say about the third quarter volumes. Tim, one thing -- just one thing to add too. If I look across the verticals, warehouses, educational office, that kind of thing. Really, when we look in 2024, the big one that's been a drag and it was kind of that way in 2023 as well has been warehouses. Everything else is not in too bad a shape as far as how the volume is getting distributed. And I think you can -- and you're probably already aware of that, that we've seen that. Yes. And I think the construction -- yes, okay. Enough. Yes. Actually, I still think prices are a little bit high versus what they were a few years ago. But after we get our synergies and a synergy-adjusted number, they've been looking really good. And it goes back to the four things we're looking for. We're looking for that organic growth story, we're looking for hard synergies, good management team. We've got those both in MTL and Plasti-Fab. The other thing is you said at the tuck-in, that ability to get those synergies, but also add a dimension to the two businesses. And I think it's really nice that MTL was a good acquisition for our existing CCM business around Drexel and Petersen, got a great manager in Tony Mallinger and things we're bringing -- efficiencies we're bringing to the existing business by adding MTL. And then you look at Plasti-Fab and it really reinforces that Frank Ready's concept that we built around national distribution, on being a national brand, on really enhancing the Carlisle Experience. I mean part of his core competency to Home Depot is a 24-hour delivery anywhere in the country. So when you look at Plasti-Fab, it begins to build out that EPS network as well. So they're really good fits, and we do see more of those. We do see more opportunities around the building envelope. And I think you'll see more of that from us certainly in 2025 and beyond. Thanks, Tim. Probably neutral, I would say. I think we definitely had some impact, at the end of September and then into October in factories primarily in Florida and around the Gulf. But obviously, we'll get some pickup from that. I mean we hope people recover quickly. There was a lot of damage. And I think more importantly than the -- if we talk about weather, the bigger impact as those wash out is probably around what kind of November, December, we have across the country, Saree, and whether we get a nice dry warm fall or we get wet weather and more snow early in the north. So that's always the factor. But I think for the most part, the opportunity and the impact kind of wash each other out in the quarter -- fourth quarter. Thanks, Saree. Right. Well, the survey that we do really reflected everything. I think you've written, and others have written about more pressure on new and more pressure on the resi side of the business. And obviously, that's been reflected in more numbers than just ours, and I think it's pretty well understood. Very kind of positive on re-roofing as we look out. And we kind of bifurcate this into a near-term look at what re-roofing is doing. But in the long term, all those roofs that we've seen, and we've talked about this before that are put on in the 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, these all come back at a higher price and have to be re-roofed within 20 years. So the outlook for Q4 has been positive across the board. Obviously, we talked about the impact of what weather can do, and there can be some impact on the margins. And then going into 2025. I was actually surprised that the kind of initial indicators were positive, both on return to volume. And I think, again, I spoke to the uncertainty now and the macroeconomic conditions that are here. Uncertainty, people being concerned. But the 2025 looked more positive. And then surprisingly, there was some positive expectation around price that would be a positive as we headed into 2025. So early days, right? These are projections. This is across a wide group of contractors, but I think good news on that commercial side. Yes. And Sue, before I get to inventories, you asked about MTL and what's happening. MTL continues to make great strides to integrate into the specifications at CCM. As always, a reminder, MTL has patents and things like this, and we're bringing those into our warranty. We're bringing our sales force teams together. I mean it's only been about six months but we're getting good traction there. We're seeing places where even Henry now is getting into the game where we will bid on a national chain, and we'll suddenly see that Henry might be in there and they're bringing MTL in or they're bringing CCM or vice versa. So there's really good synergies there. And I'm really pleased with how quickly Brian and his team have integrated and really started to push that whole idea of the building envelope platform that we want. On inventory, as you know, inventory turns have been better. We're fine. Our deliveries continue to increase in terms of on-time delivery rate. It's always been good, but it has gotten better as we moved through the quarter. And that's OTD to promise and then first-time fill rate. So I think we continue to have pretty good service, and it continues to get better in the quarter. You bet. Thank you so much. Good afternoon, David. Well, I think when we look at additions, maybe we take it into two different groups. We look at the -- our big -- the big three that -- us and our two big competitors have been here for a long time and use it as part of an integrated system. I mean we look at the re-roofing volumes over the coming years. We look at North America, getting some reshoring. We look at what we're doing with the need for energy efficiency, I think we'll be fine with what's been added. We do have others that have announced they're going to come in. I think this is an interesting statement. I think it's going to be polyiso in the market, but it's not the same type of capacity, as I would say, out of those players that have a fully warrantied system, national coverage, training centers tying it together with -- as I just mentioned to Sue, bringing in the metal and that kind of stuff. So we still are looking to be the provider of the building envelope solution. We're looking to add pieces like Plasti-Fab, which is an insulation company, obviously. And so I think there's been some capacity added and -- or at least talked about being added, and I don't understand how that might integrate into the markets we serve. We've had this happen before, I think, three years ago, maybe four years ago, we had a competitor from Canada come down and put a facility in Maryland, and it was a TPO and polyiso facility. And I think at the time, we'd had some questions around what's that going to do to the market. Obviously, we don't ever talk about that on our calls, and I would say the impact was negligible. So obviously, there's a lot more to being in this building envelope business than just showing up with a TPO line and a polyiso line. While that's a great start, I'm sure, for someone. We've got a lot of years of relationships and other things. Again, I like to think about Mehul and Frank talks about this too, VPTech's a great idea. It's not just having a piece of Blueskin or the vapor barrier, the EPS or the board, it's putting them all together and then selling through a highly talented sales network architects and contractors and builders. And so I think we're good. I think we've got a great outlook for North American construction markets. And so I think what we've added while seems to be quite a bit compared to what we're used to. I think we'll be okay with it. Yes. I think we had talked about MDI for the year being a little bit down. I know our TPO resins were a little bit up. EPDM resins -- or I should say polymers, down. So when we look overall, that's where we're getting to. Some savings that -- those that are down are overwhelming it. But for the most part, it's been stable through the year as much as we expected. I think some of it obviously depends on demand. And in the resi markets, obviously, has been down. But overall, relatively stable. Yes. When we looked at it, we try to break it into something that we all could -- there's a lot of moving parts. But basically, about a third of that was the continued deterioration in the resi markets. Both the resi, new and the R&R were both down about mid-single digits. Obviously, I'll say but you already know it, it's interest rates, affordability, election uncertainty. And then we had a little bit of an impact from the spray foam side of the business where a little bit of irrational pricing from some competitors that had a bit of an impact. But let's say that made up a third. And then the second third really was the investments and maybe I'll let Mehul go into what those investments were. He's our residential -- or I should say, CWT expert. Thanks, David Good afternoon, Bryan. Yes. Well, I think you've got a lot of really positive things. I mean, Mehul mentioned a couple of them. We've obviously expanded our retail channel. That was a great synergy that we don't build into the $30 million of synergies that we had in the Henry deal that came as a bonus. So the expansion into the retail channel has been good. We've talked about some of the different products, like I mentioned, the UltraTouch denim insulation. We've got some other projects that are going on. So I like that, Frank's VPTech, really, this [Technical Difficulty] economy and this affordability. I think a couple of interest rate cuts that will be needed will help. We've got to get people moving again, that affordability is an issue. We do know there's backlog in housing stock. So let's see that happen. CapEx gets deployed. So I think that as well as CapEx, and we haven't talked about it much on this call, but we did invest a lot into automation into CWT, things like auto fill, taking really labor out of the equation, automating that and increasing both the quality, reducing the waste and increasing the efficiency of our factories and Frank's done a nice job there. So again, to me, when we look at the quarter and we think about that one-third, two-thirds, I think, that one-third in the beginning, while it may not have been as impactful as these investments. Obviously, if the volume is there to run through it, the incrementals have been pretty good, and we were on a good pace to do that before we saw that further deterioration. So we look for this rebound in the resi and repair and remodel markets, and I think it will have a -- it will be there. Whether it happens in the first quarter, or not, I think I would look more towards the second half of the year, but we're confident it'll be there. No. Not on -- I assume you're talking on the CCM side. Yes. Yes. And I think it's been pretty -- I wouldn't say it's widely disseminated. But I think for pricing, we're seeing relative stability. I mean, I think back to a few years ago, when there was a -- raw materials will go down and we would just see pricing tied to raw materials. And I think as we pushed price discipline and as we push price to value. It's been pretty good to see our competitors investing in and new factories investing in innovation, investing in their sales teams and really ensuring that they get paid for those investments they're making. So again, I think just what we got -- as I said earlier in the call, what we got out of our survey was relatively stable pricing environment throughout the year. I think Kevin had said at the beginning of the year, we would probably be down 2% for the year, and I think we're going to be pretty close to that despite all the issues that have gone on through the year. And then I think going into 2025, the feedback was that there might be some upside to pricing from our survey. So we'll see how that plays out, but that is a good thing when our contractor base and our other [indiscernible] our value chain are thinking like that. You bet. Thank you. Yes. I think when we look at each segment, it's been pretty good, as Mehul said, I mean, relative to what our expectations were and coming into the year and then even in the second quarter. And I really don't think we can underestimate the impact of the residential markets, the affordability, the fact that people aren't moving. And I think those -- I think earlier in the year, we had a lot of talk about even three interest rate cuts and then we got one, and that was it. And I think that kind of has helped -- or not helped, but it hurt people because they're saying, well, maybe I'll stick around and wait and see if things get better in 2025. So why act now when I could maybe do it later. And then I think the bigger impact from a product line perspective has just been probably a little more deterioration in spray foam than we thought in that one segment. And again, that's a tough one. It's a very compelling market. It's got a lot of energy efficiency benefits to it. It's a much better product from an R-value perspective. From a vapor barrier perspective, we're seeing a wide adoption in homebuilding, the sound deadening benefits. It's a great product, but we've had some industry changes over the last five years where there's been acquisitions by one group and some regional players that have maybe taken some different actions. And so pricing has been a little bit worse there than we thought. And I'd say that would be the one thing that -- or those two things are the things that really impacted that CWT pricing in the third quarter and looking into the fourth. Thanks, Garik. Thanks, everybody. This concludes the third quarter call for Carlisle. Thanks for the participation. Thanks for the great questions. Look forward to speaking with you all on our next call. Thank you."

At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on the 24th of July 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mehul Patel, Carlisle's Vice President of Investor Relations.\nMehul Patel: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Carlisle's second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm Mehul Patel, Head of Investor Relations for Carlisle. We released our second quarter 2024 financial results today and you can find both our press release and the presentation for today's call in the Investor Relations section of our website. On the call with me today are Chris Koch, our Board Chair, President and CEO; along with Kevin Zdimal, our CFO. Today's call will begin with Chris. He will provide highlights of our second quarter results and accomplishments, followed by Kevin, who will provide an overview on our financial performance and an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2024. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the line for questions. But before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our press release and SEC filings. As Carlisle provides non-GAAP financial information, we provided reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and in the appendix of our presentation materials which are available on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris.\nChristian Koch: Thank you, Mehul. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Carlisle's second quarter 2024 earnings call. To start, I'd like to direct your attention to Slide 3 of the presentation. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding performance, reflecting the continued success of the Carlisle story. The underlying attributes of this story have been bolstered by the completion of our pivot to a pure-play building products company this year and reinforces underlying themes and strategies we outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy launched this past December. We are pleased to see that the transformation of Carlisle since the introduction of Vision 2025 continues with success and confirms the path we've been on remains the right one for all our stakeholders. In the second quarter, we delivered sales of $1.5 billion, representing double-digit growth, up 11% on a year-over-year basis. The CCM and CWT businesses continued to build on their first quarter performance of driving improved profitability, supported by pent-up re-roofing demand, continued discipline on price and delivering on operational efficiencies gained through the Carlisle operating system. The combination of these key drivers translated into a record bottom line performance for Carlisle with adjusted EPS up 33% to $6.24 and adjusted EBITDA margin expanding 220 basis points year-over-year to a record 28.8%. CCM delivered an impressive quarter with 15% revenue growth and 220 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, driven by strong re-roofing demand, which I previously mentioned, solid contractor backlogs and the benefit of inventory normalization in the channel. As we had discussed when we entered 2024, we expected to see a year-over-year benefit of approximately $125 million of sales improvement from inventory normalization in the second quarter, and that estimate was on the mark. As a reminder, inventory normalization also positively affected our first quarter of 2024 by $200 million and we project that inventory normalization will impact the third quarter positively by $50 million. CWT also performed well, showcasing its building earnings power. CWT delivered a 22.5% adjusted EBITDA margin on organic sales that were down approximately 1% as integration synergies and benefits from COS helped offset investments in growth initiatives and more difficult residential end markets. We are very pleased to see that CWT continues to have their sights set on the delivering of their aspirational goal of 30% EBITDA returns by 2030. During the quarter, we continued to make excellent progress on our Vision 2030 goals. A key milestone was the completion of our sale of CIT to Amphenol Corporation for approximately $2 billion. This sale marks the successful culmination of our strategic pivot to a pure-play building products company, which allows us to continue to focus on delivering superior capital returns, keeps our management attention on a more focused portfolio, and provides a clearer picture of how value is created for our shareholders. We also completed our acquisition of MTL in May. As a reminder, MTL is a Wisconsin-based specialty manufacturer of high-performance metal edge and wall systems. This acquisition positions Carlisle as an industry leader in the $4 billion architectural metal category of 2024. We are extremely pleased that in addition to a great acquisition in MTL, we were also able to strengthen our architectural metals platform through consolidating the team under Tony Mallinger, MTL's President. We look forward to supporting Tony and the team as they continue to drive success in our architectural metals business. Continuing with the theme of driving future growth, we recently announced plans for a $45 million investment in a state-of-the-art research and innovation center in Carlisle, PA. This expansion will provide additional resources necessary for the next stage of our innovation journey. The investment will support our Vision 2030 objective to accelerate our innovation in areas of energy efficiency, labor saving solutions and integrated systems. Expanding our R&D center in Carlisle is a key initiative to help us achieve our goal of generating 25% of revenues from new products introduced within five years by 2030. Furthermore, we maintained our focus on returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in quarter two. During the quarter, we executed $550 million of share repurchases. This is consistent with our planned goal of $1.4 billion of share repurchases for 2024. We also distributed over $40 million in dividends. These actions reflect our ongoing commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in Carlisle's future growth prospects. Turning to CWT. In the residential markets, homebuyer demand continues to experience affordability headwinds. Higher interest rates have kept buyers on the sidelines and changes in consumer spending are negatively affecting repair and remodel. However, with our focus on enhancing the Carlisle experience, bringing new products to market and especially in our retail home center channel by continuing to drive COS through our business and by implementing price-to-value approach, we expect to continue to grow CWT EBITDA margins towards our goal of 30%. To close out Slide 3, I would like to announce that we are raising our full year 2024 outlook by coupling our strong first half results with our previous projections for the second half of 2024 and the addition of MTL as of May 2024. We have strong confidence that the remainder of the 2024 construction season will continue the trends we have experienced in the first and second quarters of this year. We now expect revenue to grow approximately 12%, up from approximately 10% previously and adjusted EBITDA margin to expand approximately 150 basis points, up from over 100 basis points previously. Now please turn to Slide 4 as I discuss our Vision 2030 value creation drivers and targets. Under Vision 2030, we are creating value for our shareholders through our portfolio of high-performing building envelope businesses that offer innovative, energy efficient and labor-saving solutions for our customers, coupled with our goals of driving above-market growth, delivering consistent price and cost leadership and operating with a relentless focus on customer service and flawless execution through COS. As a reminder, Vision 2030 focuses on six key pillars. The first is the Carlisle Operating System. Under Vision 2030, we will continue to drive our continuous improvement culture through the consistent application of COS across every function in the enterprise with the goal to drive savings of 1% to 2% of sales annually through operational efficiencies. Second is the Carlisle Experience. The Carlisle Experience has established us as a premium brand with a recognized value proposition backed by high-quality products and exceptional service. Our commitment to our customers is to ensure we deliver the right products at the right place and at the right time. We understand that we win with customers through exceptional service and labor-savings efficiencies. Third is Innovation. We plan to increase our spend on R&D to 3% of sales by 2030 to accelerate the creation of new products and solutions that add value to our customers through advancements in sustainability, energy savings and labor efficiency. Fourth is M&A. We will expand in existing and adjacent categories that allow us to enhance our building envelope portfolio. As a reminder, our three criteria for acquisitions are, one, an embedded organic growth story; two, hard cost synergies; and three, a talented management team. When completed with our Carlisle integration playbook, we believe we have a competitive advantage in M&A. Fifth is a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Ultimately, we work for our shareholders and in line with our track record, we will continue to invest our cash responsibly into the highest ROIC opportunities. And lastly and perhaps most importantly, our sixth goal is attracting and retaining top performers to ensure that we have the best talent to execute our strategic initiatives and drive above-market growth. The execution of Vision 2030 aims to drive superior shareholder returns and position Carlisle as a premier investment in the building product sector. We expect by 2030 to deliver $40 of EPS, deliver over 25% ROIC and generate free cash flow margins in excess of 15%. Turning to Slide 5, let me spend a few minutes discussing our latest acquisition, MTL. We were pleased to close on our acquisition of MTL during the second quarter, adding a tremendous set of assets that provide innovative high-performance metal edge and wall systems. This addition of MTL aligns perfectly with our Vision 2030 strategy and meets our acquisition criteria. By deploying our Carlisle integration playbook at MTL, we are on track to exceed the $13 million of synergies we announced in May. We now expect to deliver $20 million of annual synergies in year three. Another example of the effectiveness of Carlisle's integration playbook was in the Henry acquisition, where we delivered over $50 million of synergies in year three compared to the $30 million of synergies initially announced. Now please turn to Slide 6. And I'll highlight a few examples of innovation and work at Carlisle. As I've mentioned, our Vision 2030 strategy includes new key initiatives such as an increased emphasis on innovation to further unlock the full potential of our pure-play building products portfolio. By investing in R&D and accelerating new product development, we aim to expand our competitive moat, deliver additional value to our customers, and augment our financial results with enhancements to our products at higher price points. Our goal is to increase our R&D spend to 3% of sales and grow the contribution from new products introduced in the last five years to 25% of sales, which represents a significant potential revenue lift. Over the last 18 months, we've launched over 25 new products, including several recent introductions to capture the market opportunities presented by the energy efficient labor-savings and integrated solutions trends highlighted in our Vision 2030 strategy. One such product is our new Ready Flash technology, which allows commercial roofing applicators to maintain optimal productivity in various temperature conditions by adjusting the adhesive setup time using either the light or dark facer side of the rigid insulation board. Our customer trials have demonstrated that the Dark Ready Flash facer can provide up to four times faster adhesive flash-off than a standard light facer with no sacrifice in performance. Another example is Carlisle's patented SeamShield Technology for our Sure-Weld TPO membranes in the commercial roofing market. This innovative feature provides an easy-to-remove protective film on the top and bottom seam areas, reducing cleaning time by 70%, while increasing weld strength by 10%. Additionally, we recently introduced Henry Blueskin VPTech, an integrated panel that includes a weather resistive barrier, continuous insulation and a seamed ceiling in a single panel. In trials with independent contractors, Blueskin VPTech installed 30% faster compared to traditional methods, saving both time and labor cost. It also improves a building's energy efficiency by reducing air leakage and enhancing thermal performance. These three products are patented or patent-pending and together with our other new product launches represent a significant incremental sales opportunity at higher margins. As we continue to execute our Vision 2030 strategy, we remain committed to investing in R&D and accelerating the introduction of innovative products that drive energy efficiency, labor savings and superior performance for our customers. Please turn to Slide 7. Before I hand it over to Kevin, I wanted to quickly highlight that we recently released Carlisle's 2023 Sustainability Report. The report contains detailed information, including clear examples of how our products reduce carbon footprint in buildings, how we reduce emissions in our operations and how we plan to reduce waste to landfills. It also will give the reader our latest progress on GHG emission reductions and our progress towards zero emissions by 2050. In conclusion, I'm extremely proud of our team's performance in the first half of 2024. Our ability to produce strong results in a dynamic environment demonstrates the resilience of our business model, our strategic market positioning and the disciplined execution of our Vision 2030 strategy. As we move forward with Vision 2030, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the positive fundamentals in our businesses and deliver profitable long-term growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details. Kevin?\nKevin Zdimal: Thank you, Chris. Our second quarter financial results continue to demonstrate Carlisle's strength and the effective execution on our strategic initiatives. As shown on Slide 8, we delivered a strong second quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We grew sales to $1.5 billion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by the normalization of inventory levels in our channels, a solid start to the construction season and robust re-roofing activity. We leveraged our top-line performance to expand adjusted EBITDA margin by 220 basis points to a record 28.8%. Furthermore, we grew adjusted EPS by 33% to $6.24, reflecting the strong operating results, margin expansion and the benefit of our ongoing share repurchase program. Looking at our segment highlights, starting with CCM on Slide 9. CCM delivered second quarter revenues of $1.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year, reflecting strong re-roofing activity, the benefit of inventory normalization and the acquisition of MTL. Organic revenue increased 13%. CCM's adjusted EBITDA increased 23% year-over-year to $364 million and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded an impressive 220 basis points to 33.4%, reflecting volume leverage on the strong sales growth, favorable raw materials and continued operational improvements driven by COS. Moving to Slide 10. Revenues at CWT were up 1% year-over-year to $362 million, driven by higher volumes and the benefit from the acquisition of Polar Industries, partially offset by lower pricing. CWT's adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 1% year-over-year to $81 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was stable year-over-year at 22.5% as benefits from the Henry integration and operating efficiencies helped offset ongoing growth investments. For your reference, Slide 11 provides a year-over-year second quarter adjusted EPS bridge. Moving to Slides 12 through 14, operating cash flow from continuing operations for the six months of 2024 was $333 million, up $61 million year-over-year, reflecting our earnings growth and disciplined working capital management. We invested $45 million in capital expenditures. Free cash flow was $288 million, up $73 million year-over-year. We remain on pace for a free cash flow margin of over 15% for the full year 2024. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. The strong liquidity position provides us with ample flexibility to continue investing in our businesses, while also returning capital to shareholders. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.4 times, which was positively impacted by the cash proceeds we received from the sale of CIT. We are already making significant progress against the capital allocation goals outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy. We are doing so by reinvesting in our high ROIC building product businesses through continued investment and growth CapEx evidenced by our recent announcement for a $45 million investment into our state-of-the-art research and innovation center. We continue to demonstrate our conviction in our strategy and commitment to returning capital to shareholders through dividends, including $40 million in dividends paid and repurchasing $550 million of shares during the second quarter of 2024. Since the inception of our program, we have repurchased over 20 million of our shares, reducing our diluted share count by more than 26%. We are also making synergistic acquisitions that will deliver significant opportunities for value creation such as our recently closed acquisition of MTL. These actions are collectively aligned with our disciplined capital allocation framework, which forms an integral part of our goals to deliver ROIC in excess of 25% and ultimately reaching $40 plus of adjusted EPS by 2030. Following the repurchase of $550 million of shares during the second quarter, we have 5.6 million shares remaining under our share repurchase program. Our financial strength is built upon a firm foundation, a pristine balance sheet and a disciplined approach to managing leverage. This thoughtful capital structure empowers us to strategically deploy resources with a returns oriented mindset. With a significant liquidity position of nearly $2.7 billion, now including the CIT proceeds, we are ready to seize meaningful opportunities as they emerge, unlocking further value for our stakeholders in both the near and long-term. Overall, we are confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth and significant value creation for our shareholders for years to come. Now moving to our full year financial outlook on Slide 15. As Chris previously noted, we are raising our full year 2024 outlook for revenue to grow approximately 12% over the prior year. This increase in outlook is driven by a combination of our solid second quarter results via acquisition of MTL and maintaining our previous outlook for the second half of 2024. Leveraging the additional revenue through the Carlisle Operating System, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by approximately 150 basis points as compared to our previous guidance of expanding margins by at least 100 basis points. As such, we continue to expect double-digit EPS growth in 2024. Additionally, we maintain our expectation to deliver free cash flow margins of at least 15% and ROIC in excess of 25%. This is directly aligned with the objectives outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy and we are experiencing an excellent start towards our 2030 goal of $40 plus of adjusted EPS. Looking at the components of the outlook. For CCM, we now expect year-over-year revenue to grow approximately 15% in 2024. The drivers for the 15% growth are tailwinds from the return to normalization and order patterns that was absent during 2023 due to destocking, solid end market demand driven by pent-up re-roofing activity and the acquisition of MTL more than offsetting a slight decline in year-over-year pricing. For CWT, we now expect revenue to grow approximately 3% in 2024 from strong sales execution on key growth initiatives as well as modest end market growth more than offsetting any declines in year-over-year pricing. In summary, second quarter revenue was up 11% and adjusted EBITDA was up 220 basis points to a record 28.8%. Based on the strong second quarter results and the successful start to the MTL acquisition, we are raising our full year outlook to revenue of approximately 12% and approximately 150 basis points expansion of EBITDA margins. With that I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks.\nChristian Koch: Thank you, Kevin. In conclusion, we are extremely pleased with our performance in the first half of 2024. As we look towards the second half, we believe the significant positive trends exhibited in the second quarter will carry over into the third quarter and that belief is embedded in our raising of expectations for 2024. In addition, I want to emphasize our unwavering dedication to Carlisle's strategic trajectory under Vision 2030. As we progress towards 2030, our focus on innovative, energy efficient, and labor-saving systems and solutions, the Carlisle Experience and flawless execution within our businesses positions us to outpace market growth and consequently deliver outstanding outcomes for all stakeholders. The pivot of our company to a building products portfolio in tandem with our robust free cash flow generation and significant investment in innovation sets the stage for us to unlock significant additional value for our shareholders as we move forward. I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to convey my appreciation to each and every member of the Carlisle team. The remarkable achievements we've witnessed this quarter and the momentum we've built for 2024 are a testament to the dedication and skill of our talented employees. With Vision 2030 serving as the roadmap for our success, I remain incredibly optimistic about Carlisle's future. Thank you once again for your support. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. Please go ahead, sir.\nTimothy Wojs: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Nice job.\nChristian Koch: Good afternoon. Thank you.\nTimothy Wojs: Maybe just to start off, Chris, I guess, obviously you guys are comping some of the destocking last year. I'm kind of backing into kind of the underlying market maybe in Q2 and the back half -- the front half of the year kind of being up maybe like 3% to 4%. So I guess a) is that kind of what you're seeing? And b) as you know kind of look to the back half. What kind of gives you the confidence either from talking with contractors or just kind of order rates that type of market growth rate can continue?\nChristian Koch: Tim, I think you're right on the first half and the first half was pretty much as we predicted. I think we did a good job, Kevin and the team of indicator of defining the impact of the restocking, I'll call it event with the lack of destocking. And so that was good that was right on the mark. I think we had also done some of our work and this gets with a confidence issue. I've done some of our own independent work, we can talk about that later around surveys and that really gave us some insight that we didn't have two years ago. And I think we've talked about that before how we went on did some of our own independent work after the destocking got us a little bit off guard a couple of quarters ago. And we're seeing the same things going in the third quarter that we saw in the second quarter. CCM was a little bit better. At the end of the second quarter really drivers around mix. I think we had a better operating environment. We added MTL into that positive momentum there. If you look at CWT, while sales weren't probably what everybody would hope for, I think, given the context of the resi markets and the impact on R&R and that was probably about what we expected. And what I was excited about there was in our retail channel, CWT and the Henry team introduced a couple of new products into the retail channel that really took off and helped. And so I think we look at those things. We continue to have new products introduced. We continue to -- we actually had a record month on the margin side on a record quarter, excuse me, on COS. And so we look at operational efficiency, we look at the raw material situation, we look at the demand situation across the board. We just look at Q3 and think unless there's a weather event or we see something deteriorating the economy, the trends should -- they all look like they're going to continue into the third quarter and then we'll look to the fourth quarter and see what kind of weather we get as we end the year and how many days on the roof we get as we get into November in that.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the re-roofing piece, when you guys talk about pent-up demand, are you really referring to kind of the EchoBoom from like the late '90s and the mid-2000s in terms of like that, that kind of pent-up demand or above average demand for re-roofing or is it kind of a couple of years ago where the industry just had to reprioritize or prioritize the new construction market and that kind of pushed re-roofing demand kind of to the right and that's kind of hitting now. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for what visibility you have to that backlog?\nChristian Koch: Yeah. And it's something we talked about before how and I know this chart isn't great. We've had it out there for a while where increasing new construction 20 years ago is really laying in that foundation of re-roofing that's going to occur. So as you say and we've talked about this for a while, the constrained labor markets, obviously, that's a big factor in driving our innovation is that we forecast continued constrained labor markets. And so I think you accurately set it up, which is really new construction if it's better, then you're going to be allocating labor to that and re-roofing might have a little bit of a lag. And then when we had COVID and we had some time where roofs weren't being probably addressed as quickly as they could have been, again, it just gets into that backlog. And so that's really what is supporting that. I think you referenced actually in your report you issued today on commercial around architectural firm backlog, still healthy at about 6.4 months and AIA highlighted that and I think that's kind of consistent with what we're seeing.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. And if I could sneak one last one in. Just it's hard for us to tell from the outside, but I guess, how big is the data center market for Carlisle? I mean, obviously, they're putting roofs on just like any other building. And do you get a content benefit from a data center relative to a kind of run-of-the-mill type building? I'm just thinking with all the heating and cooling that needs to happen in data centers, if there's any sort of like additional polyiso or anything like that you need.\nChristian Koch: Right. So we did see data centers, obviously, with the increase in the data consumption and the things like this. We've seen -- we've been seeing this build is our part of our overall sales, it's a small piece. It is growing. We're seeing more interest in it. And not just in areas like Phoenix where we've seen a lot of data center, excuse me, data center and talk about construction in that, but also around the country. And so it's getting our attention. We have a team focused on it and it really gets to the point that you're making is, not that it's a big part of it, but it is a nice content piece because of what you talked about. You really need to have a very secure building envelope, energy efficiency is prime there as well as moisture control and other things. So it's one of the most sophisticated roofs we would put down and I think when you think about that and translate it into product content, it's a good roof for Carlisle.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay, great. Thank you for the time and we look on the back half.\nChristian Koch: All right. Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.\nChristian Koch: Hi, Susan.\nSusan Maklari: Hi, everyone. My first question is maybe going back to roofing for a bit. It sounds like the channel inventories are still fairly lean as we think about the second half of this year. Can you talk a bit about how you are positioning the business relative to that? And anything that you're doing to sort of ensure that you can maintain service levels and market share, all those key dynamics to Vision 2030 as you think about the potential for a restock or a change in the demand over the next couple of quarters?\nChristian Koch: Right. I think it was last quarter we said that inventory might be on the historically lighter side. I think that's true. There wasn't a big load in this year. Obviously, you're aware of this, people were burned on the inventory. We had to destock. Obviously we're through that. I think coming into this year, we didn't expect a big load in. And to your point on being prepared, we actually were prepared and had -- and actually built a little bit more in the first quarter, to be sure we could address customer needs with having lower inventory through the channel. So I don't see that inventory picking up, Susan, as we go into the third quarter because we're past the peak of the construction season. So why would you load in inventory now? Historically, people haven't done that. They manage it more carefully in the back half of the year. And then as we look at 2025, we'll do some more assessment. But that would be the time when traditionally, we would have built inventory in the winter months to begin to address that load in, in the spring. And so we'll look at that. But that's one way we do it. The other way is, as I said, we had a record COS quarter in the second quarter. And I think you can think of that just simply in terms of increasing the efficiency of our operations. And we continue to invest in capital, we continue to invest in automation. We're starting to roll out AI in different places. One of them is S&OP planning, demand management, things like that. To make ourselves more efficient and to really be able to respond more quickly to any surges in inventory we've had. But to this point, we've handled the year pretty well. I think we're well-positioned on inventory and production for the third quarter. And obviously we'll be right there if there's a good weather fourth quarter that we need to continue to meet that demand. So I think we're in a good position for this year and then even into 2025.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. That's great color, Chris. Thank you. And then you mentioned the $45 million investment that you're making in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Can you talk a bit more about how we should think about those costs coming through overtime as you think about ramping up that R&D spend to towards that 3% target that you have? And what that could mean in terms of mix shift as we start to think about perhaps '25 and the forward years in there, how that perhaps could move and what that will mean to result?\nKevin Zdimal: The cost side, the $45 million investment, that's going to be over a two year period and will be more back end loaded on it as we're getting permits and getting everything in place and then getting the building going and putting the labs in. And then as far as, yeah, the outcome of that project, obviously, we'll be a little bit further out on when the new products come in. But certainly we have a full pipeline of products that we're currently working on. We have the three different buckets that we work on in our R&D and the first one is the maintenance where we're making improvements. It's really taking costs out of our products and that's going very well, a lot in that pipeline. Then the evolutionary products, some of that Chris pointed out on in his remarks on this call and that's a part that we're going to see the immediate impact where we start seeing some of that right now into '25, '26 just continue to ramp. So that's really the focus on our current new products, the new R&D center, that's going to be when we start seeing some more of the transformational R&D that we've been working on. And that's more in the three to five year bucket.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. That's helpful color. Thank you both and good luck with everything.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Susan.\nKevin Zdimal: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nGarik Shmois: Hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could provide an update on price cost. I think you're looking for it to be positive $20 million for the year. That was raised after the first quarter. Is that still a good assumption and maybe also talk to how that looked in the second quarter as well?\nKevin Zdimal: Yes, certainly, as we came into the year, we were expecting about really flat for the year. And then in the first quarter call, as you mentioned, we took that up to a $20 million positive. And then as we've moved on through the year, we've seen an uptick in MDI that's hitting raw materials a little bit. And then CWT has given up a little bit of price in one of their segments. And so those are bringing us back to looking at pretty much flat for the year is what we're looking at. If you looked at it by segment, the CCM is pretty much flat throughout all four quarters. So no real impact. Last quarter, we talked about CWP being a positive $10 million in the first quarter. Second quarter for CWT was flat and then the third and fourth quarter will probably be both down about $5 million on the price cost side at CWT.\nGarik Shmois: Great. That's helpful. I wanted to follow-up on the pricing comment. You did implement a price increase in the second quarter in CCM. I'm just wondering how that was accepted by your customers and maybe just a little bit more color on how pricing moved sequentially in the second quarter.\nChristian Koch: Hey, Garik, I'll take part of it, Kevin can talk about the sequential stuff. When we entered the year and even I think when we saw that pricing announcement from one of our competitors and again, we were happy they were attempting to show their price to value there. And they also thought I think my sense was that raw materials were rising. So a good call there because as Kevin just mentioned, MDI is getting a little higher, labor costs were going up. We said that, that wasn't really going to have much of an impact in '24 for us, maybe a little bit, I think in the fourth quarter, if I'm right, Kevin can correct me if I'm wrong. So what we saw through the quarter is we did actually see places where we had implemented that pricing increase and we were getting some traction. I would say overall though the response in the broader markets was not to have a lot of conviction over that and just to continue to extend, I wouldn't say it was a reduction, it was just an extension of current terms further into the year. And ultimately, when you keep extending a price increase implementation date, you run out of room on the year and its ability to be effective. So I think overall, not only for us, but as we projected, it wouldn't have much impact. I think in the industry, it won't have much impact all. So it will be something that I think how to labor costs, how to supply chain costs, things like that go into the third and fourth quarter and then do you see some ability by the industry to build a firmer as we enter 2025.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. No, I appreciate the color. I guess my last question is just on the MTL acquisition. You raised the EPS accretion guidance just a couple of months into ownership. Just wondering what you're seeing so early on that gave you the confidence to do that.\nChristian Koch: Well, when we come in, we have this projection that we do we try to be good about it. We don't get as much insight as we do after we own the company. But I think just like with Henry, we've got a great leadership team. Frank Ready was the Henry leader that really embraced our integration playbook. And that's a key thing is how does the team embrace the integration playbook because some of that the synergies identified and the actual identification of new synergies comes as the team gets together and they -- and they pursue these things either passionately or not passionately. In both cases, Henry and MTL leadership has just hit the ground running, fully bought into COS, fully bought into the integration playbook. And as a result, we've accelerated, I think some of the things we thought were there. And then we've also identified some new opportunities for synergy. And I think it's worthwhile to say most of the stuff that we take action on initially are cost synergies. And then as you start to get the groups together, you start thinking about sales synergies and how you can bring things together. So I think it's going really well. That management team and the teams at Drexel and at Petersen are just doing a great job. And that's why we feel confident in raising the synergies, the accretion. And I actually think there's even upside to the $20 million we put out as our new target for synergies. So more of that as we get through the year.\nGarik Shmois: All right. Sounds good. Thanks again and best of luck.\nChristian Koch: You bet. Thank you, Garik.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBryan Blair: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.\nChristian Koch: Hey, Bryan.\nBryan Blair: Sorry if I missed some of this detail, just to level set on revised sales guidance. What's now baked-in price and volume respectively for CCM and CWT? It seems like overall organic outlook is largely unchanged. CCM a bit better, CWT dials back, et cetera. Just curious about the moving parts.\nKevin Zdimal: Yeah. You summed it up pretty well there. Just overall as we look at the full year going into this quarter, we had said up low double-digits for CCM, so around 12%. We raised that to approximately 15%. So the increase 2% of it is from the MTL acquisition. Then the other 1% would really be the additional volume that we picked up in the second quarter. And then we're expecting -- we haven't made any changes to the second half of the year. We're maintaining what the outlook we provided in the last earnings call.\nBryan Blair: Understood. Appreciate the clarification. And to follow-up on MTL, maybe offer a little more detail on the MTL profile, synergistic fit with Drexel and Petersen and how your team is thinking about longer-term margin potential? And it sounds like the step-up to $20 million in deal synergies is going to ramp profitability pretty quickly there.\nKevin Zdimal: I think that MTL of longer-term, Bryan, is along the lines of CCM. I mean, we'd for sure be disappointed if we didn't see over the next few years getting into the mid-30s. And I think we're going to be aspirational to somewhere closer to 40. So I know that's a big game for the team, but I really do think we finally have the right approach. We've got the right volume, we've got the right platform across the profiles, edge metals, the fabrication, the resi, the non-resi building panels, things like that to really start to get some leverage out of this entire platform that we didn't have before. So, yeah, I would think it would continue to grow. Again, let's target mid-30s and see if we can get to 40.\nBryan Blair: Very impressive. And one last one, if I may, sticking with M&A. Any color you can offer on your current deal pipeline and potential or likelihood of other strategic deals in the foreseeable future. MTL is seemingly a homerun tons of dry powder. We know that your team is always aggressive in terms of share repurchases. Curious on the M&A side of things.\nChristian Koch: Yeah. The M&A pipeline is actually quite good. But I think you're probably aware of what's said publicly around whether it's the strategics and private equity wanting to have some exits. And we see that I think we're still a little bit -- getting a little bit of, I'd say, tension around this idea that some people might think it's better to wait and have a higher valuation as a seller thinking that rate cuts will come in '25 will be better. And so if I'm going to sell, I want a higher number and then buyers obviously are saying, well, yeah, there's a lot of uncertainty there and I think we want to be compensated for that uncertainty. So the pipeline is good. I think it's the valuation differential that's maybe slowing things down a little bit. But as you said, we have assets, we have aspirations, we have a good strategy. We've got a clear target across all of our businesses for what would be good acquisitions. So now the question is just getting them to close. And I think Kevin and I are both optimistic that M&A will continue to be a solid part of the growth story for Carlisle. So I think we're in good shape there.\nBryan Blair: All sounds good. Thanks again.\nChristian Koch: Thanks, Bryan.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSaree Boroditsky: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for bringing us in. You've highlighted some share gain initiatives within CWT. Can you just talk more through those opportunities? And then what those add to growth, especially as we think of the second half of this year and into 2025?\nMehul Patel: Yeah. Saree, I'll take that one. It's Mehul here. So on CWT, we talked in prior calls a lot about cross-selling opportunities. We talked about Home Depot. So if you just look at the Home Depot example with the new product categories that we added into that channel, that itself is going is going home by roughly double-digits. In addition to that, we also have some pretty nice synergies around new products in waterproofing, which is gaining traction. And then Frank is putting a lot of focus on system selling across the full portfolio, which is also gaining some traction. So when you roll it all together, overall for CWT, that's adding somewhere between 3% to 4% of growth in the second half.\nSaree Boroditsky: That's super helpful. A little bit earlier in the call, you highlighted some survey work that you've done internally. Maybe just give us some color on what you've learned from those surveys and how it gives you confidence in your outlook?\nChristian Koch: Saree, I don't know, I think I thought we talked about it before on a call, maybe we had you know right after the inventory destocking in the third quarter of, let's forget the year, but anyway. We were disappointed in that as you were and other investors where there wasn't more visibility and clarity into the channel, I think, both at the contractor and the distributor level. And so we went out and we worked with the firm to create kind of a -- I don't call it proprietary, but a survey where we were looking at multiple hundreds of contractor data points in various geographies, various sized contractors and distributors. And then asking a series of questions to get around things like, are we doing on inventory levels? What are you forecasting for growth? What are you seeing in your market? And then doing a consolidation around that. And it's been a pretty effective tool for us. I think the other thing it's done for us is start to give us some greater insights into market perception of us. We put a lot of emphasis on the Carlisle Experience and so embedded in that are some questions around delivery and quality and things like that we've taken back and we've used to also help us direct some efforts in our customer experience. So it's not earth shattering. It's just something we needed to do and we feel like that direct connectivity is something we need to have. So we do it, you may think, well, we already doing that. We do it, I would say, and have multiple conversations every day with, I'm sure all of our customers. But I think this is a more formal process that was a little bit more statistically valid. So it was a good addition to the portfolio of information gathering tools we have at our disposal.\nSaree Boroditsky: I appreciate the color. Thanks.\nChristian Koch: You bet, Saree.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid MacGregor: Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking the questions. Chris, congratulations on a great quarter.\nChristian Koch: Thanks.\nDavid MacGregor: I guess I wanted to, sure, I guess I wanted to see if you could drill down into CWT a little further and just help us understand kind of the flat organic growth and it looks like you're guiding 3% for the year, but based on some comments just made, it sounds like most of that's idiosyncratic internal programs. Can you just sort of open up the residential versus the commercial side of that and talk about what's happening on each side of that and just how that plays out into the second half of the year?\nMehul Patel: Yeah. So, David, as you know the end markets for CWT, it's fairly balanced about 25% each into residential -- residential R&R, commercial new and commercial R&R. So on the residential side, we were fairly on the conservative side, overall residential on the single family side. We kind of see that in the low double-digit range. Multifamily down pretty significantly around 30%. On the commercial new side, CWT leaned more towards the institution side. So that's up in the low single range. And then on the R&R side, we're down about roughly 4%. Obviously, people are with affordability as well as lighter transactions between sellers and buyers on the residential side, there's less R&R. But you net it all together, overall, the market, we see it down or up between 1% or 2%. So pretty modest small growth there. We talked about the initiatives there. There's also a small acquisition that CWT did in late Q4. So that's going to add about one point. And then price, as Kevin mentioned, in certain categories, mainly around the insulation side, there's lower prices in the second half to the tune of 3%. So you net those together, that's how you get to the plus 3%.\nDavid MacGregor: Right. Are you confident that you're holding your share in CWT?\nMehul Patel: Yeah. Overall, we talked about share gains around some of the cross-selling themes through Home Depot as well as the waterproofing side. So we feel pretty good there. And on the insulation side, I think, there's something that's going on in the channel where we see some softness outside of the overall end market trends?\nDavid MacGregor: Great. Okay. And just as a quick follow-up. For CCM, how much of a revenue impediment was weather in the quarter if at all?\nChristian Koch: Weather?\nKevin Zdimal: Yeah, weather was minimal. And, yeah, it was very minimal. We had some puts and takes there, but overall, no impact.\nChristian Koch: A little bit of flooding at one facility I think other than that.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay, great. Thanks very much. Congratulations.\nKevin Zdimal: You bet. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten from Zelman. Please go ahead.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey, guys. A quick question on CCM pricing. I think last quarter you talked about that being down about 1% from down 2% to 3% in terms of your initial outlook for the year. Is that maybe now back to that down 2% to 3% or is that down 1% still a good number to use?\nKevin Zdimal: Yeah, that's what we were approximate one before and 1% to 2% somewhere in that range, but no higher than that.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay, got it. And then just within your CCM business, maybe if you could give us some color on the verticals, whether it's office, retail, warehouse, kind of what you're seeing. I'm sure there's some puts and takes, but what's been strong, what's been weak?\nChristian Koch: Right. No, I think when we look at across obviously the warehousing thing has been down and that's been down significantly. When I think about where we were maybe back in '22 where we were in the -- the -- I think 20-plus percent increases in warehousing and now we're probably the inverse of that, maybe a little less than that. Education has been pretty consistent over the last couple of years as a good place to be office buildings. You can imagine, it's still not great, a little bit negative. You read that in the press with what's happening there, work-from-home and all that. When we think about stores, we call stores, that's doing well. Healthcare has done well again. And then I think the one that everybody draws a lot of attention to the reshoring manufacturing actually this year has been a good add in terms of new construction. So overall a mixed bag with probably what you would have expected based upon what your M&As do on the trends.\nAdam Baumgarten: Got it. Thank you.\nChristian Koch: You bet.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Chris Koch for final closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nChristian Koch: Thank you. This then concludes the second quarter earnings call. Appreciate everybody being on the call and good questions. Look forward to speaking with all of you at our next earnings call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Kevin Zdimal",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Our second quarter financial results continue to demonstrate Carlisle's strength and the effective execution on our strategic initiatives. As shown on Slide 8, we delivered a strong second quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We grew sales to $1.5 billion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by the normalization of inventory levels in our channels, a solid start to the construction season and robust re-roofing activity. We leveraged our top-line performance to expand adjusted EBITDA margin by 220 basis points to a record 28.8%. Furthermore, we grew adjusted EPS by 33% to $6.24, reflecting the strong operating results, margin expansion and the benefit of our ongoing share repurchase program. Looking at our segment highlights, starting with CCM on Slide 9. CCM delivered second quarter revenues of $1.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year, reflecting strong re-roofing activity, the benefit of inventory normalization and the acquisition of MTL. Organic revenue increased 13%. CCM's adjusted EBITDA increased 23% year-over-year to $364 million and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded an impressive 220 basis points to 33.4%, reflecting volume leverage on the strong sales growth, favorable raw materials and continued operational improvements driven by COS. Moving to Slide 10. Revenues at CWT were up 1% year-over-year to $362 million, driven by higher volumes and the benefit from the acquisition of Polar Industries, partially offset by lower pricing. CWT's adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 1% year-over-year to $81 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was stable year-over-year at 22.5% as benefits from the Henry integration and operating efficiencies helped offset ongoing growth investments. For your reference, Slide 11 provides a year-over-year second quarter adjusted EPS bridge. Moving to Slides 12 through 14, operating cash flow from continuing operations for the six months of 2024 was $333 million, up $61 million year-over-year, reflecting our earnings growth and disciplined working capital management. We invested $45 million in capital expenditures. Free cash flow was $288 million, up $73 million year-over-year. We remain on pace for a free cash flow margin of over 15% for the full year 2024. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. The strong liquidity position provides us with ample flexibility to continue investing in our businesses, while also returning capital to shareholders. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.4 times, which was positively impacted by the cash proceeds we received from the sale of CIT. We are already making significant progress against the capital allocation goals outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy. We are doing so by reinvesting in our high ROIC building product businesses through continued investment and growth CapEx evidenced by our recent announcement for a $45 million investment into our state-of-the-art research and innovation center. We continue to demonstrate our conviction in our strategy and commitment to returning capital to shareholders through dividends, including $40 million in dividends paid and repurchasing $550 million of shares during the second quarter of 2024. Since the inception of our program, we have repurchased over 20 million of our shares, reducing our diluted share count by more than 26%. We are also making synergistic acquisitions that will deliver significant opportunities for value creation such as our recently closed acquisition of MTL. These actions are collectively aligned with our disciplined capital allocation framework, which forms an integral part of our goals to deliver ROIC in excess of 25% and ultimately reaching $40 plus of adjusted EPS by 2030. Following the repurchase of $550 million of shares during the second quarter, we have 5.6 million shares remaining under our share repurchase program. Our financial strength is built upon a firm foundation, a pristine balance sheet and a disciplined approach to managing leverage. This thoughtful capital structure empowers us to strategically deploy resources with a returns oriented mindset. With a significant liquidity position of nearly $2.7 billion, now including the CIT proceeds, we are ready to seize meaningful opportunities as they emerge, unlocking further value for our stakeholders in both the near and long-term. Overall, we are confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth and significant value creation for our shareholders for years to come. Now moving to our full year financial outlook on Slide 15. As Chris previously noted, we are raising our full year 2024 outlook for revenue to grow approximately 12% over the prior year. This increase in outlook is driven by a combination of our solid second quarter results via acquisition of MTL and maintaining our previous outlook for the second half of 2024. Leveraging the additional revenue through the Carlisle Operating System, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by approximately 150 basis points as compared to our previous guidance of expanding margins by at least 100 basis points. As such, we continue to expect double-digit EPS growth in 2024. Additionally, we maintain our expectation to deliver free cash flow margins of at least 15% and ROIC in excess of 25%. This is directly aligned with the objectives outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy and we are experiencing an excellent start towards our 2030 goal of $40 plus of adjusted EPS. Looking at the components of the outlook. For CCM, we now expect year-over-year revenue to grow approximately 15% in 2024. The drivers for the 15% growth are tailwinds from the return to normalization and order patterns that was absent during 2023 due to destocking, solid end market demand driven by pent-up re-roofing activity and the acquisition of MTL more than offsetting a slight decline in year-over-year pricing. For CWT, we now expect revenue to grow approximately 3% in 2024 from strong sales execution on key growth initiatives as well as modest end market growth more than offsetting any declines in year-over-year pricing. In summary, second quarter revenue was up 11% and adjusted EBITDA was up 220 basis points to a record 28.8%. Based on the strong second quarter results and the successful start to the MTL acquisition, we are raising our full year outlook to revenue of approximately 12% and approximately 150 basis points expansion of EBITDA margins. With that I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. The cost side, the $45 million investment, that's going to be over a two year period and will be more back end loaded on it as we're getting permits and getting everything in place and then getting the building going and putting the labs in. And then as far as, yeah, the outcome of that project, obviously, we'll be a little bit further out on when the new products come in. But certainly we have a full pipeline of products that we're currently working on. We have the three different buckets that we work on in our R&D and the first one is the maintenance where we're making improvements. It's really taking costs out of our products and that's going very well, a lot in that pipeline. Then the evolutionary products, some of that Chris pointed out on in his remarks on this call and that's a part that we're going to see the immediate impact where we start seeing some of that right now into '25, '26 just continue to ramp. So that's really the focus on our current new products, the new R&D center, that's going to be when we start seeing some more of the transformational R&D that we've been working on. And that's more in the three to five year bucket. Thank you. Yes, certainly, as we came into the year, we were expecting about really flat for the year. And then in the first quarter call, as you mentioned, we took that up to a $20 million positive. And then as we've moved on through the year, we've seen an uptick in MDI that's hitting raw materials a little bit. And then CWT has given up a little bit of price in one of their segments. And so those are bringing us back to looking at pretty much flat for the year is what we're looking at. If you looked at it by segment, the CCM is pretty much flat throughout all four quarters. So no real impact. Last quarter, we talked about CWP being a positive $10 million in the first quarter. Second quarter for CWT was flat and then the third and fourth quarter will probably be both down about $5 million on the price cost side at CWT. Yeah. You summed it up pretty well there. Just overall as we look at the full year going into this quarter, we had said up low double-digits for CCM, so around 12%. We raised that to approximately 15%. So the increase 2% of it is from the MTL acquisition. Then the other 1% would really be the additional volume that we picked up in the second quarter. And then we're expecting -- we haven't made any changes to the second half of the year. We're maintaining what the outlook we provided in the last earnings call. I think that MTL of longer-term, Bryan, is along the lines of CCM. I mean, we'd for sure be disappointed if we didn't see over the next few years getting into the mid-30s. And I think we're going to be aspirational to somewhere closer to 40. So I know that's a big game for the team, but I really do think we finally have the right approach. We've got the right volume, we've got the right platform across the profiles, edge metals, the fabrication, the resi, the non-resi building panels, things like that to really start to get some leverage out of this entire platform that we didn't have before. So, yeah, I would think it would continue to grow. Again, let's target mid-30s and see if we can get to 40. Yeah, weather was minimal. And, yeah, it was very minimal. We had some puts and takes there, but overall, no impact. You bet. Thanks, David. Yeah, that's what we were approximate one before and 1% to 2% somewhere in that range, but no higher than that."

            "name": "Christian Koch",
            "content": "Thank you, Mehul. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Carlisle's second quarter 2024 earnings call. To start, I'd like to direct your attention to Slide 3 of the presentation. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding performance, reflecting the continued success of the Carlisle story. The underlying attributes of this story have been bolstered by the completion of our pivot to a pure-play building products company this year and reinforces underlying themes and strategies we outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy launched this past December. We are pleased to see that the transformation of Carlisle since the introduction of Vision 2025 continues with success and confirms the path we've been on remains the right one for all our stakeholders. In the second quarter, we delivered sales of $1.5 billion, representing double-digit growth, up 11% on a year-over-year basis. The CCM and CWT businesses continued to build on their first quarter performance of driving improved profitability, supported by pent-up re-roofing demand, continued discipline on price and delivering on operational efficiencies gained through the Carlisle operating system. The combination of these key drivers translated into a record bottom line performance for Carlisle with adjusted EPS up 33% to $6.24 and adjusted EBITDA margin expanding 220 basis points year-over-year to a record 28.8%. CCM delivered an impressive quarter with 15% revenue growth and 220 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, driven by strong re-roofing demand, which I previously mentioned, solid contractor backlogs and the benefit of inventory normalization in the channel. As we had discussed when we entered 2024, we expected to see a year-over-year benefit of approximately $125 million of sales improvement from inventory normalization in the second quarter, and that estimate was on the mark. As a reminder, inventory normalization also positively affected our first quarter of 2024 by $200 million and we project that inventory normalization will impact the third quarter positively by $50 million. CWT also performed well, showcasing its building earnings power. CWT delivered a 22.5% adjusted EBITDA margin on organic sales that were down approximately 1% as integration synergies and benefits from COS helped offset investments in growth initiatives and more difficult residential end markets. We are very pleased to see that CWT continues to have their sights set on the delivering of their aspirational goal of 30% EBITDA returns by 2030. During the quarter, we continued to make excellent progress on our Vision 2030 goals. A key milestone was the completion of our sale of CIT to Amphenol Corporation for approximately $2 billion. This sale marks the successful culmination of our strategic pivot to a pure-play building products company, which allows us to continue to focus on delivering superior capital returns, keeps our management attention on a more focused portfolio, and provides a clearer picture of how value is created for our shareholders. We also completed our acquisition of MTL in May. As a reminder, MTL is a Wisconsin-based specialty manufacturer of high-performance metal edge and wall systems. This acquisition positions Carlisle as an industry leader in the $4 billion architectural metal category of 2024. We are extremely pleased that in addition to a great acquisition in MTL, we were also able to strengthen our architectural metals platform through consolidating the team under Tony Mallinger, MTL's President. We look forward to supporting Tony and the team as they continue to drive success in our architectural metals business. Continuing with the theme of driving future growth, we recently announced plans for a $45 million investment in a state-of-the-art research and innovation center in Carlisle, PA. This expansion will provide additional resources necessary for the next stage of our innovation journey. The investment will support our Vision 2030 objective to accelerate our innovation in areas of energy efficiency, labor saving solutions and integrated systems. Expanding our R&D center in Carlisle is a key initiative to help us achieve our goal of generating 25% of revenues from new products introduced within five years by 2030. Furthermore, we maintained our focus on returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in quarter two. During the quarter, we executed $550 million of share repurchases. This is consistent with our planned goal of $1.4 billion of share repurchases for 2024. We also distributed over $40 million in dividends. These actions reflect our ongoing commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in Carlisle's future growth prospects. Turning to CWT. In the residential markets, homebuyer demand continues to experience affordability headwinds. Higher interest rates have kept buyers on the sidelines and changes in consumer spending are negatively affecting repair and remodel. However, with our focus on enhancing the Carlisle experience, bringing new products to market and especially in our retail home center channel by continuing to drive COS through our business and by implementing price-to-value approach, we expect to continue to grow CWT EBITDA margins towards our goal of 30%. To close out Slide 3, I would like to announce that we are raising our full year 2024 outlook by coupling our strong first half results with our previous projections for the second half of 2024 and the addition of MTL as of May 2024. We have strong confidence that the remainder of the 2024 construction season will continue the trends we have experienced in the first and second quarters of this year. We now expect revenue to grow approximately 12%, up from approximately 10% previously and adjusted EBITDA margin to expand approximately 150 basis points, up from over 100 basis points previously. Now please turn to Slide 4 as I discuss our Vision 2030 value creation drivers and targets. Under Vision 2030, we are creating value for our shareholders through our portfolio of high-performing building envelope businesses that offer innovative, energy efficient and labor-saving solutions for our customers, coupled with our goals of driving above-market growth, delivering consistent price and cost leadership and operating with a relentless focus on customer service and flawless execution through COS. As a reminder, Vision 2030 focuses on six key pillars. The first is the Carlisle Operating System. Under Vision 2030, we will continue to drive our continuous improvement culture through the consistent application of COS across every function in the enterprise with the goal to drive savings of 1% to 2% of sales annually through operational efficiencies. Second is the Carlisle Experience. The Carlisle Experience has established us as a premium brand with a recognized value proposition backed by high-quality products and exceptional service. Our commitment to our customers is to ensure we deliver the right products at the right place and at the right time. We understand that we win with customers through exceptional service and labor-savings efficiencies. Third is Innovation. We plan to increase our spend on R&D to 3% of sales by 2030 to accelerate the creation of new products and solutions that add value to our customers through advancements in sustainability, energy savings and labor efficiency. Fourth is M&A. We will expand in existing and adjacent categories that allow us to enhance our building envelope portfolio. As a reminder, our three criteria for acquisitions are, one, an embedded organic growth story; two, hard cost synergies; and three, a talented management team. When completed with our Carlisle integration playbook, we believe we have a competitive advantage in M&A. Fifth is a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Ultimately, we work for our shareholders and in line with our track record, we will continue to invest our cash responsibly into the highest ROIC opportunities. And lastly and perhaps most importantly, our sixth goal is attracting and retaining top performers to ensure that we have the best talent to execute our strategic initiatives and drive above-market growth. The execution of Vision 2030 aims to drive superior shareholder returns and position Carlisle as a premier investment in the building product sector. We expect by 2030 to deliver $40 of EPS, deliver over 25% ROIC and generate free cash flow margins in excess of 15%. Turning to Slide 5, let me spend a few minutes discussing our latest acquisition, MTL. We were pleased to close on our acquisition of MTL during the second quarter, adding a tremendous set of assets that provide innovative high-performance metal edge and wall systems. This addition of MTL aligns perfectly with our Vision 2030 strategy and meets our acquisition criteria. By deploying our Carlisle integration playbook at MTL, we are on track to exceed the $13 million of synergies we announced in May. We now expect to deliver $20 million of annual synergies in year three. Another example of the effectiveness of Carlisle's integration playbook was in the Henry acquisition, where we delivered over $50 million of synergies in year three compared to the $30 million of synergies initially announced. Now please turn to Slide 6. And I'll highlight a few examples of innovation and work at Carlisle. As I've mentioned, our Vision 2030 strategy includes new key initiatives such as an increased emphasis on innovation to further unlock the full potential of our pure-play building products portfolio. By investing in R&D and accelerating new product development, we aim to expand our competitive moat, deliver additional value to our customers, and augment our financial results with enhancements to our products at higher price points. Our goal is to increase our R&D spend to 3% of sales and grow the contribution from new products introduced in the last five years to 25% of sales, which represents a significant potential revenue lift. Over the last 18 months, we've launched over 25 new products, including several recent introductions to capture the market opportunities presented by the energy efficient labor-savings and integrated solutions trends highlighted in our Vision 2030 strategy. One such product is our new Ready Flash technology, which allows commercial roofing applicators to maintain optimal productivity in various temperature conditions by adjusting the adhesive setup time using either the light or dark facer side of the rigid insulation board. Our customer trials have demonstrated that the Dark Ready Flash facer can provide up to four times faster adhesive flash-off than a standard light facer with no sacrifice in performance. Another example is Carlisle's patented SeamShield Technology for our Sure-Weld TPO membranes in the commercial roofing market. This innovative feature provides an easy-to-remove protective film on the top and bottom seam areas, reducing cleaning time by 70%, while increasing weld strength by 10%. Additionally, we recently introduced Henry Blueskin VPTech, an integrated panel that includes a weather resistive barrier, continuous insulation and a seamed ceiling in a single panel. In trials with independent contractors, Blueskin VPTech installed 30% faster compared to traditional methods, saving both time and labor cost. It also improves a building's energy efficiency by reducing air leakage and enhancing thermal performance. These three products are patented or patent-pending and together with our other new product launches represent a significant incremental sales opportunity at higher margins. As we continue to execute our Vision 2030 strategy, we remain committed to investing in R&D and accelerating the introduction of innovative products that drive energy efficiency, labor savings and superior performance for our customers. Please turn to Slide 7. Before I hand it over to Kevin, I wanted to quickly highlight that we recently released Carlisle's 2023 Sustainability Report. The report contains detailed information, including clear examples of how our products reduce carbon footprint in buildings, how we reduce emissions in our operations and how we plan to reduce waste to landfills. It also will give the reader our latest progress on GHG emission reductions and our progress towards zero emissions by 2050. In conclusion, I'm extremely proud of our team's performance in the first half of 2024. Our ability to produce strong results in a dynamic environment demonstrates the resilience of our business model, our strategic market positioning and the disciplined execution of our Vision 2030 strategy. As we move forward with Vision 2030, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the positive fundamentals in our businesses and deliver profitable long-term growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details. Kevin? Thank you, Kevin. In conclusion, we are extremely pleased with our performance in the first half of 2024. As we look towards the second half, we believe the significant positive trends exhibited in the second quarter will carry over into the third quarter and that belief is embedded in our raising of expectations for 2024. In addition, I want to emphasize our unwavering dedication to Carlisle's strategic trajectory under Vision 2030. As we progress towards 2030, our focus on innovative, energy efficient, and labor-saving systems and solutions, the Carlisle Experience and flawless execution within our businesses positions us to outpace market growth and consequently deliver outstanding outcomes for all stakeholders. The pivot of our company to a building products portfolio in tandem with our robust free cash flow generation and significant investment in innovation sets the stage for us to unlock significant additional value for our shareholders as we move forward. I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to convey my appreciation to each and every member of the Carlisle team. The remarkable achievements we've witnessed this quarter and the momentum we've built for 2024 are a testament to the dedication and skill of our talented employees. With Vision 2030 serving as the roadmap for our success, I remain incredibly optimistic about Carlisle's future. Thank you once again for your support. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Good afternoon. Thank you. Tim, I think you're right on the first half and the first half was pretty much as we predicted. I think we did a good job, Kevin and the team of indicator of defining the impact of the restocking, I'll call it event with the lack of destocking. And so that was good that was right on the mark. I think we had also done some of our work and this gets with a confidence issue. I've done some of our own independent work, we can talk about that later around surveys and that really gave us some insight that we didn't have two years ago. And I think we've talked about that before how we went on did some of our own independent work after the destocking got us a little bit off guard a couple of quarters ago. And we're seeing the same things going in the third quarter that we saw in the second quarter. CCM was a little bit better. At the end of the second quarter really drivers around mix. I think we had a better operating environment. We added MTL into that positive momentum there. If you look at CWT, while sales weren't probably what everybody would hope for, I think, given the context of the resi markets and the impact on R&R and that was probably about what we expected. And what I was excited about there was in our retail channel, CWT and the Henry team introduced a couple of new products into the retail channel that really took off and helped. And so I think we look at those things. We continue to have new products introduced. We continue to -- we actually had a record month on the margin side on a record quarter, excuse me, on COS. And so we look at operational efficiency, we look at the raw material situation, we look at the demand situation across the board. We just look at Q3 and think unless there's a weather event or we see something deteriorating the economy, the trends should -- they all look like they're going to continue into the third quarter and then we'll look to the fourth quarter and see what kind of weather we get as we end the year and how many days on the roof we get as we get into November in that. Yeah. And it's something we talked about before how and I know this chart isn't great. We've had it out there for a while where increasing new construction 20 years ago is really laying in that foundation of re-roofing that's going to occur. So as you say and we've talked about this for a while, the constrained labor markets, obviously, that's a big factor in driving our innovation is that we forecast continued constrained labor markets. And so I think you accurately set it up, which is really new construction if it's better, then you're going to be allocating labor to that and re-roofing might have a little bit of a lag. And then when we had COVID and we had some time where roofs weren't being probably addressed as quickly as they could have been, again, it just gets into that backlog. And so that's really what is supporting that. I think you referenced actually in your report you issued today on commercial around architectural firm backlog, still healthy at about 6.4 months and AIA highlighted that and I think that's kind of consistent with what we're seeing. Right. So we did see data centers, obviously, with the increase in the data consumption and the things like this. We've seen -- we've been seeing this build is our part of our overall sales, it's a small piece. It is growing. We're seeing more interest in it. And not just in areas like Phoenix where we've seen a lot of data center, excuse me, data center and talk about construction in that, but also around the country. And so it's getting our attention. We have a team focused on it and it really gets to the point that you're making is, not that it's a big part of it, but it is a nice content piece because of what you talked about. You really need to have a very secure building envelope, energy efficiency is prime there as well as moisture control and other things. So it's one of the most sophisticated roofs we would put down and I think when you think about that and translate it into product content, it's a good roof for Carlisle. All right. Thanks, Tim. Hi, Susan. Right. I think it was last quarter we said that inventory might be on the historically lighter side. I think that's true. There wasn't a big load in this year. Obviously, you're aware of this, people were burned on the inventory. We had to destock. Obviously we're through that. I think coming into this year, we didn't expect a big load in. And to your point on being prepared, we actually were prepared and had -- and actually built a little bit more in the first quarter, to be sure we could address customer needs with having lower inventory through the channel. So I don't see that inventory picking up, Susan, as we go into the third quarter because we're past the peak of the construction season. So why would you load in inventory now? Historically, people haven't done that. They manage it more carefully in the back half of the year. And then as we look at 2025, we'll do some more assessment. But that would be the time when traditionally, we would have built inventory in the winter months to begin to address that load in, in the spring. And so we'll look at that. But that's one way we do it. The other way is, as I said, we had a record COS quarter in the second quarter. And I think you can think of that just simply in terms of increasing the efficiency of our operations. And we continue to invest in capital, we continue to invest in automation. We're starting to roll out AI in different places. One of them is S&OP planning, demand management, things like that. To make ourselves more efficient and to really be able to respond more quickly to any surges in inventory we've had. But to this point, we've handled the year pretty well. I think we're well-positioned on inventory and production for the third quarter. And obviously we'll be right there if there's a good weather fourth quarter that we need to continue to meet that demand. So I think we're in a good position for this year and then even into 2025. Thanks, Susan. Hey, Garik, I'll take part of it, Kevin can talk about the sequential stuff. When we entered the year and even I think when we saw that pricing announcement from one of our competitors and again, we were happy they were attempting to show their price to value there. And they also thought I think my sense was that raw materials were rising. So a good call there because as Kevin just mentioned, MDI is getting a little higher, labor costs were going up. We said that, that wasn't really going to have much of an impact in '24 for us, maybe a little bit, I think in the fourth quarter, if I'm right, Kevin can correct me if I'm wrong. So what we saw through the quarter is we did actually see places where we had implemented that pricing increase and we were getting some traction. I would say overall though the response in the broader markets was not to have a lot of conviction over that and just to continue to extend, I wouldn't say it was a reduction, it was just an extension of current terms further into the year. And ultimately, when you keep extending a price increase implementation date, you run out of room on the year and its ability to be effective. So I think overall, not only for us, but as we projected, it wouldn't have much impact. I think in the industry, it won't have much impact all. So it will be something that I think how to labor costs, how to supply chain costs, things like that go into the third and fourth quarter and then do you see some ability by the industry to build a firmer as we enter 2025. Well, when we come in, we have this projection that we do we try to be good about it. We don't get as much insight as we do after we own the company. But I think just like with Henry, we've got a great leadership team. Frank Ready was the Henry leader that really embraced our integration playbook. And that's a key thing is how does the team embrace the integration playbook because some of that the synergies identified and the actual identification of new synergies comes as the team gets together and they -- and they pursue these things either passionately or not passionately. In both cases, Henry and MTL leadership has just hit the ground running, fully bought into COS, fully bought into the integration playbook. And as a result, we've accelerated, I think some of the things we thought were there. And then we've also identified some new opportunities for synergy. And I think it's worthwhile to say most of the stuff that we take action on initially are cost synergies. And then as you start to get the groups together, you start thinking about sales synergies and how you can bring things together. So I think it's going really well. That management team and the teams at Drexel and at Petersen are just doing a great job. And that's why we feel confident in raising the synergies, the accretion. And I actually think there's even upside to the $20 million we put out as our new target for synergies. So more of that as we get through the year. You bet. Thank you, Garik. Hey, Bryan. Yeah. The M&A pipeline is actually quite good. But I think you're probably aware of what's said publicly around whether it's the strategics and private equity wanting to have some exits. And we see that I think we're still a little bit -- getting a little bit of, I'd say, tension around this idea that some people might think it's better to wait and have a higher valuation as a seller thinking that rate cuts will come in '25 will be better. And so if I'm going to sell, I want a higher number and then buyers obviously are saying, well, yeah, there's a lot of uncertainty there and I think we want to be compensated for that uncertainty. So the pipeline is good. I think it's the valuation differential that's maybe slowing things down a little bit. But as you said, we have assets, we have aspirations, we have a good strategy. We've got a clear target across all of our businesses for what would be good acquisitions. So now the question is just getting them to close. And I think Kevin and I are both optimistic that M&A will continue to be a solid part of the growth story for Carlisle. So I think we're in good shape there. Thanks, Bryan. Saree, I don't know, I think I thought we talked about it before on a call, maybe we had you know right after the inventory destocking in the third quarter of, let's forget the year, but anyway. We were disappointed in that as you were and other investors where there wasn't more visibility and clarity into the channel, I think, both at the contractor and the distributor level. And so we went out and we worked with the firm to create kind of a -- I don't call it proprietary, but a survey where we were looking at multiple hundreds of contractor data points in various geographies, various sized contractors and distributors. And then asking a series of questions to get around things like, are we doing on inventory levels? What are you forecasting for growth? What are you seeing in your market? And then doing a consolidation around that. And it's been a pretty effective tool for us. I think the other thing it's done for us is start to give us some greater insights into market perception of us. We put a lot of emphasis on the Carlisle Experience and so embedded in that are some questions around delivery and quality and things like that we've taken back and we've used to also help us direct some efforts in our customer experience. So it's not earth shattering. It's just something we needed to do and we feel like that direct connectivity is something we need to have. So we do it, you may think, well, we already doing that. We do it, I would say, and have multiple conversations every day with, I'm sure all of our customers. But I think this is a more formal process that was a little bit more statistically valid. So it was a good addition to the portfolio of information gathering tools we have at our disposal. You bet, Saree. Thanks. Weather? A little bit of flooding at one facility I think other than that. Right. No, I think when we look at across obviously the warehousing thing has been down and that's been down significantly. When I think about where we were maybe back in '22 where we were in the -- the -- I think 20-plus percent increases in warehousing and now we're probably the inverse of that, maybe a little less than that. Education has been pretty consistent over the last couple of years as a good place to be office buildings. You can imagine, it's still not great, a little bit negative. You read that in the press with what's happening there, work-from-home and all that. When we think about stores, we call stores, that's doing well. Healthcare has done well again. And then I think the one that everybody draws a lot of attention to the reshoring manufacturing actually this year has been a good add in terms of new construction. So overall a mixed bag with probably what you would have expected based upon what your M&As do on the trends. You bet. Thank you. This then concludes the second quarter earnings call. Appreciate everybody being on the call and good questions. Look forward to speaking with all of you at our next earnings call. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Carlisle Companies First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] \n I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Giannakouros, Carlisle's Vice President of Investor Relations, Jim, please go ahead. \nMehul Patel: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to welcome all of you today to Carlisle's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am Mehul Patel, I'm Head of Investor Relations. \n We released today our first quarter 2024 financial results, and you can find both our press release and the presentation for today's call in the Investors Relations section of our website. \n On the call with me today, we have Chris Koch. He is our Board Chair, President and CEO; along with Kevin Zdimal, who is our CFO.\n Today's call will begin with Chris. He will provide highlights of our results along with an update on our key accomplishments and then Kevin will follow up with an overview on our financial performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2024.\n Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the line for questions. But before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our press release and SEC filings. As Carlisle provides non-GAAP financial information, we've provided reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and in the appendix of our presentation materials, which are available on our website.\n And with that, I will turn the call over to Chris. \nD. Koch: Thank you, Mehul. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Carlisle's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.\n To start, I'd like to direct your attention to Slide 3 of the presentation. We were pleased with our overall sales growth and margin expansion during the first quarter which reinforces the underlying themes and key strategies we've outlined in Vision 2030.\n First quarter sales of $1.1 billion reflect a 23% year-over-year increase and were in line with our previous comments that destocking ended in Q4 of 2023. We also indicated that we expected a benefit of approximately $200 million of year-over-year sales as a result of a return to normal ordering levels, rebounding as predicted from a Q1 of 2023 that had been negatively affected by destocking. This return to normal ordering patterns was primarily experienced in our CCM business, which demonstrated substantial year-over-year sales growth of 36%.\n Robust reroofing activity from pent-up demand and favorable weather conditions fostering healthy construction activity were additional positive factors that assisted our first quarter performance and more than offset the impact from negative price in Q1 that we had stated in our year-end earnings call.\n In addition to a positive sales story, the Q1 margin story was also a success. Our relentless focus on improving operational efficiency, our commitment to delivering the unparalleled value in the Carlisle experience to our customers and our COS efforts contributed to a strong bottom line result.\n Improved margins across both CCM and CWT drove adjusted EBITDA of over $260 million marking an increase of well over 50% year-over-year. The focus on continuously improving adjusted EBITDA performance was underpinned in Q1 by robust margin expansion bolstered by the increased Henry integration synergies, our commitment to our Lean Sigma initiatives under our flagship Carlisle Operating System and efficiencies gained by leveraging our higher volumes in our operations.\n Pricing continues to be in line with our expectations where we anticipated pricing would be down 2% to 3% for the full year, with substantially all of the impact in the first half of the year. We are bullish on the pricing outlook for the balance of the year based on the recent price increases announced by the major competitors in our industry. Additionally, we achieved substantial growth in adjusted EPS of over 80% year-over-year. Our steadfast dedication to the Carlisle experience, operational excellence, innovation, synergistic acquisitions and organic investments continues to contribute to our superior performance and solidify Carlisle's position for sustained success in the future.\n Carrying on with the theme of positioning Carlisle for sustained success in the future, we were pleased to follow the delivery of our Vision 2030 plan in December of last year with the announcement that we are selling the Carlisle Interconnect business and taking the final step in delivering on our commitment to become a pure-play building products company. \n In January, we reached an agreement with the Amphenol Corporation to acquire our CIT business. We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of this year. The anticipated proceeds from the sale of nearly $2 billion will be strategically deployed to fund further acquisitions, execute approximately $1 billion in share repurchases and fuel additional organic growth initiatives. \n In our pursuit of generating significant value creation through strategic investments, we're excited to announce the acquisition of MTL, a Wisconsin-based specialty manufacturer of high-performance metal edge and wall systems. The acquisition of MTL is perfectly aligned with Carlisle's Vision 2030 strategy and our four criteria for all acquisitions. And as a reminder, those criteria are: one, a solid organic growth story; two, meaningful hard synergies; three, a talented management team, and lastly, a clear and easily actionable integration playbook. \n Our acquisitions are always aimed at enriching and expanding our building envelope product offerings. The planned MTL acquisition and CIT divestiture reinforce our commitment to our pure-play building product strategy, our philosophy of superior capital allocation and ultimately driving best-in-class ROIC.\n And lastly, we are very pleased to have continued our long-standing tradition of returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in Q1. During Q1, we completed $150 million in share repurchases as part of our plan to repurchase $1.4 billion worth of shares in 2024. We also paid $42 million in dividends in the first quarter as we continue to be proud of our history of having raised our dividend for over 47 consecutive years. These actions underscore our commitment to enhancing shareholder value and our confidence in Carlisle's long-term growth trajectory.\n Please turn to Slide 4 as I discuss our Vision 2030 value creation drivers and targets. After completing Vision 2025 3 years early, we are now fully engaged in building on Vision 2025 success and the execution of Vision 2030. As outlined in our Vision 2030 video, we plan to continue delivering on the foundational strategies that have produced such positive results under Vision 2025. Coupled with major secular tailwinds, we are committed to delivering innovative building envelope solutions, driving above-market growth and unlocking additional value for shareholders in this next important phase of Carlisle's growth journey.\n The key pillars of Vision 2030 include enhanced levels of innovation with a commitment to investing 3% of sales to drive the creation of new products and solutions that add value to our customers through advancements in sustainability, energy and labor efficiency. A continued emphasis on synergistic M&A as demonstrated by our recent agreement to acquire MTL, which aligns seamlessly with our strategy to enhance and expand our building envelope product portfolio, attracting and retaining top talent to ensure we have the best talent to execute our strategic initiatives and drive above-market growth, and holding steadfast to our sustainability commitments as evidenced by our progress in 2023 against our stated objectives, which you can find in our latest corporate sustainability report.\n As we move forward, we are confident that the execution of Vision 2030 will drive superior shareholder returns and position Carlisle as a premier investment opportunity in the building products sector. \n Turning to Slide 5. Our planned acquisition of MTL is directly aligned with our goal to invest prudently in high-returning businesses with best-in-class building envelope products and solutions that expand and complement our existing system offerings. With an expected close in the second quarter of 2024, MTL reinforces Carlisle as an industry leader in the multibillion dollar architectural metal market and is expected to add approximately $0.60 of adjusted EPS in 2025 with over $13 million of hard cost synergies expected within the first 3 years. MTL's values are highly aligned with Carlisle's, especially with respect to MTL's superior customer focus and solid track record of above-market growth.\n Now please turn to Slide 6 as I share recent updates on our progress with Carlisle sustainability initiatives. We seek to positively impact the environment while creating value for all our stakeholders through the 3 pillars of our sustainability strategy, which are: one, manufacturing energy-efficient products; two, minimizing our value chain greenhouse gas emissions; and three, diverting waste and end-of-life materials from landfills. \n Under our first pillar, we provide our end user customers access to solutions that drive energy efficiency in their buildings. As I mentioned earlier, in 2023, we made significant progress against this pillar with $3.2 billion in lead qualified product sales, representing an impressive 70% of our total revenue, which is up from 65% in 2022, reflecting the increasing demand and trends for more energy-efficient buildings. \n Our second pillar, reducing our operational and value chain emissions, helps Carlisle reduce our carbon footprint and environmental impacts. Carlisle began Phase 1 of metering the significant energy users or SEUs at our major manufacturing facilities. The data that results from metering this equipment will enable our plants to conduct real-time energy analysis and make more informed decisions on energy efficiency. In Q1, Carlisle installed metering at our Tooele, Utah, polyiso and membrane facility. \n Lastly, our third pillar focuses on the reduction of construction waste entering landfills. In 2023, Carlisle's recycling initiatives enabled the diversion of over 90,000 metric tons of waste from landfills through operational scrap reduction, purchase recycled raws and rooftop takeoffs. Significant contributors were the purchased recycled content of polyiso facer paper and polyols as well as 30,000 tons of recycled metal from the CAM business unit.\n Sustainability is a very important focus for Carlisle. As an organization, we remain committed to being a responsible environmental stakeholder and our products continue to offer a strong value proposition in a world looking for energy-efficient, value-added solutions.\n Our first quarter results reinforced many of the themes we discussed in our Vision 2030 presentation, including being well positioned to leverage megatrends in energy efficiency, labor savings and growing reroof demand within the building envelope marketplace. With this in mind and in combination with the strength of our first quarter results, we are increasing our full year 2024 growth outlook.\n And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details. Kevin? \nKevin Zdimal: Thank you, Chris. \n Our first quarter financial results reflect the strength of our business model and the successful execution of our strategic priorities to start off 2024 on solid footing. \n Looking at our first quarter results on Slide 7. We grew revenue by 23% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, driven by normalization of inventory in the channels, growing reroofing activity, which benefited from pent-up demand, increasing residential starts and favorable weather across the U.S. We leveraged our strong topline performance to expand our EBITDA margins by 530 basis points to 24.2%. Furthermore, we grew our earnings 85% year-over-year to an adjusted EPS of $3.72. The EPS increase was driven by sales growth, margin expansion and share repurchases.\n Looking at our segment highlights, starting with CCM on Slide 8. CCM delivered first quarter revenues of $784 million, up 36% from the first quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by a return to normalization of order patterns, including the end of destocking in the channel, positive reroof activity and favorable weather. CCM adjusted EBITDA increased 66% to $227 million with adjusted EBITDA margin of 510 basis points to 28.9%. This was driven by a combination of leveraging higher volume growth and continued operating efficiencies through the Carlisle operating system.\n Moving to Slide 9. Revenues at CWT decreased 1% year-over-year, primarily due to lower carryover prices from 2023 in select categories. However, despite the revenue decline, we were able to drive adjusted EBITDA growth of 20% to $65 million. This represented an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.7%, expanding 370 basis points from the first quarter of 2023. The margin improvement was driven by operational efficiencies gained through COS, lower input costs through strategic sourcing and the realization of synergies from the Henry acquisition. Synergies from the Henry acquisition are expected to exceed $50 million in 2024, significantly above our deal model estimate of $30 million.\n Slide 10 provides a year-over-year first quarter adjusted EPS bridge items for your reference.\n Moving to Slides 11 through 13. Carlisle ended the first quarter of 2024 with $553 million of cash on hand. We have $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, which we amended in April to extend the maturity to 2029. We generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $156 million and invested $24 million in capital expenditures. We achieved solid cash flow performance for the quarter with a free cash flow margin of 12%, and we remain on pace for a free cash flow margin of over 15% for the full year. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.4x within our target of 1 to 2x. \n We are already making significant progress against the capital allocation goals outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy. We are doing so by reinvesting in our high ROIC building products businesses through continued investment in growth CapEx and returning value to shareholders through dividends including $42 million in dividends paid and repurchasing $150 million of shares during the first quarter of 2024. We are also making synergistic acquisitions that will deliver significant opportunities for value creation such as our recently announced agreement to acquire MTL for $410 million. These actions are collectively aligned with our disciplined capital allocation framework, which forms an integral part of delivering ROIC in excess of 25% and ultimately reaching $40 plus of adjusted EPS by 2030.\n Following the repurchase of $150 million of shares during the first quarter, we have 6.9 million shares remaining under our share repurchase program. Our robust financial position is underpinned by a solid balance sheet and a prudent approach to leverage. This conservative capital structure affords us the ability to strategically allocate resources in pursuit of superior returns. Complemented by our substantial liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion, we are well equipped to capitalize on opportunities that arise, unlocking additional value for our stakeholders in the coming quarters and years. And as a reminder, we expect to receive an additional $2 billion of gross proceeds from the CIT sale in the second quarter further enhancing our financial flexibility. We believe we are well positioned to drive additional value creation in the quarters and years ahead.\n Turning to Slide 14. I will discuss our full year financial outlook. We are raising our full year 2024 revenue outlook to approximately 10% growth over the prior year which is double our outlook at year-end when we were expecting a 5% increase. This increase in outlook is driven by a combination of our solid first quarter and stronger reroofing demand for the balance of the year. Leveraging the additional revenue through the Carlisle Operating System along with a more positive outlook on pricing, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by at least 100 basis points as compared to our previous guidance of 50 basis points.\n Additionally, we maintain our expectations to deliver free cash flow margins of at least 15% and ROIC in excess of 25%. As such, we continue to expect double-digit EPS growth in 2024. This is directly aligned with the objectives outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy and we are experiencing a strong start towards our 2030 goal of $40 plus of adjusted EPS. \n Looking at the components of the outlook for CCM, we now expect year-over-year revenue to grow in the low double digits in 2024. The primary drivers are tailwinds from the return to normalization and order patterns that was absent during 2023 due to destocking and strong contractor backlogs from the pent-up reroofing demand. For CWT, we now expect year-over-year revenue to grow in the mid-single digits in 2024 from strong sales execution on key growth initiatives as well as stronger trends in our markets.\n With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. \nD. Koch: Thanks, Kevin. \n In conclusion, I want to reiterate our confidence in Carlisle's strategic direction under Vision 2030 and reinforced by our strong first quarter results. \n As we move forward, our ability to innovate with a focus on energy efficiency and labor-saving solutions puts us on the right path to drive above-market growth and in return drive superior financial results. The simplification of our Building Products portfolio, combined with a robust free cash flow engine and the anticipated proceeds from the sale of CIT places us in an excellent position to create further significant value for our shareholders. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to once again express my sincere gratitude to all of Carlisle's employees. The exceptional efforts of all of our team members have ensured a strong start to what we expect will be another exceptional year for Carlisle in 2024. And with Vision 2030 already deeply embedded in our operations, I'm incredibly optimistic about Carlisle's long-term success. Our strong brand, solid capital position and superb cash flow generation provides us with the flexibility to successfully execute our strategy and unlock additional value for all our stakeholders. \n Thank you, everyone, for your continued support. Together, we are building a brighter future for Carlisle. \n And that concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. \nTimothy Wojs: Nice Job. Maybe just my first question. So when you look at CCM, I mean, it just seems like the tone around reroofing is a lot better than what it was 60 to 90 days ago. So I guess what have you seen in your business to kind of get comfort or confidence that there is kind of pent-up demand on the reroofing side? \nKevin Zdimal: Yes. Tim, it really goes back to COVID. I mean we've been talking about this for a while that during COVID with regroup, you weren't able -- or contractors weren't able to get on the routes initially. And then when we came out of COVID, we had a strong period of new construction in the last couple of years, and we talked about just due to the lack of labor that some of the reroof was being deferred. They were doing some patch work and some of that resulted in this pent-up demand that we're now seeing come through. And frankly, that's the reason we raised our forecast that a good chunk of the increase, about half of that, was due to the reroof improvement. \nTimothy Wojs: Okay. Okay. Got you. And I guess on that point, Kevin, just if you can maybe go through the revenue bridge, just within CCM, I mean, last quarter, it was 6%. Now it's low double digits. What are the pieces if you go through the restocking the underlying volume and then just your updated price assumptions. \nKevin Zdimal: Yes. The destocking didn't change. We had at about 11% increase for the full year. We still expect it to be about 11%. We had said the dollar amount was $375 million for the year, $200 million in the first quarter, and that's what we saw, the $200 million in the first quarter. So nothing changed on the destock. What did change is both the volume and the price.  \n On the volume side, I just talked about the reroofing coming into the year, we had said we thought the total end market would be down 2% to 3%. Now we think it'll be up slightly. We still think new construction will be down high single digits, but reroof, we think, will be up mid-single digits. And then on pricing, we recently announced some price increases, and we now think that will only be down about 1% for the full year on price where, as you may recall, at the beginning of the year, we thought we'd be down 2% to 3%. So when you sum that all up, we pretty much doubled that 6% of what we're talking about at the beginning of the year for CCM. \nTimothy Wojs: Okay. Okay. Great. And then maybe just the last question just to sneak in here. I mean, how would you characterize the pace of what you're seeing on the input cost side, MDI, polyiso. I guess does the price cost math change? Or are you just seeing a little bit more inflation and so net-net on the EBITDA line, it sums to 0? \nKevin Zdimal: Yes. When we came into the year, we had said that cost was going to be pretty flat for the year. The raws has been a little bit of a mixed bag on raw materials, some raw materials are up, some are down. So not too much has changed there, but now with pricing getting a little bit better pricing, we think that number will be positive for the full year, maybe a full year up of about $20 million on price cost. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. \nSusan Maklari: My first question is on CCM as well. Appreciating that you've got this reroofing tailwind that is coming through. But can you also talk a bit about some of your own initiatives around some of the products and the work that you've done with the customers? And do you think that that's also incrementally adding to this? And how do you think about the sustainability of that through this year and maybe the cadence as we move through the next couple of quarters for the revenues there? \nD. Koch: Well, overall Susan, as we really look at three areas on the initiatives. I think we talked about margin -- or customer intimacy, really this involves a lot of contractor training, architect training. Our digital experience is getting better and better. We've done a lot of work with the -- enhancing the sales excellence of our teams. Things like optimizing our quote process really cross-selling, trying to increase dollars per square foot. And I think it is taking a hold. We've really got into a lot of the selling initiatives last year, and I do think they're starting to show up in sales. \n We also talk about innovation. Innovation is, for us, under Vision 2030 is a longer, obviously, a much longer total play. But we're already seeing new products at the market at a higher rate. We're investing a little bit more, as you can see in our SG&A. And I think that will continue to gain momentum. \n Last year, in January, we introduced a 16-foot TPO, had a product called ReadyFlash in April, and we're going to introduce some other products coming out. One of them is SeamShield, that's going to be introduced in Q2 of '24. So we continue to build momentum there. Obviously, our commitment to moving up to 3% is going to take a couple of years, but we should see increased momentum every quarter as we continue to drive innovator CCM and frankly, CWT. \n And then lastly, it's really this operational excellence, and that's just an ongoing expectation that we're getting in that 1% to 2% of sales through COS every year. AI in our factories are still starting to work on to improve efficiency, everything from the quote process to actually how we deal with the data coming off the line to become a little bit more -- maybe anticipate any quality issues that may come about by looking at the data. \n We also are trying to do a better job of forecasting through using AI and then really driving the sustainability efforts through our factories too, to drive efficiency. So trying to use less product in the whole process, trying to have less waste throughout it, whether it's freight or whether it's actually movement of goods within the factories, just trying to reduce waste. And in turn, I think that produces a nice efficiency program there not just for energy, but in all ways, and we're starting to see returns there. \n So when we look at the gains that we've had over the last 5 to 10 years, a lot of these things have played into it. I think we're doing a better job of articulating it, but we continue to see some pretty good margin expansion. And I think Henry is probably the latest, best example where in each quarter, we continue to see margin expansion. And in this last one, even on doubt sales. So a bit of a long answer for you, but I try to be a little more context and maybe Kevin wants to give more granularity. \nKevin Zdimal: Second part of your question, '24 is playing out to be a more normal year for us from the seasonality standfront. At the beginning of the year, we had said sales would be for the second quarter, about 29% of full year sales and Q3, we said about 27% of full year sales, and that seasonality still looks to be holding strong for us. So that would be the best estimate for quarterly revenue for the CCM business. And as far as CWT, that's still consistent with what we talked about in the year-end call as well. \nSusan Maklari: Okay. That's great color. That's very helpful. And then maybe just following up on that. I think you mentioned that you expect to now exceed $50 million in synergies at Henry versus the $30 million guide that you had given before. Can you just talk about what's driving that incremental $20 million in there? And any thoughts on how that will come through? \nD. Koch: Yes. In terms of what we're working at, the cross-selling is helping some new initiatives around sales, automation within the factories. We're doing a better job of I think managing our efficiency within our factories. How it comes through on the P&L, I would defer to Kevin on that one. \nKevin Zdimal: Yes. So the $50 million that we see, that's pretty well. We're at that run rate in the first quarter. So about $14 million a quarter is what we're going to get. First quarter of last year was about half of that number. So we did see those synergies in Q1, but we did ramp up as the year went on last year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. \nGarik Shmois: Decent quarter. Wanted to ask, first off, I think in the release, you spoke to lower carryover prices in CWT. Was there any new downward pricing pressure during the quarter? And how should we think of pricing moving forward and potentially when would you anniversary some of the carryover pricing pressure? \nD. Koch: Yes, I don't think there's any price pressure you weren't aware of that came through. We just lapped that. And as we detailed that it will -- the way pricing would work, we were probably down 4%, 5% around the first quarter, we'll move to probably 2%, 3% in the second. Then if you think about the third quarter, it will be flat. And then based upon what we're seeing on the pricing increases that have come out ours and others, Garik, I think it works, it doesn't hit on day 1. It takes a little bit to get into the bidding and that. And so we would anticipate then that we might be up 1% to 2% in the fourth quarter. \nGarik Shmois: Got it. And I wanted to just kind of circle back to the 1Q volume strength in CCM. Recognizing it's a recently slower quarter, but I think that the variance was pretty notable relative to what we were expecting. You saw the lapping of the destock, that track as expected. But you also said weather as being favorable. So just wanted to see do you think some of the benefit was weather? How much of the 1Q outperformance was a stronger market? Did you see any inventory build at either distribution or a contractor level? Just any additional color as to the 1Q strength would be great. \nD. Koch: Yes, let me hit a couple of those and Kevin will pick some up, too. I think on weather, maybe 2 to 3 days depending on where you were in the country, obviously, that has a big -- whether in the Northwest or your volume, I mean, compared to some others. I know some have people have announced that they had a weaker impact due to weather. So I think that depends on where you're at. For us about 2 to 3 days. The destock being over -- that was a big deal going into the end of the year. I think we were a little conservative around that. Now we had talked about $200 million in Q1. As you're sitting there in the Q1 call and you're not seeing much of it unfold yet, you want to be conservative, and I was pretty pleased that we got all of that. And then the destocking was over.\n We also picked up, we think, some extra reroofing, which was good. That seemed to build in the quarter. So overall, I think that might have had a little bit to do, especially the conservatism around the $200 million around why we might be a little bit heavier than expected. \nGarik Shmois: Got it. Okay. That's great... \nD. Koch: You asked about inventory building. I think with our data, what are conversations on that are showing in the first quarter is that really a lot of the channel, while the destock is over, we're not seeing a huge build in inventory. I think as we get closer to the season, people are still concerned about, obviously, the carrying cost of inventory or higher now than they have been. Maybe a little bit of conservatism around getting burned again on having too much inventory.\n So if demand holds up, obviously, they're all -- that will need to be addressed, and we think we're in a good position to be able to address that increased demand even if distributors aren't carrying and contractors aren't carrying as much inventories maybe we would like them to have going into the season. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer. \nBryan Blair: Pleasant start to the year. \nD. Koch: Thanks, Bryan. \nBryan Blair: Kevin, you walked through the full year bridge for CCM revenue. And I apologize if -- in all the detail that you offered during the script and Q&A, I missed this. But can you do the same for CWT, so we have that kind of level set? And then it would be great if you guys could offer some more color on what you're seeing in commercial versus residential applications specific to the CWT segment. \nD. Koch: Yes. Let me take the first one. Kevin can give you that walk through the year. And what we're seeing out in the CWT market is really -- on the resi side, just this idea that there still is an underlying need for additional housing units. When we look at and we see builders still buying land and still making investments in that, addressing that demand, we're optimistic about that for the year. I think could there be a blip? Could there be some hesitation as people digest things around the stuff we've seen today, like the GDP or first were 2 or 3 cuts and now we're headed perhaps to not as many. But I think resi again, that underlying demand is going to continue to be a drumbeat as we go through the year or the need for additional housing units.\n We get to the commercial, I think it's really -- it depends on the segment. Obviously, the office and retail side for CWT has been a bit tough, not to be, I think, expected. I think it could be expected, excuse me. Warehousing a little bit tough, too. And then when you get into health care, education, government spending, those tended to be positive. So as we look across that portfolio segments, kind of a mixed bag.\n And then really when we looked out at the margin, and we continue to anticipate driving improved margin, it's really around automation, first of all, and that's something that I think Carlisle brought to the table, and you've seen it in CCM, and you're going to see it run through CWT this year, next year is just this idea that we're approving the factories. We've talked about it before, being more efficient, applying COS and Lead Sigma.\n And then innovation. We've got innovation running as well and building in CWT. And then lastly, this positive price/cost spread that they're seeing should be helpful in the year too. I think we were probably a little bit more to the cost savings side on raw materials in the first quarter than the negative impact on price. So -- and we should also see as volume continues to improve that 1% volume, we get more volume to the factories, we see some benefits from that, too. \n So Kevin, do you want to talk about the [ walks ]? \nKevin Zdimal: Yes. And the seasonality, you know that both our businesses very much the summer months as the stronger months. But as we look at CWT specifically, it's really the same as we talked about at the end of the year where we think about 22% of the full year sales would be in Q1 and then Q2 and Q3 are both about 27%. and then you exit with the balance into Q4. As far as EBITDA drop-through, we still see CWT in the low to mid-30s for incrementals and CCM, they're at about 40% on the incrementals. \nBryan Blair: Understood. Very helpful detail. Perhaps offer a little more on the strategic fit of MTL and how the asset strengthens the product suite of the metals platform and growth potential looking forward? \nD. Koch: Right. Well, MTL is just a great company. The leader of MTL, Tony Mallinger, has done a great job over the years of driving some wonderful performance. And it really centers around edge metal, which as we've talked about before, edge metal goes on basically every low roof that we put on. And so that's something that MTL brings to us. We think that's a big benefit to get that into the Carlisle specification, to get that into the Carlisle warranty. You know what happens there.\n Also, there's some architectural and other metal products that they have that are value accretive. They actually have patents on a lot of things, something that you wouldn't expect in an edge metal or perhaps an architectural metal business. But this patented technology just shows you the type of innovation that Tony and his team have been bringing to the market through the years.\n So the addition really fits when we look right down the line from the specification, integrating it into our portfolio, being able to train our contractors, being able to offer to our contractors. And we also think there are going to be some good synergies by bringing MTL into the Drexel and Peterson group as well and having a much, much more complete product line in metal as well as the synergies when we think about raw material purchases, the volume of that metal adds when we think about shipping and other things like that. So a good addition.\n And I think when we look back to what we said it would be -- I think we had about $0.25 accretion in -- on EPS in '24 and then something like $0.60 in 2025. So right away, some good benefits there. And I think are targeted and stated savings and synergies was going to be up $13 million. But my expectation, and I think as the team gets into it, is that we'll exceed that just like we did with Henry. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. \nSaree Boroditsky: Just a couple of questions here. So first, just to build on the price cost, you talked about a positive $20 million. Could you just provide any detail on how that plays out through the year? \nKevin Zdimal: Yes. The first quarter, we got about half of that. And then through the balance of the year, it's pretty much pro rata. \nSaree Boroditsky: Perfect. And then going on MTL, can you just provide more details on the architectural metals market. I believe in the past, you talked about a growing 2x GDP, but it would be great to get an update on that. \nD. Koch: Yes, I definitely think that it's growing at a higher rate. I think you could probably say -- probably stick with your 2x GDP. One of the things that the metals business brings to us is obviously the flexibility of the product line, and that's something that obviously is a huge benefit.\n The metals market is -- I think we had 800 -- $1 billion market, there's plenty for us to go after. We also want to go after more what I would say, prefab applications where we're doing it in the factory and we're getting more standardization along product lines and shipping that out.\n So I can give you more information, Saree, if you want to ask -- that's about where I would stop or I'll just keep talking about the metal business. But it's a good business. It's very complementary. We talked about edge metal. The other thing I would just add is that when we look at a lot of the buildings that have flat roofs on them, especially warehouses and small manufacturing facilities and things like that, a lot of the time, people will put on an office building on the side in the front. Maybe it's 2 stories on the warehouse or 3 and they'll put a one-story office building.\n A lot of the time when they seek to add differentiation, they'll do it with an architectural metal set up either on the roof or the roof on the wall. And again, value-add, highly specified and wrapping it into that whole warranty system that Carlisle can provide really gives us some great expanded market potential to go after. \nSaree Boroditsky: I appreciate the color. And then just one last one, just so we're on the same page. You have net interest expense guidance for the year of $20 million. You had $10 million of interest expense this quarter. So just how you're getting to build that interest income through the year would be helpful. \nKevin Zdimal: Yes. It really comes down to the timing of CIT. When we closed, we're expecting to close at the end of May, sometime in that range as far as CIT, hard to say with regulatory approvals, out of our control, but all is going well there, and we have no concerns.\n But as far as forecasting interest income when you're getting $2 billion, makes it a little bit more challenging. So what we had this year, we did have the acquisition of MTL for $410 million. So we have to take that into consideration as well that we expect to close early May.\n And then the interest rate, we're not expecting the cuts now that we might have been looking at, at the beginning of the year, so that will increase our interest income. So net that positive against the MTL use of cash. We still think the net interest expense of around $20 million is a good number to use. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. \nDavid S. MacGregor: Congratulations on the great quarter. Yes, really strong results. I guess on the CWT, excuse me, business, I just wanted to get a sense of the lower carryover prices for 2023. What percentage of segment revenues were that represented? \nKevin Zdimal: So as far as the carryover in the first quarter was down mid-single digits. \nMehul Patel: David, from the segment side of it, it's probably roughly 30% of the business. That's where the selected price decreases were last year. \nDavid S. MacGregor: Right. Okay. That was the question, 30%. And then Kevin has provided a little bit of granularity around kind of the price cost and you talked a little bit about the volume leverage, but just trying to piece it all together here. So let me just ask you if you could just talk directly on that 66% EBITDA growth. How much of that was volume leverage? How much of it was favorable price/cost? Can I guess, get you to go back and just provide some numbers around that? \nKevin Zdimal: You're looking at Q1? \nD. Koch: Q1, yes. \nKevin Zdimal: Yes. So on Q1, yes, substantially all of it on the CCM side, you can just put the 40% incrementals in there and then price cost pretty much offset each other on the CCM side. And that number would drop right to the bottom line on EBITDA in the 40%, and that explains that segment.\n On the CWT side, also ultimately that slight volume increase, but then most of their pickup was a combination of these operating efficiencies with the synergies that we talked about and then the balance is price cost. So that they had positive price cost that CWT in the first quarter, close to $10 million. \nD. Koch: $10 million. Yes, you referenced that earlier. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten from Zelman. \nAdam Baumgarten: Just thinking about the full year outlook and maybe how it tracks back to 1Q, looks like you're expecting kind of flattish end markets ex the destocking and pricing. And if I back out the destocking in 1Q and CCM and there's some little modestly negative price, it looks like volumes were up maybe 5% or so or mid-single digits. So do you expect that to kind of -- as you get tougher comps maybe come down throughout the year? Just given the strong start to the year. \nKevin Zdimal: So as you remove the destock number, we just -- we won't talk about that, but just talking end markets, we're expecting reroof to be up mid-single digits. And then we do expect new construction down high single digits. So overall, that might be a slight positive on the end markets. \nAdam Baumgarten: Yes. I was just trying to get it. I think the first quarter was a bit better than that, it seems, right? \nKevin Zdimal: Yes, we had some positive weather in the first quarter as well. I think if you take that out, then it's going to be pretty consistent. \nAdam Baumgarten: Perfect. Got it. And then just on pricing, it sounds like it's playing out as you expected. Things have been stable since year-end last year throughout the first quarter? \nD. Koch: Yes. I think pricing is playing out. I mean there's a couple of things. One, the destock, we're super pleased that it ended up being around $200 million. We think our projections there on the pricing was right in line the carryover and things seem to be -- there's a lot of turmoil out there around -- in the broader economy that you know about. I don't need to tell you about that from GDP or that. But in our markets, things are progressing pretty much as planned and I'd say stable. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the call over to Chris Koch for closing remarks. Please go ahead. \nD. Koch: This concludes the fourth quarter and full year -- I'm sorry, this concludes our first quarter, excuse me, call and thanks for your participation. And obviously, we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call coming up. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Zdimal",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. \n Our first quarter financial results reflect the strength of our business model and the successful execution of our strategic priorities to start off 2024 on solid footing. \n Looking at our first quarter results on Slide 7. We grew revenue by 23% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, driven by normalization of inventory in the channels, growing reroofing activity, which benefited from pent-up demand, increasing residential starts and favorable weather across the U.S. We leveraged our strong topline performance to expand our EBITDA margins by 530 basis points to 24.2%. Furthermore, we grew our earnings 85% year-over-year to an adjusted EPS of $3.72. The EPS increase was driven by sales growth, margin expansion and share repurchases.\n Looking at our segment highlights, starting with CCM on Slide 8. CCM delivered first quarter revenues of $784 million, up 36% from the first quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by a return to normalization of order patterns, including the end of destocking in the channel, positive reroof activity and favorable weather. CCM adjusted EBITDA increased 66% to $227 million with adjusted EBITDA margin of 510 basis points to 28.9%. This was driven by a combination of leveraging higher volume growth and continued operating efficiencies through the Carlisle operating system.\n Moving to Slide 9. Revenues at CWT decreased 1% year-over-year, primarily due to lower carryover prices from 2023 in select categories. However, despite the revenue decline, we were able to drive adjusted EBITDA growth of 20% to $65 million. This represented an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.7%, expanding 370 basis points from the first quarter of 2023. The margin improvement was driven by operational efficiencies gained through COS, lower input costs through strategic sourcing and the realization of synergies from the Henry acquisition. Synergies from the Henry acquisition are expected to exceed $50 million in 2024, significantly above our deal model estimate of $30 million.\n Slide 10 provides a year-over-year first quarter adjusted EPS bridge items for your reference.\n Moving to Slides 11 through 13. Carlisle ended the first quarter of 2024 with $553 million of cash on hand. We have $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, which we amended in April to extend the maturity to 2029. We generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $156 million and invested $24 million in capital expenditures. We achieved solid cash flow performance for the quarter with a free cash flow margin of 12%, and we remain on pace for a free cash flow margin of over 15% for the full year. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.4x within our target of 1 to 2x. \n We are already making significant progress against the capital allocation goals outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy. We are doing so by reinvesting in our high ROIC building products businesses through continued investment in growth CapEx and returning value to shareholders through dividends including $42 million in dividends paid and repurchasing $150 million of shares during the first quarter of 2024. We are also making synergistic acquisitions that will deliver significant opportunities for value creation such as our recently announced agreement to acquire MTL for $410 million. These actions are collectively aligned with our disciplined capital allocation framework, which forms an integral part of delivering ROIC in excess of 25% and ultimately reaching $40 plus of adjusted EPS by 2030.\n Following the repurchase of $150 million of shares during the first quarter, we have 6.9 million shares remaining under our share repurchase program. Our robust financial position is underpinned by a solid balance sheet and a prudent approach to leverage. This conservative capital structure affords us the ability to strategically allocate resources in pursuit of superior returns. Complemented by our substantial liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion, we are well equipped to capitalize on opportunities that arise, unlocking additional value for our stakeholders in the coming quarters and years. And as a reminder, we expect to receive an additional $2 billion of gross proceeds from the CIT sale in the second quarter further enhancing our financial flexibility. We believe we are well positioned to drive additional value creation in the quarters and years ahead.\n Turning to Slide 14. I will discuss our full year financial outlook. We are raising our full year 2024 revenue outlook to approximately 10% growth over the prior year which is double our outlook at year-end when we were expecting a 5% increase. This increase in outlook is driven by a combination of our solid first quarter and stronger reroofing demand for the balance of the year. Leveraging the additional revenue through the Carlisle Operating System along with a more positive outlook on pricing, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by at least 100 basis points as compared to our previous guidance of 50 basis points.\n Additionally, we maintain our expectations to deliver free cash flow margins of at least 15% and ROIC in excess of 25%. As such, we continue to expect double-digit EPS growth in 2024. This is directly aligned with the objectives outlined in our Vision 2030 strategy and we are experiencing a strong start towards our 2030 goal of $40 plus of adjusted EPS. \n Looking at the components of the outlook for CCM, we now expect year-over-year revenue to grow in the low double digits in 2024. The primary drivers are tailwinds from the return to normalization and order patterns that was absent during 2023 due to destocking and strong contractor backlogs from the pent-up reroofing demand. For CWT, we now expect year-over-year revenue to grow in the mid-single digits in 2024 from strong sales execution on key growth initiatives as well as stronger trends in our markets.\n With that, I turn it over to Chris for closing remarks. Yes. Tim, it really goes back to COVID. I mean we've been talking about this for a while that during COVID with regroup, you weren't able -- or contractors weren't able to get on the routes initially. And then when we came out of COVID, we had a strong period of new construction in the last couple of years, and we talked about just due to the lack of labor that some of the reroof was being deferred. They were doing some patch work and some of that resulted in this pent-up demand that we're now seeing come through. And frankly, that's the reason we raised our forecast that a good chunk of the increase, about half of that, was due to the reroof improvement. Yes. The destocking didn't change. We had at about 11% increase for the full year. We still expect it to be about 11%. We had said the dollar amount was $375 million for the year, $200 million in the first quarter, and that's what we saw, the $200 million in the first quarter. So nothing changed on the destock. What did change is both the volume and the price.  \n On the volume side, I just talked about the reroofing coming into the year, we had said we thought the total end market would be down 2% to 3%. Now we think it'll be up slightly. We still think new construction will be down high single digits, but reroof, we think, will be up mid-single digits. And then on pricing, we recently announced some price increases, and we now think that will only be down about 1% for the full year on price where, as you may recall, at the beginning of the year, we thought we'd be down 2% to 3%. So when you sum that all up, we pretty much doubled that 6% of what we're talking about at the beginning of the year for CCM. Yes. When we came into the year, we had said that cost was going to be pretty flat for the year. The raws has been a little bit of a mixed bag on raw materials, some raw materials are up, some are down. So not too much has changed there, but now with pricing getting a little bit better pricing, we think that number will be positive for the full year, maybe a full year up of about $20 million on price cost. Second part of your question, '24 is playing out to be a more normal year for us from the seasonality standfront. At the beginning of the year, we had said sales would be for the second quarter, about 29% of full year sales and Q3, we said about 27% of full year sales, and that seasonality still looks to be holding strong for us. So that would be the best estimate for quarterly revenue for the CCM business. And as far as CWT, that's still consistent with what we talked about in the year-end call as well. Yes. So the $50 million that we see, that's pretty well. We're at that run rate in the first quarter. So about $14 million a quarter is what we're going to get. First quarter of last year was about half of that number. So we did see those synergies in Q1, but we did ramp up as the year went on last year. Yes. And the seasonality, you know that both our businesses very much the summer months as the stronger months. But as we look at CWT specifically, it's really the same as we talked about at the end of the year where we think about 22% of the full year sales would be in Q1 and then Q2 and Q3 are both about 27%. and then you exit with the balance into Q4. As far as EBITDA drop-through, we still see CWT in the low to mid-30s for incrementals and CCM, they're at about 40% on the incrementals. Yes. The first quarter, we got about half of that. And then through the balance of the year, it's pretty much pro rata. Yes. It really comes down to the timing of CIT. When we closed, we're expecting to close at the end of May, sometime in that range as far as CIT, hard to say with regulatory approvals, out of our control, but all is going well there, and we have no concerns.\n But as far as forecasting interest income when you're getting $2 billion, makes it a little bit more challenging. So what we had this year, we did have the acquisition of MTL for $410 million. So we have to take that into consideration as well that we expect to close early May.\n And then the interest rate, we're not expecting the cuts now that we might have been looking at, at the beginning of the year, so that will increase our interest income. So net that positive against the MTL use of cash. We still think the net interest expense of around $20 million is a good number to use. So as far as the carryover in the first quarter was down mid-single digits. You're looking at Q1? Yes. So on Q1, yes, substantially all of it on the CCM side, you can just put the 40% incrementals in there and then price cost pretty much offset each other on the CCM side. And that number would drop right to the bottom line on EBITDA in the 40%, and that explains that segment.\n On the CWT side, also ultimately that slight volume increase, but then most of their pickup was a combination of these operating efficiencies with the synergies that we talked about and then the balance is price cost. So that they had positive price cost that CWT in the first quarter, close to $10 million. So as you remove the destock number, we just -- we won't talk about that, but just talking end markets, we're expecting reroof to be up mid-single digits. And then we do expect new construction down high single digits. So overall, that might be a slight positive on the end markets. Yes, we had some positive weather in the first quarter as well. I think if you take that out, then it's going to be pretty consistent."

            "name": "D. Koch",
            "content": "Thank you, Mehul. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Carlisle's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.\n To start, I'd like to direct your attention to Slide 3 of the presentation. We were pleased with our overall sales growth and margin expansion during the first quarter which reinforces the underlying themes and key strategies we've outlined in Vision 2030.\n First quarter sales of $1.1 billion reflect a 23% year-over-year increase and were in line with our previous comments that destocking ended in Q4 of 2023. We also indicated that we expected a benefit of approximately $200 million of year-over-year sales as a result of a return to normal ordering levels, rebounding as predicted from a Q1 of 2023 that had been negatively affected by destocking. This return to normal ordering patterns was primarily experienced in our CCM business, which demonstrated substantial year-over-year sales growth of 36%.\n Robust reroofing activity from pent-up demand and favorable weather conditions fostering healthy construction activity were additional positive factors that assisted our first quarter performance and more than offset the impact from negative price in Q1 that we had stated in our year-end earnings call.\n In addition to a positive sales story, the Q1 margin story was also a success. Our relentless focus on improving operational efficiency, our commitment to delivering the unparalleled value in the Carlisle experience to our customers and our COS efforts contributed to a strong bottom line result.\n Improved margins across both CCM and CWT drove adjusted EBITDA of over $260 million marking an increase of well over 50% year-over-year. The focus on continuously improving adjusted EBITDA performance was underpinned in Q1 by robust margin expansion bolstered by the increased Henry integration synergies, our commitment to our Lean Sigma initiatives under our flagship Carlisle Operating System and efficiencies gained by leveraging our higher volumes in our operations.\n Pricing continues to be in line with our expectations where we anticipated pricing would be down 2% to 3% for the full year, with substantially all of the impact in the first half of the year. We are bullish on the pricing outlook for the balance of the year based on the recent price increases announced by the major competitors in our industry. Additionally, we achieved substantial growth in adjusted EPS of over 80% year-over-year. Our steadfast dedication to the Carlisle experience, operational excellence, innovation, synergistic acquisitions and organic investments continues to contribute to our superior performance and solidify Carlisle's position for sustained success in the future.\n Carrying on with the theme of positioning Carlisle for sustained success in the future, we were pleased to follow the delivery of our Vision 2030 plan in December of last year with the announcement that we are selling the Carlisle Interconnect business and taking the final step in delivering on our commitment to become a pure-play building products company. \n In January, we reached an agreement with the Amphenol Corporation to acquire our CIT business. We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of this year. The anticipated proceeds from the sale of nearly $2 billion will be strategically deployed to fund further acquisitions, execute approximately $1 billion in share repurchases and fuel additional organic growth initiatives. \n In our pursuit of generating significant value creation through strategic investments, we're excited to announce the acquisition of MTL, a Wisconsin-based specialty manufacturer of high-performance metal edge and wall systems. The acquisition of MTL is perfectly aligned with Carlisle's Vision 2030 strategy and our four criteria for all acquisitions. And as a reminder, those criteria are: one, a solid organic growth story; two, meaningful hard synergies; three, a talented management team, and lastly, a clear and easily actionable integration playbook. \n Our acquisitions are always aimed at enriching and expanding our building envelope product offerings. The planned MTL acquisition and CIT divestiture reinforce our commitment to our pure-play building product strategy, our philosophy of superior capital allocation and ultimately driving best-in-class ROIC.\n And lastly, we are very pleased to have continued our long-standing tradition of returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in Q1. During Q1, we completed $150 million in share repurchases as part of our plan to repurchase $1.4 billion worth of shares in 2024. We also paid $42 million in dividends in the first quarter as we continue to be proud of our history of having raised our dividend for over 47 consecutive years. These actions underscore our commitment to enhancing shareholder value and our confidence in Carlisle's long-term growth trajectory.\n Please turn to Slide 4 as I discuss our Vision 2030 value creation drivers and targets. After completing Vision 2025 3 years early, we are now fully engaged in building on Vision 2025 success and the execution of Vision 2030. As outlined in our Vision 2030 video, we plan to continue delivering on the foundational strategies that have produced such positive results under Vision 2025. Coupled with major secular tailwinds, we are committed to delivering innovative building envelope solutions, driving above-market growth and unlocking additional value for shareholders in this next important phase of Carlisle's growth journey.\n The key pillars of Vision 2030 include enhanced levels of innovation with a commitment to investing 3% of sales to drive the creation of new products and solutions that add value to our customers through advancements in sustainability, energy and labor efficiency. A continued emphasis on synergistic M&A as demonstrated by our recent agreement to acquire MTL, which aligns seamlessly with our strategy to enhance and expand our building envelope product portfolio, attracting and retaining top talent to ensure we have the best talent to execute our strategic initiatives and drive above-market growth, and holding steadfast to our sustainability commitments as evidenced by our progress in 2023 against our stated objectives, which you can find in our latest corporate sustainability report.\n As we move forward, we are confident that the execution of Vision 2030 will drive superior shareholder returns and position Carlisle as a premier investment opportunity in the building products sector. \n Turning to Slide 5. Our planned acquisition of MTL is directly aligned with our goal to invest prudently in high-returning businesses with best-in-class building envelope products and solutions that expand and complement our existing system offerings. With an expected close in the second quarter of 2024, MTL reinforces Carlisle as an industry leader in the multibillion dollar architectural metal market and is expected to add approximately $0.60 of adjusted EPS in 2025 with over $13 million of hard cost synergies expected within the first 3 years. MTL's values are highly aligned with Carlisle's, especially with respect to MTL's superior customer focus and solid track record of above-market growth.\n Now please turn to Slide 6 as I share recent updates on our progress with Carlisle sustainability initiatives. We seek to positively impact the environment while creating value for all our stakeholders through the 3 pillars of our sustainability strategy, which are: one, manufacturing energy-efficient products; two, minimizing our value chain greenhouse gas emissions; and three, diverting waste and end-of-life materials from landfills. \n Under our first pillar, we provide our end user customers access to solutions that drive energy efficiency in their buildings. As I mentioned earlier, in 2023, we made significant progress against this pillar with $3.2 billion in lead qualified product sales, representing an impressive 70% of our total revenue, which is up from 65% in 2022, reflecting the increasing demand and trends for more energy-efficient buildings. \n Our second pillar, reducing our operational and value chain emissions, helps Carlisle reduce our carbon footprint and environmental impacts. Carlisle began Phase 1 of metering the significant energy users or SEUs at our major manufacturing facilities. The data that results from metering this equipment will enable our plants to conduct real-time energy analysis and make more informed decisions on energy efficiency. In Q1, Carlisle installed metering at our Tooele, Utah, polyiso and membrane facility. \n Lastly, our third pillar focuses on the reduction of construction waste entering landfills. In 2023, Carlisle's recycling initiatives enabled the diversion of over 90,000 metric tons of waste from landfills through operational scrap reduction, purchase recycled raws and rooftop takeoffs. Significant contributors were the purchased recycled content of polyiso facer paper and polyols as well as 30,000 tons of recycled metal from the CAM business unit.\n Sustainability is a very important focus for Carlisle. As an organization, we remain committed to being a responsible environmental stakeholder and our products continue to offer a strong value proposition in a world looking for energy-efficient, value-added solutions.\n Our first quarter results reinforced many of the themes we discussed in our Vision 2030 presentation, including being well positioned to leverage megatrends in energy efficiency, labor savings and growing reroof demand within the building envelope marketplace. With this in mind and in combination with the strength of our first quarter results, we are increasing our full year 2024 growth outlook.\n And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to provide additional financial details. Kevin? Thanks, Kevin. \n In conclusion, I want to reiterate our confidence in Carlisle's strategic direction under Vision 2030 and reinforced by our strong first quarter results. \n As we move forward, our ability to innovate with a focus on energy efficiency and labor-saving solutions puts us on the right path to drive above-market growth and in return drive superior financial results. The simplification of our Building Products portfolio, combined with a robust free cash flow engine and the anticipated proceeds from the sale of CIT places us in an excellent position to create further significant value for our shareholders. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to once again express my sincere gratitude to all of Carlisle's employees. The exceptional efforts of all of our team members have ensured a strong start to what we expect will be another exceptional year for Carlisle in 2024. And with Vision 2030 already deeply embedded in our operations, I'm incredibly optimistic about Carlisle's long-term success. Our strong brand, solid capital position and superb cash flow generation provides us with the flexibility to successfully execute our strategy and unlock additional value for all our stakeholders. \n Thank you, everyone, for your continued support. Together, we are building a brighter future for Carlisle. \n And that concludes our formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Well, overall Susan, as we really look at three areas on the initiatives. I think we talked about margin -- or customer intimacy, really this involves a lot of contractor training, architect training. Our digital experience is getting better and better. We've done a lot of work with the -- enhancing the sales excellence of our teams. Things like optimizing our quote process really cross-selling, trying to increase dollars per square foot. And I think it is taking a hold. We've really got into a lot of the selling initiatives last year, and I do think they're starting to show up in sales. \n We also talk about innovation. Innovation is, for us, under Vision 2030 is a longer, obviously, a much longer total play. But we're already seeing new products at the market at a higher rate. We're investing a little bit more, as you can see in our SG&A. And I think that will continue to gain momentum. \n Last year, in January, we introduced a 16-foot TPO, had a product called ReadyFlash in April, and we're going to introduce some other products coming out. One of them is SeamShield, that's going to be introduced in Q2 of '24. So we continue to build momentum there. Obviously, our commitment to moving up to 3% is going to take a couple of years, but we should see increased momentum every quarter as we continue to drive innovator CCM and frankly, CWT. \n And then lastly, it's really this operational excellence, and that's just an ongoing expectation that we're getting in that 1% to 2% of sales through COS every year. AI in our factories are still starting to work on to improve efficiency, everything from the quote process to actually how we deal with the data coming off the line to become a little bit more -- maybe anticipate any quality issues that may come about by looking at the data. \n We also are trying to do a better job of forecasting through using AI and then really driving the sustainability efforts through our factories too, to drive efficiency. So trying to use less product in the whole process, trying to have less waste throughout it, whether it's freight or whether it's actually movement of goods within the factories, just trying to reduce waste. And in turn, I think that produces a nice efficiency program there not just for energy, but in all ways, and we're starting to see returns there. \n So when we look at the gains that we've had over the last 5 to 10 years, a lot of these things have played into it. I think we're doing a better job of articulating it, but we continue to see some pretty good margin expansion. And I think Henry is probably the latest, best example where in each quarter, we continue to see margin expansion. And in this last one, even on doubt sales. So a bit of a long answer for you, but I try to be a little more context and maybe Kevin wants to give more granularity. Yes. In terms of what we're working at, the cross-selling is helping some new initiatives around sales, automation within the factories. We're doing a better job of I think managing our efficiency within our factories. How it comes through on the P&L, I would defer to Kevin on that one. Yes, I don't think there's any price pressure you weren't aware of that came through. We just lapped that. And as we detailed that it will -- the way pricing would work, we were probably down 4%, 5% around the first quarter, we'll move to probably 2%, 3% in the second. Then if you think about the third quarter, it will be flat. And then based upon what we're seeing on the pricing increases that have come out ours and others, Garik, I think it works, it doesn't hit on day 1. It takes a little bit to get into the bidding and that. And so we would anticipate then that we might be up 1% to 2% in the fourth quarter. Yes, let me hit a couple of those and Kevin will pick some up, too. I think on weather, maybe 2 to 3 days depending on where you were in the country, obviously, that has a big -- whether in the Northwest or your volume, I mean, compared to some others. I know some have people have announced that they had a weaker impact due to weather. So I think that depends on where you're at. For us about 2 to 3 days. The destock being over -- that was a big deal going into the end of the year. I think we were a little conservative around that. Now we had talked about $200 million in Q1. As you're sitting there in the Q1 call and you're not seeing much of it unfold yet, you want to be conservative, and I was pretty pleased that we got all of that. And then the destocking was over.\n We also picked up, we think, some extra reroofing, which was good. That seemed to build in the quarter. So overall, I think that might have had a little bit to do, especially the conservatism around the $200 million around why we might be a little bit heavier than expected. You asked about inventory building. I think with our data, what are conversations on that are showing in the first quarter is that really a lot of the channel, while the destock is over, we're not seeing a huge build in inventory. I think as we get closer to the season, people are still concerned about, obviously, the carrying cost of inventory or higher now than they have been. Maybe a little bit of conservatism around getting burned again on having too much inventory.\n So if demand holds up, obviously, they're all -- that will need to be addressed, and we think we're in a good position to be able to address that increased demand even if distributors aren't carrying and contractors aren't carrying as much inventories maybe we would like them to have going into the season. Thanks, Bryan. Yes. Let me take the first one. Kevin can give you that walk through the year. And what we're seeing out in the CWT market is really -- on the resi side, just this idea that there still is an underlying need for additional housing units. When we look at and we see builders still buying land and still making investments in that, addressing that demand, we're optimistic about that for the year. I think could there be a blip? Could there be some hesitation as people digest things around the stuff we've seen today, like the GDP or first were 2 or 3 cuts and now we're headed perhaps to not as many. But I think resi again, that underlying demand is going to continue to be a drumbeat as we go through the year or the need for additional housing units.\n We get to the commercial, I think it's really -- it depends on the segment. Obviously, the office and retail side for CWT has been a bit tough, not to be, I think, expected. I think it could be expected, excuse me. Warehousing a little bit tough, too. And then when you get into health care, education, government spending, those tended to be positive. So as we look across that portfolio segments, kind of a mixed bag.\n And then really when we looked out at the margin, and we continue to anticipate driving improved margin, it's really around automation, first of all, and that's something that I think Carlisle brought to the table, and you've seen it in CCM, and you're going to see it run through CWT this year, next year is just this idea that we're approving the factories. We've talked about it before, being more efficient, applying COS and Lead Sigma.\n And then innovation. We've got innovation running as well and building in CWT. And then lastly, this positive price/cost spread that they're seeing should be helpful in the year too. I think we were probably a little bit more to the cost savings side on raw materials in the first quarter than the negative impact on price. So -- and we should also see as volume continues to improve that 1% volume, we get more volume to the factories, we see some benefits from that, too. \n So Kevin, do you want to talk about the [ walks ]? Right. Well, MTL is just a great company. The leader of MTL, Tony Mallinger, has done a great job over the years of driving some wonderful performance. And it really centers around edge metal, which as we've talked about before, edge metal goes on basically every low roof that we put on. And so that's something that MTL brings to us. We think that's a big benefit to get that into the Carlisle specification, to get that into the Carlisle warranty. You know what happens there.\n Also, there's some architectural and other metal products that they have that are value accretive. They actually have patents on a lot of things, something that you wouldn't expect in an edge metal or perhaps an architectural metal business. But this patented technology just shows you the type of innovation that Tony and his team have been bringing to the market through the years.\n So the addition really fits when we look right down the line from the specification, integrating it into our portfolio, being able to train our contractors, being able to offer to our contractors. And we also think there are going to be some good synergies by bringing MTL into the Drexel and Peterson group as well and having a much, much more complete product line in metal as well as the synergies when we think about raw material purchases, the volume of that metal adds when we think about shipping and other things like that. So a good addition.\n And I think when we look back to what we said it would be -- I think we had about $0.25 accretion in -- on EPS in '24 and then something like $0.60 in 2025. So right away, some good benefits there. And I think are targeted and stated savings and synergies was going to be up $13 million. But my expectation, and I think as the team gets into it, is that we'll exceed that just like we did with Henry. Yes, I definitely think that it's growing at a higher rate. I think you could probably say -- probably stick with your 2x GDP. One of the things that the metals business brings to us is obviously the flexibility of the product line, and that's something that obviously is a huge benefit.\n The metals market is -- I think we had 800 -- $1 billion market, there's plenty for us to go after. We also want to go after more what I would say, prefab applications where we're doing it in the factory and we're getting more standardization along product lines and shipping that out.\n So I can give you more information, Saree, if you want to ask -- that's about where I would stop or I'll just keep talking about the metal business. But it's a good business. It's very complementary. We talked about edge metal. The other thing I would just add is that when we look at a lot of the buildings that have flat roofs on them, especially warehouses and small manufacturing facilities and things like that, a lot of the time, people will put on an office building on the side in the front. Maybe it's 2 stories on the warehouse or 3 and they'll put a one-story office building.\n A lot of the time when they seek to add differentiation, they'll do it with an architectural metal set up either on the roof or the roof on the wall. And again, value-add, highly specified and wrapping it into that whole warranty system that Carlisle can provide really gives us some great expanded market potential to go after. Q1, yes. $10 million. Yes, you referenced that earlier. Yes. I think pricing is playing out. I mean there's a couple of things. One, the destock, we're super pleased that it ended up being around $200 million. We think our projections there on the pricing was right in line the carryover and things seem to be -- there's a lot of turmoil out there around -- in the broader economy that you know about. I don't need to tell you about that from GDP or that. But in our markets, things are progressing pretty much as planned and I'd say stable. This concludes the fourth quarter and full year -- I'm sorry, this concludes our first quarter, excuse me, call and thanks for your participation. And obviously, we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call coming up. Thank you."
