[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please also note today\u2019s event is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference call over to Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Wabtec\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2020 earnings call. Joining me this morning are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, Pat Dugan; and Senior VP of Finance, John Mastalerz. During our call today, we will be discussing earnings release that we issued earlier this morning. Our slides from today news release and financial disclosures were posted on our website earlier today and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Please note that some of the statements we\u2019re making today are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements, please see those disclosures in our earnings release, presentation and SEC filings. We will also be discussing non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. And now I will turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining today\u2019s call. Before we dive into the presentation, I\u2019d like to begin by thanking our global team for their resilience and strong performance in 2020. In a year challenged by the pandemic, they work tirelessly day in and day out to protect the charter and to keep our operations delivering for our customers. They remain disciplined on cost management, executed in the face of many challenges and help to strengthen our financial position and ultimately delivered results for our shareholders. I\u2019m proud of our team and the performance we\u2019ve delivered as you can see on Slide 3. Total sales for the year were $7.6 billion. This was driven largely by international freight market services and a recovery in Transit, but offset by global disruption due to the pandemic. Adjusted operating margin was 15.1% driven by cost actions and execution on our synergies. In 2020, we exceeded expectations by delivering a 200 basis point margin improvement in Transit where our team continues to drive improved project execution, productivity, and cost actions. Total cash conversion was strong with cash flow from operations of $784 million, which included roughly $220 million in one-time impacts related to transaction, restructuring and litigation expenses. Cash generation was driven in part by good working capital management. These allowed us to deliver on our financial priorities of investing in the business, paying down more than $300 million in debt, which includes the tax obligation to General Electric and returning roughly $300 million of capital to shareholders. Total multi-year backlog was over $21 billion and up sequentially over the prior quarter providing us better visibility into 2021 and beyond. We ended the year with adjusted EPS of $3.79. Our teams continue to take action to manage what\u2019s in our control, perfect the long-term growth of the company and improve competitiveness while delivering shareholder value. In terms of synergies, we\u2019ve delivered over $150 million in net synergies during 2020, and we\u2019re on track to deliver the full run rate of $250 million in synergies in 2021. To achieve these goals, we are taking further actions on structural costs. In 2020, we reduced headcount by 12%. We drove a 10% reduction across our operational footprint, and we have started a lean reset across the company to remove waste, maximize competitiveness across our product lines and advance our culture of continuous improvement. Here\u2019s the GE Transportation merger, total rooftops have been reduced by more than 30% and total headcount by 16%. And today, we have accepted more than 90% of the GE shared services ahead of schedule. Throughout the year, we also never lost sight of investing in growth. We extended our leadership position in autonomous operations, helping more than 70 customers successfully meet the deadline for Positive Train Control. We also closed a strategic digital order for Trip Optimizer zero to zero. This is an advanced technology that allows a customer to start a train from zero miles per hour and stop the train automatically using various controls that are integrated with Positive Train Control. In 2020, we also further strengthen our role as leaders in decarbonizing global rail transportation by developing new technologies that reduce emissions and try fuel efficiency. We built, shift, and tested the world\u2019s first heavy-haul battery electric locomotive. We\u2019re proud to share this locomotive is currently in revenue operating service with BNSF in California. And it will be a game changer in decarbonizing rail. In 2020, we extended battery technology to passengers as well by closing a significant deal with New York City Transit to drive down their overall carbon footprint. We have also reduced the weight, life cycle costs, and braking distance of a transit train with solutions like NaturoFlex for which we secured a key order in Singapore. And finally, we are improving air quality inside transit cars with the launch of BlueFilter and advanced air filtration system. And as we highlighted last quarter, our order pipeline could choose to strengthen. And we started to see that pipeline convert in the fourth quarter. Book-to-bill at the end of the quarter was 0.99 versus 0.89 in the third quarter. And we will continue to have positive momentum throughout 2021. Global freight volumes and equipment utilization have sequentially improved since the trough in the second quarter. And we are continuing to see uneven yet continued sequential recovery. This aligns with what you\u2019ve heard from our customers as well. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we secured a strategic international locomotive order and throughout the year built on our strong install base closing several long-term service agreements. We have also expanded our global technology footprint in key regions like the Americas, Russia-CIS and India. Demand for reliability and productivity will only accelerate as we continue to differentiate Wabtec into market. Quarter to-date, we closed the significant multi-year order for modernizations and long-term service agreements. And we\u2019re well-positioned for mods growth, overhauls and parts demand, especially as railroads recover. Based on these factors and orders Wabtec is in a strong position to drive profitable growth and continue to perform for our shareholders, for our customers and for our employees in the short and long-term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pat who will review the quarter, segment performance and our overall financial position. Pat?\nPat Dugan: Thanks, Rafael, and good morning, everyone. Our execution through a very challenging year demonstrated our ability to move quickly to reduce costs, generate strong cash flow, strengthen our financial position, allocate capital and position Wabtec for long-term profitable growth. Now turning to Slide 4, I\u2019ll review the fourth quarter in more detail. Sales continue to recover sequentially in both Freight and Transit up 9% from the third quarter. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2 billion, which reflects a 15% decrease versus the prior year driven mainly from the disruption across our Freight and Transit segments caused by the pandemic. For the quarter, operating income was $161 million and adjusted operating income was $283 million, which was down 22% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income excluded pre-tax expenses of $122 million of which $71 million was for non-cash amortization and $51 million of cost related to one-time IT synergy related expenses along with restructuring due to 2021 locomotive volumes and restructuring in our UK operations. Adjusted operating margin was lower than the fourth quarter last year, mainly driven by under absorption costs at our manufacturing facilities stemming from roughly 40% fewer locomotive deliveries, as well as sales mix impacted from lower parts and higher level of Transit sales. During the fourth quarter, we took additional and aggressive operational and structural cost actions that will continue to drive margin improvement sequentially through 2021. Looking forward, we expect to seasonal first quarter with some volume impacts, as you ever heard our customers describe. That said for the full year, we expect sequential improvement to result in a higher adjusted operating margin and profitable growth across both our Freight and Transit segments. At December 31, our multi-year backlog was $21.6 billion, up about $200 million quarter-over-quarter or rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multi-year backlog was $5.5 billion and continues to provide good visibility into the year. Looking at some of the detailed line items for the fourth quarter adjusted SG&A expense declined 22% year-over-year to $205 million. This was the result of swift cost actions during the downturn and excludes $30 million of restructuring and transaction expenses. SG&A expense benefited from headcount reductions and the realization of synergies. Engineering expenses decreased from last year. This was largely due to lower volume outlook as well as some changes in project timing. Amortization expenses were $71 million. For 2021, we expect non-cash amortization expense to be about $280 million and depreciation expense of about $180 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%. We expect a full year 2021 effective tax rate of about 26%. In the fourth quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.46 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.98. Now let\u2019s take a look at the segment results on Slide 5. Across the Freight segment, total sales decreased 20% from last year to $1.3 billion, but we\u2019re up 8% sequentially from the third quarter as Freight end markets continue to recover globally. In terms of product lines, equipment sales were up sequentially from the third quarter, but down 32% year-over-year, mainly due to timing of locomotive deliveries, which we have discussed, can often vary quarter-to-quarter. In line with improving freight traffic, our services sales improved 7% sequentially, but were down slightly versus the same period last year. This was largely driven by lower parts sales due to continued high locomotive parkings, as well as the timing of overhauls. We expect our services sales to continue to improve with the gradual recovery in freight volumes, un-parking of locomotives and higher demand from mods. Digital electronics sales were down 22% year-over-year, as orders shifted to the right in North America due to COVID disruption. Yet we closed the fourth quarter with strong order momentum and continue to see significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line, as customers focused on safety and improve productivity. Component sales were down 22% year-over-year. This is compared to a 58% lower railcar build year-over-year, demonstrating the diversification within our components business. Since the third quarter, we have seen signs of improvement in demand for aftermarket components as more railcars come out of storage. Freight segment adjusted operating income was $218 million for an adjusted margin of 16.3%. The benefit of synergies and cost actions were offset by sales mix and services and digital electronics, as well as under absorption of cost. As always, we will continue to execute on our synergy plans and further improve costs as part of our lean efforts. Finally, segment backlog was $17.9 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter. Turning to Slide 6, across our Transit segment, sales decreased 2% year-over-year to $684 million, driven largely by disruptions stemming from COVID-19. OE sales were up 2% year-over-year, demonstrating continued investments in green infrastructure. Aftermarket sales were down 6% from last year. However, we remain positive on the aftermarket and expect sales to continue to improve as transit ridership and services increased globally. Adjusted segment operating income was $77 million, which was up 40% year-over-year for an adjusted operating margin of 11.3%. Across the segment, we continue to drive down costs, improve project execution and risk management, as noted by our strong operating performance. We are pleased with the momentum underway and will continue to execute on more actions to drive increased profitability for the segment. Finally, Transit segment backlog was $3.7 billion, which was up about 5% versus last quarter. Now let\u2019s turn to our financial position on Slide 7. Despite a year of significant challenges, we generated $784 million of operating cash flow, demonstrating the resiliency of our business. Cash flow was driven by conversion of net income and good working capital management, including improved inventory levels and higher customer deposits. Of note, we had about $220 million of one-time impacts on cash flow during the year, mainly due to prior restructuring transaction and litigation charges. Restructuring costs in 2021 will result in further structural cost reductions, but we expect the overall level of one-time impacts to be less in 2021. For the full year, total CapEx was $136 million. In 2021, we expect CapEx to be about $180 million or about 2% of expected sales. Overall, our strong cash generation allowed us to execute on our strategic plans and capital allocation priorities. Throughout the year, we continued to strengthen our financial position and reduce debt by about another $190 million, bringing our total debt down by $723 million since the merger with GE Transportation. During the fourth quarter, we also made our first payment to GE of $115 million for our Tax Matters Agreement. Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.7 times and our liquidity is at a robust $1.9 billion. Over the course of the year, we returned $300 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share buyback. And as we announced this morning, our board approved a renewal on our share buyback authorization for up to $500 million. As you can see in these results, our balance sheet remains strong and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash flow generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital to grow shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call back over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Pat. And turning to Slide 8, let\u2019s look at some of the segment dynamic setting to 2021. Starting with freight by product line. North America freight has mostly gone through a reset, our services business has recovered and we\u2019re working through the trust in our OE business, due to locomotive deliveries are expected in North America in 2021. Total locomotive deliveries will be down roughly 35% year-over-year, driven mainly by North American locomotive deliveries down by more than 100 units versus 2020. This volume headwinds will create margin pressure due to under absorption at our manufacturing facilities. Our international pipeline remains strong and order momentum continues to build. In mining, we\u2019re optimistic as conditions are continuing to improve. When it comes to North America railcar build, rail cars are coming back into use, roughly 24% of the North American railcar fleet still remains in storage, which is similar to a pre-COVID level. Builders are taking continued step to slow down production and forecast estimates that railcar build for this year to be around 25,000 cars. The freight services, we are seeing year-over-year pressure on parts, due to higher levels of parkings. Demand for reliability and productivity will improve as railroads continue to recover, which as I shared earlier, but as in a position of strength from modernizations, overhauls and parts demand. And digital electronics were focused on growing PTC internationally. In 2021, we have contracts to install over 3,000 horsepower per ton upgrades to our Trip Optimizer systems, our new record. While we anticipate North American CapEx budgets to remain constraint, the long-term outlook is strong. Now transitioning to transit, we expect to grow on both OE and aftermarket as ridership recovers from historic lows. Infrastructure spending will continue in line with green initiatives as governments continue the churn to rail as the cleanest, safest and the most efficient means of transport. And I\u2019ll expand on that in just a minute. For 2021, we expect revenues in a range of $7.6 billion to $7.9 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.30 and cash conversion is expected to be greater than 90% for the full year. Across our segments, recovery is underway and will continue as customers experience volume growth and reinvest in their operations. We\u2019re seeing it already in some areas and we expect sequential improvements in both aftermarket services and international locomotives. In 2021, we expect orders to exceed anticipated sales, budding Wabtec in an even stronger position to drive profitable growth. With that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 9, to discuss the importance of sustainability and the strategic direction we\u2019re driving as a company. At Wabtec, we are determined to have a lasting impact on our industry and the world. Last year, we launched the company\u2019s first sustainability report and provided a detailed look at how we\u2019re building a more sustainable future by strengthening our corporate governance framework, which guides how we operate, how we innovate and how we drive growth. We also laid out our strategy on how we\u2019re taking on some of the world\u2019s toughest challenges, including climate change in automation by creating cleaner, more fuel efficient solutions, like the FLXdrive locomotive. As noted earlier, this is the world\u2019s first battery electric locomotive. And it\u2019s currently being tested in revenue service by BNSF in California. So far, we\u2019re seeing opportunity to reduce fuel consumption by 10% to 30% with significant interest from customers in North America and internationally. We\u2019re also reducing our own carbon footprint, driving down energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions across our facilities. When it comes to our employees, we\u2019re building a company culture grounded in meritocracy and integrity, one that embraces diversity in all forms and invest in its people and communities. To deliver on this vision, we outlined specific targets for how we plan to drive measurable impact. Our 30 by 30 strategy sets define matrix to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and more by at least 30% by 2030, making our commitment clear to both for our customers and our shareholders. We are making good advancement on these efforts, as you can see here and throughout our report. As we continue to build and even stronger Wabtec, we will be a driving force in transitioning to industry to a more sustainable future. And with that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 10. As you\u2019ve heard this morning, our strategic plan has empowered us to innovate and has given us a clear framework to execute on our commitments, to generate strong cash flow and to drive continued shareholder value. And it will continue to guide us as we expand our international install base, as we accelerate growth in digital electronics and services, while farther transforming our transit business. We are two years into our integration. We have delivered on our synergies. We have delivered on increased shareholder value and we\u2019ve positioned Wabtec in our customers for competitive advantage. Heading into 2021, we will drive margin expansion through prioritized cost actions and continue to invest in growth, creating new technologies that strengthen our leadership position on decarbonization and automation with the same determination and focus that has brought us here today. Before I turn the call over to questions, I want once again, personally, thank every member of the Wabtec team for what they have delivered in 2020 and the works they will continue to deliver in 2021. Thank you. And with that, Kristine.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Raphael. We will now move on to questions. But before we do, out of consideration for others on the call, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. With that operator, we are now ready to take our first question\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, our first question comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just want to go back to the comments around the new \u2013 I guess, the new locomotive, the electric locomotive, obviously understanding the North America market is pretty challenge right now. Could you maybe walk us through the process from pilot? I know, you said there\u2019s interest. This is something that would be revenue generating in 2022. Just trying to think of how that progression would work.\nRafael Santana: Okay. Allison, fuel is one of the biggest costs for our customers, I\u2019d say, they are heavily focused on driving fuel efficiency across your operations. This combined with the growing focus on ESG and the need for decarbonization, I think positions the FLXDrive as a unique product to really address this challenges. We\u2019re actively working with customers in North America and internationally between sort of this technology and their operations. Proposals are out, but we do not have sales of this product into a 2021 or 2022 at this point.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then just on Transit, there\u2019s a lot of obviously news around government fund in the U.S., it\u2019s a little less clear what\u2019s going on internationally. Any color that you can provide just sort of where we are in terms of that type of funding internationally for you guys.\nRafael Santana: Allison, we\u2019re seeing \u2013 I would say continued commitments to Transit overall, in terms of transportation. And we\u2019re saying called the continuation of projects. We have not seen cancellations at this point. In fact, we have a lot of discussions regarding new projects with our customers.\nAllison Poliniak: I guess, it\u2019s just in line with that \u2013 would you say, there\u2019s some accelerated discussions based on potential government funding or municipal funding outside of the international markets kind of similar to what we\u2019re seeing here or is it a little different?\nRafael Santana: I think the intensity is growing in the light of well recovering in the markets and I think on the auto side, we seeing our business to stay quite resilient through this time.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Long from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nPat Dugan: Good morning.\nJustin Long: Wanted to start with a question on the Freight segment. So freight margins declined sequentially in the fourth quarter. It looks like, this was mainly a function of mix, but I was wondering if you could provide any color on anything else that drove that sequential weakness. And then looking ahead to 2021, I think Pat, you said margins for both segments should improve, but I was wondering if you could provide any more color about the magnitude of improvement by segment that\u2019s baked into this guidance. Thanks.\nRafael Santana: Let me start Justin, I\u2019ll pass it on to Pat here. But in the fourth quarter, number one, we had a very significant drop in locomotive production. As we go into 2021, we have about a 35% reduction in locomotive volumes, which means no deliveries for North America. And that\u2019s the first time it happens in decades. So we went through a significant restructuring and a couple of facilities in the U.S. that drove under absorption in efficiencies in the quarter with a lower margin rate. We have taken the necessary cost actions in the fourth quarter with significant headcount reductions and we will continue to drive profitable growth, that\u2019s we go into 2021. Mix was also a headwind and that was a function just some of the elements, if you look at byproduct line, you\u2019d think about transit. Aftermarket was actually declines versus a year ago with all we growing and you have some moderate dynamics with both equipment coming down. We put significant step down in locomotive shipments in the quarter and you also had a significant drop into digital electronics revenues.\nPat Dugan: Yes. Just let me add on to that. I mean, the impact in the fourth quarter is really a result of those low locomotive deliveries and we see that continuing into next year. When you look at the full year for next year, you\u2019re asking about kind of guidance or view into the segment margins. We typically haven\u2019t given a lot of information about segment margins in the guidance, but I think if you look at the full year, the full Wabtec view, we expect to be in that with the guidance to be in above 15% kind of range, which is flattish and improving into from 2020 into 2021. We\u2019re committed to the margin improvement on the transit side, like, we\u2019ve talked about in the strategic goals we put out there. And we see the freight margins to improve as we continue to get our synergies that we\u2019ve talked about as we benefit from the cost actions we\u2019ve taken both in the full year and in the fourth quarter on the freight businesses and seeing the mix of business really heading in our favor.\nJustin Long: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And for my second question, I was wondering what you\u2019re assuming for rail volumes in 2021. And if you anticipate your aftermarket business to kind of trend in line with whatever you\u2019re modeling in. And then on buybacks, also curious if that\u2019s something that\u2019s getting factored into this outlook.\nRafael Santana: Let me start with the last parts. Buybacks are not included and guidance we\u2019re providing at this point, Justin. Even though, it is an element of capital allocation as we look forward. The second piece in terms of just the dynamics, I think we are continuing to see sequential improvement. In the fourth quarter, we saw book-to-bill that increased the 0.99, and that\u2019s an improvement versus the average for the year, which was around 0.91. As we had said, I think our pipeline of deals continues to strengthen, we\u2019re off to a strong starter for the year. And as we looking to the elements of what\u2019s taking place, I think there could be some tailwinds associated with the dynamics we\u2019re currently seeing that to some of the elements of weather and services deterioration.\nJustin Long: Okay. I\u2019ll leave it at that. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nPat Dugan: Good morning.\nJerry Revich: I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about, Rafael, your views on alternative fuel locomotives longer term. How attractive you expect hydrogen powered battery fuel cell locomotives to be for the industry. And can you talk about your investments in that area versus battery electric and any of the other areas that you folks are spending R&D dollars on?\nRafael Santana: So we\u2019re stepping up our investments in that area. We call it the decarbonization product portfolio. And in our minds, it starts with really the ability to improve fuel efficiency for customer on existing platforms. So that was our upgrades. There\u2019s a second element that ties it off with the adoption of more biofuel and renewable fuel. So that builds on that stairway. I think, there\u2019s a nodder element here, which is tied to just continue to modernize. So the fleets and you\u2019ve got a still a lot of opportunities to replace three units with two, there\u2019s the element here of battery technologies, which will and can be a game-changer. And you need that in order to actually drive to the next level, which is they use a fuel cell. So that\u2019s how we see the stairway. I think we\u2019re well positioned to lead in all the elements of that stairway. That\u2019s been continued work from us and you\u2019ll see us continue to step up investment on that area.\nJerry Revich: Okay, thank you. And then on the integration and nice to see the $250 million number for 2021 under tough circumstances. Can you just talk about, are there any costs to achieve numbers that are running through the P&L and your adjusted earnings number of things like double counting essentially for support costs between a shared services for GE and you folks, anything that\u2019s happening like that in 2021 that we should be thinking about as we think about the margin structure in 2022?\nPat Dugan: Yes, Jerry, so the \u2013 in 2020, there was obviously cost to separate and we would capture those in our restructuring and transaction costs when we report our numbers. We had \u2013 there were expenditures in order to stand up our own systems and achieve synergies related to separation from GE and get out from the transition service agreements. We had some of those costs come through in the fourth quarter too. And we expect to see some of those going into 2021, but to start to really slow down and get the full benefit. We\u2019re also \u2013 and we have not included that in our guidance. We will treat them the same as we have in 2020. And then when you look into 2021, those efforts are really starting to be behind us. We\u2019re starting to get the full benefit. We have additional synergy projects that will get us $250 million run rate by the end of the year. And but the cost to achieve those synergies will really slow.\nJerry Revich: Just to make sure, I\u2019m on the same page with you and the cost to achieve you\u2019re treating as non-recurring items anyways. So there was no impact on\u2026\nPat Dugan: Exactly. And we\u2019ve been \u2013 same manner that we\u2019ve been treating them since the combination in 2019.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nRob Wertheimer: Just a little bit of a question on the freight international demand, I wonder if you could characterize it that\u2019s a little bit broad-based or just a customer too. And then within that, you touched on mining, I don\u2019t know where mining demand stands now, and whether that\u2019s on the come active dialogue or further head. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: We had mentioned before, I think the recovery, especially, on the equipment side, it\u2019s clearly taking place first internationally. We have gotten a significant order as a result of that in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re continuing discussions and we\u2019re seeing some bright spots there. Whether if you think about that you just mentioned mining or if you think about agriculture exports, we certainly see that in both South America, we see that in Australia, but overall Southeast Asia, we\u2019re quite active there, Russia CIS region. And we\u2019re continuing to expand on delivering our fleet in India as well. But just on mining more specifically, it\u2019s certainly I think a bright spot for us as we look into the year.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nScott Group: Thanks. Good morning, guys. So you made a comment about first quarter seasonality would just be a bit more color there. Can you just talk about it at a high level, if you get a big infrastructure package? What \u2013 how do you staying to benefit from that? One of the key things will either be beneficiaries, if its house be go out and participate in their actually high level outcome that. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Scott, let me start with the last part of your question. I think we are a unique inflection point here to help shape, what I call, a clean energy economy focused around rail. Rail is the most sustainable way of moving both freight and land and large amount of people. So I think policies that incentivize movement by rail will be go both good for the economy, good for the environment, but can stimulate job creation North America we actively working with decent administration in that regard. And with regards to, I think just how we see things progressing throughout the year. I think similar to what you\u2019ve heard from customers, I think you\u2019ll see a sequential improvement. We do have elements of seasonality here into the first quarter. Certainly, weather has impacted our operations in Fort Worth. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re actively working very close with our teams there to assess that impact.\nPat Dugan: Yes. And I would just add Scott, we do have some seasonality that comes from our aftermarket business and in our mining business, just the timing of how orders and projects get landed and the kind of operating rhythm of our customers related to aftermarket and part sales. So first quarter tends to be impacted a lot by all these kind of elements that along with the things that Rafael just talked about.\nScott Group: Just going back to the infrastructure side, can you maybe just talk little more specifically then how you participate in, if there\u2019s going to be some big high speed rail build out or something, [indiscernible] infrastructure on the markets that you touch and how you benefit.\nRafael Santana: Scott, can you repeat that? It\u2019s very difficult to hear you.\nScott Group: Sorry. I\u2019m having a problem with my phone, but I guess I\u2019m trying to understand on the infrastructure side, where specifically you would stand to benefit, do you participate in that big high speed rail build out if that\u2019s just coming, where did you benefit kind of good infrastructure?\nRafael Santana: Scott, we\u2019re working. I think some of the initiatives go right align with the opportunity to improve efficiency for our customers on the fuel side opportunities to look at potentially accelerating some of the introductions of new technologies that help both on driving fuel efficiency, driving more automation, ultimately reducing carbon emissions. So that\u2019s the best way to frame it, so last associated with the high speed rail per se.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nPat Dugan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\nJames Monigan: Hey guys, James on for Chris. Good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nJames Monigan: Just wanted to touch on digital. You mentioned that the orders are sort of gotten pushed out to the right, but the growth outlook just frankly isn\u2019t all that strong. So just wondering if there\u2019s any sort of product life cycle issues there that are creating a headwind, and there\u2019s more underlying growth just kind of wanting to understand sort of the puts and takes to growth within that line in 2021 and sort of how to think about it moving forward.\nRafael Santana: Revenues for the business came down about 2% in 2020 versus the year before. I\u2019d say customers continue to be very committed, Chris on investing in productivity and we have a record number of installs in new products as we highlighted. So the fundamentals are good there. And customers continue to be really committed to drive productivity and investing on that. What we saw also was a good book-to-bill in the fourth quarter. I think we\u2019re continuing to see that as we move into the first quarter, but a key challenge for our team is to drive what I\u2019ll call convertible gain of the year. So think about getting orders that churn into sales within 2021, but back again the fundamentals are of the business are strong.\nJames Monigan: Got it. So it\u2019s more along the lines of essentially a pipeline issue. Is that sort of the right way to think about it? Essentially, there wasn\u2019t as much the sales activity in 2020 sort of bleeding into the realized revenue in 2021. Is that sort of the dynamic there then?\nRafael Santana: Yes, it was a quick way to also eliminate costs within the air pushing some of those decisions to the right.\nJames Monigan: Got it. All right. And then just on the freight revenues outlook broadly just wanting to \u2013 it seems like the guidance at least includes the possibility of freight revenues being down. Just wanted to understand now that at least in the American carloads have turned positive. How to think about freight revenue as this further earn that segments revenue inflecting sustainably positive across the year. Is that like a second half thing? Or should we think about that being something like more than 2022?\nRafael Santana: I\u2019d start with we\u2019re seeing sequential improvement, right. And that has turned the book-to-bill into I\u2019ll call a significant improvement in the fourth quarter. I think we\u2019re continuing to see that improvements, especially quarter to-date. I think we\u2019ve had a strong start for the year with an order for both mods and an order for service agreements, which it\u2019s a real positive. So at this point, I think we\u2019ll see sequential improvement on volume as a result of continued on parking locomotives and freight cars. I think so important to mention here, I think we \u2013 as we look at the quarter to-date, the backlog coverage for the year is better than we had a year ago, but we\u2019re still sitting on \u2013 a significant higher number of locomotives parked versus pre-COVID level. I think the auto elements I\u2019d offer you there is the PSR headwinds that we signed last couple of years impacting demand. I think they\u2019re largely reflecting the network and I\u2019d not be surprised to see potential incremental of a volume created by the combination of this winter weather, deterioration of service levels. And this should be really the first year that we see traffic growth after sometime.\nJames Monigan: All right, got it. Actually in a real quick one, can you just comment on mods year-over-year in the fourth quarter and sort of what you\u2019re thinking about that in 2021 within \u2013 in 2021 and that\u2019s it for me.\nRafael Santana: Significant order quarter to-date, we expect a double-digit growth from the mods number for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey Rafael, Pat, Kristine, thank you. Good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nKen Hoexter: Just maybe can you talk \u2013 Pat, can you talk a bit about the outlook? What are the highs and lows in terms of the parts of the outlook? Can you maybe provide any specifics? I know you said you\u2019re not giving details on Freight or Transit specifically, but maybe just talk about the highs and lows on the other.\nPat Dugan: So the range what would \u2013 how would we get to the high end of the range or the impact of the low end, it\u2019s really going to be driven by the areas we see positivity, it\u2019s a services. It\u2019s a mod, it\u2019s a part sales. And my driver for that is really the rail volumes. When I look at the Transit same thing as the regions and the economies reopened and passenger ridership starts to continue to trend positively. We\u2019ll see those part sales. We have a good visibility into our OE side on Transit and our OE side on Freight, but where the reaching the high end of the range, it\u2019s going to be driven by those items. It\u2019s freight volumes, carloadings, and ridership.\nRafael Santana: I\u2019ll just add. We continue to see strong international opportunities. The pipeline continues to strengthen. This is certainly a trough year for us. When you think about the equipment business and we\u2019re building from there. I mean I can\u2019t remember a year where we had zero deliveries on locomotives, so moving in the right direction.\nKen Hoexter: That\u2019s helpful. And it seems like international is really big part of this. Is there a baseline kind of Pat on or Rafael on the local builds or I guess carload growth that you\u2019ve said as kind of the midpoint that we should look as a starting point just to help us based on that.\nRafael Santana: Subject for the year, I mean we\u2019ve got the backlog in house for what I call new locomotives. So this is really about building forward into 2022, and that\u2019s where the dynamics are positive. You talk about the freight cars kind of all back to the parking levels. We had pre-COVID. There was certainly a significant drop last year with a 58% drop in the freight carbuild. We expect that to be more on the 25,000 for the year. So we have started the year with a positive beat up to this point.\nKen Hoexter: Okay. And then I guess for my follow-up, yes, that was great detail on the electric locomotive test in California. But Rafael, can you take that a step further, the integration of Positive Train Control, your ability to go fully autonomous? What are the next steps for the rails given that the trucks are obviously making strides on pushing autonomy? What is left from your thoughts on the development side for the rails to go fully autonomous?\nRafael Santana:  We took a key step with a order on zero to zero, which is really the ability to start at zero and stop the train at zero. So you talk about moving it and the integration with PTC that really sets the tone of how you can be a lot more autonomous through that process. Some of these steps might vary a little bit on the various class ones, but we have a suite of products in order to support that. So you\u2019ve tied that off with a lot of the elements that I described in terms of our portfolio for de-carbonization. We have a real strong portfolio here to drive growth in this business for the long-term and despite of I call variation here on carloads.\nKen Hoexter: But I guess is there anything technological that you still think is needed or is it just \u2013 is the technology there and it\u2019s just developing.\nRafael Santana: I don\u2019t think the technology is the bottleneck. So we\u2019ve got the elements of technology to drive to that.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks for the colors. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Hi guys, just wanted to dig a little bit more into the comments on margin improvement in Transit as well as Freight for next year. Obviously, you\u2019ve laid the synergies and the pricing and the backlog on Transit. But can you just talk about any headwinds that you\u2019re incorporating into your guidance at this point added some material cost or supply chain headwinds that you\u2019re accounting for.\nRafael Santana: Let me start I think as far as the Transit business, I think we had good progress in the business. The focus continues to be on execution, improving, the quality of the order intake, but also improving, say the metrics to our customers. Margins have improved about 200 basis points. And the team has a good plan to move up and not a 100 basis points this year. I think some of the dynamics on the business might vary depending on well lockdown sort of restrictions that have had a significant impact on ridership, but what has not changed stuff rises, we continue to see a very resilient services business. If you think about ridership down 30%, 50%, 80% levels, as we saw last year, we had a business that the aftermarket came down by single-digits in 2020. On the OE side, we have not seen as I said project constellation, so long-term fundamentals are strong there. I was certainly \u2013 are looking through some of the headwinds you described inflation being one of them. We\u2019ve got our team really actively working with suppliers to make sure that we well-prepared for any of these elements. What I\u2019ll anticipate you, we also have agreements that provide what I call escalation in the case of [indiscernible] but a good amount of work being done by our teams as we speak around that.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay. So would you quantify anything that\u2019s baked into the guidance at this point or\u2026\nRafael Santana: I\u2019d say to while we have visibility to, I think we feel confident about the framework we have provided to you.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay, great. And then just on the Transit recovery again, I know you\u2019ve talked about the improving ridership. Any comment on what you\u2019re seeing and Europe versus U.S. versus Asia in terms of how you expect it to that business recovery next year.\nRafael Santana: I think Asia certainly the ridership is in the higher levels, right. There\u2019s of course some specifics in terms of some of the lockdown, some governments have act on it. I think Europe is come next. As we saw some of these new lockdown measures, you saw what used to be a ridership on the 80%-plus level go down to a more like 50%s and 60%s, but we expect those to resume back up. North America has certainly been on the low end of that spectrum of recovery, but as vaccination takes place, we\u2019ll see those improve across the board.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nSaree Boroditsky: Hi, thanks for filling me in. So historically Wabtec is seeing more maintenance demand related to breakdown in severe winter weather. I know you talked about a weaker start to the year, but is this something that could provide upside to guidance?\nRafael Santana: We\u2019re certainly watching that very closely. We do think that, well, the combination of a severe winter weather conditions, higher volumes, the fact that you have a deterioration of service levels and back to the fact that the 2021 should be the first year that we see traffic growth, yes. That could provide tailwinds.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great. And then you talked about international opportunities and PTC, would that largely be in Brazil or South America? Could you talk about what other regions would be an opportunity for that?\nRafael Santana: I\u2019ll tell you. We just got our first international order and it was not in South America, but we do have opportunities to continue to expand that. And that\u2019s one of the areas of focus of our games.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steve Barger from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteve Barger: Thanks. Good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nSteve Barger: I just want to clarify on the freight revenue question. You talked about headwinds from seasonality and equipment activity levels in the first half. And then on the positive side, you talked about mods orders and backlog coverage. So if I net that out, is it reasonable to think we see positive year-over-year growth in the second half? Or is it too early to tell for the freight segment?\nRafael Santana: We expect to drive what I\u2019ll call profitable growth for overall Wabtec and I should see those dynamics into that segments.\nSteve Barger: Profitable growth in the back half for Freight.\nPat Dugan: Yes. Well, we\u2019re \u2013 again, we said specifically sequential growth, so looking at the quarters. I mean that, that would sort of imply that the second half is going to be stronger to answer your question specifically, yes.\nRafael Santana: Yes, and additional to the seasonality, you see on the first quarter was certainly watching for well that \u2013 weather impacts that we\u2019ve had on our operation in fourth quarter.\nSteve Barger: Yes. I mean just given the seasonality, you\u2019re talking about, it sounds like you\u2019re expecting bigger year-over-year declines in the first half, then you see year-over-year growth in the second half. Is that right?\nPat Dugan: Yes, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at.\nSteve Barger: All right. And you said the impact from one-time costs on operating cash flow will be lower in 2021 than it was last year. Can you put a number on that relative to the $220 million that hit last year?\nPat Dugan: Well, $220 million is the cash flow impact, right. And you have \u2013 I would say roughly half of it is of the cash flow impact is from costs that had been recorded in 2019 paid in 2020. The other half were kind of were costs and impact within the year. And then going forward, we were still working through those costs to achieve synergies and restructuring. We haven\u2019t given any specific guidance on those items, because of the sensitivity to our operations. But we expect those to come down.\nSteve Barger: So well, the $110 million from 2019 paid in 2020 rolls off, of course. So the other $110 million, you would expect to step down from that.\nPat Dugan: That\u2019s exactly right.\nSteve Barger: Okay. So I\u2019ll just squeeze one quick one in, so with conditions, just sequentially improving balance sheets in good shape, cash cost of restructuring coming down, reasonable to think you\u2019ll make significant inroads on the buyback this year.\nRafael Santana: So number one, I think we continue to see opportunities to return value to shareholders through a share buyback. And that\u2019s why our Board has renewed the authorization of $500 million and buybacks. I think our focus starts with driving organic growth. I mentioned the portfolio solutions we have around de-carbonization and automation. They do provide a significant growth opportunity for our business and it\u2019s very much aligned to both productivity and carbon reduction for our customers. So we\u2019re committed to continuing to lead there. And we have increased the step into 2021. And on inorganic, we\u2019re continuing to explore bolt-on acquisitions. We will be opportunistic here. This will be really highly strategic with strong returns that drive higher ROIC and faster profitable growth increasing shareholder value. So that\u2019s fundamentally how we think about capital allocation here going into 2021.\nSteve Barger: Thanks very much.\nRafael Santana: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we\u2019ll end today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone for participating today. We look forward to speaking with you throughout the quarter. Have a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Pat Dugan",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael, and good morning, everyone. Our execution through a very challenging year demonstrated our ability to move quickly to reduce costs, generate strong cash flow, strengthen our financial position, allocate capital and position Wabtec for long-term profitable growth. Now turning to Slide 4, I'll review the fourth quarter in more detail. Sales continue to recover sequentially in both Freight and Transit up 9% from the third quarter. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2 billion, which reflects a 15% decrease versus the prior year driven mainly from the disruption across our Freight and Transit segments caused by the pandemic. For the quarter, operating income was $161 million and adjusted operating income was $283 million, which was down 22% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income excluded pre-tax expenses of $122 million of which $71 million was for non-cash amortization and $51 million of cost related to one-time IT synergy related expenses along with restructuring due to 2021 locomotive volumes and restructuring in our UK operations. Adjusted operating margin was lower than the fourth quarter last year, mainly driven by under absorption costs at our manufacturing facilities stemming from roughly 40% fewer locomotive deliveries, as well as sales mix impacted from lower parts and higher level of Transit sales. During the fourth quarter, we took additional and aggressive operational and structural cost actions that will continue to drive margin improvement sequentially through 2021. Looking forward, we expect to seasonal first quarter with some volume impacts, as you ever heard our customers describe. That said for the full year, we expect sequential improvement to result in a higher adjusted operating margin and profitable growth across both our Freight and Transit segments. At December 31, our multi-year backlog was $21.6 billion, up about $200 million quarter-over-quarter or rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multi-year backlog was $5.5 billion and continues to provide good visibility into the year. Looking at some of the detailed line items for the fourth quarter adjusted SG&A expense declined 22% year-over-year to $205 million. This was the result of swift cost actions during the downturn and excludes $30 million of restructuring and transaction expenses. SG&A expense benefited from headcount reductions and the realization of synergies. Engineering expenses decreased from last year. This was largely due to lower volume outlook as well as some changes in project timing. Amortization expenses were $71 million. For 2021, we expect non-cash amortization expense to be about $280 million and depreciation expense of about $180 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%. We expect a full year 2021 effective tax rate of about 26%. In the fourth quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.46 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.98. Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 5. Across the Freight segment, total sales decreased 20% from last year to $1.3 billion, but we're up 8% sequentially from the third quarter as Freight end markets continue to recover globally. In terms of product lines, equipment sales were up sequentially from the third quarter, but down 32% year-over-year, mainly due to timing of locomotive deliveries, which we have discussed, can often vary quarter-to-quarter. In line with improving freight traffic, our services sales improved 7% sequentially, but were down slightly versus the same period last year. This was largely driven by lower parts sales due to continued high locomotive parkings, as well as the timing of overhauls. We expect our services sales to continue to improve with the gradual recovery in freight volumes, un-parking of locomotives and higher demand from mods. Digital electronics sales were down 22% year-over-year, as orders shifted to the right in North America due to COVID disruption. Yet we closed the fourth quarter with strong order momentum and continue to see significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line, as customers focused on safety and improve productivity. Component sales were down 22% year-over-year. This is compared to a 58% lower railcar build year-over-year, demonstrating the diversification within our components business. Since the third quarter, we have seen signs of improvement in demand for aftermarket components as more railcars come out of storage. Freight segment adjusted operating income was $218 million for an adjusted margin of 16.3%. The benefit of synergies and cost actions were offset by sales mix and services and digital electronics, as well as under absorption of cost. As always, we will continue to execute on our synergy plans and further improve costs as part of our lean efforts. Finally, segment backlog was $17.9 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter. Turning to Slide 6, across our Transit segment, sales decreased 2% year-over-year to $684 million, driven largely by disruptions stemming from COVID-19. OE sales were up 2% year-over-year, demonstrating continued investments in green infrastructure. Aftermarket sales were down 6% from last year. However, we remain positive on the aftermarket and expect sales to continue to improve as transit ridership and services increased globally. Adjusted segment operating income was $77 million, which was up 40% year-over-year for an adjusted operating margin of 11.3%. Across the segment, we continue to drive down costs, improve project execution and risk management, as noted by our strong operating performance. We are pleased with the momentum underway and will continue to execute on more actions to drive increased profitability for the segment. Finally, Transit segment backlog was $3.7 billion, which was up about 5% versus last quarter. Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 7. Despite a year of significant challenges, we generated $784 million of operating cash flow, demonstrating the resiliency of our business. Cash flow was driven by conversion of net income and good working capital management, including improved inventory levels and higher customer deposits. Of note, we had about $220 million of one-time impacts on cash flow during the year, mainly due to prior restructuring transaction and litigation charges. Restructuring costs in 2021 will result in further structural cost reductions, but we expect the overall level of one-time impacts to be less in 2021. For the full year, total CapEx was $136 million. In 2021, we expect CapEx to be about $180 million or about 2% of expected sales. Overall, our strong cash generation allowed us to execute on our strategic plans and capital allocation priorities. Throughout the year, we continued to strengthen our financial position and reduce debt by about another $190 million, bringing our total debt down by $723 million since the merger with GE Transportation. During the fourth quarter, we also made our first payment to GE of $115 million for our Tax Matters Agreement. Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.7 times and our liquidity is at a robust $1.9 billion. Over the course of the year, we returned $300 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share buyback. And as we announced this morning, our board approved a renewal on our share buyback authorization for up to $500 million. As you can see in these results, our balance sheet remains strong and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash flow generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital to grow shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call back over to Rafael. Good morning. Yes. Just let me add on to that. I mean, the impact in the fourth quarter is really a result of those low locomotive deliveries and we see that continuing into next year. When you look at the full year for next year, you're asking about kind of guidance or view into the segment margins. We typically haven't given a lot of information about segment margins in the guidance, but I think if you look at the full year, the full Wabtec view, we expect to be in that with the guidance to be in above 15% kind of range, which is flattish and improving into from 2020 into 2021. We're committed to the margin improvement on the transit side, like, we've talked about in the strategic goals we put out there. And we see the freight margins to improve as we continue to get our synergies that we've talked about as we benefit from the cost actions we've taken both in the full year and in the fourth quarter on the freight businesses and seeing the mix of business really heading in our favor. Good morning. Yes, Jerry, so the \u2013 in 2020, there was obviously cost to separate and we would capture those in our restructuring and transaction costs when we report our numbers. We had \u2013 there were expenditures in order to stand up our own systems and achieve synergies related to separation from GE and get out from the transition service agreements. We had some of those costs come through in the fourth quarter too. And we expect to see some of those going into 2021, but to start to really slow down and get the full benefit. We're also \u2013 and we have not included that in our guidance. We will treat them the same as we have in 2020. And then when you look into 2021, those efforts are really starting to be behind us. We're starting to get the full benefit. We have additional synergy projects that will get us $250 million run rate by the end of the year. And but the cost to achieve those synergies will really slow. Exactly. And we've been \u2013 same manner that we've been treating them since the combination in 2019. Yes. And I would just add Scott, we do have some seasonality that comes from our aftermarket business and in our mining business, just the timing of how orders and projects get landed and the kind of operating rhythm of our customers related to aftermarket and part sales. So first quarter tends to be impacted a lot by all these kind of elements that along with the things that Rafael just talked about. Thank you. So the range what would \u2013 how would we get to the high end of the range or the impact of the low end, it's really going to be driven by the areas we see positivity, it's a services. It's a mod, it's a part sales. And my driver for that is really the rail volumes. When I look at the Transit same thing as the regions and the economies reopened and passenger ridership starts to continue to trend positively. We'll see those part sales. We have a good visibility into our OE side on Transit and our OE side on Freight, but where the reaching the high end of the range, it's going to be driven by those items. It's freight volumes, carloadings, and ridership. Yes. Well, we're \u2013 again, we said specifically sequential growth, so looking at the quarters. I mean that, that would sort of imply that the second half is going to be stronger to answer your question specifically, yes. Yes, that's right. That's what we're looking at. Well, $220 million is the cash flow impact, right. And you have \u2013 I would say roughly half of it is of the cash flow impact is from costs that had been recorded in 2019 paid in 2020. The other half were kind of were costs and impact within the year. And then going forward, we were still working through those costs to achieve synergies and restructuring. We haven't given any specific guidance on those items, because of the sensitivity to our operations. But we expect those to come down. That's exactly right."

            "content": "Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining today's call. Before we dive into the presentation, I'd like to begin by thanking our global team for their resilience and strong performance in 2020. In a year challenged by the pandemic, they work tirelessly day in and day out to protect the charter and to keep our operations delivering for our customers. They remain disciplined on cost management, executed in the face of many challenges and help to strengthen our financial position and ultimately delivered results for our shareholders. I'm proud of our team and the performance we've delivered as you can see on Slide 3. Total sales for the year were $7.6 billion. This was driven largely by international freight market services and a recovery in Transit, but offset by global disruption due to the pandemic. Adjusted operating margin was 15.1% driven by cost actions and execution on our synergies. In 2020, we exceeded expectations by delivering a 200 basis point margin improvement in Transit where our team continues to drive improved project execution, productivity, and cost actions. Total cash conversion was strong with cash flow from operations of $784 million, which included roughly $220 million in one-time impacts related to transaction, restructuring and litigation expenses. Cash generation was driven in part by good working capital management. These allowed us to deliver on our financial priorities of investing in the business, paying down more than $300 million in debt, which includes the tax obligation to General Electric and returning roughly $300 million of capital to shareholders. Total multi-year backlog was over $21 billion and up sequentially over the prior quarter providing us better visibility into 2021 and beyond. We ended the year with adjusted EPS of $3.79. Our teams continue to take action to manage what's in our control, perfect the long-term growth of the company and improve competitiveness while delivering shareholder value. In terms of synergies, we've delivered over $150 million in net synergies during 2020, and we're on track to deliver the full run rate of $250 million in synergies in 2021. To achieve these goals, we are taking further actions on structural costs. In 2020, we reduced headcount by 12%. We drove a 10% reduction across our operational footprint, and we have started a lean reset across the company to remove waste, maximize competitiveness across our product lines and advance our culture of continuous improvement. Here's the GE Transportation merger, total rooftops have been reduced by more than 30% and total headcount by 16%. And today, we have accepted more than 90% of the GE shared services ahead of schedule. Throughout the year, we also never lost sight of investing in growth. We extended our leadership position in autonomous operations, helping more than 70 customers successfully meet the deadline for Positive Train Control. We also closed a strategic digital order for Trip Optimizer zero to zero. This is an advanced technology that allows a customer to start a train from zero miles per hour and stop the train automatically using various controls that are integrated with Positive Train Control. In 2020, we also further strengthen our role as leaders in decarbonizing global rail transportation by developing new technologies that reduce emissions and try fuel efficiency. We built, shift, and tested the world's first heavy-haul battery electric locomotive. We're proud to share this locomotive is currently in revenue operating service with BNSF in California. And it will be a game changer in decarbonizing rail. In 2020, we extended battery technology to passengers as well by closing a significant deal with New York City Transit to drive down their overall carbon footprint. We have also reduced the weight, life cycle costs, and braking distance of a transit train with solutions like NaturoFlex for which we secured a key order in Singapore. And finally, we are improving air quality inside transit cars with the launch of BlueFilter and advanced air filtration system. And as we highlighted last quarter, our order pipeline could choose to strengthen. And we started to see that pipeline convert in the fourth quarter. Book-to-bill at the end of the quarter was 0.99 versus 0.89 in the third quarter. And we will continue to have positive momentum throughout 2021. Global freight volumes and equipment utilization have sequentially improved since the trough in the second quarter. And we are continuing to see uneven yet continued sequential recovery. This aligns with what you've heard from our customers as well. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we secured a strategic international locomotive order and throughout the year built on our strong install base closing several long-term service agreements. We have also expanded our global technology footprint in key regions like the Americas, Russia-CIS and India. Demand for reliability and productivity will only accelerate as we continue to differentiate Wabtec into market. Quarter to-date, we closed the significant multi-year order for modernizations and long-term service agreements. And we're well-positioned for mods growth, overhauls and parts demand, especially as railroads recover. Based on these factors and orders Wabtec is in a strong position to drive profitable growth and continue to perform for our shareholders, for our customers and for our employees in the short and long-term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat who will review the quarter, segment performance and our overall financial position. Pat? Thanks, Pat. And turning to Slide 8, let's look at some of the segment dynamic setting to 2021. Starting with freight by product line. North America freight has mostly gone through a reset, our services business has recovered and we're working through the trust in our OE business, due to locomotive deliveries are expected in North America in 2021. Total locomotive deliveries will be down roughly 35% year-over-year, driven mainly by North American locomotive deliveries down by more than 100 units versus 2020. This volume headwinds will create margin pressure due to under absorption at our manufacturing facilities. Our international pipeline remains strong and order momentum continues to build. In mining, we're optimistic as conditions are continuing to improve. When it comes to North America railcar build, rail cars are coming back into use, roughly 24% of the North American railcar fleet still remains in storage, which is similar to a pre-COVID level. Builders are taking continued step to slow down production and forecast estimates that railcar build for this year to be around 25,000 cars. The freight services, we are seeing year-over-year pressure on parts, due to higher levels of parkings. Demand for reliability and productivity will improve as railroads continue to recover, which as I shared earlier, but as in a position of strength from modernizations, overhauls and parts demand. And digital electronics were focused on growing PTC internationally. In 2021, we have contracts to install over 3,000 horsepower per ton upgrades to our Trip Optimizer systems, our new record. While we anticipate North American CapEx budgets to remain constraint, the long-term outlook is strong. Now transitioning to transit, we expect to grow on both OE and aftermarket as ridership recovers from historic lows. Infrastructure spending will continue in line with green initiatives as governments continue the churn to rail as the cleanest, safest and the most efficient means of transport. And I'll expand on that in just a minute. For 2021, we expect revenues in a range of $7.6 billion to $7.9 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.30 and cash conversion is expected to be greater than 90% for the full year. Across our segments, recovery is underway and will continue as customers experience volume growth and reinvest in their operations. We're seeing it already in some areas and we expect sequential improvements in both aftermarket services and international locomotives. In 2021, we expect orders to exceed anticipated sales, budding Wabtec in an even stronger position to drive profitable growth. With that, let's turn to Slide 9, to discuss the importance of sustainability and the strategic direction we're driving as a company. At Wabtec, we are determined to have a lasting impact on our industry and the world. Last year, we launched the company's first sustainability report and provided a detailed look at how we're building a more sustainable future by strengthening our corporate governance framework, which guides how we operate, how we innovate and how we drive growth. We also laid out our strategy on how we're taking on some of the world's toughest challenges, including climate change in automation by creating cleaner, more fuel efficient solutions, like the FLXdrive locomotive. As noted earlier, this is the world's first battery electric locomotive. And it's currently being tested in revenue service by BNSF in California. So far, we're seeing opportunity to reduce fuel consumption by 10% to 30% with significant interest from customers in North America and internationally. We're also reducing our own carbon footprint, driving down energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions across our facilities. When it comes to our employees, we're building a company culture grounded in meritocracy and integrity, one that embraces diversity in all forms and invest in its people and communities. To deliver on this vision, we outlined specific targets for how we plan to drive measurable impact. Our 30 by 30 strategy sets define matrix to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and more by at least 30% by 2030, making our commitment clear to both for our customers and our shareholders. We are making good advancement on these efforts, as you can see here and throughout our report. As we continue to build and even stronger Wabtec, we will be a driving force in transitioning to industry to a more sustainable future. And with that, let's turn to Slide 10. As you've heard this morning, our strategic plan has empowered us to innovate and has given us a clear framework to execute on our commitments, to generate strong cash flow and to drive continued shareholder value. And it will continue to guide us as we expand our international install base, as we accelerate growth in digital electronics and services, while farther transforming our transit business. We are two years into our integration. We have delivered on our synergies. We have delivered on increased shareholder value and we've positioned Wabtec in our customers for competitive advantage. Heading into 2021, we will drive margin expansion through prioritized cost actions and continue to invest in growth, creating new technologies that strengthen our leadership position on decarbonization and automation with the same determination and focus that has brought us here today. Before I turn the call over to questions, I want once again, personally, thank every member of the Wabtec team for what they have delivered in 2020 and the works they will continue to deliver in 2021. Thank you. And with that, Kristine. Okay. Allison, fuel is one of the biggest costs for our customers, I'd say, they are heavily focused on driving fuel efficiency across your operations. This combined with the growing focus on ESG and the need for decarbonization, I think positions the FLXDrive as a unique product to really address this challenges. We're actively working with customers in North America and internationally between sort of this technology and their operations. Proposals are out, but we do not have sales of this product into a 2021 or 2022 at this point. Allison, we're seeing \u2013 I would say continued commitments to Transit overall, in terms of transportation. And we're saying called the continuation of projects. We have not seen cancellations at this point. In fact, we have a lot of discussions regarding new projects with our customers. I think the intensity is growing in the light of well recovering in the markets and I think on the auto side, we seeing our business to stay quite resilient through this time. Good morning. Let me start Justin, I'll pass it on to Pat here. But in the fourth quarter, number one, we had a very significant drop in locomotive production. As we go into 2021, we have about a 35% reduction in locomotive volumes, which means no deliveries for North America. And that's the first time it happens in decades. So we went through a significant restructuring and a couple of facilities in the U.S. that drove under absorption in efficiencies in the quarter with a lower margin rate. We have taken the necessary cost actions in the fourth quarter with significant headcount reductions and we will continue to drive profitable growth, that's we go into 2021. Mix was also a headwind and that was a function just some of the elements, if you look at byproduct line, you'd think about transit. Aftermarket was actually declines versus a year ago with all we growing and you have some moderate dynamics with both equipment coming down. We put significant step down in locomotive shipments in the quarter and you also had a significant drop into digital electronics revenues. Let me start with the last parts. Buybacks are not included and guidance we're providing at this point, Justin. Even though, it is an element of capital allocation as we look forward. The second piece in terms of just the dynamics, I think we are continuing to see sequential improvement. In the fourth quarter, we saw book-to-bill that increased the 0.99, and that's an improvement versus the average for the year, which was around 0.91. As we had said, I think our pipeline of deals continues to strengthen, we're off to a strong starter for the year. And as we looking to the elements of what's taking place, I think there could be some tailwinds associated with the dynamics we're currently seeing that to some of the elements of weather and services deterioration. Good morning. So we're stepping up our investments in that area. We call it the decarbonization product portfolio. And in our minds, it starts with really the ability to improve fuel efficiency for customer on existing platforms. So that was our upgrades. There's a second element that ties it off with the adoption of more biofuel and renewable fuel. So that builds on that stairway. I think, there's a nodder element here, which is tied to just continue to modernize. So the fleets and you've got a still a lot of opportunities to replace three units with two, there's the element here of battery technologies, which will and can be a game-changer. And you need that in order to actually drive to the next level, which is they use a fuel cell. So that's how we see the stairway. I think we're well positioned to lead in all the elements of that stairway. That's been continued work from us and you'll see us continue to step up investment on that area. Good morning. We had mentioned before, I think the recovery, especially, on the equipment side, it's clearly taking place first internationally. We have gotten a significant order as a result of that in the fourth quarter. We're continuing discussions and we're seeing some bright spots there. Whether if you think about that you just mentioned mining or if you think about agriculture exports, we certainly see that in both South America, we see that in Australia, but overall Southeast Asia, we're quite active there, Russia CIS region. And we're continuing to expand on delivering our fleet in India as well. But just on mining more specifically, it's certainly I think a bright spot for us as we look into the year. Scott, let me start with the last part of your question. I think we are a unique inflection point here to help shape, what I call, a clean energy economy focused around rail. Rail is the most sustainable way of moving both freight and land and large amount of people. So I think policies that incentivize movement by rail will be go both good for the economy, good for the environment, but can stimulate job creation North America we actively working with decent administration in that regard. And with regards to, I think just how we see things progressing throughout the year. I think similar to what you've heard from customers, I think you'll see a sequential improvement. We do have elements of seasonality here into the first quarter. Certainly, weather has impacted our operations in Fort Worth. And that's something that we're actively working very close with our teams there to assess that impact. Scott, can you repeat that? It's very difficult to hear you. Scott, we're working. I think some of the initiatives go right align with the opportunity to improve efficiency for our customers on the fuel side opportunities to look at potentially accelerating some of the introductions of new technologies that help both on driving fuel efficiency, driving more automation, ultimately reducing carbon emissions. So that's the best way to frame it, so last associated with the high speed rail per se. Good morning. Revenues for the business came down about 2% in 2020 versus the year before. I'd say customers continue to be very committed, Chris on investing in productivity and we have a record number of installs in new products as we highlighted. So the fundamentals are good there. And customers continue to be really committed to drive productivity and investing on that. What we saw also was a good book-to-bill in the fourth quarter. I think we're continuing to see that as we move into the first quarter, but a key challenge for our team is to drive what I'll call convertible gain of the year. So think about getting orders that churn into sales within 2021, but back again the fundamentals are of the business are strong. Yes, it was a quick way to also eliminate costs within the air pushing some of those decisions to the right. I'd start with we're seeing sequential improvement, right. And that has turned the book-to-bill into I'll call a significant improvement in the fourth quarter. I think we're continuing to see that improvements, especially quarter to-date. I think we've had a strong start for the year with an order for both mods and an order for service agreements, which it's a real positive. So at this point, I think we'll see sequential improvement on volume as a result of continued on parking locomotives and freight cars. I think so important to mention here, I think we \u2013 as we look at the quarter to-date, the backlog coverage for the year is better than we had a year ago, but we're still sitting on \u2013 a significant higher number of locomotives parked versus pre-COVID level. I think the auto elements I'd offer you there is the PSR headwinds that we signed last couple of years impacting demand. I think they're largely reflecting the network and I'd not be surprised to see potential incremental of a volume created by the combination of this winter weather, deterioration of service levels. And this should be really the first year that we see traffic growth after sometime. Significant order quarter to-date, we expect a double-digit growth from the mods number for the year. Good morning. I'll just add. We continue to see strong international opportunities. The pipeline continues to strengthen. This is certainly a trough year for us. When you think about the equipment business and we're building from there. I mean I can't remember a year where we had zero deliveries on locomotives, so moving in the right direction. Subject for the year, I mean we've got the backlog in house for what I call new locomotives. So this is really about building forward into 2022, and that's where the dynamics are positive. You talk about the freight cars kind of all back to the parking levels. We had pre-COVID. There was certainly a significant drop last year with a 58% drop in the freight carbuild. We expect that to be more on the 25,000 for the year. So we have started the year with a positive beat up to this point. We took a key step with a order on zero to zero, which is really the ability to start at zero and stop the train at zero. So you talk about moving it and the integration with PTC that really sets the tone of how you can be a lot more autonomous through that process. Some of these steps might vary a little bit on the various class ones, but we have a suite of products in order to support that. So you've tied that off with a lot of the elements that I described in terms of our portfolio for de-carbonization. We have a real strong portfolio here to drive growth in this business for the long-term and despite of I call variation here on carloads. I don't think the technology is the bottleneck. So we've got the elements of technology to drive to that. Let me start I think as far as the Transit business, I think we had good progress in the business. The focus continues to be on execution, improving, the quality of the order intake, but also improving, say the metrics to our customers. Margins have improved about 200 basis points. And the team has a good plan to move up and not a 100 basis points this year. I think some of the dynamics on the business might vary depending on well lockdown sort of restrictions that have had a significant impact on ridership, but what has not changed stuff rises, we continue to see a very resilient services business. If you think about ridership down 30%, 50%, 80% levels, as we saw last year, we had a business that the aftermarket came down by single-digits in 2020. On the OE side, we have not seen as I said project constellation, so long-term fundamentals are strong there. I was certainly \u2013 are looking through some of the headwinds you described inflation being one of them. We've got our team really actively working with suppliers to make sure that we well-prepared for any of these elements. What I'll anticipate you, we also have agreements that provide what I call escalation in the case of [indiscernible] but a good amount of work being done by our teams as we speak around that. I'd say to while we have visibility to, I think we feel confident about the framework we have provided to you. I think Asia certainly the ridership is in the higher levels, right. There's of course some specifics in terms of some of the lockdown, some governments have act on it. I think Europe is come next. As we saw some of these new lockdown measures, you saw what used to be a ridership on the 80%-plus level go down to a more like 50%s and 60%s, but we expect those to resume back up. North America has certainly been on the low end of that spectrum of recovery, but as vaccination takes place, we'll see those improve across the board. We're certainly watching that very closely. We do think that, well, the combination of a severe winter weather conditions, higher volumes, the fact that you have a deterioration of service levels and back to the fact that the 2021 should be the first year that we see traffic growth, yes. That could provide tailwinds. I'll tell you. We just got our first international order and it was not in South America, but we do have opportunities to continue to expand that. And that's one of the areas of focus of our games. Good morning. We expect to drive what I'll call profitable growth for overall Wabtec and I should see those dynamics into that segments. Yes, and additional to the seasonality, you see on the first quarter was certainly watching for well that \u2013 weather impacts that we've had on our operation in fourth quarter. So number one, I think we continue to see opportunities to return value to shareholders through a share buyback. And that's why our Board has renewed the authorization of $500 million and buybacks. I think our focus starts with driving organic growth. I mentioned the portfolio solutions we have around de-carbonization and automation. They do provide a significant growth opportunity for our business and it's very much aligned to both productivity and carbon reduction for our customers. So we're committed to continuing to lead there. And we have increased the step into 2021. And on inorganic, we're continuing to explore bolt-on acquisitions. We will be opportunistic here. This will be really highly strategic with strong returns that drive higher ROIC and faster profitable growth increasing shareholder value. So that's fundamentally how we think about capital allocation here going into 2021. Yes, thanks."

Turning to Slide 3, while we continue to see the impact of COVID globally, a gradual recovery across the global freight and transit rail market is continuing. North America freight volumes and equipment utilization sequentially improved in the third quarter and transit ridership is also slowly resuming. These directional trends along with the focused performance of our teams are reflected in our third quarter results. Total sales for the quarter were $1.9 billion, driven largely by international freight markets and a recovery in transit but offset by global disruption due to the COVID pandemic. Total adjusted operating income was $293 million, impacted primarily by the drop in freight sales but somewhat offset by a more than 20% increase in transit segment income. Adjusted operating margin was 15.7% driven by cost actions and execution on our synergies, as well as margin improvement in transit, which was up 270 basis points for the quarter due to synergies, improved productivity and better project execution. In third quarter, we had solid cash conversion with cash flow from operations of $230 million driven by good working capital management. This allowed us to further strengthen the balance sheet by reducing debt by over $200 million in the quarter. Our liquidity position remains strong at $1.9 billion. Total multi-year backlog was over $21 billion despite current market conditions.  Finally, we ended up the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.95, further reinforcing that our teams are continuing to take the necessary steps to control what we can, protect the long term growth of the company, and deliver shareholder value. In the area of synergies, we are accelerating our progress and we are on track to deliver $150 million of net synergies in 2020 as well as deliver on the full run rate of $250 million in synergies before the end of 2022. To achieve these goals, we continue to take actions on structural costs. Ending the third quarter, we further reduced headcount by another 3%, taking our total reductions to roughly 13% year over year. We also have reduced our operational footprint year over year and we are actively driving cost reductions through lean initiatives. To date, we have exited about 75% of the shared services from GE Transportation merger ahead of schedule and we are on track to exit over 90% of these activities by year end.  Overall, our team delivered a strong quarter in a challenging and dynamic environment and won several orders, including a significant deal with New York City Transit to extend battery technology to passenger transit and drive down emissions. This is a key win that directly aligns with our own sustainability strategy as we outlined in our 2020 sustainability report issued earlier this week. We also closed a $160 million multi-year mining order for advance to dry systems, our single largest mining order to date.  In digital electronics, we won our first order with the Class 1 railroads for our advanced trip optimizer zero-to-zero solution. This deal will reduce emissions and will drive increased fuel savings, and is another significant step towards autonomous rail.  Finally, we had a solid quarter in transit, winning new brakes, doors, and HVAC contracts in Australia, Germany, France and the U.K., as well as our first order for the natural industry\u2019s most advanced braking system, the NaturoFlex, in Asia.  Looking ahead, the rail transportation market continues to recover from trough levels in the second quarter. We are encouraged by the advance of a recovery as noted by the ongoing improvement in our international freight markets, the sequential improvement in North America rail volumes, and increasing global transit activity. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pat who will share more on the quarter, segment performance, and our overall financial position. Pat?\nPat Dugan: Thanks Rafael, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 4, sales for the third quarter were $1.9 billion, which reflects a 7% decrease versus the prior year. The decline in year-over-year sales was mainly due to the ongoing disruption across our freight and transit segments caused by COVID-19.  For the quarter, operating income was $207 million and adjusted operating income was $293 million, which was down 12% year over year mainly driven by lower sales and disruption in our operations as a result of the pandemic, offset somewhat by variable cost actions and the continued realization of synergies.  In the third quarter, adjusted operating income excluded pre-tax expenses of $87 million, of which $70 million was for non-cash amortization and $16 million of restructuring and transaction costs. Please see Appendix D in our press release for the reconciliation of these details. Now looking at some of the detailed line items, adjusted SG&A declined 4% year over year to $241 million, which is excluding $12 million of the restructuring and transaction expenses I just discussed. SG&A expenses benefited from structural cost actions across the business and the realization of synergies. As expected, we did see a resumption of certain discretionary and compensation expenses that we eliminated during the depths of the pandemic. For the full year, we expect adjusted SG&A to be around $900 million. Engineering expenses decreased to $37 million or down 38% from last year. This was largely due to the lower volume outlook as well as some changes in project timing. Amortization expenses were $70 million. For 2020, we expect non-cash amortization expense to be about $285 million and depreciation expense to be about $180 million.  In the third quarter, we had GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.67 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.95. The details which bridge GAAP earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share of $0.95 can be found attached to our press release. As of September 30, our multi-year backlog was $21.4 billion. Backlog is about flat quarter over quarter. Our rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multi-year backlog, was $5.2 billion and continues to provide good visibility across both freight and transit segments.  Now let\u2019s take a look at the segment results on Slide 5. Across the freight segment, total sales decreased 7% to $1.2 billion in the third quarter. In terms of product lines, equipment sales were up 35% year over year as a result of higher locomotive deliveries which, as we have discussed, can often vary quarter to quarter due to timing. In the fourth quarter, we expect locomotive deliveries to be slightly higher when compared to the third quarter but down versus last year. In line with improving freight traffic from the second quarter, our service sales improved sequentially but were down 19% from a seasonally strong period last year. This was largely driven by lower parts sales due to continued record high locomotive parkings, as well as the timing of mods, deliveries and overhauls. We expect our parts sales to continue to improve with the gradual recovery in freight volumes and un-parking of locomotives. Digital electronics sales were down 13% year over year as orders shift to the right in North America due to COVID disruptions. Overall, we continue to see a significant pipeline opportunities in our digital electronics product line, providing productivity and improved safety for our customers. Component sales were down 16% year over year on a 45% lower rail car build versus the prior year, demonstrating the diversification within our components business. Since September, we have seen early signs of improvement in demand for aftermarket rail car components as more rail cars are beginning to come out of storage. Despite the top line headwinds and higher mix of OE locomotives during the quarter, our execution on synergies continued to drive positive impact, as reflected in our segment adjusted operating income of $234 million and adjusted margin of 18.9%. Finally, segment backlog was $17.8 billion, down just slightly from the prior quarter.  Turning to Slide 6, across our transit segment sales decreased 6% year over year to $628 million, driven largely by disruptions stemming from COVID-19. OE sales were down 2% year over year. It\u2019s important to note that this is a strong improvement from the second quarter, due in large part to improving transit ridership and service levels around the globe. Aftermarket sales were down 10% from last year. We remain positive on the aftermarket and expect sales to continue to improve as transit services increase globally.  Adjusted segment operating income was $75 million, which was up 21% year over year for an adjusted operating margin of 12%. Across the segment, we continue to drive down costs and improve project execution, as noted by our strong operating performance. While early days, we are pleased with the momentum underway and will continue to execute on more actions to drive increased profitability for the segment. Finally, transit segment backlog was $3.5 billion, which was up slightly versus last quarter. Now let\u2019s turn to our financial position on Slide 7. Cash flow generation during the quarter was strong at $230 million driven largely by working capital management, including improved inventory levels and higher customer deposits. I\u2019d also note that there was no material change from the A/R securitization in the quarter. We had about $15 million of one-time impacts on cash flow during the quarter and about $170 million for the full year, mainly due to prior year restructuring, transaction and litigation charges. Throughout the quarter, we continued to strengthen our financial position and reduced net debt by approximately $460 million since the same quarter a year ago. Our adjusted leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.6 times, down slightly from the last quarter, and our liquidity is still robust at $1.9 billion. In summary, our balance sheet is strong and we are confident we can drive solid cash flow generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to execute our strategic plans. With that, let\u2019s move to Slide 8, and I will turn the call back over Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks Pat. Looking ahead, we are seeing a gradual recovery across most freight and transit end markets as global economic activity and commuter travel improves. In North America, rail volumes increased dramatically from the second quarter due to a broad recovery in agricultural, intermodal, [indiscernible] and automotive volumes. Locomotive parkings, after peaking to a record high in the second quarter, have improved but are still more than 20% higher than pre-COVID levels. As railroads enter into recovery and we accelerate technology improvements, we expect demand for reliability and productivity to be even greater, putting us in a position of strength for modernizations, overhauls, and parts demand. In terms of North America rail car builds, rail cars are slowly moving out of storage; however, more than 25% of the North American rail car fleet still remains in storage. Builders are taking continued steps to slow production lines. The industry forecast currently indicates that the rail car build for 2020 will be less than 30,000 cars. Internationally, where economies have started to open, we continue to see encouraging signs. In Brazil, demand remains steady with greater dependency on agriculture products following a record harvest. In Australia, rail activity has shown good momentum following the COVID lockdown. In Kazakhstan, year-to-date car volumes are up driven by growth in volumes from China. In India after long lockdowns, activity has recently improved with the gradual reopening of the region. Overall, we have a strong order pipeline internationally in places like Brazil, Russia, CIS, Africa and Australia, and we expect revenue growth in several of these markets throughout 2021.  In mining, end markets remain stable and we remain optimistic that the mining market conditions are improving.  Transitioning to the transit sector, ridership is continuing to recover from historic lows, particularly in Europe and Asia, and in line with an operational recovery in transit globally. Looking forward, the long term market drivers for passenger transport remain strong. Infrastructure spending in support of green initiative continues to be a focus, especially as governments globally look to rail for clean, safe and efficient transport.  Turning to guidance for the year, we are updating our sales guidance to $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion, which is the higher end of our previous range, and we are updating adjusted EPS guidance to the range of $3.75 to $3.85 due largely to our operational execution to date, ongoing actions to align variable and fixed costs to the volume realities we face, and visibility to our backlog. Finally, we remain confident in delivering strong cash generation for the year. Turning to Slide 9 and to conclude, I\u2019m proud of the strong execution by the team in the third quarter despite a challenging environment. Our team remains vigilant on monitoring COVID-19 globally and is laser focused on keeping our employees safe while executing through today\u2019s volatile environment to deliver for our customers. As we go forward, we remain committed to executing on our strategic plan, reducing coats, aggressively managing cash, delivering on our synergy targets, and focusing on what we can control. We will continue to lean into the strong long term fundamentals of this company and invest in technologies that advance our competitive advantage, help us successfully manage today\u2019s market headwinds over the long term, and emerge as a more resilient company. Before I turn the call over to questions, I want to personally thank each and every member of the Wabtec team for all that they are doing. This year has been a significant stress test for our organization as we have navigated a complex integration, an industrial recession, a market reset, in addition to the pandemic. Yet, despite all these headwinds, we are performing well and we have continued to deliver, as demonstrated by our synergy execution, strong cash flow, and overall performance.  Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the constructive trends we are seeing across the global transit and freight markets. Demand should continue to improve sequentially across most of the portfolio. Recovery will remain somewhat mixed, but our business is uniquely positioned to drive long term profitable growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine?\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you Rafael. We will now move onto questions. Before we do, out of consideration for others on the call, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, please re-join the queue. With that, Operator, we are now ready to take our first question.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Good morning. Could we talk to transit a little bit? I think the performance in that segment was quite a bit more resilient than folk, including myself, would have thought. Given the backdrop of COVID, it sounds like Europe and Asia are starting to recovery quite a bit faster. Is there a way to quantify the headwind that you\u2019re seeing from North America, and how do you think that segment evolves in terms of the future, just with COVID and the concerns folks will never get back on commuter rail again?\nRafael Santana: Let me start first with the following. We\u2019re working of course very closely with our customers. I think while transit authorities around the globe, they are seeing operating budgets constrained, I think there is really strong support in terms of government stimulus for them to navigate through this. At this point, we haven\u2019t seen any project cancellations, but we continue to work with customers and I think the dynamics at this point, they remain a positive. I think there\u2019s still going to be volatility in terms of some of the measures that you see taking place in places like Europe, but we don\u2019t feel that that\u2019s going to go back to what I\u2019ll call the worst trough levels of COVID, so overall positive trends. A couple other comments here. If you think about transit, I think it\u2019s been slower in the U.S. versus other markets. I call out that the U.S. market represents only 15% of what we do in the transit market, so I think that\u2019s also an important element.  With that, I think I\u2019m really proud to see how the team has embraced change. They are driving improvement. We see that coming into our order backlog. I think I\u2019ve said it before and the trend continues, our backlog today has got margins that are 100% at least higher than they were a year ago. We\u2019ve seen improved execution, and I think we\u2019re moving in the right direction with that business, so we\u2019re committed to continue to improve margins over time.\nAllison Poliniak: Great, and just a question on margins within freight. If I recall, the equipment margins could be a little bit lower just in terms of the mix. Can you help quantify if there\u2019s a way to do that in mix impact from the product dynamics in the quarter within freight, in terms of would it have been better, I guess, if the equipment weren\u2019t so strong?\nRafael Santana: You\u2019ve got it. Margins were primarily impacted by mix, and Allison, just very straightforward, right - when I\u2019ve got equipment growing at 35% in the quarter and at the same time, I\u2019ve got services which is a much larger business with digital electronics - I mean, services was down 19% with digital electronics at 13%. That\u2019s really what drove that. We can have those variations just based on mix. We remain focused on improving margins. I think we\u2019re taking a lot of the right actions in different areas. We\u2019re delivering on synergies. We\u2019ve been taking action on SG&A and indirect costs, and we\u2019re going to continue to move in that direction.\nAllison Poliniak: Great, thanks. I\u2019ll pass it along.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Long from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. I wanted to start with a question on the North American freight aftermarket business. I\u2019m curious how that trended sequentially in the third quarter and your expectations going forward, and maybe within that business it would be helpful to hear about the cadence of mods Q2 to Q3, and maybe even Q3 to Q4 as well, just because I know that can move things around a good bit.\nRafael Santana: Okay, so let me take a step back, first with the second quarter on services, because I think it\u2019s important just to understand. Think of car loads in the second quarter were down close to 20%. We saw on the other side our revenues came down about 9%. Now when you come into the third quarter, so there\u2019s clearly a lag there, when you\u2019re coming to the third quarter, while car loads were down, I think 7.5%, we\u2019ve seen volume improvement of about 1%.  Here\u2019s some things to keep in mind. I think there is naturally a lag there. What I\u2019ll tell you, what we\u2019re seeing from a services perspective, there\u2019s clearly a pick-up in terms of, I\u2019ll call it recovery. It started first in our international markets and we saw fleets getting parts, and I think we\u2019re seeing volumes continue to move in the right direction. There was a lag into North America but we\u2019ve also seen that improving, as I think continuing to move forward. It\u2019s a shorter cycle business, but the trends that I\u2019m looking at right now, they\u2019re positive for the services business. You asked specifically on mods. I think there is--there\u2019s pent-up demand being created in terms of fleets that didn\u2019t run, so overhauls that have pushed to the right, potential investments in the fleet that have not been done in the course of the last couple years that have also pushed to the right, and that pent-up demand is going to come, so we do expect growth in mods moving forward.  I\u2019ll step away from providing you any specifics in quarter over quarter because we can have variation on that, but I think there\u2019s positive dynamics there in the services business.\nJustin Long: Okay, thanks. Secondly, I wanted to ask about your thoughts on buybacks, just given where the valuation metrics for the stock are today. As you think about closing that valuation gap to the market and peers, were there any major takeaways from the investor perception study that you recently completed? Just curious if there are any actions that you\u2019re planning to take after completing that exercise.\nRafael Santana: Let me start with the last part - yes, we have done that study, really great turnout. I think the amount of feedback was great, very specific, very candid answers, so we\u2019re continuing to work on that. With that, a couple things in mind. Number one, I think there is an element of providing what I\u2019ll call a little more details in terms of some of our segments, which we\u2019re going to work with you to make sure that we look into those as we go into next year.  On capital allocation, what I would like to tell you is, number one, we are committed to drive organic growth and continue the R&D investments that really drive differentiation and innovation for our customers - that\u2019s top of mind. Of course, we are looking and reprioritizing as we look at the current environment, and very committed there. We\u2019re also confident about our ability to drive cash and to reduce debt. Just think about just the last 12 months - we have paid down $490 million of debt and at the same time, we were driving over $190 million of both stock buybacks and dividends. Right now and as I look at it, our current stock price presents significant opportunity to return value to shareholders. We currently have a share repurchase authorization for $400 million, and we are intensifying buybacks. That\u2019s the focus now.\nJustin Long: Great, very helpful. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Thanks, good morning guys.\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Chris.\nChris Wetherbee: I was wondering about the return of resources in the freight segment as we see volumes continue to improve in 4Q and potentially first half of next year and beyond. Specifically on the headcount side, what are the learnings that you\u2019ve had from this downturn? Is there the ability to hold off on bringing folks back to try to drive stronger sequential incremental margins than what we saw just initially here in the third quarter?\nRafael Santana: The answer is yes. Number one, I think if you look at our headcount numbers, we\u2019ve reduced 3% quarter-over-quarter, 13% versus a year ago. I think there\u2019s a lot of learnings that came from just the COVID period. We\u2019ve looked at different areas, and I\u2019ve got to tell you there is an opportunity here to win even more productivity for certain areas of the company if you work remotely. There\u2019s some other ones that\u2019s not the case, but we do see the opportunity to drive increased leverage, and we will be growing margins as a result of volume growth [indiscernible].\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Maybe a bigger picture question on synergies. I think you talked about achieving full run rate out sometime during 2022. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes that might influence that timing a little bit? Maybe forgetting about the macro to some degree, I think, with what\u2019s in your control, are there any potential drivers that could maybe pull that forward a little bit? What could they be, and what\u2019s the risk to pushing that out a little bit?\nRafael Santana: I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s pushing that out a little bit right now, and it\u2019s just a function of volume. But with the guidance of what we\u2019ve provided with the $150 million for the year, we\u2019re committed to that and we\u2019re going to deliver on that. We\u2019re tracking to that, we have not broken down that on the quarter , but we\u2019re tracking to be north of $150 million for the year, and we will deliver the $250 million before end of next year, so moving in that direction. What I\u2019ll say is of course volume conditions improve, it can only help us there.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, got it. Thanks for the time, appreciate it.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Wertheimer: Hi and good morning everybody. My question is just on transit. You had another quarter of good progress on margin, and I wonder if you would just give a general update on what workflows are left to come. You\u2019ve rolled off some of the unprofitable business. Could you just give us an update on your strategy for continued improvement there? Thanks.\nRafael Santana: Yes, I\u2019ll say this is ongoing work, right? You have a backlog that you\u2019ve got to work through. I think the comments I would make is I think for more than a year now, we have been really disciplined about the quality of that backlog and the orders we take, so the specific terms and conditions that come with those orders, and that\u2019s where I say that we\u2019ve got over 100 basis points of margin improvement on that backlog, so it\u2019s a continuation.  I think execution is a lot better. I think we\u2019ve got improvement in terms of on-time delivery. The team has really embraced the principles of lean across our operations. We\u2019re going through a significant exercise on making sure that we\u2019ve got what I\u2019ll call a more--just a more efficient footprint.  Without mentioning the business here, I run sometimes into businesses where you have eight locations, different groups of engineers in each one of those locations, designing things to a lot of times different spec, sometimes to support similar customers. We have the opportunity here to have what I\u2019ll call centers of excellence when it comes down to engineering. We have some of those established in places like India, so we have the opportunity to significantly reduce costs, and we really don\u2019t need those eight sites. I can do with that maybe four or five, and I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to continue to pursue. We\u2019re being very disciplined about it, but we\u2019re going to continue to drive margins up, so we\u2019re committed to the framework that we\u2019ve highlighted before, which is over 100 basis points on average per year. I think we see the opportunity to do better this year, and we\u2019re not going to be pushing for anything less than another 100 next year.\nRob Wertheimer: That\u2019s very helpful, thank you. I\u2019m sorry for the clarification, but how much is left on federal contracts and backlog that will flow through to positive margin at this point? Thank you.\nRafael Santana: I think the one contract that we\u2019ve been more open about it was the U.K. project. That runs off fundamentally by the end of this year, so there\u2019s very minimal left, I think, for the first quarter of next year. But there\u2019s a backlog of contracts and we\u2019ll continue to work. I think the importance is we\u2019re committed to drive margin improvement with all the levers we have. Pat, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on it?\nPat Dugan: No, I just think it\u2019s worth mentioning that we\u2019re still a run rate of about $25 million of revenue each quarter, and it\u2019s flat year over year and quarter over quarter, and it\u2019s at a margin that\u2019s right around breakeven, so there\u2019s no element of that that has made this margin better than in other quarters. This is really--the margin improvement has come from the things that Rafael talked about - cost actions, efficiencies, synergies, all those items and things that we outlined earlier and are executing on now.\nRafael Santana: So the headcount reductions are really cutting across the business. This is not in one specific area.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks Rafael, thanks Pat.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCourtney Yakavonis : Hi, thanks for the question. If you can just maybe comment high level at your thoughts for freight in 2021 - you know, I think the cadence of OE versus your services and your digital business went a little bit differently than we would have expected this quarter, but it sounds like there\u2019s some pent-up demand and you\u2019re expecting growth in mods going forward. You talked about orders shifting to the right in digital electronics, so do you think that there is pent-up demand there? Then you had obviously mentioned a mining contract or a multi-year order. Is that going to start to flow through next year? Help us think about how locos are shaping up, thanks.\nRafael Santana: Let me give you a sense of our end markets. Of course I\u2019m not going to get into the elements here of giving guidance into 2021, but the way I look at our end markets, let me just start with maybe the transit piece of it. I think we\u2019re continuing to see positive signs of recovery. If you look at our backlog right now, it\u2019s larger than it was a year ago and I think we\u2019re continuing to see good trends there.  The second piece would clearly come down to really, I\u2019ll call it the freight side. I think we\u2019re positive on services. As I mentioned before, I think we\u2019ve seen the pick-up on services from the trough levels in the second quarter start first in the international markets, then we saw that--a little bit of a lag, but then it came into North America, and I think we see positive trends there. I think there\u2019s of course--there is a shorter nature of the cycle of that business, so things tend to pick up faster. Now when you go to the equipment side, I think we\u2019re kind of seeing similar dynamics, meaning if you think about the pipeline of opportunity that we were working versus six months ago, we see significant improvement. It started once again in the international markets. I think there is positive signs on some of this pipeline actually converting into the fourth quarter, which means even a possibility specifically in one of those markets to already deliver, so bringing revenues into 2021. But we\u2019ve got to see that taking, I\u2019ll call a broader impact across international markets.  I think ultimately you\u2019re going to see that happening in North America, but there is of course a lag there, and when you look at our equipment business, there is an element of, I\u2019ll call it longer cycle into that perspective. But as you highlighted, I think there\u2019s pent-up demand in terms of just utilization that didn\u2019t happen of fleets during this year, and that has pushed out many elements of maintenance to the right, so there\u2019s pent-up demand in that regard.  With that being said, there\u2019s of course a lot of volatility still. We\u2019re working hard. There\u2019s a lot of focus and working very closely with our customers, because I think we can provide them significant opportunities here to accelerate some of this, I\u2019ll call it investment in the fleet. Keep in mind, I think there\u2019s been an under-investment in the fleet and the fleet is aging, and the good news is we are accelerating a lot of investments we\u2019ve done in terms of technology to improve efficiency in those fleets, so if you think about those mods and those overhauls, I expect to be able to deliver to the customer increased fuel efficiency. I expect to increase reliability on those fleets. With our digital electronics portfolio, we do expect to have an opportunity there to also increase technology. We\u2019ve just talked about an order we got on zero-to-zero with a Class 1 in North America - that\u2019s another building block towards automation. The significance of that, that opens up really room for me to introduce that into a lot of Class 1s. Think of products like trip optimizer - this is something that builds on the top of that, so I think we\u2019ve got some good dynamics here to work from.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Thanks, and then just on freight margins for the fourth quarter, I think you\u2019ve historically talked about a 20% to 25% decremental margin framework in freight. Obviously it was a little higher this quarter given the mix, but would you expect it, given that you\u2019re expecting OE to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter, to go back to that framework or potentially be a little bit better as the mix improves?\nRafael Santana: Again staying away from commenting on mix and specifics on the quarter, what I\u2019ll say is we\u2019re confident with the guidance we\u2019ve provided, and we\u2019re committed to hit that guidance. With that, I think there\u2019s also an element of cash flows, and I think we\u2019re seeing all of our teams working through that. There\u2019s of course headwinds into the quarter, but we feel strong about the guidance we\u2019re providing at this point.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Yes hi, good morning everyone. Rafael, I was pleasantly surprised by the bookings trend in freight - you know, really strong book to bill, even as you had really strong deliveries in the quarter. Could you just expand on your prepared remarks in terms of where you\u2019re seeing pockets of strength from orders, and I think you alluded to a building international locomotive project pipeline as well, would you mind just expanding on those two areas, please?\nRafael Santana: When I talk about pipeline of opportunities and option to convert those into orders, I think we\u2019re seeing some positive signs in places like Latin America, and we have the opportunity here to convert some of those orders already in the fourth quarter - the team feels strong about it. We\u2019re seeing similar trends in places like Kazakhstan, and there\u2019s picked up activity in some other markets which I\u2019d rather not open up at this point. We\u2019re certainly--we face strong competition wherever we go, and we want to make sure that we continue to progress in that direction.\nJerry Revich: Okay, thank you, and the bookings in the quarter, can you just expand on what drove such a strong bookings quarter in a really tough environment?\nRafael Santana: I think a piece of it was the order that we announced on New York City Transit - that was certainly a significant element of that. It\u2019s a big opportunity for us here to continue to expand on electrification of our market, so this battery electric locomotive, we see this as a great solution for our customers. There has been a great degree of interest, and we\u2019re moving into what I\u2019ll call the phase two of that with a couple different customers, so we expect that to continue. The other piece I\u2019ll mention to you is mining. I think mining has demonstrated resilience and even as we go forward here, I think there is really an element of resilience, especially when you look at iron ore, copper and some specific commodities, so that\u2019s also another resilient part of the business.\nJerry Revich: Okay, thank you. Can you talk about how the productivity ramp has gone on the facilities in India, in particular are you getting the productivity that you were targeting?\nRafael Santana: Two things - there has been significant improvement in productivity and efficiency. I look at the last two years, we\u2019ve significantly improved the profitability of the contract that we are executing, so it\u2019s a positive there. When you talk about last quarter, I mean, of course it\u2019s been very disruptive. Between COVID hit, between monsoon season, I can\u2019t say things have been necessarily easy, but I think the team has continued to progress. We have delivered more than 130 locomotives at this point, and I\u2019d say the team is very much committed to deliver the minimum 100 locomotives per year, so we feel positive about the dynamics. But very tough dynamics in the course of the last 90-plus days.\nJerry Revich: Okay, appreciate the discussion. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Morning guys. Rafael, can you just talk directionally how you see the loco and rail car markets for next year, directionally just sort of up or down or flattish, and then I\u2019m wondering can you talk at all about some of the things you\u2019re doing with electric or alternative locos on the freight side?\nRafael Santana: Yes, so a couple things. On the freight car side, I think you all look at the same reports we do. I think for this year, the number for freight cars is probably around 30,000. As you look into next year, there is an expectation for that to drop down to potentially mid-20s. I guess the question here is, there\u2019s potentially some stimulus incentive that could improve those numbers, but right now we\u2019d be thinking about numbers around 25,000 to 30,000, depending on how that plays out. When I think about locomotives, I think you\u2019ve got to break out the elements of North American and international. I think international, we continue to see a robust pipeline and good opportunities here for us. I think North America, as I had mentioned, there\u2019s a lag here so keep in mind the longer cycle nature of these orders in order to be fulfilled.  Those are maybe--I think--hopefully that answers part of your question. I think mining, which is another element here, I think we see mining resilience at this point. Oh, and on electrification, which you asked about it. We see the opportunity here to enter into some areas of electrification with differentiation, which would mean driving value for both our customers and for ourselves. I\u2019ll talk to you more about it in the first quarter of next year, but that\u2019s an exciting area that will also help us, I think, accelerate growth in the business. I think there\u2019s an element of pent-up demand that I talked to you about. There\u2019s an element of, for me, accelerating technology into our fleets, which will ultimately accelerate the investments, so you have more reliable and more efficient fleets, and there\u2019s an element here of stepping into new areas, so we\u2019re really working hard to build on the right set of dynamics to drive growth. On mods, we do see positive trends going to next year.\nScott Group: Okay, helpful. Then just lastly, one of the opportunities with the GE deal was, I think, improving the content per loco on the legacy Wabtec side. Can you just give us an update on where we stand on that front? Are we seeing that yet? Is that still to come? Any thoughts there, thank you.\nRafael Santana: I think we\u2019ve seen a little bit, but it\u2019s--I mean, in the scheme of things, I could call it immaterial. I think what\u2019s been important is we see an element of--the opportunity is real. It takes sometimes a little bit longer just in terms of customers wanting to test it before they fully adopt it, but we\u2019re doing that across the board. I think broader than that, we\u2019ve seen the fact that we\u2019re so penetrated in so many different regions, we see now teams [indiscernible] of different products that before we couldn\u2019t even think about selling. We\u2019re selling our heat exchanger business here in the U.S. - we\u2019ve never been able to reach the kind of businesses we\u2019re getting on in Russia. We just signed about a $5 million deal - while it\u2019s small, it just give you the sense of how we can really take these products into a broader sense. We\u2019re educating our teams through it. I think there is a sense of really having a broader product portfolio that we can win share out there, and the fact that we\u2019re improving now profitability in transit, it also allows us to be a lot more aggressive on going after market share in some areas and drive profitable growth, so just stronger team together.\nScott Group: Okay, thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Matt Elkott from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Elkott: Good morning, thank you. Rafael, I think you highlighted some pockets of revenue growth opportunities for next year, but did you say if you guys expect to grow revenue, total revenue next year?\nRafael Santana: A couple things. We\u2019re not giving guidance into next year. I think what I provided was just a perspective on how do I see the recovery taking place. I think there\u2019s an element of our business which is tied to services with shorter cycles, and we\u2019re seeing the recovery there, so with shorter cycle you\u2019re able to deliver most of the time in what I call less than six months. There\u2019s an element of equipment which is longer cycle, and I\u2019d say a lot of cases you\u2019re looking at deliveries above 12 months, and I think the signs we\u2019re seeing of order recovery, we started to see that, as I described to you with the pipeline, that started first internationally, and we do expect some of those conversions to already start here in the fourth quarter, but North America has been lagging behind.\nMatt Elkott: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Then maybe switching over to the transit side, that New York City Transit hybrid locomotive order is very encouraging, but can you help us understand how this is happening at a time when, if this was actually the MTA, I think they\u2019re expecting a deficit of $16 billion through 2024 if there is not federal emergency funding. Is this order basically contingent upon a blue wave scenario next week?\nRafael Santana: A couple things - number one, we\u2019re not going to comment on any specific customers and customer orders or transactions, but I would say transit authorities around the globe, they are really seeing operating budget constraints. We haven\u2019t seen, as I told you before, project cancellations at this point. I think there is significant opportunity for those transit authorities to also drive what I\u2019ll call a shift to green, and we\u2019re seeing significant investments on that and that helps a lot of these elements. That\u2019s maybe where I\u2019ll finish.\nMatt Elkott: Got it, and you did mention that you\u2019re having more of these conversations with different customers around the world, about the transit hybrid locomotive?\nRafael Santana: I think there\u2019s huge interest on it. There\u2019s clearly an opportunity to already apply some of these in some specific routes, so we\u2019ve got--well, we\u2019re going to start a pilot here very soon in California, and we\u2019ve started some of the elements of what I\u2019ll call the next phase, and I think there\u2019s some real interest. If you think about the elements of fuel efficiency that could be gained from this significantly, and due to all the dynamics you see in the automotive industry, we\u2019re seeing really significant progress in terms of just the power density on those batteries, life continues to improve, and cost continues to come down, and that\u2019s really accelerating some of the opportunity here that we see.\nMatt Elkott: Okay, and then you mentioned California, which kind of reminded me of something that\u2019s probably much, much longer term, and it\u2019s probably contingent on energy, more aggressive energy policies. But I think California a few years ago were talking about tier 5 locomotive - this is on the freight side. Do you think if we have a more aggressive push to implement green policies in the U.S., do you think we could start talking about the next generation of locomotives sometime in the next five years?\nRafael Santana: Well, a couple comments there. Number one, let\u2019s just talk about from tier 4 and how much has been adopted and how much has become a significant part of the install base. I think if I look at it, I think it\u2019s still under--it\u2019s maybe 1,200 units of tier 4 installed, and if you consider the install base, it\u2019s minimal at this point. So before we jump into the next wave, I think it\u2019s important to look at what is available out there and make sure that, I think, ultimately you\u2019re taking advantage of the products that have been developed.  Now when it comes down to tier 5, I think battery electric, as I described to you, can really potentially drive even more benefits than simply thinking about whatever tier 5 would mean, so we\u2019re talking here 15% to 30%-plus reduction on fuel on routes, and that\u2019s massive. That\u2019s probably not been obtained through any of the other programs that have been done in the past, so that\u2019s why we look at battery electric as really a leap forward.\nMatt Elkott: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Saree, your line is now live. Please go ahead.\nSaree Boroditsky: Hi, sorry. I was on mute. Could you just talk about the margin profile on international locomotives, and as you target international locomotive growth, would you expect to see any margin headwinds? Then for my follow-up question, could you just provide the impact on the contract adjustment on freight margins in the quarter, and how should we think about that impact going into 2021 as the Egypt contract rolls off? Thank you.\nPat Dugan: Okay Saree, so in the quarter, the impact of that below market intangible is $12.5 million, so lower than previous quarters, and we expect for the full year that, as we\u2019ve talked, that it\u2019s about flat year over year. Then from a profile standpoint, we definitely see that coming down. The specific accounting that you\u2019re referring to is--those locomotive units will have been falling off and we\u2019ll see the number decline into next year.\nRafael Santana: But let me be very specific - as we go into next year, we\u2019re going to see that number to be less than 50 and it\u2019s going to be limited to the India contract, so I just want to remove any sense that there is a lack of profitability associated with international contracts.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thank you, and could you provide any color on what is the margin profile on international locomotives, and maybe how the India contract differs from the contracts that you\u2019re looking to gain going forward?\nPat Dugan: Yes Saree, so the margin on international projects for locomotives is good. It\u2019s obviously higher. This specific accounting item that you\u2019re asking was just really related to two new markets, new markets where costs were incurred as part of localization of initial engineering that\u2019s non-recurring, and very typical with brand new, new product development and business development opportunities.  But on a go forward basis, we have pockets of international projects where the profitability level is really good. It can be higher than average, it can be--it\u2019s not really appropriate to look at it as international projects are less profitable in locomotives than the average. It really comes down to how long we\u2019ve been established and have been operating in those locations.\nRafael Santana: Let me give you more color here. When you look at countries that we\u2019ve had an established presence, that\u2019s been mature with a product that\u2019s also been mature, good profitability, and I can speak of places like Brazil, I can speak of places like Kazakhstan, I can speak of places like Australia, of course the U.S. market now, and as you go into new markets, as Pat described, which was the case of India, investing on a brand-new platform, so you\u2019re designing a product for the first time, you\u2019re investing in infrastructure, and that\u2019s where you\u2019ll see those be on the lower end side. Even in Africa, we went through that in the beginning, and today it\u2019s a mature market. We have established a mature presence there, so that\u2019s maybe the way to think about it.\nPat Dugan: And these decisions to enter into these markets, really it\u2019s because they\u2019re a strategic opportunity, so you get yourself established, you have a long lived contract with opportunity for lean activities and variable cost productivity improvements, and so when you get in and the initial cost is behind you, you end up with add-on orders and additional units that really enjoy a good margin.\nRafael Santana: And ultimately an install base that\u2019s going to be there for the next 30 years, that you\u2019re going to be serving on the aftermarket side. \nSaree Boroditsky: I appreciate the color, guys. Thank you for clearing that up.\nPat Dugan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from [indiscernible] from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUnknown Analyst: Hi, good morning. You\u2019ve touched on the demand side quite a bit, but I just wanted to see if we could dig in to that a little bit more.  You mentioned strength in Latin America, Kazakhstan, some other regions. Maybe you could give us an indication of is that enough to support the backlog, growth in the backlog, or should we expect this kind of secular decline in the backlog until we see a pick-up in demand from North America? Maybe if you could just give us a little more color on the magnitude of the demand that you\u2019re seeing and where there are pockets of strength. \nRafael Santana: I\u2019ll just take your question being very focused on the locomotive side. We are like at trough levels here on the locomotive side, and by the time you get pretty close to zero, I tend to think things go up, so the question for me here is more on the pacing, so it\u2019s more on the pace of recovery. That\u2019s where I started with the elements of the international. I think we see a robust pipeline versus what we saw six months ago, and we\u2019re starting to see some good indications of potentially converting that. North America is lagging behind.\nUnknown Analyst: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Makes sense. Can\u2019t go below zero, that\u2019s for sure.\nRafael Santana: Exactly.\nUnknown Analyst: On the transit side, maybe if you would give a little more color. You had mentioned that municipal budgets and transit authorities are seeing some pressure. Maybe if you could give some color on how that\u2019s changing the nature of the discussions with those organizations. Are they looking for more price concessions or that sort of thing? How do you see contracts evolving in that space, given that budget pressure that they\u2019re facing?\nRafael Santana: We had a meeting just two days ago with one of those authorities in Europe, and what I\u2019ll tell you right now is they are maintaining their budgets at this point, but of course there is a lot of volatility as he would have described it in terms of what happens here on this wave 2. But they are committed to keep the fleets running at this point and they did not at this point pin down to any project cancellations, so just trying to give you a perspective of one customer. Of course, we\u2019re working with various customers, very closely, so I think it\u2019s something to continue to watch. I think the commitment to have trains running and operating, I think it\u2019s there. Could we have a risk that if this thing delays further, that at a certain point there\u2019s delay in projects, I guess that could be a possibility. I wouldn\u2019t be speculating at this time, so right now I think the trends, and even as you\u2019re looking to some of the industry reports, those point out to [indiscernible]. I think we\u2019ve got some good indications there at this point.\nUnknown Analyst: That\u2019s great color. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Kubacki for any closing remarks.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you Rachel.  Thank you everyone for participating today. We look forward to catching up with you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Rafael, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 4, sales for the third quarter were $1.9 billion, which reflects a 7% decrease versus the prior year. The decline in year-over-year sales was mainly due to the ongoing disruption across our freight and transit segments caused by COVID-19.  For the quarter, operating income was $207 million and adjusted operating income was $293 million, which was down 12% year over year mainly driven by lower sales and disruption in our operations as a result of the pandemic, offset somewhat by variable cost actions and the continued realization of synergies.  In the third quarter, adjusted operating income excluded pre-tax expenses of $87 million, of which $70 million was for non-cash amortization and $16 million of restructuring and transaction costs. Please see Appendix D in our press release for the reconciliation of these details. Now looking at some of the detailed line items, adjusted SG&A declined 4% year over year to $241 million, which is excluding $12 million of the restructuring and transaction expenses I just discussed. SG&A expenses benefited from structural cost actions across the business and the realization of synergies. As expected, we did see a resumption of certain discretionary and compensation expenses that we eliminated during the depths of the pandemic. For the full year, we expect adjusted SG&A to be around $900 million. Engineering expenses decreased to $37 million or down 38% from last year. This was largely due to the lower volume outlook as well as some changes in project timing. Amortization expenses were $70 million. For 2020, we expect non-cash amortization expense to be about $285 million and depreciation expense to be about $180 million.  In the third quarter, we had GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.67 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.95. The details which bridge GAAP earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share of $0.95 can be found attached to our press release. As of September 30, our multi-year backlog was $21.4 billion. Backlog is about flat quarter over quarter. Our rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multi-year backlog, was $5.2 billion and continues to provide good visibility across both freight and transit segments.  Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 5. Across the freight segment, total sales decreased 7% to $1.2 billion in the third quarter. In terms of product lines, equipment sales were up 35% year over year as a result of higher locomotive deliveries which, as we have discussed, can often vary quarter to quarter due to timing. In the fourth quarter, we expect locomotive deliveries to be slightly higher when compared to the third quarter but down versus last year. In line with improving freight traffic from the second quarter, our service sales improved sequentially but were down 19% from a seasonally strong period last year. This was largely driven by lower parts sales due to continued record high locomotive parkings, as well as the timing of mods, deliveries and overhauls. We expect our parts sales to continue to improve with the gradual recovery in freight volumes and un-parking of locomotives. Digital electronics sales were down 13% year over year as orders shift to the right in North America due to COVID disruptions. Overall, we continue to see a significant pipeline opportunities in our digital electronics product line, providing productivity and improved safety for our customers. Component sales were down 16% year over year on a 45% lower rail car build versus the prior year, demonstrating the diversification within our components business. Since September, we have seen early signs of improvement in demand for aftermarket rail car components as more rail cars are beginning to come out of storage. Despite the top line headwinds and higher mix of OE locomotives during the quarter, our execution on synergies continued to drive positive impact, as reflected in our segment adjusted operating income of $234 million and adjusted margin of 18.9%. Finally, segment backlog was $17.8 billion, down just slightly from the prior quarter.  Turning to Slide 6, across our transit segment sales decreased 6% year over year to $628 million, driven largely by disruptions stemming from COVID-19. OE sales were down 2% year over year. It's important to note that this is a strong improvement from the second quarter, due in large part to improving transit ridership and service levels around the globe. Aftermarket sales were down 10% from last year. We remain positive on the aftermarket and expect sales to continue to improve as transit services increase globally.  Adjusted segment operating income was $75 million, which was up 21% year over year for an adjusted operating margin of 12%. Across the segment, we continue to drive down costs and improve project execution, as noted by our strong operating performance. While early days, we are pleased with the momentum underway and will continue to execute on more actions to drive increased profitability for the segment. Finally, transit segment backlog was $3.5 billion, which was up slightly versus last quarter. Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 7. Cash flow generation during the quarter was strong at $230 million driven largely by working capital management, including improved inventory levels and higher customer deposits. I'd also note that there was no material change from the A/R securitization in the quarter. We had about $15 million of one-time impacts on cash flow during the quarter and about $170 million for the full year, mainly due to prior year restructuring, transaction and litigation charges. Throughout the quarter, we continued to strengthen our financial position and reduced net debt by approximately $460 million since the same quarter a year ago. Our adjusted leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.6 times, down slightly from the last quarter, and our liquidity is still robust at $1.9 billion. In summary, our balance sheet is strong and we are confident we can drive solid cash flow generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to execute our strategic plans. With that, let's move to Slide 8, and I will turn the call back over Rafael. No, I just think it's worth mentioning that we're still a run rate of about $25 million of revenue each quarter, and it's flat year over year and quarter over quarter, and it's at a margin that's right around breakeven, so there's no element of that that has made this margin better than in other quarters. This is really--the margin improvement has come from the things that Rafael talked about - cost actions, efficiencies, synergies, all those items and things that we outlined earlier and are executing on now. Okay Saree, so in the quarter, the impact of that below market intangible is $12.5 million, so lower than previous quarters, and we expect for the full year that, as we've talked, that it's about flat year over year. Then from a profile standpoint, we definitely see that coming down. The specific accounting that you're referring to is--those locomotive units will have been falling off and we'll see the number decline into next year. Yes Saree, so the margin on international projects for locomotives is good. It's obviously higher. This specific accounting item that you're asking was just really related to two new markets, new markets where costs were incurred as part of localization of initial engineering that's non-recurring, and very typical with brand new, new product development and business development opportunities.  But on a go forward basis, we have pockets of international projects where the profitability level is really good. It can be higher than average, it can be--it's not really appropriate to look at it as international projects are less profitable in locomotives than the average. It really comes down to how long we've been established and have been operating in those locations. And these decisions to enter into these markets, really it's because they're a strategic opportunity, so you get yourself established, you have a long lived contract with opportunity for lean activities and variable cost productivity improvements, and so when you get in and the initial cost is behind you, you end up with add-on orders and additional units that really enjoy a good margin. Thank you."

            "name": "Rafael Santana",
            "content": "Thanks Kristine, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. I hope you and your families remain healthy and safe. Turning to Slide 3, while we continue to see the impact of COVID globally, a gradual recovery across the global freight and transit rail market is continuing. North America freight volumes and equipment utilization sequentially improved in the third quarter and transit ridership is also slowly resuming. These directional trends along with the focused performance of our teams are reflected in our third quarter results. Total sales for the quarter were $1.9 billion, driven largely by international freight markets and a recovery in transit but offset by global disruption due to the COVID pandemic. Total adjusted operating income was $293 million, impacted primarily by the drop in freight sales but somewhat offset by a more than 20% increase in transit segment income. Adjusted operating margin was 15.7% driven by cost actions and execution on our synergies, as well as margin improvement in transit, which was up 270 basis points for the quarter due to synergies, improved productivity and better project execution. In third quarter, we had solid cash conversion with cash flow from operations of $230 million driven by good working capital management. This allowed us to further strengthen the balance sheet by reducing debt by over $200 million in the quarter. Our liquidity position remains strong at $1.9 billion. Total multi-year backlog was over $21 billion despite current market conditions.  Finally, we ended up the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.95, further reinforcing that our teams are continuing to take the necessary steps to control what we can, protect the long term growth of the company, and deliver shareholder value. In the area of synergies, we are accelerating our progress and we are on track to deliver $150 million of net synergies in 2020 as well as deliver on the full run rate of $250 million in synergies before the end of 2022. To achieve these goals, we continue to take actions on structural costs. Ending the third quarter, we further reduced headcount by another 3%, taking our total reductions to roughly 13% year over year. We also have reduced our operational footprint year over year and we are actively driving cost reductions through lean initiatives. To date, we have exited about 75% of the shared services from GE Transportation merger ahead of schedule and we are on track to exit over 90% of these activities by year end.  Overall, our team delivered a strong quarter in a challenging and dynamic environment and won several orders, including a significant deal with New York City Transit to extend battery technology to passenger transit and drive down emissions. This is a key win that directly aligns with our own sustainability strategy as we outlined in our 2020 sustainability report issued earlier this week. We also closed a $160 million multi-year mining order for advance to dry systems, our single largest mining order to date.  In digital electronics, we won our first order with the Class 1 railroads for our advanced trip optimizer zero-to-zero solution. This deal will reduce emissions and will drive increased fuel savings, and is another significant step towards autonomous rail.  Finally, we had a solid quarter in transit, winning new brakes, doors, and HVAC contracts in Australia, Germany, France and the U.K., as well as our first order for the natural industry's most advanced braking system, the NaturoFlex, in Asia.  Looking ahead, the rail transportation market continues to recover from trough levels in the second quarter. We are encouraged by the advance of a recovery as noted by the ongoing improvement in our international freight markets, the sequential improvement in North America rail volumes, and increasing global transit activity. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat who will share more on the quarter, segment performance, and our overall financial position. Pat? Thanks Pat. Looking ahead, we are seeing a gradual recovery across most freight and transit end markets as global economic activity and commuter travel improves. In North America, rail volumes increased dramatically from the second quarter due to a broad recovery in agricultural, intermodal, [indiscernible] and automotive volumes. Locomotive parkings, after peaking to a record high in the second quarter, have improved but are still more than 20% higher than pre-COVID levels. As railroads enter into recovery and we accelerate technology improvements, we expect demand for reliability and productivity to be even greater, putting us in a position of strength for modernizations, overhauls, and parts demand. In terms of North America rail car builds, rail cars are slowly moving out of storage; however, more than 25% of the North American rail car fleet still remains in storage. Builders are taking continued steps to slow production lines. The industry forecast currently indicates that the rail car build for 2020 will be less than 30,000 cars. Internationally, where economies have started to open, we continue to see encouraging signs. In Brazil, demand remains steady with greater dependency on agriculture products following a record harvest. In Australia, rail activity has shown good momentum following the COVID lockdown. In Kazakhstan, year-to-date car volumes are up driven by growth in volumes from China. In India after long lockdowns, activity has recently improved with the gradual reopening of the region. Overall, we have a strong order pipeline internationally in places like Brazil, Russia, CIS, Africa and Australia, and we expect revenue growth in several of these markets throughout 2021.  In mining, end markets remain stable and we remain optimistic that the mining market conditions are improving.  Transitioning to the transit sector, ridership is continuing to recover from historic lows, particularly in Europe and Asia, and in line with an operational recovery in transit globally. Looking forward, the long term market drivers for passenger transport remain strong. Infrastructure spending in support of green initiative continues to be a focus, especially as governments globally look to rail for clean, safe and efficient transport.  Turning to guidance for the year, we are updating our sales guidance to $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion, which is the higher end of our previous range, and we are updating adjusted EPS guidance to the range of $3.75 to $3.85 due largely to our operational execution to date, ongoing actions to align variable and fixed costs to the volume realities we face, and visibility to our backlog. Finally, we remain confident in delivering strong cash generation for the year. Turning to Slide 9 and to conclude, I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the third quarter despite a challenging environment. Our team remains vigilant on monitoring COVID-19 globally and is laser focused on keeping our employees safe while executing through today's volatile environment to deliver for our customers. As we go forward, we remain committed to executing on our strategic plan, reducing coats, aggressively managing cash, delivering on our synergy targets, and focusing on what we can control. We will continue to lean into the strong long term fundamentals of this company and invest in technologies that advance our competitive advantage, help us successfully manage today's market headwinds over the long term, and emerge as a more resilient company. Before I turn the call over to questions, I want to personally thank each and every member of the Wabtec team for all that they are doing. This year has been a significant stress test for our organization as we have navigated a complex integration, an industrial recession, a market reset, in addition to the pandemic. Yet, despite all these headwinds, we are performing well and we have continued to deliver, as demonstrated by our synergy execution, strong cash flow, and overall performance.  Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the constructive trends we are seeing across the global transit and freight markets. Demand should continue to improve sequentially across most of the portfolio. Recovery will remain somewhat mixed, but our business is uniquely positioned to drive long term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine? Let me start first with the following. We're working of course very closely with our customers. I think while transit authorities around the globe, they are seeing operating budgets constrained, I think there is really strong support in terms of government stimulus for them to navigate through this. At this point, we haven't seen any project cancellations, but we continue to work with customers and I think the dynamics at this point, they remain a positive. I think there's still going to be volatility in terms of some of the measures that you see taking place in places like Europe, but we don't feel that that's going to go back to what I'll call the worst trough levels of COVID, so overall positive trends. A couple other comments here. If you think about transit, I think it's been slower in the U.S. versus other markets. I call out that the U.S. market represents only 15% of what we do in the transit market, so I think that's also an important element.  With that, I think I'm really proud to see how the team has embraced change. They are driving improvement. We see that coming into our order backlog. I think I've said it before and the trend continues, our backlog today has got margins that are 100% at least higher than they were a year ago. We've seen improved execution, and I think we're moving in the right direction with that business, so we're committed to continue to improve margins over time. You've got it. Margins were primarily impacted by mix, and Allison, just very straightforward, right - when I've got equipment growing at 35% in the quarter and at the same time, I've got services which is a much larger business with digital electronics - I mean, services was down 19% with digital electronics at 13%. That's really what drove that. We can have those variations just based on mix. We remain focused on improving margins. I think we're taking a lot of the right actions in different areas. We're delivering on synergies. We've been taking action on SG&A and indirect costs, and we're going to continue to move in that direction. Okay, so let me take a step back, first with the second quarter on services, because I think it's important just to understand. Think of car loads in the second quarter were down close to 20%. We saw on the other side our revenues came down about 9%. Now when you come into the third quarter, so there's clearly a lag there, when you're coming to the third quarter, while car loads were down, I think 7.5%, we've seen volume improvement of about 1%.  Here's some things to keep in mind. I think there is naturally a lag there. What I'll tell you, what we're seeing from a services perspective, there's clearly a pick-up in terms of, I'll call it recovery. It started first in our international markets and we saw fleets getting parts, and I think we're seeing volumes continue to move in the right direction. There was a lag into North America but we've also seen that improving, as I think continuing to move forward. It's a shorter cycle business, but the trends that I'm looking at right now, they're positive for the services business. You asked specifically on mods. I think there is--there's pent-up demand being created in terms of fleets that didn't run, so overhauls that have pushed to the right, potential investments in the fleet that have not been done in the course of the last couple years that have also pushed to the right, and that pent-up demand is going to come, so we do expect growth in mods moving forward.  I'll step away from providing you any specifics in quarter over quarter because we can have variation on that, but I think there's positive dynamics there in the services business. Let me start with the last part - yes, we have done that study, really great turnout. I think the amount of feedback was great, very specific, very candid answers, so we're continuing to work on that. With that, a couple things in mind. Number one, I think there is an element of providing what I'll call a little more details in terms of some of our segments, which we're going to work with you to make sure that we look into those as we go into next year.  On capital allocation, what I would like to tell you is, number one, we are committed to drive organic growth and continue the R&D investments that really drive differentiation and innovation for our customers - that's top of mind. Of course, we are looking and reprioritizing as we look at the current environment, and very committed there. We're also confident about our ability to drive cash and to reduce debt. Just think about just the last 12 months - we have paid down $490 million of debt and at the same time, we were driving over $190 million of both stock buybacks and dividends. Right now and as I look at it, our current stock price presents significant opportunity to return value to shareholders. We currently have a share repurchase authorization for $400 million, and we are intensifying buybacks. That's the focus now. Good morning, Chris. The answer is yes. Number one, I think if you look at our headcount numbers, we've reduced 3% quarter-over-quarter, 13% versus a year ago. I think there's a lot of learnings that came from just the COVID period. We've looked at different areas, and I've got to tell you there is an opportunity here to win even more productivity for certain areas of the company if you work remotely. There's some other ones that's not the case, but we do see the opportunity to drive increased leverage, and we will be growing margins as a result of volume growth [indiscernible]. I'll tell you what's pushing that out a little bit right now, and it's just a function of volume. But with the guidance of what we've provided with the $150 million for the year, we're committed to that and we're going to deliver on that. We're tracking to that, we have not broken down that on the quarter , but we're tracking to be north of $150 million for the year, and we will deliver the $250 million before end of next year, so moving in that direction. What I'll say is of course volume conditions improve, it can only help us there. Thank you. Yes, I'll say this is ongoing work, right? You have a backlog that you've got to work through. I think the comments I would make is I think for more than a year now, we have been really disciplined about the quality of that backlog and the orders we take, so the specific terms and conditions that come with those orders, and that's where I say that we've got over 100 basis points of margin improvement on that backlog, so it's a continuation.  I think execution is a lot better. I think we've got improvement in terms of on-time delivery. The team has really embraced the principles of lean across our operations. We're going through a significant exercise on making sure that we've got what I'll call a more--just a more efficient footprint.  Without mentioning the business here, I run sometimes into businesses where you have eight locations, different groups of engineers in each one of those locations, designing things to a lot of times different spec, sometimes to support similar customers. We have the opportunity here to have what I'll call centers of excellence when it comes down to engineering. We have some of those established in places like India, so we have the opportunity to significantly reduce costs, and we really don't need those eight sites. I can do with that maybe four or five, and I think that's something that we're going to continue to pursue. We're being very disciplined about it, but we're going to continue to drive margins up, so we're committed to the framework that we've highlighted before, which is over 100 basis points on average per year. I think we see the opportunity to do better this year, and we're not going to be pushing for anything less than another 100 next year. I think the one contract that we've been more open about it was the U.K. project. That runs off fundamentally by the end of this year, so there's very minimal left, I think, for the first quarter of next year. But there's a backlog of contracts and we'll continue to work. I think the importance is we're committed to drive margin improvement with all the levers we have. Pat, I don't know if you want to comment on it? So the headcount reductions are really cutting across the business. This is not in one specific area. Let me give you a sense of our end markets. Of course I'm not going to get into the elements here of giving guidance into 2021, but the way I look at our end markets, let me just start with maybe the transit piece of it. I think we're continuing to see positive signs of recovery. If you look at our backlog right now, it's larger than it was a year ago and I think we're continuing to see good trends there.  The second piece would clearly come down to really, I'll call it the freight side. I think we're positive on services. As I mentioned before, I think we've seen the pick-up on services from the trough levels in the second quarter start first in the international markets, then we saw that--a little bit of a lag, but then it came into North America, and I think we see positive trends there. I think there's of course--there is a shorter nature of the cycle of that business, so things tend to pick up faster. Now when you go to the equipment side, I think we're kind of seeing similar dynamics, meaning if you think about the pipeline of opportunity that we were working versus six months ago, we see significant improvement. It started once again in the international markets. I think there is positive signs on some of this pipeline actually converting into the fourth quarter, which means even a possibility specifically in one of those markets to already deliver, so bringing revenues into 2021. But we've got to see that taking, I'll call a broader impact across international markets.  I think ultimately you're going to see that happening in North America, but there is of course a lag there, and when you look at our equipment business, there is an element of, I'll call it longer cycle into that perspective. But as you highlighted, I think there's pent-up demand in terms of just utilization that didn't happen of fleets during this year, and that has pushed out many elements of maintenance to the right, so there's pent-up demand in that regard.  With that being said, there's of course a lot of volatility still. We're working hard. There's a lot of focus and working very closely with our customers, because I think we can provide them significant opportunities here to accelerate some of this, I'll call it investment in the fleet. Keep in mind, I think there's been an under-investment in the fleet and the fleet is aging, and the good news is we are accelerating a lot of investments we've done in terms of technology to improve efficiency in those fleets, so if you think about those mods and those overhauls, I expect to be able to deliver to the customer increased fuel efficiency. I expect to increase reliability on those fleets. With our digital electronics portfolio, we do expect to have an opportunity there to also increase technology. We've just talked about an order we got on zero-to-zero with a Class 1 in North America - that's another building block towards automation. The significance of that, that opens up really room for me to introduce that into a lot of Class 1s. Think of products like trip optimizer - this is something that builds on the top of that, so I think we've got some good dynamics here to work from. Again staying away from commenting on mix and specifics on the quarter, what I'll say is we're confident with the guidance we've provided, and we're committed to hit that guidance. With that, I think there's also an element of cash flows, and I think we're seeing all of our teams working through that. There's of course headwinds into the quarter, but we feel strong about the guidance we're providing at this point. When I talk about pipeline of opportunities and option to convert those into orders, I think we're seeing some positive signs in places like Latin America, and we have the opportunity here to convert some of those orders already in the fourth quarter - the team feels strong about it. We're seeing similar trends in places like Kazakhstan, and there's picked up activity in some other markets which I'd rather not open up at this point. We're certainly--we face strong competition wherever we go, and we want to make sure that we continue to progress in that direction. I think a piece of it was the order that we announced on New York City Transit - that was certainly a significant element of that. It's a big opportunity for us here to continue to expand on electrification of our market, so this battery electric locomotive, we see this as a great solution for our customers. There has been a great degree of interest, and we're moving into what I'll call the phase two of that with a couple different customers, so we expect that to continue. The other piece I'll mention to you is mining. I think mining has demonstrated resilience and even as we go forward here, I think there is really an element of resilience, especially when you look at iron ore, copper and some specific commodities, so that's also another resilient part of the business. Two things - there has been significant improvement in productivity and efficiency. I look at the last two years, we've significantly improved the profitability of the contract that we are executing, so it's a positive there. When you talk about last quarter, I mean, of course it's been very disruptive. Between COVID hit, between monsoon season, I can't say things have been necessarily easy, but I think the team has continued to progress. We have delivered more than 130 locomotives at this point, and I'd say the team is very much committed to deliver the minimum 100 locomotives per year, so we feel positive about the dynamics. But very tough dynamics in the course of the last 90-plus days. Yes, so a couple things. On the freight car side, I think you all look at the same reports we do. I think for this year, the number for freight cars is probably around 30,000. As you look into next year, there is an expectation for that to drop down to potentially mid-20s. I guess the question here is, there's potentially some stimulus incentive that could improve those numbers, but right now we'd be thinking about numbers around 25,000 to 30,000, depending on how that plays out. When I think about locomotives, I think you've got to break out the elements of North American and international. I think international, we continue to see a robust pipeline and good opportunities here for us. I think North America, as I had mentioned, there's a lag here so keep in mind the longer cycle nature of these orders in order to be fulfilled.  Those are maybe--I think--hopefully that answers part of your question. I think mining, which is another element here, I think we see mining resilience at this point. Oh, and on electrification, which you asked about it. We see the opportunity here to enter into some areas of electrification with differentiation, which would mean driving value for both our customers and for ourselves. I'll talk to you more about it in the first quarter of next year, but that's an exciting area that will also help us, I think, accelerate growth in the business. I think there's an element of pent-up demand that I talked to you about. There's an element of, for me, accelerating technology into our fleets, which will ultimately accelerate the investments, so you have more reliable and more efficient fleets, and there's an element here of stepping into new areas, so we're really working hard to build on the right set of dynamics to drive growth. On mods, we do see positive trends going to next year. I think we've seen a little bit, but it's--I mean, in the scheme of things, I could call it immaterial. I think what's been important is we see an element of--the opportunity is real. It takes sometimes a little bit longer just in terms of customers wanting to test it before they fully adopt it, but we're doing that across the board. I think broader than that, we've seen the fact that we're so penetrated in so many different regions, we see now teams [indiscernible] of different products that before we couldn't even think about selling. We're selling our heat exchanger business here in the U.S. - we've never been able to reach the kind of businesses we're getting on in Russia. We just signed about a $5 million deal - while it's small, it just give you the sense of how we can really take these products into a broader sense. We're educating our teams through it. I think there is a sense of really having a broader product portfolio that we can win share out there, and the fact that we're improving now profitability in transit, it also allows us to be a lot more aggressive on going after market share in some areas and drive profitable growth, so just stronger team together. A couple things. We're not giving guidance into next year. I think what I provided was just a perspective on how do I see the recovery taking place. I think there's an element of our business which is tied to services with shorter cycles, and we're seeing the recovery there, so with shorter cycle you're able to deliver most of the time in what I call less than six months. There's an element of equipment which is longer cycle, and I'd say a lot of cases you're looking at deliveries above 12 months, and I think the signs we're seeing of order recovery, we started to see that, as I described to you with the pipeline, that started first internationally, and we do expect some of those conversions to already start here in the fourth quarter, but North America has been lagging behind. A couple things - number one, we're not going to comment on any specific customers and customer orders or transactions, but I would say transit authorities around the globe, they are really seeing operating budget constraints. We haven't seen, as I told you before, project cancellations at this point. I think there is significant opportunity for those transit authorities to also drive what I'll call a shift to green, and we're seeing significant investments on that and that helps a lot of these elements. That's maybe where I'll finish. I think there's huge interest on it. There's clearly an opportunity to already apply some of these in some specific routes, so we've got--well, we're going to start a pilot here very soon in California, and we've started some of the elements of what I'll call the next phase, and I think there's some real interest. If you think about the elements of fuel efficiency that could be gained from this significantly, and due to all the dynamics you see in the automotive industry, we're seeing really significant progress in terms of just the power density on those batteries, life continues to improve, and cost continues to come down, and that's really accelerating some of the opportunity here that we see. Well, a couple comments there. Number one, let's just talk about from tier 4 and how much has been adopted and how much has become a significant part of the install base. I think if I look at it, I think it's still under--it's maybe 1,200 units of tier 4 installed, and if you consider the install base, it's minimal at this point. So before we jump into the next wave, I think it's important to look at what is available out there and make sure that, I think, ultimately you're taking advantage of the products that have been developed.  Now when it comes down to tier 5, I think battery electric, as I described to you, can really potentially drive even more benefits than simply thinking about whatever tier 5 would mean, so we're talking here 15% to 30%-plus reduction on fuel on routes, and that's massive. That's probably not been obtained through any of the other programs that have been done in the past, so that's why we look at battery electric as really a leap forward. But let me be very specific - as we go into next year, we're going to see that number to be less than 50 and it's going to be limited to the India contract, so I just want to remove any sense that there is a lack of profitability associated with international contracts. Let me give you more color here. When you look at countries that we've had an established presence, that's been mature with a product that's also been mature, good profitability, and I can speak of places like Brazil, I can speak of places like Kazakhstan, I can speak of places like Australia, of course the U.S. market now, and as you go into new markets, as Pat described, which was the case of India, investing on a brand-new platform, so you're designing a product for the first time, you're investing in infrastructure, and that's where you'll see those be on the lower end side. Even in Africa, we went through that in the beginning, and today it's a mature market. We have established a mature presence there, so that's maybe the way to think about it. And ultimately an install base that's going to be there for the next 30 years, that you're going to be serving on the aftermarket side. I'll just take your question being very focused on the locomotive side. We are like at trough levels here on the locomotive side, and by the time you get pretty close to zero, I tend to think things go up, so the question for me here is more on the pacing, so it's more on the pace of recovery. That's where I started with the elements of the international. I think we see a robust pipeline versus what we saw six months ago, and we're starting to see some good indications of potentially converting that. North America is lagging behind. Exactly. We had a meeting just two days ago with one of those authorities in Europe, and what I'll tell you right now is they are maintaining their budgets at this point, but of course there is a lot of volatility as he would have described it in terms of what happens here on this wave 2. But they are committed to keep the fleets running at this point and they did not at this point pin down to any project cancellations, so just trying to give you a perspective of one customer. Of course, we're working with various customers, very closely, so I think it's something to continue to watch. I think the commitment to have trains running and operating, I think it's there. Could we have a risk that if this thing delays further, that at a certain point there's delay in projects, I guess that could be a possibility. I wouldn't be speculating at this time, so right now I think the trends, and even as you're looking to some of the industry reports, those point out to [indiscernible]. I think we've got some good indications there at this point."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Wabtec\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, Pat Dugan; and President of Freight Services, Pascal Schweitzer; Senior VP of Finance, John Mastalerz. Today\u2019s slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures, were posted on our website earlier today and can be accessed on our Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Some statements we are making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentations. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. And now, I will turn over the call to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kristine and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. And I hope you and your families remain healthy and safe. Before we get started, I would like to once again thank our employees out in the field, in our factories and those working from remote locations for continuing to keep our facilities safe and operational through this pandemic. I am very proud of how our teams has responded to the challenging environment delivered for our customers and supported one another during a time when healthcare, economic and social tensions run high. And you see that reflected in our second quarter results and long-term focus. Turning to Slide 3, we had a strong execution in the second quarter despite a difficult environment. Total sales for the quarter were $1.7 billion driven largely by the international freight market and services, but offset by disruptions due to COVID in both the freight and transit end-market. Adjusted operating income was $262 million, resulting in an adjusted margin of 15.1%, which was impacted by the drop in sales across freight and transit, but somewhat offset by synergies. Cash flow from operations of $311 million was driven by strong cash conversion and good working capital performance. This allowed us to further strengthen our financial position, pay-down debt during the quarter by $300 million and increase our liquidity position by $700 million. Total multiyear backlog was over $21 billion, providing us continued visibility across freight and transit despite market conditions. And finally, we ended the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.87, demonstrating that we are taking the steps necessary to control what we can, protect the long-term viability of the company and deliver shareholder value. With that, let\u2019s dive into some actions underway. As you know, we remain committed to our synergy targets and we are accelerating our efforts here. We have $150 million of net synergies planned for 2020. Year-to-date, we are on plan with over $70 million in net synergies realized and we remain confident that we will deliver on the full run-rate of $250 million in synergies ahead of schedule. Of particular note, we continued the aggressive action on structural costs and lowered SG&A expense by 26% year-over-year. During second quarter, we reduced headcount by 5% and were down more than 10% year-over-year. We have also reduced our operational footprint year-over-year and we are actively driving cost reductions through lean initiatives. To-date, we have exited more than 60% of the shared service agreements from GE Transportation merger ahead of schedule. Looking ahead, the rail transportation market and impacts from the pandemic remain challenged and fluid. While we anticipate market conditions to remain somewhat mixed, as I will share with you in a moment, we believe volumes largely bottomed in the second quarter and we will see a gradual recovery. With this in mind and based on our first half results as well as based on the backlog coverage for the rest of the year, we are issuing a new outlook for the 2020 year. Pending no further lockdowns due to COVID-19 pandemic or resulting negative impacts on our business, we expect revenues in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.6 billion for the year. We will continue to adjust our variable and fixed costs to align with volume realities and we are committed to improving segment margins. We anticipate adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.80 and cash conversions to be greater than 90% for the full year. This includes roughly $130 million from prior restructuring and transactions cash outflows. Cash conversion within the company\u2019s core business is expected to be over 100%. Turning to Slide 4, I would like to discuss the market conditions and drivers we are seeing across the sector. Pascal Schweitzer, President of Freight Services will also hit on some of this in a few minutes. In both freight and transit, we are experiencing mixed conditions as economic recovery begins and commuter travel resumes. And we are carefully monitoring the ongoing impact of the virus in some regions. In North America, rail volumes had a record decline, down roughly 20% year-over-year in the second quarter. However, we have seen rail volume improve since bottoming in the second quarter. Likewise, locomotive parkings, after peaking to a record high in the second quarter, have also shown gradual improvements and we remain positive on the aftermarket sector. In terms of the North American railcar builds, a record one-thirds of the North America rail car fleet is in storage and builders are taking continued steps to slow down production lines in 2020. Industry forecasts currently indicate that the rail car build for the year will be less than 30,000 cars. Reflecting on the quarter, I want to share a couple of highlights. Internationally, rail volumes were more resilient driven largely by agriculture and mining tailwinds. International locomotive shipments were up versus last year and helped offset North America locomotives and freight car build declines, as expected. We continue to see demand for new locomotives in Russia, CIS, Brazil and Australia. Some tenders have pushed to the right due to COVID-19, but we expect this to resolve as economies have stabilized. New growth opportunities for next-gen sustainable solutions also remain strong, especially for hybrids and fuel-saving technology. We are doing some really innovative work in reducing fuel consumptions by 5% through our engine overhaul process. Pascal will share more on this in a moment. We are also currently field testing our FLXdrive locomotive, the first 100% heavy-haul battery-powered locomotive in the world operating in the hybrid [consist] [ph]. So far, we are seeing an opportunity to reduce fuel consumption for our customers by 10% to 30%. We are extending battery technology to passenger transit as well and just closed a significant deal with New York City transit to drive down their overall carbon footprint. Finally, we continue to see our digital electronics product line provide significant productivity and improve safety for our customers. Sales for the quarter were up 4% versus the prior year. Transitioning to the transit sector, the COVID-19 crisis has had a significant impact on ridership and service levels in early second quarter. Since then, particularly in Europe and Asia, ridership trends are showing a slow recovery as economies reopen. This has resulted in some positive activity internationally with new brake, new doors, and HVAC contracts in regions like Australia, Canada, India and the UK. Overall, we believe the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remain intact, especially as governments look to rail as the cleanest, safest and the most efficient mode to address the world\u2019s public transportation challenges. Across the segment, we also continue to drive costs down. We continue to improve project execution and profitability. Lilian and the team are on track to expand margins over time while delivering over 100 basis points of improvement in 2020. With that, let\u2019s flip to Slide 5 and I will turn things over to Pascal.\nPascal Schweitzer: Thanks, Rafael. Good morning, everyone. It is good to be with all of you today. I am Pascal Schweitzer and I am the Group President of Wabtec Freight Services. It is a roughly $2.2 billion business with operations in around 40 countries and approximately $12 billion in backlog. Roughly, 80% of our revenues are generated through multiyear contracts, including long-term service agreements, parts contract as well as multiyear modernization agreements. So in short, we are with our customers for the long haul, helping them pull freight in some of the most important logistics corridors around the world. As I have shown before, we are executing on a focused strategy to create value for our customers. This included ensuring that our fleet is performing well and running hard, that we are capturing the aftermarket with a superior product and delivering outcomes for our customers through technology upgrades and new tools. All these while constantly improving our fleet\u2019s total lifecycle cost. Today, as railroads continue to enhance for productivity and efficiency gains, through initiatives like precision schedule railroading, for instance and in the mixed challenges brought on by the pandemic. This strategy is more relevant than ever. The second quarter, as Rafael explained, we saw significant disruption in many of the regions where we operate. Government shutdowns had an impact on our customer operations and trade volumes globally. As a result, a record number of locomotives were parked in North America. However, despite this, we continue to have a leading and increasing share of the total active fleet. And our customers continue to increasingly prioritize the dispatch of our locomotives due in large part to the performance and reliability of the fleet. I would also like to point out that in the second quarter we need to hit record performance for on-time parts delivery and despite regional disruptions and shutdowns from COVID, each of our more than 100 service locations remained open and fully operational, a huge testament to the team in the field and we see the strong illustration that we do so much more than sell parts. You see that\u2019s reflected in the resiliency of our second quarter top line. So, while the uncertainty related to the crisis has led some railroads to delay certain investment decisions, the value of our portfolio remains. We have worked with our customers to align scheduled maintenance plans to the new market realities. And as a result, we have leveraged the full power of Wabtec to increase the scope of our work and to unlock new growth in R&D. Now looking ahead as railroads enter into recovery and the growing level of freights relying on the small number of locomotives, we expect the demand for reliability to be even greater. This will translate into more comprehensive work scopes, into more comprehensive fleet strategies, into modernization opportunities. Currently, we have more than 1,000 modernized locomotives in operation, delivering improved reliability, better fuel efficiency and overall economic performance for our customers. As our customers strategically consider their investment plans over the long-term, the value of modernizations remains very compelling. The second quarter, mods deliveries show good momentum and we continue to have visibility via our multiyear backlog. Now, on a broader international scale, where economies are starting to reopen, we are also seeing encouraging improvement in parkings and operational fleet performance. Just to give you a few examples, in Australia, rail activity has shown good momentum throughout the quarter as China resumed business following the COVID lockdown. In Kazakhstan, year-to-date car volumes are up compared with 2019. Brazil, we see a strong demand with greater dependency on agricultural products, following a record harvest. In India, while there were a significant number of locomotives parked due to the pandemic, this ultimately had little impact to our business as we shifted focus to maintenance. And as of July, all of these locomotives are back in operation. Finally, in North America, as discussed, we do expect carload volumes to continue to gradually improve and parking to progressively recover. In terms of commercial activity for the quarter, the team closed some significant long-term service agreements with Class 1s in North America as well as in Brazil and won a key order for our FDL Advantage product. Going into this product a little bit more specifically as Rafael described, we had around 10,000 FDL locomotives running globally. Any of these locomotives are approaching their second or third engine overhauls. So with these next-gen solutions, we are able to reduce the fuel consumptions by up to 5%. That means for a single locomotive burning around 200,000 gallons of fuel a year, around $25,000 in savings per year. This is an exciting first win that is opening up a multimillion dollar pipeline of opportunity for Wabtec fully in line with our strategy of technology differentiation for the installed base. Finally, I will share a few thoughts on cost management. So last year, we have reduced our headcount by roughly 10% ahead of our synergy commitment and in line with market realities. We have undertaken lean actives to drive cost out of the business, while still being able to deliver for our customers and scale up as markets recover. But to conclude, while the market remains fluid and carload volumes and parking grew significant headwinds, the freight services team had a strong operational quarter giving us confidence that our broad international portfolio, our $12 billion multiyear backlog, and our strong aftermarket rates will position us well into the future. Looking forward, you will see some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonality of maintenance activity due to our engine overhaul profiles and mods delivery schedules. However, the fundamentals of this business and its ability to recover post COVID remains strong. I will now turn things over to Pat to provide more color on the company\u2019s overall second quarter performance. Pat?\nPat Dugan: Thanks, Pascal. Turning to Slide 6, sales for the second quarter were $1.7 billion, which reflects a 22% decrease versus the prior year. The decline in year-over-year sales was mainly due to disruption across our freight and transit segments caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For the quarter, operating income was $159 million and adjusted operating income was $262 million. That\u2019s down 32% year-over-year, mainly driven by the lower sales and the disruption in our operations as a result of the pandemic offset somewhat by variable cost actions and the realization of our synergies. For the quarter, adjusted operating income excluded pre-tax expense of $103 million, of which $72 million was for non-cash amortization, $31 million of restructuring and transaction costs. Take a look at the Appendix D to our press release for the reconciliation of these details. Now, looking at some of these detailed line items, SG&A declined 26% year-over-year to $217 million, including $13 million of the restructuring and transaction expenses, SG&A expense benefited from structural cost actions across the business as well as the realization of synergies. Engineering expense decreased to $38 million or down 33% from last year. Engineering expense moved down with a lower volume outlook as well as some changes in project timing. And amortization expenses were $72 million. In 2020, we expect non-cash amortization expense to be about $290 million and appreciation expense of about $180 million. Second quarter, we had GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.46 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.70. Details that bridge the GAAP earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share of $0.87 can be found attached to our press release. As of June 30, our multiyear backlog was $21.4 billion. Excluding the impact of FX, backlog is flat quarter-over-quarter, a rolling 12-month backlog which is a subset of the multiyear backlog, $5.3 billion. Our backlog continues to give us and provide good visibility across both the freight and transit segments. Now, let\u2019s take a look at those segments, the results on Slide 7. Across the Freight segment, total sales decreased 21% to $1.2 billion in the second quarter, FX negatively impacted sales by about $26 million during the quarter. In terms of product lines, equipment sales were down 37% year-over-year as a result of lower North America locomotive deliveries, which as we have discussed, often can vary quarter-to-quarter due to timing and that was offset somewhat in the second quarter by higher year-over-year international locomotive deliveries and increased mining sales. In the second half of the year, we expect locomotive deliveries to be slightly higher when compared to the first half of this year. And as you heard Pascal discuss, our services portfolio continues to show resiliency despite the OE headwinds. Despite a nearly 18% drop in North America freight volumes for the quarter, services revenues were down 8% year-over-year, a result of lower parts sales due to record locomotive parkings, but that was offset by double-digit growth in mods deliveries. We expect our parts sales to improve with a gradual recovery in freight volumes, recent timing of maintenance and overhaul work edging into the fourth quarter. Digital Electronics sales were up 4% year-over-year on higher sales of distributed power products and signaling projects. Components sales were down 30% year-over-year on lower year-over-year railcar build and declines in key industrial end markets such as oil and gas and power generation. Despite the top line headwinds, evidence of our synergies coming through as segment adjusted operating income was $229 million for an adjusted margin of 19%. Finally, the freight segment backlog was $18 billion about flat with the prior quarter. I would note again that FX negatively impacted that backlog by about $58 million. Turning to Slide 8, across our Transit segment, sales decreased 25% year-over-year to $533 million driven largely by disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 virus, but were also impacted by FX which reduced sales by an additional $18 million. OE sales were down 32% year-over-year on disruptions caused by the pandemic. During the quarter, our operations and our customers\u2019 operations, which are primarily in Europe and Asia, were negatively impacted by government shutdowns. Aftermarket sales, which were down 18% from last year, were impacted by reduced capacity at many transit systems around the globe. However, as economies have opened up, we have seen a resumption in service, increased equipment deployed, gradual recovery and ridership in most markets. Our adjusted segment operating income was $51 million for an adjusted operating margin of 9.6%. Margin performance was impacted by the lower absorption of fixed costs in the first half of the quarter. However, we are continuing to drive improvements in the transit business and expect transit margins to increase 100 basis points for the year. Finally, the segment backlog was $3.4 billion, also about flat with last quarter. FX negatively impacted the backlog by $79 million versus the end of the first quarter. Now, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow on Slide 9. Cash flow generation during the quarter was strong at $311 million. I would note that we had about $40 million of one-time impacts due to prior year restructuring and transaction charges we had identified on our last earnings call. Our leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 2.7x about flat with the last quarter. But our total liquidity at the end of the second quarter, was $1.9 billion, up solidly from the $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter and total net debt is down about $282 million. Also in July, we took proactive steps to restore a more balanced maturity profile of our debt with a successful 5-year $500 million bond offering that retired $500 million in floating rate notes due in September of 2021. Summary our balance sheet is strong, and we are confident in our ability to generate cash flow, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to execute our strategic. With that, let\u2019s move to Slide 10. And I will turn the call back over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks Pat. So as you heard throughout the morning and you see on this page Wabtec had a solid performance in the second quarter, despite a weak and fluid environment, a reminder that in difficult times, strong companies must learn how to adapt, find a better way and lead through change. We could not have imagined a greater stress test for our company and how it would perform in a difficult environment than the one we are seeing it today. Over the last 70 months, we have successfully managed a massive merger that doubled the size of this company we have faced into the global pandemic, in an industrial recession in one of the most difficult business cycles ever seen. Yet despite all the odds, we are performing strong and we have delivered a true testament to the team and their commitment to position this company as a stronger and more resilient Wabtec carrying into the second half of the year we would fully expect to see continued headwinds, especially given the uncertainties of COVID-19. Our leadership team remains constant and committed to manage cost and to drive profitable growth that will help us navigate these challenges. I want to personally thank each and every member of the Wabtec team. Again, for all that they are doing in the face of change your efforts are reflected in the results we shared today. With that, I will turn the call back to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of the discussion.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Raphael. We will now move on to questions. Before we do out of consideration for others on the call, I asked you that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up question. If you have additional questions, just please rejoin the queue. With that operator, I think we\u2019re ready to take our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJustin Long: Thanks Good morning and congrats on the quarter.\nRafael Santana: Good morning Justin.\nJustin Long: So maybe let\u2019s start with the 2020 guidance. So if I look at the revenue guidance, it implies that sequentially in the second half of the year revenue should get better relative to the second quarter. As we think about just the mix implications, can you give us some color on how much of that sequential improvement in revenue you anticipate to come from freight versus transit, and then anything just on a quarterly basis that you can provide to help us think about the cadence of revenue or earnings in the back half?\nRafael Santana: Sure. Justin, let me start first with well, as we look at the backlog coverage for the ranges we have provided we feel strong about that, I think we also feel strong about the strength in the execution. We have got say a strong momentum in terms of both synergies and cost actions that we are taking I think in the second quarter we certainly saw volumes bottoming for our costumers. We think it was also when we think from operational disruptions. I think we also, to some extent have seen the worse. I don\u2019t think we are through that; I think we have seen improvement in the transit storage at the end of the quarter point out to that with unparking of locomotives, ridership levels in the transit side have improved a bit but I think the better news there, you have got a large number of trains still operating. So I think we are continuing to see those trends. There is, of course, some volatility as we see, and as we look into the recovery, but we are seeing trends up starting at the end of the second quarter, and we continue to see that through this month of July as well. Pat I don\u2019t know if you want to add any more specifics into it?\nPat Dugan: No, I think the one thing I would point out is that when the \u2013 when you kind of look at our information though as it becomes available, the mix of aftermarket versus OE that the decline is much more significant in the OE side kind of quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. You see that it\u2019s really being impacted by the disruption in the industry, in the market. And so I think to get to your question of where and how those recoveries, I think the recovery is going to be in both segments, I think you are going to see it coming back to more typical mix of businesses as the year goes along.\nRafael Santana: I think one of the things we will be watching for is really any push-outs on the decisions which regards to new projects. And I think that\u2019s something for us to continue to monitor here as we continue to build backlog.\nJustin Long: Okay, great. And then maybe Pat on the cadence part of that question for third and fourth quarter, do you feel like third quarter is maybe a little bit worse and then we kind of build off of that into the end of the year. Any color on that front?\nPat Dugan: Yes, just want to be careful about guidance this quarter and everything. But I think you see sort of a kind of a steady sequential improvement as we go through the rest of the year.\nJustin Long: Okay, helpful. And as my second question, I wanted to ask about free cash flow, I know you made the comment about the cash conversion percentage this year, but anymore specific thoughts around free cash flow in 2020 and how that cash could be allocated between debt pay-down and maybe potentially even buybacks? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something you are considering at this point?\nRafael Santana: Well, couple of points. I think we have given clear guidance to cash conversion being above 90%, I think we remain committed to that. And I think we have the areas of opportunities here to act. If you look into areas like inventory, for instance, so we will continue to have strong rigor around that and we feel strong about delivering above 90% cash conversion here.\nPat Dugan: Yes. And as for the allocation, I think it\u2019s obviously, one of the most challenging times and we want to make sure that we focus on debt repayment and then get into other uses of capital. I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think it\u2019s too early to really be talking about anything aggressive or we want to \u2013 but we want to remain opportunistic and that\u2019s the way we have approached this. We are generating cash, we are meeting our goals and then we are using it to get our debt in the right kind of ratio range as we have always talked about and be opportunistic for all the other things we can do.\nRafael Santana: We remain committed to the framework we presented during the Investor Day. I mean, there is a commitment to continue to pay debt down, but we are going to be looking at opportunities here. And especially, we can see bolt-on acquisitions being I will call more available than they were maybe 6 months ago and that will make sure to evaluate that against the different options. So, we are committed to that framework we presented back at the Investor Day.\nJustin Long: Okay, great. I really appreciate the time.\nPat Dugan: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes. Hey, thanks and good morning. Maybe if you could \u2013 I was curious if you could provide a little bit more sort of color on the outlook for the second half on Freight segment. So looking through sort of equipment and components and kind of getting a sense of how we should be thinking about that revenue rebound relative to what we see in the freight market. Services and digital obviously held up fairly well. But when you think about those two pieces did those kind of move linearly with recovery and volume or how are you guys expecting that to play out in the second half?\nRafael Santana: I think I will probably point out to three things to be a really watching. Of course, the impact for both customers in operation was very significant in the second quarter. As we are going to the second half, I think, first really watching closely on the freight side, the unparking of locomotives. What I feel was North America or international, I mean, we have seen the impacts in the second quarter. And as those un-parking occurs I think we have seen that trend. It\u2019s not linear, but I think there are some brighter spots then, but one places versus others. Especially, internationally, I\u2019d say we see some of those brighter spots. We see democrats across some geographies and driven by well, either agriculture or specific mining. There is still some markets we\u2019re heavily under penetrated. So I think we see a good dynamics coming from the, from some of these markets. And it is reflected also in the pipeline of what I call opportunities for equipment deals. So what if I talk about agriculture in Brazil or mining in Australia, we also continue to deliver on our contract in India. You think a country like Kazakhstan's volumes carloads, are actually up year over a year, year to date, and that\u2019s also I think, a significant opportunity for us. \nChris Wetherbee: Okay, that is very helpful. I appreciate that color. And then just a detailed question about the 12-month backlog, I just want to make sure I understand sort of what the progression has been over the last couple of quarters. So that's come down a bit, and I know FX is probably some of it I am just kind of curious, have we seen any of the sort of 12 month outlook get pushed out into the right? I think there was some comments about that maybe on the in the prepared remarks, just want to make sure I am understanding sort of what the 12-month view is, obviously, the long term is very stable. So want to make sure how we are seeing that kind of play out over the course of this sort of more immediate term?\nRafael Santana: I would say certainly, when I look at second quarter, even first quarter, I mean, I can\u2019t say those were necessarily great in terms of all favoring a dynamic of order intake. I think when you compare first quarter, against the second quarter, and if you have to exclude FX, you will see in backlog remained flattish quarter over quarter, I think, as we look at has ahead, I mean, we are really in the business of looking for business. We are chasing every piece of opportunity that we can go after. Our strategy here is to grow the business profitably, and so we will continue to act to have a more competitive cost structure than ever before. I think, yes, we are seeing some decisions moving to the right. And I think, especially if you think about some of the dynamics in the transit side with, really despite of the fact that ridership is low, I think we are seeing a number of trains in operation. So operators are really reevaluating some of these but we think the long term fundamental is ratified, look at transit or freight remain strong. And we are seeing a commitment to actually be investing in those modes. And this is part of the solution, as we look out the world ahead in terms of driving more efficient, more productive, less emissions. And I think we sit in a good place in terms of the long term fundamentals for the business.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, okay that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the color. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nPat Dugan: Good morning.\nAllison Poliniak: I just want to delve into Chris\u2019 question a little bit more on the freight aftermarket piece, particularly if it relates to North America. I guess, just given the focus on the rails and in terms of increasing the rotation versus bringing equipment back. I would have thought your fleet aftermarket. I think you said it wouldn\u2019t recover one to one, but I would think it would actually recover a little faster as a result of that. Any thoughts there? Am I thinking about that wrong?\nRafael Santana: Well, couple of comments there. Number one, I mean, we felt the impact in the second quarter in North America I mean it is brutal, right? I mean, as you look into the numbers you have heard from the Class 1s I mean we have seen volume reduction, pretty close to those numbers that you have heard I think of transactional parts. And I think some of the Class 1s alluded to, like 20% down. Yes. I mean, we did feel that directly. I think what we have also seen is from the bottoming of the volume, which fundamentally happened in the first two months of the quarter, we have seen that improvement come through. That is also being true not just for North America. We have also seen that into international markets. And we do expect recovery to happen there faster, especially as our fleets are on parked. It is all dependent on the pace in, which those fleets gets un-parked. I think we are seeing a faster rate of recovery on international markets. I think I mentioned here earlier, some of the dynamics on agribusiness mining across some of the geographies that we serve, and we are certainly seeing I see a much faster recovery, in fact, of some customers actually up year-over-year in terms of carloads in some of these geographies.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. Got it. And then just want to turn to transit, in terms of the recovery in terms of U.S. versus global, I know global is a much bigger impact for you on transit, any differences that you are seeing in those markets in terms of how they are recovering or interest in investing in infrastructure going forward?\nRafael Santana: I think the recovery in terms of number one, ridership has been a little bit better in Europe, if you compare against U.S., but reality is it remains well below what I will call the pre-COVID level. So, I think the better side of it is we have seen I think number of trains in service and operations are very significant despite of the ridership being down. So, I think we can also be looking at service despite maybe a lower decline going into a faster recovery. And I think other element is, I think, as far as project scales, we haven\u2019t seen any again cancellations or anything with regards to the impact of the share. There could be an element of things pushing to the right in terms of just project delays when customers might want equipment. I think that\u2019s one of the elements that we are going to keep monitoring.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thanks so much. I will pass it along.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Hi, great. Thanks for the question, guys. You talked a little bit about kind of the bottoming in volumes and in ridership in transit. And I appreciate kind of a lot of questions on kind of the aftermarket, but could you kind of clarify what the exit rate trends that you are seeing kind of that improvement off of the down 18% in transit aftermarket and then similarly, in the freight services side kind of how you have seen that recovery progressed so far kind of as we have gone through the quarter and the exit trends?\nRafael Santana: So, I think in terms of the exit trends, I mean, yes, we saw it going back up some of the demand in both \u2013 in terms of orders, but in terms of sales, versus the first 2 months of the quarter. I think, in specific, I\u2019d say in transit, I think beyond that, I think we have taken significant actions in the business. Lilian and the team is really committed to continue to take the necessary cost actions and I look at a year-to-date we are 110 basis points margin improvement versus the first half of last year. I think we have talked to you about being at least 100 basis points improvement year-over-year. So, despite of what I will call a really unprecedented quarter in many ways, we are very much on track to deliver on that promise. So, still a lot of work to do, still subject to lot of disruptions, but we feel like the team is heading in the right direction here.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay. And then just on the synergy targets, obviously, you mentioned that you feel confident that you can get over the $150 million net by the end of this year. I think you have talked about some of those synergies being volume related. So, maybe can you just comment on your confidence is that because you are seeing that volume improve or are you seeing maybe faster footprint reduction than you were anticipating? And then if you can talk at all about maybe the upside to that $250 million since you have mentioned that you will achieve that earlier than you had previously anticipated?\nRafael Santana: Yes, we are certainly \u2013 I\u2019d say number one reason for that is we do have a pipeline of synergies that\u2019s greater than the one that we have provided. So, we are continuing to work on those and they are critical in order to offset any I\u2019ll call downside that we could experience along the way. So, we are not giving necessarily any considerations on volume growth at this point as being able to accelerate that. But I think we have got good momentum there. And I think we continue to have opportunity here to provide I will call better news in terms of accelerating synergies as we progress this year and into next year.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, good morning. Pat, maybe just continue on the margin commentary there, what are your thoughts on freight margins now that you have fully integrated with GE and lapping year-over-year. You are in the upper-teens, but maybe just help us think about what happens as asset sales come back online, should we see a mix change do you expect that to move back into the 20 should it stay at this level, maybe just your general thoughts as the mix shifts with business mix?\nRafael Santana: Sure. I mean, when you kind of look at the impacts you have freight car builds that are really at very historically low levels you have North America locos and in the impact of that markets on our business, as those volumes come back on, we have we obviously get really good margins on the on the freight car build and we get good margins on the locomotive builds, on OE and the absorption that comes along with that. So I think that you could see the business and the margins for that freight segment improve with the higher volume It certainly makes sense. The other aspect of this would be digital electronics and, the investment that our customers will make in the growth in that in that revenue area will also provide really good margins for the segment.\nKen Hoexter: So it\u2019s not like digital has higher margins because of less asset intensity. So therefore, it\u2019s peakish now and with more assets, it would be pressured you see as the physical assets come back and improving in that margin, just as you get more fixed cost coverage just to clarify on that?\nRafael Santana: Yes, exactly. I think fixed costs coverage is a big part of it, but I think it\u2019s, also it those are those are good product lines for us and they deliver a lot of value for our customers and I think that is the overall volumes recover and we get industry improve. I think that you will see the margins get back to more historical than typical levels. \nKen Hoexter: Right. And then for my follow-up, Pascal, you say obviously freight did well in the in holding up in the background can you talk about the mix of contract services versus equipment in the backlog itself in terms of what was added and maybe your thoughts on domestic versus international as well?\nPascal Schweitzer: Look, you want to think about I just want to be a little careful, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve kind of broken out like each of the, the component, the product line revenue into its backlog and everything. Obviously, we talk in general about the revenue mix in the services, as about half of it comes under the MSA agreements, which is an element of both kind of labor service and parts and other activity. You have mods in there and you have part sales in there. So those are those are basically the rule of thumb that we have been talking about in terms of how to look at that, that product line revenue. And I think the orders that we have come in, kind of hold with that with that mix. It is not absolute every quarter but when you look over a longer period, a year or more, you are going to see your order intake be pretty consistent with that mix of revenue.\nRafael Santana: And maybe to your question about\u2026\nPat Dugan: North America back to the international, I mean, what we see is that North America, we have seen these big impact from parking. Now, if you look at the active fleet today, Wabtec locomotives really represent the majority of the fleet that is running today. So this is an effect that is mitigating with high parking number. And the locomotives that are running are running really hard. So in terms of megawatt hour miles per locomotive we have really seen a strong increase, together with the implementation of precision scheduled railroading So which is one thing that is accelerating scheduled maintenance, that is putting more focus on reliability and which is good for services international Rafael discussed it. I mean, Australia is strong, Brazil is strong Kazakhstan, Egypt, many of our big international markets have remained strong. And in terms of in terms of mods with the great work that our supply chain team has been doing to keep our factories open, we have been able to stick to our delivery schedules, and to have a strong quarter as well. So these are really the three building blocks that that can explain this performance, I would say.\nRafael Santana: I think if you look at the last few years we have continued to see an increase in terms of the percent of our fleets running when compared to our competitors, whether if I look at North America or global markets. I think that\u2019s an ongoing trend.\nKen Hoexter: Thank you so much. Appreciate the time and thoughts.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Elkott: Good morning. Thank you. So, back at the Analyst Day, you guys provided a chart showing the installed base distribution for locomotives. And based on the age profile of the T4 locomotives, it would appear that some of them may be rolling off warranty in the next couple of years. First of all, is that \u2013 if that makes sense? If so, would that be a positive for aftermarket revenue on those locomotives?\nRafael Santana: Yes, yes, that\u2019s true. Now keep in mind, I mean, this is a big fleet right, we are talking about 23,000 assets as we presented. I think we have a favorable age distribution. The average age of this fleet is only 13 years, which is a pretty young fleet that is going to keep running for a number of years. You have some of the older fleets that are running less you have some of fleets that are coming off warranty, especially internationally. And so you have a number of effects coming together. But true, we have some locomotives coming off warranty and these locomotives start generating service revenue.\nMatt Elkott: And then service revenue, that doesn\u2019t make it into the backlog number, does it, that you have published at $12 billion?\nRafael Santana: Not necessary, it depends on the contractual coverage that we have for these units.\nPat Dugan: Yes, I mean, you \u2013 you have MSAs that are out there depending on the customer and the fleet and their own decision. There might be a contract agreement that\u2019s in place. But you could also have customers be doing some of the maintenance on their own with just our parts or somewhere in the middle, it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s not something as you can kind of paint broad-brush over everybody, it can be a little bit different. And that\u2019s why I always go back to the kind of the mixer of the service revenue for the product line.\nRafael Santana: So there is about what $600 million, which is more transactional, which is orders you get on the Gulf, so you might not be seeing those on the backlog to your point out of the total $2.2 billion that make up the bridge.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. That makes sense. And speaking of question that may be in that gray area and it\u2019s somewhat hard to answer, I was just wondering, if we can gauge what percentage of your international backlog maybe for customers that are government-backed entities, federal government backed entities versus state level versus private companies, I know that you probably don\u2019t have that specific breakout, but any color would be helpful?\nRafael Santana: Exactly. We don\u2019t really have that breakdown like you described, but I mean we can certainly look into that and try to get back to you with at least some color around it.\nPat Dugan: Yes, I would just add \u2013 I mean just as like a rule of thumb or something that just to consider. I mean, a lot of our especially in the freight side, our contracts are backed with bank guarantees and other financing that\u2019s in place. And when you get on the transit side, especially on the OE markets, where you have the big backlog, those are typically supported with government funding. And often that funding has been in place for years and because they \u2013 because the contract was awarded years ago. So, that\u2019s just kind of a thing to consider.\nRafael Santana: So, that\u2019s one side on the equipment and maybe on the service side they will very often be sold if a services contract on the top of that, because they want to make sure ultimately they maintain the locomotives running and there is an element of continued training to the operators. And what we often see is our fleets running, especially in those remote locations as we support the customers throughout the life of the locomotives.\nPascal Schweitzer: Yes. To look, I mean, internationally, we can pretty often without the proper service we both end up with a brand new fleet of locomotives that is stranded after a few years only we really try to stay close, we have our customers over the entire life of the \u2013 over the entire life of the locomotive. We have more than 160 service locations all around the world. So, adding local presence and being able to bring engineering support whether physically or with remote diagnostics is having keeping parts locally is really important for us internationally. \nRafael Santana: So we are very interconnected with our customers to the point that in a lot of places, we manage the inventory associated with parts coming in and ultimately making sure we guarantee the availability and reliability of those assets. So we feel very much upfront on any of those changes.\nMatt Elkott: Great. Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Good morning, everyone. Rafael I am wondering, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about how your MSA is performed in the quarter obviously, really strong services results. Sounds like mods help. But can you talk about the MSA performance in particular and, I believe you get Higher revenue opportunities post PSR adoption and I am wondering, are you starting to see that hitting the sweet spot, if you will? Can you? Can you just expand around those points?\nRafael Santana: Okay. So I\u2019ll just start with the second quarter. I mean, of course, the trends were not great there. I mean we saw a decline in some of these items. And I think I mentioned about parts I mean we also saw pressure on the MSA I mean units not just not running as much as they were. But once again, I think as you start seeing the on parking take place, I think we are seeing those trends as early as of June and continuing to July to move in the right direction. And I think we are seeing a good pattern from this point of view. But I think though one thing I want to highlight to you here is we are working with customers to make sure that they have got ultimately, I think the most efficient the most reliable locomotives out there. And these presents to us opportunities to overhaul to modernize and to ultimately also equip them, so they can run a lot of the things you have heard from the Class 1s, how do I run longer trains? How do I get to a more fuel efficiency for those locomotives, and we got to make sure that we are combative does we do that but things like distributed power with LOCOTROL, LXA, Trip optimizer. These are some of the technologies that will enable that and these are in fact, proven technologies that align very well with PSR. And all the efficiency, railroads want to drive and I think, again, very much connected with a lot of the story you hear from Pascal on the services side, and one area that we continue to see opportunity here to grow our installed days and to help customers with a great paybacks. \nJerry Revich: Okay. And then, a follow-up on mods, Pat, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks. You had double digit growth, to hit the type of outperformance that you had in services versus trade volumes in the quarter, you would see mods, shipments would have to be up, you know, 30% to 40% year over year to drive the level of performance that we saw for you folks in the quarter and I am wondering if you can comment on what\u2019s the equity level like for adding mods to backlog? Are you able to essentially maintain the mods backlog as we hopefully see improving Freight conditions entering 21 \nPat Dugan: Yes, so the mods are, they are in the backlog year over year, essentially, we continue to execute on orders received and, it would have been in 2019. And according to the schedule, that are customers and have worked with us on establishing so there is a certain amount of quarter to quarter variability it will come with those mods orders as we execute it sometimes it\u2019s, to look at it and say this is going to be linear or whatever, or have a trend there, you really have to look at a bigger picture, a bigger number of quarters or a year to date, kind of kind of numbers. So it just so happens in the second quarter that backlog is more staggered in compared to last year. When you talk about order intake for mods going forward I mean, it\u2019s, I think that there is a lot of interest in our customers to continue to, to use this mod approach to leverage especially in their PSR strategy and, and their fleet and their fleet strategy. Pascal if there is anything you want to add to that?\nPascal Schweitzer: No, I mean, number one, I think if you look at the service number for the quarter, it was not 100% a mod story, right? As we explained, we had a difficult situation in North America due to parking. However, a big portion of our fleet kept running internationally. We saw some strong performance. And then we had a strong mod quarter in terms of deliveries. Now looking forward for mods, I mean, we believe that this is a big opportunity for the railroads, which is fully in line with their strategy, as Rafael said around longer trains, more reliable trains, better economic performance, we have analyzed the fleet in a lot of detail and we have the opportunity to deliver big outcomes and to our customers. So, we are talking about 50% increase in power eligibility, reliability improvement by more than 50%, 10% fuel efficiency improvement, the addition of all our suite of digital solutions, Trip Optimizer, LOCOTROL, LXA. And all this, when you combine it together we believe that this is turning into a very attractive investment proposition for the railroad. Now for them in the end it\u2019s a question of capital allocation and they decide. I mean we will count to show them the value of our product and we believe that there is a big opportunity to create value for the railroads and for Wabtec at the same time. You can and you will see big swings between mods and so what I\u2019ll call new locomotive volumes quarter-over-quarter. Just keep in mind, the same facilities, they are doing the mods or doing the new units and of course, we tend to profile those to make sure mean we are driving good productivity at our plants. So, there could be some significant changes on quarter-over-quarter numbers. I think the seasonality \u2013 the seasonality effect is important and you have mods, you have service, you have scheduled, you have unscheduled maintenance, you have the overall profile. There is a seasonality impact and then you will see some ups and downs there.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Appreciate the discussion and congratulations on the strong quarter. Thanks, everyone.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSteve Barger: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. For the Digital business increase of 4%, was more of that recurring revenue from existing customers or you have been able to convert new customers looking for efficiency in 2Q?\nRafael Santana: Can you repeat that?\nPat Dugan: You broke up a little bit. Steve, can you say it again?\nSteve Barger: Yes, sorry. The digital business increase of 4% more recurring customers or were you converting new customers?\nRafael Santana: I think we have \u2013 a lot of it\u2019s associated with I will call existing customers. We have the opportunity here to grow our installed base on some products that are still under-penetrated. I think I mentioned here, LXA as a product. So I mean, we still have an installed base that\u2019s relatively small when I look at the potential of this product. And it\u2019s a key product, especially as railroads look at making longer trains. I think there is some elements here of auto products like Smart HPT that will also enable customers to get significant fuel savings as they run those longer trains, so more with existing products and existing customers. I think one of the big opportunities we have is to expand that share growth and really into the international market. I think we have got some earlier adopters in places like Brazil, in places like Kazakhstan, but we can still be doing a lot into some modern geographies.\nSteve Barger: So that was my next question. The digital business is much more North America and less penetrated in international?\nRafael Santana: Exactly.\nSteve Barger: And just last one, one quick clarification, Slide 8 says you expect to drive margin improvement in transit through the rest of the year. Does that mean sequential improvement by quarter or is that relative to what you put up last year?\nRafael Santana: I think, again, what we said last year was we are going to drive at least 100 basis points margin improvement year-over-year. And we certainly have actions that support more than that. And I think my commentary earlier was you look at the first half of the year, we are very much on track to do so and actions will continue. It\u2019s less about the event. I will call the improvement year-over-year, but making sure that we will continue to drive momentum to, well, get to our entitlement. So I want to see continued momentum there.\nSteve Barger: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks for the time, guys. A couple quick ones for you first Pat. So typically third quarter just normal seasonality is lower than third than second quarter, does that sort of normal seasonality apply this year and then maybe just bigger picture when I look at the guidance, showed a faster improvement in revenue growth off the bottom than earnings growth? Maybe just some thoughts there on sort of the mixer or margins as revenue starts recovering? Thank you.\nPat Dugan: Yes. So the seasonality we kind of find that to be a little bit challenging and a little bit, not typical year to year when you would consider all that we have gone through the easy one to point to is the timing of some of our freight services business, we would see a lot of strength of that in the in the third quarter. And then in the my earlier remarks prior March, I kind of mentioned that we see some of that edging out into the fourth quarter. And I think that that\u2019s, from what we can tell what our customers we think that that\u2019s going to have an impact. I think you also look at that was always a kind of a positive seasonality in Q3 you also had some negative impact of shutdowns and plant slowdowns in the in the summer months in Q3. We are seeing that being a little bit moderated. So I think that the expectation for us in Q3. getting back to normal and next year. and I your point about, about kind of revenue growth outpacing the earnings growth. I think that\u2019s a little bit related to the sales mix timing, we, we certainly will see some kind of return to normal and some of our engineering costs and, SG&A being, more consistent with the higher revenues. And I think that will have an impact on our margins a little bit in the second half of the year. \nScott Group: Okay, thank you. Just last one, if I go back to the beginning of the year, you were talking about $900 million of cash from ops. It looks like the net income guidance is down around $200 million from January. So should we assume a similar sort of $200 million decline in cash flow from operations or is there reasons why it can be better than that?\nPat Dugan: Well, I think you got a, obviously consider the impact of net income In lower volumes on the cash flow, but, the areas of confidence in cash flow and opportunities to do better, really starts with the ability to work with our working capital to reduce our working capital with a lower volumes, turn that into a source of cash, obviously, the cash, the cost savings initiatives that we put in place. And, we continue to execute on some of the tools, the balance sheet tools and the supply chain tools that we replaced from exiting the GE transaction. So all those things I think lead to a lot of confidence in our cash flow generation for the rest of the year.\nScott Group: Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Appreciate the time.\nPat Dugan: Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kristine Kubacki for any closing remarks. \nKristine Kubacki: Thank you everyone for your participation. I will turn the call over to Rafael for a quick few comments. \nRafael Santana : Hey, just one of the most disruptive quarters for us ever with really an impact for both customers and operations, Wabtec employees have been absolutely amazing in their response, and I just want to thank them for the hard work and dedication to keep serving our customers and running our company. Well. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Pascal Schweitzer",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael. Good morning, everyone. It is good to be with all of you today. I am Pascal Schweitzer and I am the Group President of Wabtec Freight Services. It is a roughly $2.2 billion business with operations in around 40 countries and approximately $12 billion in backlog. Roughly, 80% of our revenues are generated through multiyear contracts, including long-term service agreements, parts contract as well as multiyear modernization agreements. So in short, we are with our customers for the long haul, helping them pull freight in some of the most important logistics corridors around the world. As I have shown before, we are executing on a focused strategy to create value for our customers. This included ensuring that our fleet is performing well and running hard, that we are capturing the aftermarket with a superior product and delivering outcomes for our customers through technology upgrades and new tools. All these while constantly improving our fleet's total lifecycle cost. Today, as railroads continue to enhance for productivity and efficiency gains, through initiatives like precision schedule railroading, for instance and in the mixed challenges brought on by the pandemic. This strategy is more relevant than ever. The second quarter, as Rafael explained, we saw significant disruption in many of the regions where we operate. Government shutdowns had an impact on our customer operations and trade volumes globally. As a result, a record number of locomotives were parked in North America. However, despite this, we continue to have a leading and increasing share of the total active fleet. And our customers continue to increasingly prioritize the dispatch of our locomotives due in large part to the performance and reliability of the fleet. I would also like to point out that in the second quarter we need to hit record performance for on-time parts delivery and despite regional disruptions and shutdowns from COVID, each of our more than 100 service locations remained open and fully operational, a huge testament to the team in the field and we see the strong illustration that we do so much more than sell parts. You see that's reflected in the resiliency of our second quarter top line. So, while the uncertainty related to the crisis has led some railroads to delay certain investment decisions, the value of our portfolio remains. We have worked with our customers to align scheduled maintenance plans to the new market realities. And as a result, we have leveraged the full power of Wabtec to increase the scope of our work and to unlock new growth in R&D. Now looking ahead as railroads enter into recovery and the growing level of freights relying on the small number of locomotives, we expect the demand for reliability to be even greater. This will translate into more comprehensive work scopes, into more comprehensive fleet strategies, into modernization opportunities. Currently, we have more than 1,000 modernized locomotives in operation, delivering improved reliability, better fuel efficiency and overall economic performance for our customers. As our customers strategically consider their investment plans over the long-term, the value of modernizations remains very compelling. The second quarter, mods deliveries show good momentum and we continue to have visibility via our multiyear backlog. Now, on a broader international scale, where economies are starting to reopen, we are also seeing encouraging improvement in parkings and operational fleet performance. Just to give you a few examples, in Australia, rail activity has shown good momentum throughout the quarter as China resumed business following the COVID lockdown. In Kazakhstan, year-to-date car volumes are up compared with 2019. Brazil, we see a strong demand with greater dependency on agricultural products, following a record harvest. In India, while there were a significant number of locomotives parked due to the pandemic, this ultimately had little impact to our business as we shifted focus to maintenance. And as of July, all of these locomotives are back in operation. Finally, in North America, as discussed, we do expect carload volumes to continue to gradually improve and parking to progressively recover. In terms of commercial activity for the quarter, the team closed some significant long-term service agreements with Class 1s in North America as well as in Brazil and won a key order for our FDL Advantage product. Going into this product a little bit more specifically as Rafael described, we had around 10,000 FDL locomotives running globally. Any of these locomotives are approaching their second or third engine overhauls. So with these next-gen solutions, we are able to reduce the fuel consumptions by up to 5%. That means for a single locomotive burning around 200,000 gallons of fuel a year, around $25,000 in savings per year. This is an exciting first win that is opening up a multimillion dollar pipeline of opportunity for Wabtec fully in line with our strategy of technology differentiation for the installed base. Finally, I will share a few thoughts on cost management. So last year, we have reduced our headcount by roughly 10% ahead of our synergy commitment and in line with market realities. We have undertaken lean actives to drive cost out of the business, while still being able to deliver for our customers and scale up as markets recover. But to conclude, while the market remains fluid and carload volumes and parking grew significant headwinds, the freight services team had a strong operational quarter giving us confidence that our broad international portfolio, our $12 billion multiyear backlog, and our strong aftermarket rates will position us well into the future. Looking forward, you will see some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonality of maintenance activity due to our engine overhaul profiles and mods delivery schedules. However, the fundamentals of this business and its ability to recover post COVID remains strong. I will now turn things over to Pat to provide more color on the company's overall second quarter performance. Pat? Look, you want to think about I just want to be a little careful, I don't think we've kind of broken out like each of the, the component, the product line revenue into its backlog and everything. Obviously, we talk in general about the revenue mix in the services, as about half of it comes under the MSA agreements, which is an element of both kind of labor service and parts and other activity. You have mods in there and you have part sales in there. So those are those are basically the rule of thumb that we have been talking about in terms of how to look at that, that product line revenue. And I think the orders that we have come in, kind of hold with that with that mix. It is not absolute every quarter but when you look over a longer period, a year or more, you are going to see your order intake be pretty consistent with that mix of revenue. Yes. To look, I mean, internationally, we can pretty often without the proper service we both end up with a brand new fleet of locomotives that is stranded after a few years only we really try to stay close, we have our customers over the entire life of the \u2013 over the entire life of the locomotive. We have more than 160 service locations all around the world. So, adding local presence and being able to bring engineering support whether physically or with remote diagnostics is having keeping parts locally is really important for us internationally. No, I mean, number one, I think if you look at the service number for the quarter, it was not 100% a mod story, right? As we explained, we had a difficult situation in North America due to parking. However, a big portion of our fleet kept running internationally. We saw some strong performance. And then we had a strong mod quarter in terms of deliveries. Now looking forward for mods, I mean, we believe that this is a big opportunity for the railroads, which is fully in line with their strategy, as Rafael said around longer trains, more reliable trains, better economic performance, we have analyzed the fleet in a lot of detail and we have the opportunity to deliver big outcomes and to our customers. So, we are talking about 50% increase in power eligibility, reliability improvement by more than 50%, 10% fuel efficiency improvement, the addition of all our suite of digital solutions, Trip Optimizer, LOCOTROL, LXA. And all this, when you combine it together we believe that this is turning into a very attractive investment proposition for the railroad. Now for them in the end it's a question of capital allocation and they decide. I mean we will count to show them the value of our product and we believe that there is a big opportunity to create value for the railroads and for Wabtec at the same time. You can and you will see big swings between mods and so what I'll call new locomotive volumes quarter-over-quarter. Just keep in mind, the same facilities, they are doing the mods or doing the new units and of course, we tend to profile those to make sure mean we are driving good productivity at our plants. So, there could be some significant changes on quarter-over-quarter numbers. I think the seasonality \u2013 the seasonality effect is important and you have mods, you have service, you have scheduled, you have unscheduled maintenance, you have the overall profile. There is a seasonality impact and then you will see some ups and downs there."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Pat Dugan",
            "content": "Thanks, Pascal. Turning to Slide 6, sales for the second quarter were $1.7 billion, which reflects a 22% decrease versus the prior year. The decline in year-over-year sales was mainly due to disruption across our freight and transit segments caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For the quarter, operating income was $159 million and adjusted operating income was $262 million. That's down 32% year-over-year, mainly driven by the lower sales and the disruption in our operations as a result of the pandemic offset somewhat by variable cost actions and the realization of our synergies. For the quarter, adjusted operating income excluded pre-tax expense of $103 million, of which $72 million was for non-cash amortization, $31 million of restructuring and transaction costs. Take a look at the Appendix D to our press release for the reconciliation of these details. Now, looking at some of these detailed line items, SG&A declined 26% year-over-year to $217 million, including $13 million of the restructuring and transaction expenses, SG&A expense benefited from structural cost actions across the business as well as the realization of synergies. Engineering expense decreased to $38 million or down 33% from last year. Engineering expense moved down with a lower volume outlook as well as some changes in project timing. And amortization expenses were $72 million. In 2020, we expect non-cash amortization expense to be about $290 million and appreciation expense of about $180 million. Second quarter, we had GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.46 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.70. Details that bridge the GAAP earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share of $0.87 can be found attached to our press release. As of June 30, our multiyear backlog was $21.4 billion. Excluding the impact of FX, backlog is flat quarter-over-quarter, a rolling 12-month backlog which is a subset of the multiyear backlog, $5.3 billion. Our backlog continues to give us and provide good visibility across both the freight and transit segments. Now, let's take a look at those segments, the results on Slide 7. Across the Freight segment, total sales decreased 21% to $1.2 billion in the second quarter, FX negatively impacted sales by about $26 million during the quarter. In terms of product lines, equipment sales were down 37% year-over-year as a result of lower North America locomotive deliveries, which as we have discussed, often can vary quarter-to-quarter due to timing and that was offset somewhat in the second quarter by higher year-over-year international locomotive deliveries and increased mining sales. In the second half of the year, we expect locomotive deliveries to be slightly higher when compared to the first half of this year. And as you heard Pascal discuss, our services portfolio continues to show resiliency despite the OE headwinds. Despite a nearly 18% drop in North America freight volumes for the quarter, services revenues were down 8% year-over-year, a result of lower parts sales due to record locomotive parkings, but that was offset by double-digit growth in mods deliveries. We expect our parts sales to improve with a gradual recovery in freight volumes, recent timing of maintenance and overhaul work edging into the fourth quarter. Digital Electronics sales were up 4% year-over-year on higher sales of distributed power products and signaling projects. Components sales were down 30% year-over-year on lower year-over-year railcar build and declines in key industrial end markets such as oil and gas and power generation. Despite the top line headwinds, evidence of our synergies coming through as segment adjusted operating income was $229 million for an adjusted margin of 19%. Finally, the freight segment backlog was $18 billion about flat with the prior quarter. I would note again that FX negatively impacted that backlog by about $58 million. Turning to Slide 8, across our Transit segment, sales decreased 25% year-over-year to $533 million driven largely by disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 virus, but were also impacted by FX which reduced sales by an additional $18 million. OE sales were down 32% year-over-year on disruptions caused by the pandemic. During the quarter, our operations and our customers' operations, which are primarily in Europe and Asia, were negatively impacted by government shutdowns. Aftermarket sales, which were down 18% from last year, were impacted by reduced capacity at many transit systems around the globe. However, as economies have opened up, we have seen a resumption in service, increased equipment deployed, gradual recovery and ridership in most markets. Our adjusted segment operating income was $51 million for an adjusted operating margin of 9.6%. Margin performance was impacted by the lower absorption of fixed costs in the first half of the quarter. However, we are continuing to drive improvements in the transit business and expect transit margins to increase 100 basis points for the year. Finally, the segment backlog was $3.4 billion, also about flat with last quarter. FX negatively impacted the backlog by $79 million versus the end of the first quarter. Now, let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow on Slide 9. Cash flow generation during the quarter was strong at $311 million. I would note that we had about $40 million of one-time impacts due to prior year restructuring and transaction charges we had identified on our last earnings call. Our leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 2.7x about flat with the last quarter. But our total liquidity at the end of the second quarter, was $1.9 billion, up solidly from the $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter and total net debt is down about $282 million. Also in July, we took proactive steps to restore a more balanced maturity profile of our debt with a successful 5-year $500 million bond offering that retired $500 million in floating rate notes due in September of 2021. Summary our balance sheet is strong, and we are confident in our ability to generate cash flow, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to execute our strategic. With that, let's move to Slide 10. And I will turn the call back over to Rafael. No, I think the one thing I would point out is that when the \u2013 when you kind of look at our information though as it becomes available, the mix of aftermarket versus OE that the decline is much more significant in the OE side kind of quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. You see that it's really being impacted by the disruption in the industry, in the market. And so I think to get to your question of where and how those recoveries, I think the recovery is going to be in both segments, I think you are going to see it coming back to more typical mix of businesses as the year goes along. Yes, just want to be careful about guidance this quarter and everything. But I think you see sort of a kind of a steady sequential improvement as we go through the rest of the year. Yes. And as for the allocation, I think it's obviously, one of the most challenging times and we want to make sure that we focus on debt repayment and then get into other uses of capital. I don't think \u2013 I think it's too early to really be talking about anything aggressive or we want to \u2013 but we want to remain opportunistic and that's the way we have approached this. We are generating cash, we are meeting our goals and then we are using it to get our debt in the right kind of ratio range as we have always talked about and be opportunistic for all the other things we can do. Thanks. Good morning. North America back to the international, I mean, what we see is that North America, we have seen these big impact from parking. Now, if you look at the active fleet today, Wabtec locomotives really represent the majority of the fleet that is running today. So this is an effect that is mitigating with high parking number. And the locomotives that are running are running really hard. So in terms of megawatt hour miles per locomotive we have really seen a strong increase, together with the implementation of precision scheduled railroading So which is one thing that is accelerating scheduled maintenance, that is putting more focus on reliability and which is good for services international Rafael discussed it. I mean, Australia is strong, Brazil is strong Kazakhstan, Egypt, many of our big international markets have remained strong. And in terms of in terms of mods with the great work that our supply chain team has been doing to keep our factories open, we have been able to stick to our delivery schedules, and to have a strong quarter as well. So these are really the three building blocks that that can explain this performance, I would say. Yes, I mean, you \u2013 you have MSAs that are out there depending on the customer and the fleet and their own decision. There might be a contract agreement that's in place. But you could also have customers be doing some of the maintenance on their own with just our parts or somewhere in the middle, it's really \u2013 it's not something as you can kind of paint broad-brush over everybody, it can be a little bit different. And that's why I always go back to the kind of the mixer of the service revenue for the product line. Yes, I would just add \u2013 I mean just as like a rule of thumb or something that just to consider. I mean, a lot of our especially in the freight side, our contracts are backed with bank guarantees and other financing that's in place. And when you get on the transit side, especially on the OE markets, where you have the big backlog, those are typically supported with government funding. And often that funding has been in place for years and because they \u2013 because the contract was awarded years ago. So, that's just kind of a thing to consider. Yes, so the mods are, they are in the backlog year over year, essentially, we continue to execute on orders received and, it would have been in 2019. And according to the schedule, that are customers and have worked with us on establishing so there is a certain amount of quarter to quarter variability it will come with those mods orders as we execute it sometimes it's, to look at it and say this is going to be linear or whatever, or have a trend there, you really have to look at a bigger picture, a bigger number of quarters or a year to date, kind of kind of numbers. So it just so happens in the second quarter that backlog is more staggered in compared to last year. When you talk about order intake for mods going forward I mean, it's, I think that there is a lot of interest in our customers to continue to, to use this mod approach to leverage especially in their PSR strategy and, and their fleet and their fleet strategy. Pascal if there is anything you want to add to that? You broke up a little bit. Steve, can you say it again? Yes. So the seasonality we kind of find that to be a little bit challenging and a little bit, not typical year to year when you would consider all that we have gone through the easy one to point to is the timing of some of our freight services business, we would see a lot of strength of that in the in the third quarter. And then in the my earlier remarks prior March, I kind of mentioned that we see some of that edging out into the fourth quarter. And I think that that's, from what we can tell what our customers we think that that's going to have an impact. I think you also look at that was always a kind of a positive seasonality in Q3 you also had some negative impact of shutdowns and plant slowdowns in the in the summer months in Q3. We are seeing that being a little bit moderated. So I think that the expectation for us in Q3. getting back to normal and next year. and I your point about, about kind of revenue growth outpacing the earnings growth. I think that's a little bit related to the sales mix timing, we, we certainly will see some kind of return to normal and some of our engineering costs and, SG&A being, more consistent with the higher revenues. And I think that will have an impact on our margins a little bit in the second half of the year. Well, I think you got a, obviously consider the impact of net income In lower volumes on the cash flow, but, the areas of confidence in cash flow and opportunities to do better, really starts with the ability to work with our working capital to reduce our working capital with a lower volumes, turn that into a source of cash, obviously, the cash, the cost savings initiatives that we put in place. And, we continue to execute on some of the tools, the balance sheet tools and the supply chain tools that we replaced from exiting the GE transaction. So all those things I think lead to a lot of confidence in our cash flow generation for the rest of the year. Thank you."

            "name": "Rafael Santana",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristine and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. And I hope you and your families remain healthy and safe. Before we get started, I would like to once again thank our employees out in the field, in our factories and those working from remote locations for continuing to keep our facilities safe and operational through this pandemic. I am very proud of how our teams has responded to the challenging environment delivered for our customers and supported one another during a time when healthcare, economic and social tensions run high. And you see that reflected in our second quarter results and long-term focus. Turning to Slide 3, we had a strong execution in the second quarter despite a difficult environment. Total sales for the quarter were $1.7 billion driven largely by the international freight market and services, but offset by disruptions due to COVID in both the freight and transit end-market. Adjusted operating income was $262 million, resulting in an adjusted margin of 15.1%, which was impacted by the drop in sales across freight and transit, but somewhat offset by synergies. Cash flow from operations of $311 million was driven by strong cash conversion and good working capital performance. This allowed us to further strengthen our financial position, pay-down debt during the quarter by $300 million and increase our liquidity position by $700 million. Total multiyear backlog was over $21 billion, providing us continued visibility across freight and transit despite market conditions. And finally, we ended the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.87, demonstrating that we are taking the steps necessary to control what we can, protect the long-term viability of the company and deliver shareholder value. With that, let's dive into some actions underway. As you know, we remain committed to our synergy targets and we are accelerating our efforts here. We have $150 million of net synergies planned for 2020. Year-to-date, we are on plan with over $70 million in net synergies realized and we remain confident that we will deliver on the full run-rate of $250 million in synergies ahead of schedule. Of particular note, we continued the aggressive action on structural costs and lowered SG&A expense by 26% year-over-year. During second quarter, we reduced headcount by 5% and were down more than 10% year-over-year. We have also reduced our operational footprint year-over-year and we are actively driving cost reductions through lean initiatives. To-date, we have exited more than 60% of the shared service agreements from GE Transportation merger ahead of schedule. Looking ahead, the rail transportation market and impacts from the pandemic remain challenged and fluid. While we anticipate market conditions to remain somewhat mixed, as I will share with you in a moment, we believe volumes largely bottomed in the second quarter and we will see a gradual recovery. With this in mind and based on our first half results as well as based on the backlog coverage for the rest of the year, we are issuing a new outlook for the 2020 year. Pending no further lockdowns due to COVID-19 pandemic or resulting negative impacts on our business, we expect revenues in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.6 billion for the year. We will continue to adjust our variable and fixed costs to align with volume realities and we are committed to improving segment margins. We anticipate adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.80 and cash conversions to be greater than 90% for the full year. This includes roughly $130 million from prior restructuring and transactions cash outflows. Cash conversion within the company's core business is expected to be over 100%. Turning to Slide 4, I would like to discuss the market conditions and drivers we are seeing across the sector. Pascal Schweitzer, President of Freight Services will also hit on some of this in a few minutes. In both freight and transit, we are experiencing mixed conditions as economic recovery begins and commuter travel resumes. And we are carefully monitoring the ongoing impact of the virus in some regions. In North America, rail volumes had a record decline, down roughly 20% year-over-year in the second quarter. However, we have seen rail volume improve since bottoming in the second quarter. Likewise, locomotive parkings, after peaking to a record high in the second quarter, have also shown gradual improvements and we remain positive on the aftermarket sector. In terms of the North American railcar builds, a record one-thirds of the North America rail car fleet is in storage and builders are taking continued steps to slow down production lines in 2020. Industry forecasts currently indicate that the rail car build for the year will be less than 30,000 cars. Reflecting on the quarter, I want to share a couple of highlights. Internationally, rail volumes were more resilient driven largely by agriculture and mining tailwinds. International locomotive shipments were up versus last year and helped offset North America locomotives and freight car build declines, as expected. We continue to see demand for new locomotives in Russia, CIS, Brazil and Australia. Some tenders have pushed to the right due to COVID-19, but we expect this to resolve as economies have stabilized. New growth opportunities for next-gen sustainable solutions also remain strong, especially for hybrids and fuel-saving technology. We are doing some really innovative work in reducing fuel consumptions by 5% through our engine overhaul process. Pascal will share more on this in a moment. We are also currently field testing our FLXdrive locomotive, the first 100% heavy-haul battery-powered locomotive in the world operating in the hybrid [consist] [ph]. So far, we are seeing an opportunity to reduce fuel consumption for our customers by 10% to 30%. We are extending battery technology to passenger transit as well and just closed a significant deal with New York City transit to drive down their overall carbon footprint. Finally, we continue to see our digital electronics product line provide significant productivity and improve safety for our customers. Sales for the quarter were up 4% versus the prior year. Transitioning to the transit sector, the COVID-19 crisis has had a significant impact on ridership and service levels in early second quarter. Since then, particularly in Europe and Asia, ridership trends are showing a slow recovery as economies reopen. This has resulted in some positive activity internationally with new brake, new doors, and HVAC contracts in regions like Australia, Canada, India and the UK. Overall, we believe the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remain intact, especially as governments look to rail as the cleanest, safest and the most efficient mode to address the world's public transportation challenges. Across the segment, we also continue to drive costs down. We continue to improve project execution and profitability. Lilian and the team are on track to expand margins over time while delivering over 100 basis points of improvement in 2020. With that, let's flip to Slide 5 and I will turn things over to Pascal. Thanks Pat. So as you heard throughout the morning and you see on this page Wabtec had a solid performance in the second quarter, despite a weak and fluid environment, a reminder that in difficult times, strong companies must learn how to adapt, find a better way and lead through change. We could not have imagined a greater stress test for our company and how it would perform in a difficult environment than the one we are seeing it today. Over the last 70 months, we have successfully managed a massive merger that doubled the size of this company we have faced into the global pandemic, in an industrial recession in one of the most difficult business cycles ever seen. Yet despite all the odds, we are performing strong and we have delivered a true testament to the team and their commitment to position this company as a stronger and more resilient Wabtec carrying into the second half of the year we would fully expect to see continued headwinds, especially given the uncertainties of COVID-19. Our leadership team remains constant and committed to manage cost and to drive profitable growth that will help us navigate these challenges. I want to personally thank each and every member of the Wabtec team. Again, for all that they are doing in the face of change your efforts are reflected in the results we shared today. With that, I will turn the call back to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of the discussion. Good morning Justin. Sure. Justin, let me start first with well, as we look at the backlog coverage for the ranges we have provided we feel strong about that, I think we also feel strong about the strength in the execution. We have got say a strong momentum in terms of both synergies and cost actions that we are taking I think in the second quarter we certainly saw volumes bottoming for our costumers. We think it was also when we think from operational disruptions. I think we also, to some extent have seen the worse. I don't think we are through that; I think we have seen improvement in the transit storage at the end of the quarter point out to that with unparking of locomotives, ridership levels in the transit side have improved a bit but I think the better news there, you have got a large number of trains still operating. So I think we are continuing to see those trends. There is, of course, some volatility as we see, and as we look into the recovery, but we are seeing trends up starting at the end of the second quarter, and we continue to see that through this month of July as well. Pat I don't know if you want to add any more specifics into it? I think one of the things we will be watching for is really any push-outs on the decisions which regards to new projects. And I think that's something for us to continue to monitor here as we continue to build backlog. Well, couple of points. I think we have given clear guidance to cash conversion being above 90%, I think we remain committed to that. And I think we have the areas of opportunities here to act. If you look into areas like inventory, for instance, so we will continue to have strong rigor around that and we feel strong about delivering above 90% cash conversion here. We remain committed to the framework we presented during the Investor Day. I mean, there is a commitment to continue to pay debt down, but we are going to be looking at opportunities here. And especially, we can see bolt-on acquisitions being I will call more available than they were maybe 6 months ago and that will make sure to evaluate that against the different options. So, we are committed to that framework we presented back at the Investor Day. I think I will probably point out to three things to be a really watching. Of course, the impact for both customers in operation was very significant in the second quarter. As we are going to the second half, I think, first really watching closely on the freight side, the unparking of locomotives. What I feel was North America or international, I mean, we have seen the impacts in the second quarter. And as those un-parking occurs I think we have seen that trend. It's not linear, but I think there are some brighter spots then, but one places versus others. Especially, internationally, I'd say we see some of those brighter spots. We see democrats across some geographies and driven by well, either agriculture or specific mining. There is still some markets we're heavily under penetrated. So I think we see a good dynamics coming from the, from some of these markets. And it is reflected also in the pipeline of what I call opportunities for equipment deals. So what if I talk about agriculture in Brazil or mining in Australia, we also continue to deliver on our contract in India. You think a country like Kazakhstan's volumes carloads, are actually up year over a year, year to date, and that's also I think, a significant opportunity for us. I would say certainly, when I look at second quarter, even first quarter, I mean, I can't say those were necessarily great in terms of all favoring a dynamic of order intake. I think when you compare first quarter, against the second quarter, and if you have to exclude FX, you will see in backlog remained flattish quarter over quarter, I think, as we look at has ahead, I mean, we are really in the business of looking for business. We are chasing every piece of opportunity that we can go after. Our strategy here is to grow the business profitably, and so we will continue to act to have a more competitive cost structure than ever before. I think, yes, we are seeing some decisions moving to the right. And I think, especially if you think about some of the dynamics in the transit side with, really despite of the fact that ridership is low, I think we are seeing a number of trains in operation. So operators are really reevaluating some of these but we think the long term fundamental is ratified, look at transit or freight remain strong. And we are seeing a commitment to actually be investing in those modes. And this is part of the solution, as we look out the world ahead in terms of driving more efficient, more productive, less emissions. And I think we sit in a good place in terms of the long term fundamentals for the business. Good morning. Well, couple of comments there. Number one, I mean, we felt the impact in the second quarter in North America I mean it is brutal, right? I mean, as you look into the numbers you have heard from the Class 1s I mean we have seen volume reduction, pretty close to those numbers that you have heard I think of transactional parts. And I think some of the Class 1s alluded to, like 20% down. Yes. I mean, we did feel that directly. I think what we have also seen is from the bottoming of the volume, which fundamentally happened in the first two months of the quarter, we have seen that improvement come through. That is also being true not just for North America. We have also seen that into international markets. And we do expect recovery to happen there faster, especially as our fleets are on parked. It is all dependent on the pace in, which those fleets gets un-parked. I think we are seeing a faster rate of recovery on international markets. I think I mentioned here earlier, some of the dynamics on agribusiness mining across some of the geographies that we serve, and we are certainly seeing I see a much faster recovery, in fact, of some customers actually up year-over-year in terms of carloads in some of these geographies. I think the recovery in terms of number one, ridership has been a little bit better in Europe, if you compare against U.S., but reality is it remains well below what I will call the pre-COVID level. So, I think the better side of it is we have seen I think number of trains in service and operations are very significant despite of the ridership being down. So, I think we can also be looking at service despite maybe a lower decline going into a faster recovery. And I think other element is, I think, as far as project scales, we haven't seen any again cancellations or anything with regards to the impact of the share. There could be an element of things pushing to the right in terms of just project delays when customers might want equipment. I think that's one of the elements that we are going to keep monitoring. So, I think in terms of the exit trends, I mean, yes, we saw it going back up some of the demand in both \u2013 in terms of orders, but in terms of sales, versus the first 2 months of the quarter. I think, in specific, I'd say in transit, I think beyond that, I think we have taken significant actions in the business. Lilian and the team is really committed to continue to take the necessary cost actions and I look at a year-to-date we are 110 basis points margin improvement versus the first half of last year. I think we have talked to you about being at least 100 basis points improvement year-over-year. So, despite of what I will call a really unprecedented quarter in many ways, we are very much on track to deliver on that promise. So, still a lot of work to do, still subject to lot of disruptions, but we feel like the team is heading in the right direction here. Yes, we are certainly \u2013 I'd say number one reason for that is we do have a pipeline of synergies that's greater than the one that we have provided. So, we are continuing to work on those and they are critical in order to offset any I'll call downside that we could experience along the way. So, we are not giving necessarily any considerations on volume growth at this point as being able to accelerate that. But I think we have got good momentum there. And I think we continue to have opportunity here to provide I will call better news in terms of accelerating synergies as we progress this year and into next year. Sure. I mean, when you kind of look at the impacts you have freight car builds that are really at very historically low levels you have North America locos and in the impact of that markets on our business, as those volumes come back on, we have we obviously get really good margins on the on the freight car build and we get good margins on the locomotive builds, on OE and the absorption that comes along with that. So I think that you could see the business and the margins for that freight segment improve with the higher volume It certainly makes sense. The other aspect of this would be digital electronics and, the investment that our customers will make in the growth in that in that revenue area will also provide really good margins for the segment. Yes, exactly. I think fixed costs coverage is a big part of it, but I think it's, also it those are those are good product lines for us and they deliver a lot of value for our customers and I think that is the overall volumes recover and we get industry improve. I think that you will see the margins get back to more historical than typical levels. And maybe to your question about... I think if you look at the last few years we have continued to see an increase in terms of the percent of our fleets running when compared to our competitors, whether if I look at North America or global markets. I think that's an ongoing trend. Yes, yes, that's true. Now keep in mind, I mean, this is a big fleet right, we are talking about 23,000 assets as we presented. I think we have a favorable age distribution. The average age of this fleet is only 13 years, which is a pretty young fleet that is going to keep running for a number of years. You have some of the older fleets that are running less you have some of fleets that are coming off warranty, especially internationally. And so you have a number of effects coming together. But true, we have some locomotives coming off warranty and these locomotives start generating service revenue. Not necessary, it depends on the contractual coverage that we have for these units. So there is about what $600 million, which is more transactional, which is orders you get on the Gulf, so you might not be seeing those on the backlog to your point out of the total $2.2 billion that make up the bridge. Exactly. We don't really have that breakdown like you described, but I mean we can certainly look into that and try to get back to you with at least some color around it. So, that's one side on the equipment and maybe on the service side they will very often be sold if a services contract on the top of that, because they want to make sure ultimately they maintain the locomotives running and there is an element of continued training to the operators. And what we often see is our fleets running, especially in those remote locations as we support the customers throughout the life of the locomotives. So we are very interconnected with our customers to the point that in a lot of places, we manage the inventory associated with parts coming in and ultimately making sure we guarantee the availability and reliability of those assets. So we feel very much upfront on any of those changes. Okay. So I'll just start with the second quarter. I mean, of course, the trends were not great there. I mean we saw a decline in some of these items. And I think I mentioned about parts I mean we also saw pressure on the MSA I mean units not just not running as much as they were. But once again, I think as you start seeing the on parking take place, I think we are seeing those trends as early as of June and continuing to July to move in the right direction. And I think we are seeing a good pattern from this point of view. But I think though one thing I want to highlight to you here is we are working with customers to make sure that they have got ultimately, I think the most efficient the most reliable locomotives out there. And these presents to us opportunities to overhaul to modernize and to ultimately also equip them, so they can run a lot of the things you have heard from the Class 1s, how do I run longer trains? How do I get to a more fuel efficiency for those locomotives, and we got to make sure that we are combative does we do that but things like distributed power with LOCOTROL, LXA, Trip optimizer. These are some of the technologies that will enable that and these are in fact, proven technologies that align very well with PSR. And all the efficiency, railroads want to drive and I think, again, very much connected with a lot of the story you hear from Pascal on the services side, and one area that we continue to see opportunity here to grow our installed days and to help customers with a great paybacks. Thank you. Can you repeat that? I think we have \u2013 a lot of it's associated with I will call existing customers. We have the opportunity here to grow our installed base on some products that are still under-penetrated. I think I mentioned here, LXA as a product. So I mean, we still have an installed base that's relatively small when I look at the potential of this product. And it's a key product, especially as railroads look at making longer trains. I think there is some elements here of auto products like Smart HPT that will also enable customers to get significant fuel savings as they run those longer trains, so more with existing products and existing customers. I think one of the big opportunities we have is to expand that share growth and really into the international market. I think we have got some earlier adopters in places like Brazil, in places like Kazakhstan, but we can still be doing a lot into some modern geographies. Exactly. I think, again, what we said last year was we are going to drive at least 100 basis points margin improvement year-over-year. And we certainly have actions that support more than that. And I think my commentary earlier was you look at the first half of the year, we are very much on track to do so and actions will continue. It's less about the event. I will call the improvement year-over-year, but making sure that we will continue to drive momentum to, well, get to our entitlement. So I want to see continued momentum there. Hey, just one of the most disruptive quarters for us ever with really an impact for both customers and operations, Wabtec employees have been absolutely amazing in their response, and I just want to thank them for the hard work and dedication to keep serving our customers and running our company. Well. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Wabtec\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, Pat Dugan; and Senior VP of Finance, John Mastalerz. Today\u2019s slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures, were posted on our website earlier today, and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Some statements we\u2019re making are forward-looking, and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements, please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics, and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully, as you consider these metrics. Before we begin, I'd like to extend wishes of health and safety to everyone on the line as we continue all to manage through this COVID-19 pandemic. And now, I will turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. We had a solid first quarter that was only possible due to the perseverance of our employees working in conjunction with customers, suppliers and key stakeholders. These are unprecedented times that have forced us all to flex and adapt. And for that, I want to sincerely thank our Wabtec team members in our factories, and in the field supporting our customers, as well as all of those working remotely for all that they're doing to deliver in the face of incredible change. The COVID-19 crisis reiterates the appreciation for the work our team members do everyday, supporting essential rail services that are critical to overcome this crisis. Their work around the world has allowed our sites to remain largely operational, although we had some facilities down in places, including China, India and Europe. As a company, operating in the midst of this pandemic, there are some key essential priorities I'd like to highlight to you. So please turn to slide 3. First, we are committed to protecting the health and safety of our workforce, and we are taking significant efforts across our plants and sites. In many cases, we're going above and beyond the CDC's recommendations or any local government requirements. These actions include daily temperature checks at many of our facilities, limiting [Class IV] [ph] activity by rotating schedules, removing noncritical staff from factory floor, restricting access to work areas, enhanced social distancing, deep cleanings and increased disinfection efforts, among other activities. Second, we're focused on maintaining our operational capabilities. Roughly eight weeks ago, we assembled a COVID response team, comprised of global business and functional leaders. They meet daily to assess and respond to the extraordinary challenges at hand and implement contingency plans across our operations and supply chain. They assess government mandates as well as any impacts to our business in real-time and take decisive action to ensure Wabtec is proactively positioned to manage through today's extraordinary challenges. As I shared earlier, we have an incredible responsibility to help keep people and product moving during this crisis. During the quarter, we began to feel increasing impact of the COVID-19 disruption across our supply chain as well as our operations in our customers' operations. Throughout the pandemic over 80% of our 160-plus global manufacturing sites have largely remained operational. Those that experienced disruption were primarily due to the customer shutdowns, supply chain disruptions or government-mandated lockdowns. These include countries like China which has several sites impacted in February but they were all back in operations by mid-March. We had operations in countries like France, Italy and Spain, which were required to close for several weeks in the first and second quarters, and they're mostly all back up and running now. And it also included countries like India. However, in those regions that were on lockdown, all Wabtec service locations, field service technicians and warehouses remain in operations to support transportation's essential infrastructure as required by the governments. In the United States, rail and passenger transportation has been squarely recognized as critical to essential operations. As such, all of our major manufacturing sites and services and parts locations across Pennsylvania and Texas and most other locations have remained open and operational throughout the pandemic. Third, we are focused on cash and preserving the balance sheet, by working to reduce CapEx by more than 40% versus our prior guidance of $200 million. In addition, we are quickly aligning working capital for the volume environment and targeting improved cash flow conversion. Overall, our financial position continues to be strong. At the end of the first quarter, liquidity was about $1.2 billion, and we recently took additional measures to further enhance liquidity by adding a new undrawn $600 million credit facility after the end of the quarter. Fourth point. Prior to the onset of the pandemic, we were laser-focused on reducing costs and delivering on our synergy targets ahead of schedule. For example, since a year ago, during a period of top line revenue growth, the company reduced headcount, including contingent workers, by more than 1,500 people and had begun to consolidate operations, reducing our footprint by 6% and removing over 1 million square feet across our operations. We're on plan to reduce our operational footprint by another 9% in 2020. We also have captured significant sourcing savings from the merger. We've discontinued several shared services contracts with GE, and we've continued to drive lean across our operations to enable more cost-effective and efficient throughput. We saw the results of those actions realized in the first quarter. And while we anticipate a change in the volume assumptions for near-term synergies, we have a pipeline of actions, and we remain committed to deliver our synergy targets for the year. Today, given the rapidly evolving situation and the uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of the COVID crisis, we have withdrawn our previously issued annual guidance. We will continue to take the necessary measures to control what we can, to protect the long term viability of the company, continue to invest in key technologies and capabilities and deliver shareholder value for the long term. And you're seeing that focus, along with the strength of this franchise and our experienced managed team in our first quarter results. As noted on Slide 4, in the midst of a challenging market that included operational and supply chain disruptions in China, India and Europe, we delivered a solid operational quarter. Sales were $1.9 billion, with an adjusted EBIT margin up 15.7%, driven by strong execution against cost and synergy goals. This yielded $0.97 in adjusted earnings per share, a testament to the team's execution in the midst of a challenging market. Included in our results, we estimate over $0.05 of earnings per share loss due to the impacts of COVID-19, primarily in China and Europe during the quarter. Cash used for operations was $82 million. However, this was in line with seasonality and the one-time outflows due to previously announced restructuring, litigation and transactional charges. Our multiyear backlog of about $22 billion continues to provide visibility across both Freight and Transit. And as we continue to help, support our customers during these times, we are adjusting timing and specifications on some deliveries as needed and remain confident in our backlog. Looking across our Freight and Transit segments, we saw several dynamic market conditions throughout the quarter, many of which we related to the COVID-19 crisis. In the freight sector, North American carload volumes were down about 5% in the first quarter and intermodal was down over 8%. This was largely driven by weak global macro conditions. Carload volumes have further deteriorated in the second quarter as the crisis has accelerated its impact on the global economy and supply chains. This will have a near-term impact on demand for services and components, which will improve as freight recovers. At this point, it is very difficult to predict where carloads will settle for the year given the direct dependency on restarting the economy. In terms of the North American railcar builds, all builders in North America have taken steps to slow production lines in 2020. An industry forecast now indicates that railcar build for the year will be less than 30,000 cars. As you are aware, some of these conditions were present in pre-COVIDs and the collapse of the global oil market, but we had already been taking actions to adjust capacity, as outlined in our investor conference in early March. To be even more proactive, we are taking additional actions to align all of our operations for the new realities we face. Reflecting on the quarter, despite of the challenging global freight segment dynamics, there were some bright spots. Our Digital Electronics sales were up double digits versus the prior year. This gives us further confidence that the business can grow in average faster than the overall Freight segment. Our modernization deliveries showed good momentum, which were up on a pro forma basis versus last year, along with steady international locomotive deliveries, which helped offset North America locomotive and freight car build declines as expected. Transitioning to the transit sector, the COVID-19 crisis and global shelter-in-place orders have had a direct impact on passenger transportation and near-term service levels in some markets. This disruption to services and the impacts on our customers' operations will have a corresponding near-term impact on our OE and aftermarket sales. However, as I shared earlier, most of our transit manufacturing facilities remain operational. Overall, we believe the long-term market drivers remain strong, including the need for sustainable transit solutions and projected growth in both ridership and urbanization. It has wider restrictions, we will see infrastructure spend also recover. I'd also add that we delivered strong margin improvements across the Transit segment in the first quarter. While sales were down 7%, adjusted income from operations was up 14% due to improved mix and early evidence of actions to drive margin rate improvement. Finally, as noted earlier, across both the Freight and Transit sectors, we have strong multiyear backlog. This helps provide stability and visibility to evolving environment demand. With that, I'll turn things over to Pat to provide more color on the first quarter.\nPat Dugan: Thanks, Rafael. Turning to slide 5, you can see that we had a good operating quarter despite an increasingly challenging environment. Sales for the first quarter were $1.9 billion, which reflects a 21% increase versus the prior year. Increased year-over-year sales were mainly due to the merger of GE Transportation, along with higher Digital Electronics and Services sales, offset somewhat by decreased revenues in Freight, Equipment, Components and Transit, as well as a negative impact due to foreign exchange. For the quarter, operating income was $217 million, and adjusted operating income was $303 million, up 30% year-over-year, mainly driven by higher Freight sales and good performance in Digital Electronics, the realization of synergies, as well as a better mix of sales and better operational performance in Transit. Although there are limitations on visibility into the full effect of the pandemic, we estimated the COVID-19 impact on our customers, suppliers and operations during the quarter negatively impacted our operating income by approximately $50 million or $0.05 in earnings per share. For the quarter, adjusted operating income excluded pre-tax expenses of $86 million, of which $69 million was for non-cash amortization, and $17 million of transaction and restructuring costs. Please see Appendix B of our press release for the reconciliation of these details. Now looking at some of the detailed line items. SG&A was $243 million, including $16 million of the restructuring and transaction expenses I just discussed. Engineering expenses increased to $49, due mainly to the addition of GE Transportation. And the amortization expenses were $69 million, but remember starting this year we are excluding amortization expense, which is all non-cash, from our adjusted operating income. For 2020, we still expect non-cash amortization expense to be about $280 million. Other expense was $15 million versus $8 million of expense a year ago. The variance year-over-year was due to severe fluctuations in the FX rates late in the quarter, most notably from the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real. Income tax expense was $38 million. Adjusted income tax expense was $63 million for an adjusted effective tax rate of about 25%. We expect the tax rate for the full year to still be about 26%. In the first quarter, we had GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.58 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.97. The details that bridge GAAP earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share of $0.97 can be found attached to our press release. As of March 31, our multi-year backlog was roughly $22 billion and our rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multi-year backlog, was $5.6 billion. Our backlog continues to provide visibility across both Freight and Transit. Now let's take a look at the segment results on slide six. Across the Freight segment, sales increased to $1.3 billion in the first quarter. This increase was due to the GE Transportation merger, which added $506 million. Organic sales decreased $108 million, primarily due to lower sales of freight car components, due to the decrease in car builds, along with lower sales in freight equipment due to the timing of deliveries. Segment operating income was $162 million, and adjusted operating income was $241 for an adjusted margin of 18.5%. I'll make a note that the margin in the prior year quarter benefitted from the timing of deliveries after the close of the GET merger. Finally, Freight segment backlog was $18 billion. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased to $629 million, driven by disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 virus. Organic sales declined $34 million versus the prior year, but were also impacted by FX, which reduced sales by an additional $18 million. Segment operating income was $69 million for an operating margin of 10.9%. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 11.9%, an improvement of 220 basis points year-over-year. This improvement is evidence of some early success in the plans and actions the Transit team outlined at our Investor Day in March. Now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide seven. We entered the year with a very different expectation of what has ultimately transpired. And while the pandemic presents uncertainty and many challenges, Wabtec is essential to a recovery and we are confident that our solid financial position and ability to generate strong cash flow will enable us to emerge stronger. From a cash flow perspective, the quarter played out about as expected. Our cash flow from operations was a negative $82 million in the quarter, we had about $80 million of one-time impact due to prior year restructuring, litigation and transaction charges, which we had identified in our last earnings call. Our leverage at the end of the first quarter was about 2.6 times, flat with year-end. Our total liquidity at the end of the first quarter was $1.2 billion, down from about $1.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. This $1.2 billion does not reflect the new $600 million, 364-day credit facility that we entered into as part of our liquidity planning subsequent to the quarter end, which further strengthened our liquidity position. We have also stressed test our balance sheet under a variety of scenarios and expect to remain in compliance with all of our covenants. In terms of the working capital items I typically review, they are the following: As of March 31, receivables were $1.2 billion and inventories were $1.8 billion. Payables were $1.1 billion. All roughly consistent with the end of the fourth quarter. Our unbilled receivables were $523 million, which were more than offset by customer deposits of $603 million. Now turning to Slide 8. I'll describe some of the actions we are taking to further strengthen our financial position. First, we are lowering our costs across the business. We are swiftly aligning our operating costs with volume realities while remaining focused on achieving our synergy targets. We are taking further actions to lower our fixed costs by driving down SG&A, eliminating discretionary spend, suspending merit increases, implementing a hiring freeze since January 1, along with other actions. Considering our cost structure, about 85% of our cost of sales are variable. And within SG&A, about 15% of our costs are variable or semi-variable in the short term. We expect the incremental cost actions we are taking to drive down SG&A. Second, we are aggressively managing cash and looking to further strengthen our balance sheet. We expect improved cash flow conversion as we reduce our working capital levels in line with the volume environment. We are also reprioritizing some of our 2020 spend to essential and critical items. We've evaluated expenditures that can be paused or canceled, and we are targeting to reduce CapEx by more than 40% versus our prior guidance of $200 million of capital spend. In terms of capital allocation, our approach remains consistent with what we've said at our Investor Day, and we will continue to smartly invest in our people and the business. We certainly recognize the current uncertainties of the macro environment but believe our framework allows us to be flexible and make discretionary adjustments as necessary. We, like many companies, are focused on our business and balance sheet. We are targeting to reduce the debt levels and to increase liquidity. We did recently announce our dividend payable on May 22, but for the short term, we paused our share repurchase program. Keep in mind, we have no major debt maturities due until mid-June of 2021 and remain confident in our ability to access the markets, given our financial profile. We are already taking steps to identify solutions to retire or refinance debt well ahead of maturities, including the opportunities from government stimulus programs and other long-term forms of issuances. With that, let's move to slide 9, and I will turn the call back over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Pat. So as you heard throughout today's call, the company performed well and delivered a solid first quarter despite a weakening environment. As we go forward, we remain committed to executing on our strategic plans as communicated during our Investor Day, and we will continue to carefully assess the markets, in which we operate. This includes reducing costs, aggressively managing cash and enhancing our liquidity position, while focusing on what we can control. We\u2019ll also lean into the strong long-term fundamentals of this company. This includes our $22 billion multiyear backlog, recurring service revenues, broad after market reach, significant install base, technical capabilities, expansive international footprint and a proven leadership team with deep industry domain. In addition, we will continue to invest in technologies and capabilities that will advance our competitive advantage and drive the long-term growth. These are the tangible differentiators that will help us successfully manage today's market headwinds over the long-term and will help us emerge as an even stronger and more resilient company. Before I turn the call over to questions, I want to personally thank each and every member of the Wabtec team for all that they\u2019re doing. Everyday, I hear stories about people jump into action to ensure we keep our customers' operations moving and critical medical supplies flowing into the hardest-hit communities. But I also hear stories of team members going above and beyond to make a difference in our communities. Like our technology team, who are using additive technology to produce thousands of face shields for healthcare workers and first responders, or our teams in Tennessee and in the U.K., who quickly provided radiators for generators at the University of Southern California Hospital and East London's, ExCeL Exhibition Center, which both delivered emergency medical care during the pandemic. These moments and so many more are like them are the stories that fill me and our team with pride. And these are the stories that demonstrate how we will emerge from this crisis even stronger. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kristine.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move onto questions. But before we do, out of considerations for others on the call, I would ask that you limit your self to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional question, please rejoin the queue. With that, operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, guys, good morning.\nRafael Santana: Morning, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak: Rafael, you had talked about your European, Asian sites from a Wabtec perspective coming back online. But could you maybe talk about how the recovery is playing out in those regions on the demand side? I suspect there's a little bit of a lag there.\nRafael Santana: Sure. I think a couple of comments there, Allison. Number one, I think, as of today, of our 162 manufacturing sites, we only have two that are still closed. And they've got, I'm going to call, specific plans to be open within the next 10 days. So I think that\u2019s encouraging to see from that perspective. Of course, I mean, as sites resume, I think we\u2019re dealing with a lot of government restrictions still. So that\u2019s to be observed and we\u2019re staying very much aligned with our customers to understand how that pace of recovery will take place. And I think if you were to talk to most of our customers, they would describe as volumes really bottoming between, what I call, the month of April and May, and starting to really see recovery through the end of the second quarter and through the second half of the year. So I think that's probably the best description of how we're seeing recovery ahead of us. But we do expect a significant impact in the second quarter based on the bottoming of that volume.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. Understand. And then that $15 million profit impact to the quarter from the closures, is there any way to help us understand what percent went to Freight versus Transit there?\nPat Dugan: Hey, Allison, I would say that the majority of it was in the Transit area. The impact was really kind of disruption to our operations and the ability to maybe complete and ship and recognize revenue on orders or both from a supply chain or inflow of components, but as well our own operations and having the people there and get things completed and things out the door. So the majority of that was in Europe and Asia.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thanks so much. I'll pass it along.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Thanks, and good morning.\nPat Dugan: Good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Justin.\nJustin Long: Good morning. Maybe to start with the balance sheet. Pat, you mentioned you've stress tested the balance sheet and expect to stay in compliance with your covenants. But is there any color you can provide on the EBITDA downside scenarios that you're modeling as you think through that? And if possible, maybe talk about the range of free cash flow outcomes in 2020 as you think about the different scenarios that you're assessing.\nPat Dugan: Yeah. Justin, thanks for the question. It's a little bit of guidance and kind of wrapped in there. But what we've done is, just as a reminder, our covenant ratios are about, for this quarter and the next are at 3.5 times and then it reduces to 3.25. Total debt to EBITDA on a kind of a bank basis for calculating that, those covenants. We've done a variety of scenarios. We've looked at percentage drops of, kind of, like -- most likely a deeper case. We've looked at changes within quarters where one quarter is more drastically affected than others. And for the -- and we're -- as we've come out of those views, our covenants, we are staying within those. We feel like our cash conversion is aligned with what we gave in terms of guidance in the Investor Day, a 90% cash conversion that will most likely improve because of working capital management. And so all those things should really given us the opportunity to see strong \u2013 we're confident in our strong cash performance and meeting our covenants.\nJustin Long: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, just because things are changing so rapidly here. I was wondering if you could provide any update on the quarter-to-date trends you are seeing in the business, just maybe from a revenue perspective. And also, I think everybody is looking back to the last recession as a proxy. Obviously, the business has changed a lot with acquisitions. Is there a way to think back and, I guess, look at the pro forma business and what the aftermarket business did in the last recession on an organic basis as we think about kind of a downside scenario for the aftermarket?\nRafael Santana: So Justin, let me maybe start here. Number one, I think just with regards to cash flow conversion, we see an opportunity to increase debt conversion from the 90% above that we've guided into our Investor Relations. So just keep that in mind. The second piece here is, as we look into the first quarter, I think, as you think about aftermarkets \u2013 and I'll break it down here on the freight side, it grew 8% against performance. So I think, we've seen at least a couple of bright spots in the business. And the Services is certainly one of them. Digital Electronics is another one. I think we've talked quite a bit before about the fact that we've got our international fleets are growing. I think we see \u2013 especially across customers, there's some, they are being less impacted, especially you're more dependent on agriculture or specific single commodities versus dependence on what I call global trade or general cargo intermodal. So I think that's playing differently across different geographies that we serve. And of course, there's different end markets too, for that context. I think we see mining potentially less impacted than the overall freight market. So we remain confident in terms of the long-term view for some of these segments. We do again expect really based on discussions we had with our customers, to see bottoming of volume between here the months of April and May timeframe with recovering starting to happening the later part of this quarter and through the second half of the year. Pat?\nPat Dugan: Yes. I would just \u2013 it's a difficult comparison to previous crisis. I mean, not everything is the same. This is unlike anything that any of us have ever seen in our lifetime. I just keep coming back to the strength of our aftermarket and service business, which will be disrupted, as Rafael talked about, but is obviously critical to any kind of recovery and part of the essential businesses that still operate and, in some cases operate with some strengths. So we feel good about the business, the core business, the base business and the cash flow that it will generate.\nRafael Santana: The last thing I'll add there, Justin, is just we're confident about our backlog. We're staying very close with customers and through that process, of course, there's the impact in terms of shipments based on some of the impacts we've had and our customers have had through the second quarter, but I think the backlog gives us a strong confidence about the long-term views and the fundamentals of the business.\nJustin Long: Thanks. And Pat, on the quarter-to-date part of that question, is there anything you can share on how the business has trended from a revenue perspective or just looking at aftermarket?\nPat Dugan: Yeah. It's a little preliminary to be talking about our \u2013 about the quarter and what \u2013 how we performed in April. I understand the desire to get a little bit of direction there, but it's a bit early. I can say that what we've been doing is focusing on some KPIs, looking at \u2013 again, our confidence in our backlog and how that's evolving and looking at our cash performance on a daily, weekly basis. So far, we feel that that performance supports all the comments about our confidence and strength in the overall view of backlog and cash flow.\nJustin Long: Okay, fair enough. I appreciate the time. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChris Wetherbee: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nChris Wetherbee: Maybe just drilling down a little bit on the cash flow and working capital. It sounds like there's some efforts as the year goes on to maybe improve the working capital dynamics. Can you talk a little bit about the first quarter and dynamics within working capital, and then how that may, sort of, improve as you move forward through the rest of 2020?\nPat Dugan: Yeah. So we talked about the impact of those one-time items that really did impact our first quarter. We had about $80 million worth of cash outflow, which are working capital items, but that cash outflow related to prior year reserves and accruals that were paid in the first quarter. They were restructuring, transaction-related. They were litigation-related. And so that $80 million did impact Q1. You look at the rest of working capital performance in Q1, you do have seasonality and we have these outflows that happen in Q1, specific to some comp and benefit type things, incentive related reserves. And then you also have a very good performance in Q4 that probably impacted our Q1 a little bit. And what you'll see throughout the year is that our working capital, where we anticipate the normal performance where you \u2013 it becomes a source of cash throughout the rest of the year. And then you layer into it the impact of a business that we've talked about, the disruption that's occurring related to the virus and in our operations and revenue, and you would anticipate that the working capital would become a bit of a source of cash over the course of the rest of the year. So we feel like that working capital performance and for the remaining quarters will help us drive our cash conversion up for the remainder of the year.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that color. And then just maybe thinking bigger picture about the Transit outlook, and maybe how we can think about government budgets, just potential longer term changes post-COVID-19, are there any beginnings of thoughts around how this business might look and the shape or trajectory of this business might look in sort of a three to five-year window? I know it's early on in this process and we're still learning about it, but kind of curious maybe, Rafael, your thoughts around how this business might evolve over time, if it will be sort of impacted?\nRafael Santana: I think what I'd say is the short-term, I mean, certainly, ridership has been impacted. But as we look at really the restarting of economies, I mean \u2013 and if you look at some of the Transit systems and implementation of, what I'll call, safe distancing, it's going to demand more trains, more investments. So we're certainly looked at as, I think, a positive for the Transit segment. So I think we continue to see demand there, and it's certainly part of also a commitment of continuing to, I think, moving things in a better way. So I think, well, we're bullish there. And I'll just take the opportunity to also mention, as we think about some of the dynamics on the freight side, I think we also see, I think, potentially some opportunities playing out of this, which would include elements of -- I think, some of our end markets really valuing a lot more reliability in terms of their supply chains. And there could be an element, especially for North America in terms of near-shoring or on shoring some of the supply chain. So those are probably, I think, a couple of things that we could see out of this that would certainly drive volumes and trends up for the end markets we serve.\nChris Wetherbee: Got it. Great. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen.\nMatt Elkott: Good morning. Thank you. So a lot of the North American freight railroads talked about -- I think, they still want to do locomotive modernization. Some may actually use the downtime to do more. But they're also, like everybody else, cutting capital expenditures. Where we stand now, Rafael? How does that impact the outlook for modernization this year? Are we looking at fewer modernizations or in line or up?\nRafael Santana: I think, at this point, we see a continuous commitment to the modernization program. It's a big part of how you drive efficiency and productivity into the customers' operations. And I'll probably add to that, some of the elements of our digital electronics business as well. So we're seeing a commitment there. And I think there's continued opportunity to play that also internationally. And I think we're currently discussing a few opportunities to drive upgrades internationally as well and continue to grow from the opportunity to highlight end of last year.\nMatt Elkott: But it's too soon to say whether modernization revenue would be -- directionally, how it would look relative to your expectations a few months ago?\nRafael Santana: I'd say, I mean, we're confident about the backlog. And I'd say we've walked into this year with that backlog fundamentally secured. And it was the same with regards to new locomotives, which was expected to be down. I do want to remind you that, for the first quarter, and we had -- I mentioned that before, we expect both new locomotive shipments and modernizations to be lower. So -- and that was even pre COVID, but I think we remain confident about the dynamics of demand for mods in the business.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. And just one more question. If you can just talk broadly about the impact of lower oil prices on the different part of your business.\nRafael Santana: Okay. So if you think about lower oil prices, I think, as far as the freight market goes, it really calls for about 7% of what North America Railroads transport. That's probably where we would see most of that impact. I'd say, less than a-third of that 7% is really tied to any variation of what I'll call in the price of oil per se. So it's less about that. And I think the one area to watch out is some of the energy markets that we serve with our products, and that's an area we'll continue to watch. I think, as we really follow with customers here on how they're seeing volume ahead, I mean, we're very much committed to make sure we're taking the necessary cost actions to adjust the different parts of the business to face these new realities.\nMatt Elkott: Great. Thanks very much.\nRafael Santana: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you're all doing well. I'm wondering if you could talk about the opportunities to accelerate the cost-reduction targets as a result of the weaker demand environment, anything that you could do to come out step ahead on the strategic front out of this lower volume environment? And if you could talk about your expectations for synergies, savings cadence over the course of this year, given the evolving playbook, that would be helpful.\nRafael Santana: Let me start and I\u2019ll maybe pass it on to Pat. I think, I probably start with just SG&A is down from the first quarter about 70 basis points. Hopefully, you've seen that a lot of these actions were taken in the back of the year. So if you look at 2019, we were actually growing volume above 5% and we took more than 5% headcount down during that time. So we are committed to take the necessary actions. They're challenging tough actions, but necessary to the environment we have. And we're going to continue to do that. We've had announcements in terms of reductions in some of our key sites. And we'll continue to move in that direction. Earlier on, we talked about CapEx, and we're implementing more than 40% reduction. I want to balance that with the following comment. I think a lot of that CapEx reduction was tied to projects that we have volume associated with it. So we're either deferring or postponing some of these as we gain better visibility ahead. I think, I do want to, again, emphasize our commitment to R&D and continue to invest on some key programs that will be differentiators for us, as we highlighted in the investor conference we had. I think the other elements has been really consolidating footprint. Last year we did about 6% of footprints of consolidation and that was about a 1 million a square feet. We\u2019re going to be executing on our 9%, so that\u2019s also going to be an element of how we continue to drive cost down and we\u2019re \u2013 as I think about the synergies per se, we're absolutely committed to the $150 million of synergies for the year. We do recognize there could be an element of the impacts associated with volume, but again I think we will continue to take further actions to make sure that we deliver on that maybe Pat?\nPat Dugan: Yes. I would just add we\u2019re trying to be very disciplined about what we measure is synergies versus just adjusting the business for the volume realities. We\u2019re doing both at the same and so if you just go back to your kind of the original question, is therein we can do strategically to accelerate. We had already accelerated the synergy plan that we would hit our run rate a little bit earlier. We are going to continue to execute on all of those \u2013 all of those expectations, all those plans and that they can and will be looked at as maybe done a little bit earlier based on volume, but nothing that we want to really highlight at this point in terms of giving a number or anything plan specific. All I can tell you is that we are working on everything we can to make \u2013 to ensure that we \u2013 and we expect to get those synergies, but to do more in terms of additional cost because of the change in the environment.\nRafael Santana: Expect us to use every lever in the business, and we'll continue to evaluate those and make sure that we exercise those as we're looking to new realities ahead.\nJerry Revich: Okay. I appreciate the color. And then in terms of services and electronics specifically, how discretionary are aspects of those product lines in this type of environment where volumes are down 20% for your customers? I'm sure they're also targeting OpEx reductions as well. Can you just talk about how critical the services are? Do you expect to continue to outperform in your services versus freight volumes? Just high-level comments there would be great.\nRafael Santana: Okay. Well, first of all, there's certainly an element of impact there as customers park locomotives, especially in North America, in the light of volume bottoming. I think we said before, I think we have a younger fleet. Fleet of locomotives are productive than our competitors locomotive, so I think we\u2019re in better position in terms of being able to navigate through this downturn. And I think a lot of the solutions that we have in the digital electronics, even though, to your point, some of that could be discretionary spending, I think a lot of those play strong in terms of allowing customers to get really lower costs, lowering expenses, and ultimately getting the benefit with relatively short-term, and \u2013 so we continue to expect strength on those product lines.\nPat Dugan: Yes. I just -- I'm going to just reemphasize what Rafael just said is that the service side of our business helps our customers drive efficiencies and reduce operating expense. It's really \u2013 it's some of the premise of PSR, but and I \u2013 you would think that that would continue as we go through the rest of the year.\nJerry Revich: Okay. I appreciate the discussion. Thank you.\nPat Dugan: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Morning guys.\nPat Dugan: Scott, good morning.\nScott Group: So, can you help us think about the \u2013 with Transit ridership down at least so much in the near-term, is that having more of an impact on OE or aftermarket, how do we think about margin mix within Transit right now? I know there was a comment in the release about committed to segment margin improvement, does that apply to both of the segments this year?\nPat Dugan: So maybe you start, I think as you think about Transit, man I think we're seeing that customers continue to be committed to I'll call the projects, per se, there could be an element of, I\u2019ll call impact of what I call services for the short-term just phased on, well, ridership being down. I think, again, we're probably going to see and as we talk to customers. I think there's an expectation that the bottom of that has really happened between here, the month of April and May and I think ridership is expected to be ramping back up as we go into the later part of the quarter, and into the second half of the year. So I think that's one element. I think a lot of the dynamics what you saw in the quarter, per se, I think that referred to the -- over $0.05, without the impact on EPS. I think a lot of that came really associated with our inability to ship due to shutdowns. And those were either to our own plants, especially in -- I'll probably mentioned here India and parts of Europe. And, well, of course, we have customers impacted through that as well. So in some cases, the inability of customers receiving some of these shipments. But, again, I think, we have a solid long term view here for the business and we're confident about the strong fundamentals. So that's\u2026\nPat Dugan: Yeah. I think, kind of getting to your question about what do we think about the impact of transit ridership being down. I think, kind of, near term you're seeing a little bit of a mix of fewer trains running, but maybe some pent up demand for some maintenance and services and safety stock. So some of that is definitely occurring. I think, that kind of more longer term impact of the -- of a quarter or more of the lower ridership will -- is to be seen and part of the reason why we talk about our top line guidance the way we have is, we still have to see how this unfolds. But, long term, our -- the areas that we're operating in are heavily dependent and continue -- and will continue to rely on transit. And what -- in some way it may become opportunistic as everybody kind of figures out what Transit looks like in the future.\nRafael Santana: And I think when you reflect on the margin improvements, I think we're continuing to see the quality of the order intake, margins continues to improve there, so the orders are coming in and there are pieces we're seeing operational improvement in the business. That speaks to improvement, on time delivery, reduction on cost of quality. Of course, these comments are pre-COVID. And we'll be assessing how COVID will be impacting some of that. But we're committed to the margin improvement on Transit segment.\nScott Group: Okay. And then, I want to sort of see if, maybe, we can get a little bit more color. I understand you won't give us April revenue and that's fine, but we're lapping GE, we don't really have any KPIs to track, there's not great sort of conflict directionally. Is there any sort of color on sort of how to think about revenue right now, down mid single, down high single, double-digit, strong doubles, like, any sort of directional color, just because it's -- with you guys, it's particularly tough right now relative to some of the other companies.\nPat Dugan: Yeah. I appreciate the question Scott, I don't -- with kind of pulling the guidance, I think, for the year, I think it's a little bit difficult to put anything out there. April for us is still being kind of accumulated and looked at. We feel good about -- as we're measuring where our backlog is and our cash flow performances and we feel like it's well within some of the scenarios that we had outlined, but not -- nothing that we really want to talk about publicly right now in terms of guidance.\nScott Group: Okay. Perhaps in the Q, maybe an update on April would be helpful. Okay. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Good morning. I think you mentioned mining being less impacted than the overall freight market, could you talk about what you saw from the industrial business in the quarter and how you're thinking about demand there for the rest of the year?\nRafael Santana: Yes. I think when we think about the impact, I think certainly the energy markets is the one that we\u2019re fully more concerned about and the impact there as we serve some end customers on that regard.  We\u2019re working very closely with our mining customers and staying very closely with Komatsu here. I think we continue to see opportunities for the services of that business. And I think we're seeing certainly less of an impact there. Anything else you would add here, Pat?\nPat Dugan: No. I mean, I think that some of the industrial markets are really \u2013 they're tied to oil and gas or our heat exchange business and some of our turbocharger business. And we've seen some decline in the quarter. We imagine that, that decline will be sustained a little bit with the price of oil.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks. That's helpful. And then you talked about continued strength on the Freight Services side. I was just wondering if you're seeing any of the rails perform more in-house services given the lower volumes?\nRafael Santana: Could you repeat that again, please?\nSaree Boroditsky: You talked about continued strength in the Freight Services side, so I was just wondering, in your conversations, if you've seen any of the rails perform more in-house servicing?\nRafael Santana: I'd say, no, we haven't seen any significant change to that. I think, in fact, we have some opportunities here to help the railroads potentially driving efficiency through that process. So if you think about mods and some of the elements of things that we do on the services side of the house, so I think that's a continued opportunity for us. We don't see that as an impact to our revenues right now.\nSaree Boroditsky: Okay. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Hi. Thanks for the questions guys. Can you just comment a little bit on the shut-down in India? Obviously, they make up a large portion of the backlog on the freight side and on the local delivery side. Can you just comment on your ability to kind of catch up by the end of this year or whether we should be thinking about some of those expected shipments getting or deliveries getting pushed into, into 2021?\nRafael Santana: So I'll say our sites resumed operations today in India, except for one of them, which I think we have a clear line of site to starting back up within less than a week. And I think, we\u2019re going to be watching really closely here but right now things seems to be really moving in the right direction and we would have the ability to catch up for the year. And even as we look at it in the quarter, there has been, I think, potentially some opportunity to partially recover some of the volume lost there in terms shipments. Does that answer your question?\nCourtney Yakavonis: Yes. That's helpful and then also you commented on kind of quantifying the COVID related drag on the quarter has been about $0.05 or $15 million. Can you just comment what exactly you're including into that, and how you would break that down between Freight and Transit?\nPat Dugan: Yeah. We didn't view it as \u2013 when we were talking about this, this is not something we added back. We just highlighted it for \u2013 just for exactly this question. I mean, and the mostly it's revenue impact to our operations in India, the ability to get some of our loco build finalized. But I\u2019ll also plan, we have a pretty sizeable Transit business in India that was also impacted. And again, it was just the timing of shipments and \u2013 production and shipments in the quarter -- at the end of the quarter. The rest of the impact is European operations were shutdown or partial shutdowns occurred. And again maybe something \u2013 things weren't shipped and the revenue recognized or our inputs components from suppliers didn't arrive in time and we weren\u2019t able to complete the project. So all those things, kind of, added up into the $15 million worth of EBIT impact. We did not have a lot of -- we had some, but nothing worth highlighting like cleanup costs or any things like that. We clearly were taking the appropriate steps to protect our employees to make sure that anything kind of cleaning or any kind of disruption that way were viewed, but the $0.05 that we\u2019re talking about here were really revenue disruptions.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay. Thanks. And then just one more clarification on the 9% footprint consolidation was that incremental to your previous plans or was that kind of what's expected to achieve the synergy targets you guys are putting?\nRafael Santana: That was within, how we would have achieved the synergy targets for the year, so totally tied to the $150 million that we're committed to deliver during the year.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay, great. Thank you guys.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, good morning, Pat and Rafael. Interesting. On the confidence in the backlog, maybe you could just talk a little about this. I just want to see, have you had customers come in and have discussions about shifting? Maybe you could talk to us and give us some precedent in prior downturns how has that committed spending been. And is the \u2013 is that tied to production schedules in terms of the backlog, can they shift delivery times and push that out? Just want to understand how the timeframe works on that backlog as well? Thanks.\nRafael Santana: Yeah. So I think you bring a great point. I mean, this is not the first downturn we're going through. We will operate and work very closely with customers here, and we're confident about that $22 billion backlog at this point. We\u2019re, of course, working with customers as COVID has impacted operations, so there could be shift in terms of when some of these projects are shift. But overall, confident about delivering on that backlog.\nKen Hoexter: Yeah. Just can you expand a little bit on that, Rafael? Have customers come and ask for delays? I just want to understand the commitment on that?\nRafael Santana: I think the backlog largely, again I think we are executing through that backlog. The elements of delay are really associated with some of the dynamics we see in the quarter whether it\u2019s due to our \u2013 I'll call own inability to catch up on some of the elements of this delivery just based on the shutdowns we've been subject to, or customers' ability to also be receiving or executing through that. So, I think -- again, back to my original comment, the confidence on the backlog is there we'll always be working with customers proactively on that regard.\nKen Hoexter: But no comment directly on if customers have come and asked for delays, or what the negotiations like. I think I'm just trying to understand how that...\nPat Dugan: So, Ken, I mean, the -- I think, some of it -- we're constantly in conversation with all our backlog and all our customers about the timing of deliveries. And so it does have an impact. When we kind of look at the current year, right now, we have a lot of confidence in these -- in the current scheduling in terms of manufacturing and delivering, but it will -- you do have this kind of constant demand on us and our customers to kind of work on when and how we're going to deliver the backlog. So it's not kind of simple as you\u2019re saying. Well, have they, all of a sudden, just showed up and asked the question, this is how everything unfolds every year.\nKen Hoexter: Okay. And then just on the second part of that, was that -- is it tied to your production schedules. Do they -- can they shift the delivery times? Is that part of the backlog discussions you have?\nRafael Santana: I think there's a mix, there's an element of, I'll call, long term orders that we\u2019re certainly executing through it. There could be delays there. I think the area where you could see some variations really tied to more transactional volume associated with potentially fleets are parked and maintenance, to some extent, that's going to be deferred, just the fact you\u2019re not utilizing Wabtec. And most of that impact is certainly going to be felt here I think in the second quarter, based on my earlier of bottoming of volume between the months of April and May time frame. And they do expect that to resume as we go forward, so at the end of this quarter in the second half of the year.\nKen Hoexter: Great. And then, my follow-up, on Courtney's question before about the 9% footprint consolidation. Maybe just expand on that a bit. Are you doing any structural changes now that you look at post-merger and given the downturn in demand? Do you see like yourself accelerating some of these structural changes? Or are you saying, with $150 million, you're sticking with the target, maybe you've accelerated that plan within that target, but there are no new moves that you're putting within that, that are clearer now that you've got downturn and can make bigger changes.\nRafael Santana: So, certainly, I think volume reductions allow us to potentially look at, I'll call it, accelerating some of these elements. And I think when I go back to our comments of staying committed to deliver on the $150 million of synergies for the year, there's certainly an element of that. And despite of any, I think, volume reductions we're seeing there on the synergy, especially, you could think from a sourcing perspective, there could be, I'll call it, an impact there. I think, we've got areas of opportunities here to continually to take action on.\nKen Hoexter: All right. Thanks for the time, guys.\nOperator: Our next question come from Jeff Gates with Gates Capital.\nQ \u2013 Jeff Gates: Yeah. I have a question. If I look at the GE business that you purchased, can you talk about the seasonality of that? And it looks like the first quarter from the pro formas you gave last year show that it's typically very seasonally weak in the first quarter. And I'm just wondering, what is it about that business that makes it so seasonal?\nPat Dugan: Jeff, I think the seasonal aspect of this business \u2013 and Rafael may add on to this, is that is the service side. I think our customers have a kind of overweight in the loco areas, the service business, into the third quarter and not so much in the first and in the fourth. And so that\u2019s the real seasonal about it. But when you kind of look at it over a multi-year period, you do have the impact of projects, which is OE and is driven by customer demands and expectations their own fleet, their own fleet strategies for new equipment and then international projects, too. So that can kind of create some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in terms of revenue recognition. But the true seasonal part which is the Service in North America and international locomotives tends to be very heavily weighted into Q3 and not so much in Q1.\nJeff Gates: But am I thinking about it correctly that the GE business, the first quarter is more seasonally weaker than the legacy Wabtec business?\nRafael Santana: I think sure, to look historically I think there could be elements of like weakness in the first quarter. But back to Pat's comment, it's really more tied to time of projects than anything else. And as I look into specifically this quarter, we did have both elements of not just lower shipments on new locomotives, but we also expected lower shipments on the modernization side. And those were even break of that. So largely, again, project-driven.\nPat Dugan: And I would add one other element. And I don't know how many periods or what periods you are comparing but there\u2019s \u2013 if you go outside of the numbers that we've provided, you have different revenue recognition standards and that would, would maybe exaggerate some of the seasonality but I think that it's fair to say that Q1 is seasonally is lower on service side, Q3 is a little bit higher. Wabtec on the other hand, which is doing freight car, service and maintenance maybe a little bit different but now it's a much smaller percentage of the total, the total business where that seasonality would be more Q1 and less than Q3. So, a lot of things to kind of add and subtract from them.\nJeff Gates: Okay. Thank you.\nPat Dugan: Yes, thanks.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Kristine Kubacki for any closing remarks.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Eiley, and thank you, everyone, for participation today. Hope everybody stays safe and healthy. We look forward to speaking to you soon. Goodbye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Pat Dugan",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael. Turning to slide 5, you can see that we had a good operating quarter despite an increasingly challenging environment. Sales for the first quarter were $1.9 billion, which reflects a 21% increase versus the prior year. Increased year-over-year sales were mainly due to the merger of GE Transportation, along with higher Digital Electronics and Services sales, offset somewhat by decreased revenues in Freight, Equipment, Components and Transit, as well as a negative impact due to foreign exchange. For the quarter, operating income was $217 million, and adjusted operating income was $303 million, up 30% year-over-year, mainly driven by higher Freight sales and good performance in Digital Electronics, the realization of synergies, as well as a better mix of sales and better operational performance in Transit. Although there are limitations on visibility into the full effect of the pandemic, we estimated the COVID-19 impact on our customers, suppliers and operations during the quarter negatively impacted our operating income by approximately $50 million or $0.05 in earnings per share. For the quarter, adjusted operating income excluded pre-tax expenses of $86 million, of which $69 million was for non-cash amortization, and $17 million of transaction and restructuring costs. Please see Appendix B of our press release for the reconciliation of these details. Now looking at some of the detailed line items. SG&A was $243 million, including $16 million of the restructuring and transaction expenses I just discussed. Engineering expenses increased to $49, due mainly to the addition of GE Transportation. And the amortization expenses were $69 million, but remember starting this year we are excluding amortization expense, which is all non-cash, from our adjusted operating income. For 2020, we still expect non-cash amortization expense to be about $280 million. Other expense was $15 million versus $8 million of expense a year ago. The variance year-over-year was due to severe fluctuations in the FX rates late in the quarter, most notably from the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real. Income tax expense was $38 million. Adjusted income tax expense was $63 million for an adjusted effective tax rate of about 25%. We expect the tax rate for the full year to still be about 26%. In the first quarter, we had GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.58 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.97. The details that bridge GAAP earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share of $0.97 can be found attached to our press release. As of March 31, our multi-year backlog was roughly $22 billion and our rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multi-year backlog, was $5.6 billion. Our backlog continues to provide visibility across both Freight and Transit. Now let's take a look at the segment results on slide six. Across the Freight segment, sales increased to $1.3 billion in the first quarter. This increase was due to the GE Transportation merger, which added $506 million. Organic sales decreased $108 million, primarily due to lower sales of freight car components, due to the decrease in car builds, along with lower sales in freight equipment due to the timing of deliveries. Segment operating income was $162 million, and adjusted operating income was $241 for an adjusted margin of 18.5%. I'll make a note that the margin in the prior year quarter benefitted from the timing of deliveries after the close of the GET merger. Finally, Freight segment backlog was $18 billion. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased to $629 million, driven by disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 virus. Organic sales declined $34 million versus the prior year, but were also impacted by FX, which reduced sales by an additional $18 million. Segment operating income was $69 million for an operating margin of 10.9%. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 11.9%, an improvement of 220 basis points year-over-year. This improvement is evidence of some early success in the plans and actions the Transit team outlined at our Investor Day in March. Now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide seven. We entered the year with a very different expectation of what has ultimately transpired. And while the pandemic presents uncertainty and many challenges, Wabtec is essential to a recovery and we are confident that our solid financial position and ability to generate strong cash flow will enable us to emerge stronger. From a cash flow perspective, the quarter played out about as expected. Our cash flow from operations was a negative $82 million in the quarter, we had about $80 million of one-time impact due to prior year restructuring, litigation and transaction charges, which we had identified in our last earnings call. Our leverage at the end of the first quarter was about 2.6 times, flat with year-end. Our total liquidity at the end of the first quarter was $1.2 billion, down from about $1.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. This $1.2 billion does not reflect the new $600 million, 364-day credit facility that we entered into as part of our liquidity planning subsequent to the quarter end, which further strengthened our liquidity position. We have also stressed test our balance sheet under a variety of scenarios and expect to remain in compliance with all of our covenants. In terms of the working capital items I typically review, they are the following: As of March 31, receivables were $1.2 billion and inventories were $1.8 billion. Payables were $1.1 billion. All roughly consistent with the end of the fourth quarter. Our unbilled receivables were $523 million, which were more than offset by customer deposits of $603 million. Now turning to Slide 8. I'll describe some of the actions we are taking to further strengthen our financial position. First, we are lowering our costs across the business. We are swiftly aligning our operating costs with volume realities while remaining focused on achieving our synergy targets. We are taking further actions to lower our fixed costs by driving down SG&A, eliminating discretionary spend, suspending merit increases, implementing a hiring freeze since January 1, along with other actions. Considering our cost structure, about 85% of our cost of sales are variable. And within SG&A, about 15% of our costs are variable or semi-variable in the short term. We expect the incremental cost actions we are taking to drive down SG&A. Second, we are aggressively managing cash and looking to further strengthen our balance sheet. We expect improved cash flow conversion as we reduce our working capital levels in line with the volume environment. We are also reprioritizing some of our 2020 spend to essential and critical items. We've evaluated expenditures that can be paused or canceled, and we are targeting to reduce CapEx by more than 40% versus our prior guidance of $200 million of capital spend. In terms of capital allocation, our approach remains consistent with what we've said at our Investor Day, and we will continue to smartly invest in our people and the business. We certainly recognize the current uncertainties of the macro environment but believe our framework allows us to be flexible and make discretionary adjustments as necessary. We, like many companies, are focused on our business and balance sheet. We are targeting to reduce the debt levels and to increase liquidity. We did recently announce our dividend payable on May 22, but for the short term, we paused our share repurchase program. Keep in mind, we have no major debt maturities due until mid-June of 2021 and remain confident in our ability to access the markets, given our financial profile. We are already taking steps to identify solutions to retire or refinance debt well ahead of maturities, including the opportunities from government stimulus programs and other long-term forms of issuances. With that, let's move to slide 9, and I will turn the call back over to Rafael. Hey, Allison, I would say that the majority of it was in the Transit area. The impact was really kind of disruption to our operations and the ability to maybe complete and ship and recognize revenue on orders or both from a supply chain or inflow of components, but as well our own operations and having the people there and get things completed and things out the door. So the majority of that was in Europe and Asia. Good morning. Yeah. Justin, thanks for the question. It's a little bit of guidance and kind of wrapped in there. But what we've done is, just as a reminder, our covenant ratios are about, for this quarter and the next are at 3.5 times and then it reduces to 3.25. Total debt to EBITDA on a kind of a bank basis for calculating that, those covenants. We've done a variety of scenarios. We've looked at percentage drops of, kind of, like -- most likely a deeper case. We've looked at changes within quarters where one quarter is more drastically affected than others. And for the -- and we're -- as we've come out of those views, our covenants, we are staying within those. We feel like our cash conversion is aligned with what we gave in terms of guidance in the Investor Day, a 90% cash conversion that will most likely improve because of working capital management. And so all those things should really given us the opportunity to see strong \u2013 we're confident in our strong cash performance and meeting our covenants. Yes. I would just \u2013 it's a difficult comparison to previous crisis. I mean, not everything is the same. This is unlike anything that any of us have ever seen in our lifetime. I just keep coming back to the strength of our aftermarket and service business, which will be disrupted, as Rafael talked about, but is obviously critical to any kind of recovery and part of the essential businesses that still operate and, in some cases operate with some strengths. So we feel good about the business, the core business, the base business and the cash flow that it will generate. Yeah. It's a little preliminary to be talking about our \u2013 about the quarter and what \u2013 how we performed in April. I understand the desire to get a little bit of direction there, but it's a bit early. I can say that what we've been doing is focusing on some KPIs, looking at \u2013 again, our confidence in our backlog and how that's evolving and looking at our cash performance on a daily, weekly basis. So far, we feel that that performance supports all the comments about our confidence and strength in the overall view of backlog and cash flow. Yeah. So we talked about the impact of those one-time items that really did impact our first quarter. We had about $80 million worth of cash outflow, which are working capital items, but that cash outflow related to prior year reserves and accruals that were paid in the first quarter. They were restructuring, transaction-related. They were litigation-related. And so that $80 million did impact Q1. You look at the rest of working capital performance in Q1, you do have seasonality and we have these outflows that happen in Q1, specific to some comp and benefit type things, incentive related reserves. And then you also have a very good performance in Q4 that probably impacted our Q1 a little bit. And what you'll see throughout the year is that our working capital, where we anticipate the normal performance where you \u2013 it becomes a source of cash throughout the rest of the year. And then you layer into it the impact of a business that we've talked about, the disruption that's occurring related to the virus and in our operations and revenue, and you would anticipate that the working capital would become a bit of a source of cash over the course of the rest of the year. So we feel like that working capital performance and for the remaining quarters will help us drive our cash conversion up for the remainder of the year. Yes. I would just add we're trying to be very disciplined about what we measure is synergies versus just adjusting the business for the volume realities. We're doing both at the same and so if you just go back to your kind of the original question, is therein we can do strategically to accelerate. We had already accelerated the synergy plan that we would hit our run rate a little bit earlier. We are going to continue to execute on all of those \u2013 all of those expectations, all those plans and that they can and will be looked at as maybe done a little bit earlier based on volume, but nothing that we want to really highlight at this point in terms of giving a number or anything plan specific. All I can tell you is that we are working on everything we can to make \u2013 to ensure that we \u2013 and we expect to get those synergies, but to do more in terms of additional cost because of the change in the environment. Yes. I just -- I'm going to just reemphasize what Rafael just said is that the service side of our business helps our customers drive efficiencies and reduce operating expense. It's really \u2013 it's some of the premise of PSR, but and I \u2013 you would think that that would continue as we go through the rest of the year. Okay. Thanks. Scott, good morning. So maybe you start, I think as you think about Transit, man I think we're seeing that customers continue to be committed to I'll call the projects, per se, there could be an element of, I'll call impact of what I call services for the short-term just phased on, well, ridership being down. I think, again, we're probably going to see and as we talk to customers. I think there's an expectation that the bottom of that has really happened between here, the month of April and May and I think ridership is expected to be ramping back up as we go into the later part of the quarter, and into the second half of the year. So I think that's one element. I think a lot of the dynamics what you saw in the quarter, per se, I think that referred to the -- over $0.05, without the impact on EPS. I think a lot of that came really associated with our inability to ship due to shutdowns. And those were either to our own plants, especially in -- I'll probably mentioned here India and parts of Europe. And, well, of course, we have customers impacted through that as well. So in some cases, the inability of customers receiving some of these shipments. But, again, I think, we have a solid long term view here for the business and we're confident about the strong fundamentals. So that's... Yeah. I think, kind of getting to your question about what do we think about the impact of transit ridership being down. I think, kind of, near term you're seeing a little bit of a mix of fewer trains running, but maybe some pent up demand for some maintenance and services and safety stock. So some of that is definitely occurring. I think, that kind of more longer term impact of the -- of a quarter or more of the lower ridership will -- is to be seen and part of the reason why we talk about our top line guidance the way we have is, we still have to see how this unfolds. But, long term, our -- the areas that we're operating in are heavily dependent and continue -- and will continue to rely on transit. And what -- in some way it may become opportunistic as everybody kind of figures out what Transit looks like in the future. Yeah. I appreciate the question Scott, I don't -- with kind of pulling the guidance, I think, for the year, I think it's a little bit difficult to put anything out there. April for us is still being kind of accumulated and looked at. We feel good about -- as we're measuring where our backlog is and our cash flow performances and we feel like it's well within some of the scenarios that we had outlined, but not -- nothing that we really want to talk about publicly right now in terms of guidance. No. I mean, I think that some of the industrial markets are really \u2013 they're tied to oil and gas or our heat exchange business and some of our turbocharger business. And we've seen some decline in the quarter. We imagine that, that decline will be sustained a little bit with the price of oil. Yeah. We didn't view it as \u2013 when we were talking about this, this is not something we added back. We just highlighted it for \u2013 just for exactly this question. I mean, and the mostly it's revenue impact to our operations in India, the ability to get some of our loco build finalized. But I'll also plan, we have a pretty sizeable Transit business in India that was also impacted. And again, it was just the timing of shipments and \u2013 production and shipments in the quarter -- at the end of the quarter. The rest of the impact is European operations were shutdown or partial shutdowns occurred. And again maybe something \u2013 things weren't shipped and the revenue recognized or our inputs components from suppliers didn't arrive in time and we weren't able to complete the project. So all those things, kind of, added up into the $15 million worth of EBIT impact. We did not have a lot of -- we had some, but nothing worth highlighting like cleanup costs or any things like that. We clearly were taking the appropriate steps to protect our employees to make sure that anything kind of cleaning or any kind of disruption that way were viewed, but the $0.05 that we're talking about here were really revenue disruptions. So, Ken, I mean, the -- I think, some of it -- we're constantly in conversation with all our backlog and all our customers about the timing of deliveries. And so it does have an impact. When we kind of look at the current year, right now, we have a lot of confidence in these -- in the current scheduling in terms of manufacturing and delivering, but it will -- you do have this kind of constant demand on us and our customers to kind of work on when and how we're going to deliver the backlog. So it's not kind of simple as you're saying. Well, have they, all of a sudden, just showed up and asked the question, this is how everything unfolds every year. Jeff, I think the seasonal aspect of this business \u2013 and Rafael may add on to this, is that is the service side. I think our customers have a kind of overweight in the loco areas, the service business, into the third quarter and not so much in the first and in the fourth. And so that's the real seasonal about it. But when you kind of look at it over a multi-year period, you do have the impact of projects, which is OE and is driven by customer demands and expectations their own fleet, their own fleet strategies for new equipment and then international projects, too. So that can kind of create some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in terms of revenue recognition. But the true seasonal part which is the Service in North America and international locomotives tends to be very heavily weighted into Q3 and not so much in Q1. And I would add one other element. And I don't know how many periods or what periods you are comparing but there's \u2013 if you go outside of the numbers that we've provided, you have different revenue recognition standards and that would, would maybe exaggerate some of the seasonality but I think that it's fair to say that Q1 is seasonally is lower on service side, Q3 is a little bit higher. Wabtec on the other hand, which is doing freight car, service and maintenance maybe a little bit different but now it's a much smaller percentage of the total, the total business where that seasonality would be more Q1 and less than Q3. So, a lot of things to kind of add and subtract from them. Yes, thanks."

            "name": "Rafael Santana",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. We had a solid first quarter that was only possible due to the perseverance of our employees working in conjunction with customers, suppliers and key stakeholders. These are unprecedented times that have forced us all to flex and adapt. And for that, I want to sincerely thank our Wabtec team members in our factories, and in the field supporting our customers, as well as all of those working remotely for all that they're doing to deliver in the face of incredible change. The COVID-19 crisis reiterates the appreciation for the work our team members do everyday, supporting essential rail services that are critical to overcome this crisis. Their work around the world has allowed our sites to remain largely operational, although we had some facilities down in places, including China, India and Europe. As a company, operating in the midst of this pandemic, there are some key essential priorities I'd like to highlight to you. So please turn to slide 3. First, we are committed to protecting the health and safety of our workforce, and we are taking significant efforts across our plants and sites. In many cases, we're going above and beyond the CDC's recommendations or any local government requirements. These actions include daily temperature checks at many of our facilities, limiting [Class IV] [ph] activity by rotating schedules, removing noncritical staff from factory floor, restricting access to work areas, enhanced social distancing, deep cleanings and increased disinfection efforts, among other activities. Second, we're focused on maintaining our operational capabilities. Roughly eight weeks ago, we assembled a COVID response team, comprised of global business and functional leaders. They meet daily to assess and respond to the extraordinary challenges at hand and implement contingency plans across our operations and supply chain. They assess government mandates as well as any impacts to our business in real-time and take decisive action to ensure Wabtec is proactively positioned to manage through today's extraordinary challenges. As I shared earlier, we have an incredible responsibility to help keep people and product moving during this crisis. During the quarter, we began to feel increasing impact of the COVID-19 disruption across our supply chain as well as our operations in our customers' operations. Throughout the pandemic over 80% of our 160-plus global manufacturing sites have largely remained operational. Those that experienced disruption were primarily due to the customer shutdowns, supply chain disruptions or government-mandated lockdowns. These include countries like China which has several sites impacted in February but they were all back in operations by mid-March. We had operations in countries like France, Italy and Spain, which were required to close for several weeks in the first and second quarters, and they're mostly all back up and running now. And it also included countries like India. However, in those regions that were on lockdown, all Wabtec service locations, field service technicians and warehouses remain in operations to support transportation's essential infrastructure as required by the governments. In the United States, rail and passenger transportation has been squarely recognized as critical to essential operations. As such, all of our major manufacturing sites and services and parts locations across Pennsylvania and Texas and most other locations have remained open and operational throughout the pandemic. Third, we are focused on cash and preserving the balance sheet, by working to reduce CapEx by more than 40% versus our prior guidance of $200 million. In addition, we are quickly aligning working capital for the volume environment and targeting improved cash flow conversion. Overall, our financial position continues to be strong. At the end of the first quarter, liquidity was about $1.2 billion, and we recently took additional measures to further enhance liquidity by adding a new undrawn $600 million credit facility after the end of the quarter. Fourth point. Prior to the onset of the pandemic, we were laser-focused on reducing costs and delivering on our synergy targets ahead of schedule. For example, since a year ago, during a period of top line revenue growth, the company reduced headcount, including contingent workers, by more than 1,500 people and had begun to consolidate operations, reducing our footprint by 6% and removing over 1 million square feet across our operations. We're on plan to reduce our operational footprint by another 9% in 2020. We also have captured significant sourcing savings from the merger. We've discontinued several shared services contracts with GE, and we've continued to drive lean across our operations to enable more cost-effective and efficient throughput. We saw the results of those actions realized in the first quarter. And while we anticipate a change in the volume assumptions for near-term synergies, we have a pipeline of actions, and we remain committed to deliver our synergy targets for the year. Today, given the rapidly evolving situation and the uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of the COVID crisis, we have withdrawn our previously issued annual guidance. We will continue to take the necessary measures to control what we can, to protect the long term viability of the company, continue to invest in key technologies and capabilities and deliver shareholder value for the long term. And you're seeing that focus, along with the strength of this franchise and our experienced managed team in our first quarter results. As noted on Slide 4, in the midst of a challenging market that included operational and supply chain disruptions in China, India and Europe, we delivered a solid operational quarter. Sales were $1.9 billion, with an adjusted EBIT margin up 15.7%, driven by strong execution against cost and synergy goals. This yielded $0.97 in adjusted earnings per share, a testament to the team's execution in the midst of a challenging market. Included in our results, we estimate over $0.05 of earnings per share loss due to the impacts of COVID-19, primarily in China and Europe during the quarter. Cash used for operations was $82 million. However, this was in line with seasonality and the one-time outflows due to previously announced restructuring, litigation and transactional charges. Our multiyear backlog of about $22 billion continues to provide visibility across both Freight and Transit. And as we continue to help, support our customers during these times, we are adjusting timing and specifications on some deliveries as needed and remain confident in our backlog. Looking across our Freight and Transit segments, we saw several dynamic market conditions throughout the quarter, many of which we related to the COVID-19 crisis. In the freight sector, North American carload volumes were down about 5% in the first quarter and intermodal was down over 8%. This was largely driven by weak global macro conditions. Carload volumes have further deteriorated in the second quarter as the crisis has accelerated its impact on the global economy and supply chains. This will have a near-term impact on demand for services and components, which will improve as freight recovers. At this point, it is very difficult to predict where carloads will settle for the year given the direct dependency on restarting the economy. In terms of the North American railcar builds, all builders in North America have taken steps to slow production lines in 2020. An industry forecast now indicates that railcar build for the year will be less than 30,000 cars. As you are aware, some of these conditions were present in pre-COVIDs and the collapse of the global oil market, but we had already been taking actions to adjust capacity, as outlined in our investor conference in early March. To be even more proactive, we are taking additional actions to align all of our operations for the new realities we face. Reflecting on the quarter, despite of the challenging global freight segment dynamics, there were some bright spots. Our Digital Electronics sales were up double digits versus the prior year. This gives us further confidence that the business can grow in average faster than the overall Freight segment. Our modernization deliveries showed good momentum, which were up on a pro forma basis versus last year, along with steady international locomotive deliveries, which helped offset North America locomotive and freight car build declines as expected. Transitioning to the transit sector, the COVID-19 crisis and global shelter-in-place orders have had a direct impact on passenger transportation and near-term service levels in some markets. This disruption to services and the impacts on our customers' operations will have a corresponding near-term impact on our OE and aftermarket sales. However, as I shared earlier, most of our transit manufacturing facilities remain operational. Overall, we believe the long-term market drivers remain strong, including the need for sustainable transit solutions and projected growth in both ridership and urbanization. It has wider restrictions, we will see infrastructure spend also recover. I'd also add that we delivered strong margin improvements across the Transit segment in the first quarter. While sales were down 7%, adjusted income from operations was up 14% due to improved mix and early evidence of actions to drive margin rate improvement. Finally, as noted earlier, across both the Freight and Transit sectors, we have strong multiyear backlog. This helps provide stability and visibility to evolving environment demand. With that, I'll turn things over to Pat to provide more color on the first quarter. Thanks, Pat. So as you heard throughout today's call, the company performed well and delivered a solid first quarter despite a weakening environment. As we go forward, we remain committed to executing on our strategic plans as communicated during our Investor Day, and we will continue to carefully assess the markets, in which we operate. This includes reducing costs, aggressively managing cash and enhancing our liquidity position, while focusing on what we can control. We'll also lean into the strong long-term fundamentals of this company. This includes our $22 billion multiyear backlog, recurring service revenues, broad after market reach, significant install base, technical capabilities, expansive international footprint and a proven leadership team with deep industry domain. In addition, we will continue to invest in technologies and capabilities that will advance our competitive advantage and drive the long-term growth. These are the tangible differentiators that will help us successfully manage today's market headwinds over the long-term and will help us emerge as an even stronger and more resilient company. Before I turn the call over to questions, I want to personally thank each and every member of the Wabtec team for all that they're doing. Everyday, I hear stories about people jump into action to ensure we keep our customers' operations moving and critical medical supplies flowing into the hardest-hit communities. But I also hear stories of team members going above and beyond to make a difference in our communities. Like our technology team, who are using additive technology to produce thousands of face shields for healthcare workers and first responders, or our teams in Tennessee and in the U.K., who quickly provided radiators for generators at the University of Southern California Hospital and East London's, ExCeL Exhibition Center, which both delivered emergency medical care during the pandemic. These moments and so many more are like them are the stories that fill me and our team with pride. And these are the stories that demonstrate how we will emerge from this crisis even stronger. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kristine. Morning, Allison. Sure. I think a couple of comments there, Allison. Number one, I think, as of today, of our 162 manufacturing sites, we only have two that are still closed. And they've got, I'm going to call, specific plans to be open within the next 10 days. So I think that's encouraging to see from that perspective. Of course, I mean, as sites resume, I think we're dealing with a lot of government restrictions still. So that's to be observed and we're staying very much aligned with our customers to understand how that pace of recovery will take place. And I think if you were to talk to most of our customers, they would describe as volumes really bottoming between, what I call, the month of April and May, and starting to really see recovery through the end of the second quarter and through the second half of the year. So I think that's probably the best description of how we're seeing recovery ahead of us. But we do expect a significant impact in the second quarter based on the bottoming of that volume. Thank you. Good morning, Justin. So Justin, let me maybe start here. Number one, I think just with regards to cash flow conversion, we see an opportunity to increase debt conversion from the 90% above that we've guided into our Investor Relations. So just keep that in mind. The second piece here is, as we look into the first quarter, I think, as you think about aftermarkets \u2013 and I'll break it down here on the freight side, it grew 8% against performance. So I think, we've seen at least a couple of bright spots in the business. And the Services is certainly one of them. Digital Electronics is another one. I think we've talked quite a bit before about the fact that we've got our international fleets are growing. I think we see \u2013 especially across customers, there's some, they are being less impacted, especially you're more dependent on agriculture or specific single commodities versus dependence on what I call global trade or general cargo intermodal. So I think that's playing differently across different geographies that we serve. And of course, there's different end markets too, for that context. I think we see mining potentially less impacted than the overall freight market. So we remain confident in terms of the long-term view for some of these segments. We do again expect really based on discussions we had with our customers, to see bottoming of volume between here the months of April and May timeframe with recovering starting to happening the later part of this quarter and through the second half of the year. Pat? The last thing I'll add there, Justin, is just we're confident about our backlog. We're staying very close with customers and through that process, of course, there's the impact in terms of shipments based on some of the impacts we've had and our customers have had through the second quarter, but I think the backlog gives us a strong confidence about the long-term views and the fundamentals of the business. Good morning. I think what I'd say is the short-term, I mean, certainly, ridership has been impacted. But as we look at really the restarting of economies, I mean \u2013 and if you look at some of the Transit systems and implementation of, what I'll call, safe distancing, it's going to demand more trains, more investments. So we're certainly looked at as, I think, a positive for the Transit segment. So I think we continue to see demand there, and it's certainly part of also a commitment of continuing to, I think, moving things in a better way. So I think, well, we're bullish there. And I'll just take the opportunity to also mention, as we think about some of the dynamics on the freight side, I think we also see, I think, potentially some opportunities playing out of this, which would include elements of -- I think, some of our end markets really valuing a lot more reliability in terms of their supply chains. And there could be an element, especially for North America in terms of near-shoring or on shoring some of the supply chain. So those are probably, I think, a couple of things that we could see out of this that would certainly drive volumes and trends up for the end markets we serve. I think, at this point, we see a continuous commitment to the modernization program. It's a big part of how you drive efficiency and productivity into the customers' operations. And I'll probably add to that, some of the elements of our digital electronics business as well. So we're seeing a commitment there. And I think there's continued opportunity to play that also internationally. And I think we're currently discussing a few opportunities to drive upgrades internationally as well and continue to grow from the opportunity to highlight end of last year. I'd say, I mean, we're confident about the backlog. And I'd say we've walked into this year with that backlog fundamentally secured. And it was the same with regards to new locomotives, which was expected to be down. I do want to remind you that, for the first quarter, and we had -- I mentioned that before, we expect both new locomotive shipments and modernizations to be lower. So -- and that was even pre COVID, but I think we remain confident about the dynamics of demand for mods in the business. Okay. So if you think about lower oil prices, I think, as far as the freight market goes, it really calls for about 7% of what North America Railroads transport. That's probably where we would see most of that impact. I'd say, less than a-third of that 7% is really tied to any variation of what I'll call in the price of oil per se. So it's less about that. And I think the one area to watch out is some of the energy markets that we serve with our products, and that's an area we'll continue to watch. I think, as we really follow with customers here on how they're seeing volume ahead, I mean, we're very much committed to make sure we're taking the necessary cost actions to adjust the different parts of the business to face these new realities. Thanks. Let me start and I'll maybe pass it on to Pat. I think, I probably start with just SG&A is down from the first quarter about 70 basis points. Hopefully, you've seen that a lot of these actions were taken in the back of the year. So if you look at 2019, we were actually growing volume above 5% and we took more than 5% headcount down during that time. So we are committed to take the necessary actions. They're challenging tough actions, but necessary to the environment we have. And we're going to continue to do that. We've had announcements in terms of reductions in some of our key sites. And we'll continue to move in that direction. Earlier on, we talked about CapEx, and we're implementing more than 40% reduction. I want to balance that with the following comment. I think a lot of that CapEx reduction was tied to projects that we have volume associated with it. So we're either deferring or postponing some of these as we gain better visibility ahead. I think, I do want to, again, emphasize our commitment to R&D and continue to invest on some key programs that will be differentiators for us, as we highlighted in the investor conference we had. I think the other elements has been really consolidating footprint. Last year we did about 6% of footprints of consolidation and that was about a 1 million a square feet. We're going to be executing on our 9%, so that's also going to be an element of how we continue to drive cost down and we're \u2013 as I think about the synergies per se, we're absolutely committed to the $150 million of synergies for the year. We do recognize there could be an element of the impacts associated with volume, but again I think we will continue to take further actions to make sure that we deliver on that maybe Pat? Expect us to use every lever in the business, and we'll continue to evaluate those and make sure that we exercise those as we're looking to new realities ahead. Okay. Well, first of all, there's certainly an element of impact there as customers park locomotives, especially in North America, in the light of volume bottoming. I think we said before, I think we have a younger fleet. Fleet of locomotives are productive than our competitors locomotive, so I think we're in better position in terms of being able to navigate through this downturn. And I think a lot of the solutions that we have in the digital electronics, even though, to your point, some of that could be discretionary spending, I think a lot of those play strong in terms of allowing customers to get really lower costs, lowering expenses, and ultimately getting the benefit with relatively short-term, and \u2013 so we continue to expect strength on those product lines. And I think when you reflect on the margin improvements, I think we're continuing to see the quality of the order intake, margins continues to improve there, so the orders are coming in and there are pieces we're seeing operational improvement in the business. That speaks to improvement, on time delivery, reduction on cost of quality. Of course, these comments are pre-COVID. And we'll be assessing how COVID will be impacting some of that. But we're committed to the margin improvement on Transit segment. Yes. I think when we think about the impact, I think certainly the energy markets is the one that we're fully more concerned about and the impact there as we serve some end customers on that regard.  We're working very closely with our mining customers and staying very closely with Komatsu here. I think we continue to see opportunities for the services of that business. And I think we're seeing certainly less of an impact there. Anything else you would add here, Pat? Could you repeat that again, please? I'd say, no, we haven't seen any significant change to that. I think, in fact, we have some opportunities here to help the railroads potentially driving efficiency through that process. So if you think about mods and some of the elements of things that we do on the services side of the house, so I think that's a continued opportunity for us. We don't see that as an impact to our revenues right now. So I'll say our sites resumed operations today in India, except for one of them, which I think we have a clear line of site to starting back up within less than a week. And I think, we're going to be watching really closely here but right now things seems to be really moving in the right direction and we would have the ability to catch up for the year. And even as we look at it in the quarter, there has been, I think, potentially some opportunity to partially recover some of the volume lost there in terms shipments. Does that answer your question? That was within, how we would have achieved the synergy targets for the year, so totally tied to the $150 million that we're committed to deliver during the year. Thank you. Yeah. So I think you bring a great point. I mean, this is not the first downturn we're going through. We will operate and work very closely with customers here, and we're confident about that $22 billion backlog at this point. We're, of course, working with customers as COVID has impacted operations, so there could be shift in terms of when some of these projects are shift. But overall, confident about delivering on that backlog. I think the backlog largely, again I think we are executing through that backlog. The elements of delay are really associated with some of the dynamics we see in the quarter whether it's due to our \u2013 I'll call own inability to catch up on some of the elements of this delivery just based on the shutdowns we've been subject to, or customers' ability to also be receiving or executing through that. So, I think -- again, back to my original comment, the confidence on the backlog is there we'll always be working with customers proactively on that regard. I think there's a mix, there's an element of, I'll call, long term orders that we're certainly executing through it. There could be delays there. I think the area where you could see some variations really tied to more transactional volume associated with potentially fleets are parked and maintenance, to some extent, that's going to be deferred, just the fact you're not utilizing Wabtec. And most of that impact is certainly going to be felt here I think in the second quarter, based on my earlier of bottoming of volume between the months of April and May time frame. And they do expect that to resume as we go forward, so at the end of this quarter in the second half of the year. So, certainly, I think volume reductions allow us to potentially look at, I'll call it, accelerating some of these elements. And I think when I go back to our comments of staying committed to deliver on the $150 million of synergies for the year, there's certainly an element of that. And despite of any, I think, volume reductions we're seeing there on the synergy, especially, you could think from a sourcing perspective, there could be, I'll call it, an impact there. I think, we've got areas of opportunities here to continually to take action on. I think sure, to look historically I think there could be elements of like weakness in the first quarter. But back to Pat's comment, it's really more tied to time of projects than anything else. And as I look into specifically this quarter, we did have both elements of not just lower shipments on new locomotives, but we also expected lower shipments on the modernization side. And those were even break of that. So largely, again, project-driven. Thank you."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristine Kubacki, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Wabtec's Fourth Quarter, 2021, Earnings Call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana, CFO, John Olin, and Senior Vice President Finance, John Mastalerz. Today's slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures were posted on our website earlier today and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Some statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements, please, see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kristine and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4 then I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter, and our long-term value framework. John will then cover the financials. Overall, we achieved significant progress against our strategy and delivered a strong fourth quarter as noted by the expansion of adjusted margins by 2.1 percentage points and adjusted earnings per share increase of over 20%. Total cash flow from operations was strong at $314 million. This takes year-to-date cash from operations to over $1 billion, up 37% versus last year, which was a record for the company. This is a solid illustration that the team continues to drive strong operational performance and quality earnings. Cash conversion for the quarter was set 99%. Finally, we ended the year with over $22 billion of multiyear backlog, which was up $578 million in 2021. Overall, our team delivered really strong execution to finish of the year despite significant supply chain disruption and rising costs. On the back of this strong performance and our confidence about the future, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend and reauthorized a $750 million share buyback program. Shifting our focus to Slide 5, let's talk about our end-market conditions in more details. Internationally, freight activity continued to grow in the fourth quarter across our major markets, and our order pipeline remains strong. We expect long-term revenue growth in the majority of our end markets. Freight trends in North America were down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This was not driven by lack of demand, but largely by ongoing global supply chain disruptions. Locomotive parkings continued to decline despite weaker Freight traffic in the quarter. Throughout the year, the advancements we have made in reliability, efficiency, and safety continue to drive manageable outcomes across our customers operations. Last year, our fleet of locomotives traveled more than 1.5 billion miles in some of the world's harshest conditions. Looking ahead, we expect demand for reliability, productivity, and fuel efficiency to continue to increase placing our service's business and Amortization portfolio in a position of strength. When it comes to the North America railcar builds, demand for railcar is increasing. Railcars in storage are below pre-COVID levels with about 19% of the North American fleet car in storage. As a result, industry orders for new railcars are continuing to improve. The industry, delivered just over 29,000 railcars in \u201821 and the outlook for 2022 is for over 40,000 cars. Transitioning to the transit sector, ridership trends continue to be uneven in various markets. However, infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue to be a bright spot, especially as governments globally invest in rail for clean, safe and efficient transportation. Overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remains strong. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss some recent winds that are providing good momentum and visibility as we enter into 2022. Let's start with the shift to battery-electric. In recent weeks, Union Pacific announced an agreement to buy FLXDrive locomotives. This comes on the heels of auto-strategic commitments from international customers in Canada and in Australia, all of which will leverage this next-generation technology to increase productivity, reduce fuel, and slash emissions across their operations. And in transits, Wabtec was named a founding member of Europe's rail joint undertaking, which is investing nearly 1.2 billion euros to fund Green rail projects. These are government labs  projects focused on automation, digitization, and network optimization. The areas where we can help drive innovation and technology adoption across the rail sector. I'd also highlight during the quarter in freight services, we won a significant international long-term service contract, as well as orders for international locomotive modernizations. Overall, the modernization backlog remains strong. Throughout the fourth quarter, we delivered a record number of mods, marking a significant milestone for the team. We also won strategic digital contracts in North America to upgrade PTC hardware, along with an order for smart HBT at a Class 1 to help our customers improve asset utilization, driving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. Looking forward, our backlog gives us the confidence that we will drive long-term profitable growth and leads stay industry in advancing its position in sustainable rail even further. I'll  the call here over to John to review the quarter segment performance and our overall financial position. John.\nJohn Mastalerz: Thanks, Rafael. And good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I'll review our fourth quarter results in more detail. We had another good quarter of operational and financial performance. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.07 billion, which reflects a 2.4% increase versus the prior year. Sales were positively impacted by the continued broad recovery we are experiencing across our portfolio, recent pricing and the acquisition of Nordco, partially offset by continued weakness in the North America OE locomotive market, lower year-over-year sales and transit, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. In addition, we continue to experience adverse impacts to our sales results in both segments due to shortages across many component parts, including computer chips, which caused delays in production and customer delivery. We estimate that our enterprise revenues were 3% to 4% lower than they would have been without the supply chain disruptions, and that the majority of these lower revenues represent delayed sales versus lost sales. For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $334 million, which was up 18.0% versus the prior year. Most notably, we delivered margin expansion in both of our segments up 2.1 percentage points on a consolidated basis. Margins were aided by strong mix favorability, realization of synergies, and improved productivity. The team achieved margin expansion across both segments even in the face of a highly disrupted supply chain and a challenging inflationary environment. We estimate that cost headwinds adversely impacted operating margins by $20 million to $25 million during the quarter. In the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were a $1.18, up 20.4% versus prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share were a $1.02, which was up 122% versus the fourth quarter a year ago. In addition to growth in operating margins, GAAP earnings benefited from a significantly lower tax rate. The fourth quarter, 2021, GAAP tax rate of 17.4% was 9.2% points lower than fourth quarter of 2020. This decline in tax rate was due to an election, which accelerated deferred tax benefits from our merger with GE Transportation. GE Transportation. This favorable tax benefit of $25 million is considered one-time in nature, and therefore not included in our adjusted effective tax rate. As Rafael noted, we are pleased with our Q4 results, in particular our sales growth in the phase of supply chain disruptions and our margin growth in the face of continued cost increases. We remain diligent and proactive as we work to minimize these challenges. Turning to Slide 8, let's review our product lines in more detail. Fourth-quarter consolidated sales were up versus last year, driven by higher sales in the freight segment, partially offset by lower transit segment sales. Fourth quarter sales were adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange of 0.8%, and supply chain disruption of 3% to 4%. Equipment sales were down 12.9% year-over-year due to fewer locomotive deliveries this quarter versus last year, and no new locomotive deliveries in North America, partially offset by continued strong mining sales. Component sales continued to show recovery and were up 11.8% year-over-year driven by demand for railcar components and recovery in the industrial end-markets. We remain encouraged by the continuing trend of railcars coming out of storage and higher deliveries of new railcars. In line with an improving outlook for rail, our services sales grew 21.2% versus last year. The year-over-year increase was largely driven from a record quarter of mods deliveries the unparking of locomotives, and the acquisition of Nordco. The superior performance, reliability, and availability of our fleet continues to drive customer demand, as railroads increasingly look for predictable outcomes across their fleet. Excluding Nordco, organic sales for the fourth quarter we're up 10.1%. Digital electronics sales were up 1.8% versus prior year, driven by improved demand for onboard locomotive products, largely offset by ongoing shortages of chips. Notably, our backlog in digital continues to increase. And even more importantly, we continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers globally focused on safety, improved productivity, and increased capacity utilization. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 5.4% versus prior year to $648 million. Sales were down versus last year due to supply chain issues, COVID-related disruptions, and the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange, which adversely impacted revenues by 2.1 percentage points, excluding near-term supply chain challenges. We estimate that transit sales would have been up on a year-over-year basis. We believe the medium and long-term outlook for this segment remains positive as infrastructure spendings for Green initiatives continue. Now, moving to Slide 9, our adjusted gross margin expanded 5.7 percentage points to 31.7% driven by strong product mix. Increased pricing and favorable manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Mix and pricing positively impacted our margins. Mix benefited margins as Services sales outpaced our Equipment and Transit sales. Additionally, higher pricing was realized from price escalations incorporated into many of our long-term contracts, along with other price actions that were implemented to recover increased costs. Raw material costs were up significantly, led by dramatically higher metals costs, including steel, aluminum, copper, and increased transportation and fuel costs. Foreign currency exchange adversely impacted revenues by 0.8% and adversely impacted fourth-quarter gross margins by $5 million. Finally, manufacturing costs were positively impacted by realization of synergies and productivity gains, partially offset by exponentially higher transportation and logistic costs. Container costs continue to be significantly higher than last year. In aggregate, the continuing effects of the supply chain disruptions, higher materials, transportation and logistic, and labor costs are estimated to be $20 million to $25 million higher than last year's fourth quarter. Our team continues to work hard to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures and supply chain disruptions by: triggering price escalation clauses that are included in many of our long-term contracts. Implementing price surcharges and driving operational productivity and lean initiatives. Turning to Slide 10, for the fourth quarter, adjusted operating margin expanded 2.1 percentage points versus last year, driven by higher adjusted gross margin but partially offset by higher SG&A and engineering expenses. Adjusted SG&A was $271 million, which was up $65 million from the prior year due to the normalization of certain expenses, higher incentive compensation, and employee benefit costs, and the acquisition of Nordco. GAAP SG&A includes a net benefit of $7 million primarily of sales of a closed manufacturing facility. Engineering expense increased from last year. We continue to invest engineering resources in current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customer's safety, productivity, and capacity utilization. Now, let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 11, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales improved for the quarter, and segment adjusted operating income was $267 million for the adjusted margin of 18.7% up 2.4 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefits of improved productivity, realization of synergies, and mix across our portfolio were partially offset by higher net input costs. Finally, segment backlog was $18.5 billion, up $615 million from the end of last year due to the broad multi-year order momentum that Rafael discussed earlier. This year's backlog growth was driven by an unusually high number of long-term service contracts. Looking forward, we expect our service long-term orders to normalize in 2022. Turning to Slide 12, transit segment sales were down 5.4%, driven by supply chain disruptions and the negative effects of foreign currency exchange. Adjusted segment operating income was up $11 million to $88 million, which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 13.6%, up a strong 2.3 percentage points versus the prior year, and up 1.1 percentage points for the full year. Across the segment, we continued to drive down cost and improve project execution despite the volatile environment. Finally, transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.67 billion, down slightly versus a year ago. Adjusting for the negative effect of foreign currency exchange, backlog would have been up 3.6%. Now, let's turn to our financial position on Slide 13. We had another strong quarter of cash generation. We generated $314 million of operating cash flow during the quarter, bringing full-year cash flow generated to over $1.07 billion, which as Rafael noted, is a record high for the company. This performance clearly demonstrates the quality of our earnings and our business portfolio. During the quarter, total Capex was $52 million, bringing total year Capex to $130 million. Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter declined to 2.5 times, and our liquidity is robust at 1.67 billion. Also during the quarter, we returned more cash to our shareholders, repurchasing an additional a $100 million of shares, bringing the full year share repurchases to $300 million and paid dividends of $92 million. As you can see in these results, our balance sheet continues to strengthen and we are confident that we can continue to drive solid cash generation, giving us liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital toward the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value. Moving to Slide 14, quickly recapping the year, overall, the team delivered a very strong year for all our stakeholders. Despite challenging dynamics, we drove revenue growth, expanded our operating margins across both segments, and generated robust cash flow. The strong execution provides us a solid foundation and good momentum as we enter into 2022. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, John. Let's flip to Slide 15 to discuss our 2022 financial guidance. We believe that there are underlying customer demand for our products and the end market momentum remains strong across our product lines, and our backlog continues to provide visibility into 2022 and beyond. North American freight markets are expected to show growth despite another year of zero locomotive deliveries in North America. Our international pipeline remains strong in order momentum continues to build. International markets continue to be the bright spot, and we expect overall locomotive deliveries to be significantly higher versus 2021. We expect strong growth in equipment in 2022, which will create negative mix for us during the year. When it comes to North American builds, railcars are coming back into use, and we expect railcar deliveries to increase. Our service business continues to benefit from demand for reliable, efficient, and available power, driving the need to modernize and refresh fleets along with the continued unparking of locomotives. In Digital Electronics, our growing backlog of orders supports a return to growth in 2022. Now, on transitioning to Transit, we expect growth as ridership continues to recover and the infrastructure spending increases as governments invest and clean, safe, and efficient means of transport. We are committed to driving adjusted margin expansion in 2022, despite headwinds from supply chain disruptions of unfavorable mix and still challenging cost environment with higher investments in technology. The team is committed to driving strong top line growth while aggressively managing costs; with these factors in mind, we expect sales of $8.3 billion to $8.6 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $4.65 and $5.05 per share. We expect cash flow conversion to be greater than 90%. Now, let's turn to our next slide. Our teams remain committed to delivering long-term profitable growth. Our strategy is built on our significant stall base and deep industry expertise grounded in innovation, breakthrough initiatives and scalable technologies that drive value for our customers. These efforts we will continue to be accelerated by our lean and continuous improvement culture and disciplined capital allocation. I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the fourth quarter despite a challenging environment. You are seeing their efforts in the strength of the company, our 2021 financial results, and our 2022 guidance. As we go forward, the rail sector is well positioned to increase share and address the critical issues facing the world's freight and logistics sector. We will continue to lean into the strong fundamentals of this industry in our company to deliver long-term profitable growth. As we said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose, to move and improve the world. And after demonstrating strong performance in 2021, I'm confident, that this company will continue to deliver and lead the transition to a more sustainable future. With that, I will turn the call back over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine?\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Rafael. Before we begin Q&A, I'd also like to remind everyone we will be holding our Virtual Investor Day on March ninth, beginning at 8 a.m. Eastern Time. During that discussion, we look forward to sharing more details on our long-term growth strategy and financial outlook. A detailed agenda will be released shortly. We will now move to questions. Out of consideration for others on the call, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. . Again, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. If you could just give us a little bit more detail on your thoughts for 2022. Appreciate the sales guidance, but if you can give us any thoughts on how the growth rates to compare on freight versus transit. And then, you talked about some negative mix and cost headwinds through the year, but if you can comment at all on the first half versus second half margins or incrementals since many of your peers are talking about a worst first half and specifically first quarter versus second half, just helpful for us to frame the cadence through the year.\nRafael Santana: Hi Courtney, thanks for the question. Let me start with top-line growth at 8%. When we think about \u201822 we have stronger coverage than we had last year, so that's a positive. We're continuing to invest in the business with engineering up as a percent of sales. We liked the momentum on how we were progressing with the deal pipeline. We do have headwinds from inflation, we are going very much through a transition in terms of costs coming in, while our teams are working on both elements of pricing, but also continue to manage costs. I think mix is relevant elements, especially with equipment s really growing at a faster rate than the rest of the company. Our teams are focused on driving what I call profitable growth into \u201822 and beyond. And with EPS growing up double-digits, you asked a little bit about the dynamics between first half of the year and second half of the year. We would say revenues relatively similar to what you saw last year with maybe a couple of points higher in the second half of the year. Profitability on the other way around, you should think about profitability a bit higher in the first half of the year versus the second half, and that's really driven by, again, the mix as we have deliveries of what I call new locomotives into the second half of the year.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, I think you've mentioned a couple of times about your record  deliveries this year. And if you can comment on your thoughts for , you'd also mentioned services should grow next year, but just how much visibility you have there and how we should be thinking about that specific driver within freight?\nRafael Santana: Reporting a strong  results on that side. We had also, I think very strong orders last year. And those are multiyear orders, I think in the fourth-quarter in specific. We're continue to pick up momentum internationally on that, which I think provides a significant opportunity for us to continue grow so that business line is growing in \u201822 and we see the opportunity to continue to grow beyond that. There's just a significant opportunity for us to modernize units really drive a lot of the technology that we've developed with fuel and now automation and demand is  there.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Thanks\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Please, go ahead.\nJustin Long: Thanks. And good morning.\nRafael Santana: Morning.\nJustin Long: I wanted to circle back to the supply chain impact. I know you've called that out the last couple of quarters in terms of how it's impacted revenue. It sounds like at some point there will be a catch-up. I think, John, you said some of those -- some of that revenue was delayed, not lost. So I'm curious if you could give us a little bit more color on what's getting baked into the 2022 guidance in terms of the supply chain, headwind, and maybe a catch-up at some point.\nJohn Mastalerz: Thanks, Justin. Yes, we've discussed and taking it back to the third quarter. We certainly had a drag on revenue because of the supply chain disruptions of three to four. And I am sorry, in two to three percentage points. And that increased in the fourth quarter. As we look forward into next year, we've incorporated a catch up into the guidance that we have and would look that to be hopefully over the next couple of quarters. It's very difficult to tell. We see parts of the supply chain improving and other parts getting a little bit worse. So -- and it's kind of spread out beyond just the material piece, the labor with Omicron. So we expect there will be some impact on certainly in the first quarter. And we'll just have to see how things work out over the next few quarters.\nRafael Santana: Justin, I would like to add the following. I mean, just in the fourth quarter and just transitioning here between fourth quarter and first, we saw record absenteeism in the business, something we hadn't seen before. And well, needless to say, some of the continuation of some of the supply delays. But that has ultimately just delayed revenues and in that case for the fourth quarter was over $70 million. Where with BOP fast got peak and we have a strong team who's executed well, and we're seeing that coming through in the first quarter.\nJustin Long: Okay. So maybe just to clarify, if I run the math on the third and fourth quarter, it looks like the revenue headwind was somewhere in the range of $100 million to $140 million, and your guidance is, assuming that you catch up, that revenue here in the first half, but maybe with some offset in the first quarter from headwinds.\nJohn Mastalerz: Justin, that's necessarily additive. It affected us in the third quarter, took revenue down in the fourth quarter as we exited. A way to look at it more is it was three to four percentage points at the midpoint. That's around $72 million. So we're looking year-over-year, not sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. So we would expect to pick up a fair portion of the majority of that $72 million that we believe we were short at the end of the year.\nJustin Long: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then from a cost perspective, you called out the $20 million to $25 million of increased costs here in the fourth quarter, I'm assuming that's a gross number. Can you maybe talk about how that number trends going into 2022 and maybe what that net number looks like when you include some of that mitigating actions?\nJohn Mastalerz: Sure. Justin. Let's take the two pieces and start with the gross cost. And you're absolutely right, the $20 million to $30 million is a gross cost or $20 million to $25 million is a gross cost. And again, let me take you back to the third quarter, at the time this all started. And we had higher costs, which were predominantly on the transportation side, but called out the fact that coming behind that on the material side was a lot of costs that were getting caught up in inventory, and that they would release over time. And at that time, we had $15 million to $20 million of costs. We said it would rise, and indeed it did in the fourth quarter, it grew to 20-25. we also saw that piece come in behind us, an inventory grow, which we expected. So as we look forward, Justin, we would expect cost to continue to grow over the next few quarters, certainly in the first half of the year. And as you pointed out, there's 2 sides of this equation, and so that takes us to the other side and the cost recovery or the pricing side of it. Again, taking you back to the third quarter, at that time we said about half of the higher costs of $15 million to $20 million we're being recaptured in terms of pricing. We also talked a little bit about our uniqueness in that the majority of our revenues are tied up and long-term contracts and they have price escalators in them. So we feel very confident that pricing will come, these have been in contracts for decades and  tried and true, but they will come over a period of time and they typically, while some are monthly and most of them are annual, and they'll tick at the anniversary dates and that'll happen throughout the fourth quarter s after the third quarter or throughout the next year. And what we saw in the fourth quarter is exactly, what we would have expected is that price recovery has increased from the 50% into the fourth quarter, and we will expect to see that to continue to increase over the next few quarters as we lapped those anniversary dates and supply  area in our contracts with our customers.\nJustin Long: Okay. So gross costs probably go up sequentially in the first quarter, but do you think net costs go down?\nJohn Mastalerz: Gross costs will certainly go up in the first quarter, and we'll also see the pricing go up. Not saying anything about the net costs.\nJustin Long: Okay.\nJohn Mastalerz: The timing of what comes through this is just a little bit harder to tell because the timing of what comes through the balance sheet or off of inventory.\nJustin Long: Got it. I appreciate the time. Thanks.\nJohn Mastalerz: Thank you, Justin.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Rafael, can you expand on your comments on the battery electric locomotive order trend? Sounds like you're getting test units in place. I am wondering, can you just quantify the orders that you've seen to date and what level of order opportunities do you see for those products over the course of this year?\nRafael Santana: Jerry, I think strong progress here we're considering to work closely with customers. And this is an area we're a leader and we will continue to be in that space. We're continuing to adapt dialogues with a number of orders announced now, more recently in North America. But we've had orders in Canada and Australia. There's a conversations are continuing with customers in other geographies. So the pipeline, it's continued to build up and we are confident about that when you think about the deliveries here, they are mostly into the 24-time frame, and that's when you're going to be seeing more of that. With that, I mean, we're excited to see some of the evolution on the technologies and a lot of the elements of what we consider today in terms of power density, in terms of what's possible, we see growth in that power density. And combining that with really the digital portfolio we have, we still like we're uniquely positioned to really do energy management and drive significant value for customers in terms of the results they get from this technology.\nJerry Revich: And Raphael just order of magnitude you've had initial orders. Are you thinking in the tens range? Are we talking about potential hundreds of orders in 2022 or can you just frame for us just order of magnitude, please?\nRafael Santana: Yes. I think if you look at the announcements is about 20 at this point, but I think a lot of it is tied to customer testing that technology into their specific operations. Jerry, we're not going to be commenting on specific numbers around these orders, but we're picking up. If you think about when we really started to talk about this, this is reality. It's got application in a variety of areas for customers and will ultimately help them drive, not just the fuel expense down that will ultimately also help down meet decarbonization goals, which most of them have put out there.\nJerry Revich: Okay. I appreciate the discussion. Thanks.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please, go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nRafael Santana: Morning.\nScott Group: Just want to follow-up on a couple of things. Rafael, your comments about first half versus second half, the year-over-year -- was that a year-over-year comment about a better year-over-year earnings growth in first half than the second half and better year-over-year revenue growth in the second half and first half?\nRafael Santana: Yes, it was a comparison between first half and second half, Justin. Sorry, Scott.\nScott Group: But you're talking year-over-year, correct?\nRafael Santana: Yes.\nScott Group: Okay. Great. And then I guess I want -- John, you had a comment about something unusual in the backlog. If you could just -- I wasn't sure what you meant. And then Rafael, you were talking about a big increase in international Locos. Can we just put some directional numbers on where international Locos were last year, where you think they're going to be this year?\nJohn Mastalerz: Okay. Scott, so within the prepared remarks, we talked a little bit about the backlog. We're very pleased overall with the growth that we're seeing. Just wanted to point out that in 2021 we had a strong level of orders coming in on -- pretty long-term multiyear orders on the service side. And while we expect backlog to continue to grow into the future, we will see a little bit of normalization in some of those long-term contracts. We picked up a lot of them from some of our largest carriers in 2021.\nRafael Santana: Scott, let me add the following. When you look at how it we finished last year, 12-month backlog growing double-digits. But really, I think what's most informing here is providing higher conversion into \u201822 versus swat we had a year ago. So stepping into the OMIX of the guidance we've provided we certainly have higher cost assets based on that backlog conversion that we have moving forward. We talked about equipment growth off which it's really tied to international locomotive orders, largely concentrated in the second half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter. And those were the comments that I made earlier associated with mix in the elements of higher margins in the first half of \u201822 versus second half of \u201822.\nScott Group: And then, just so -- if it's -- if there's a lot in fourth quarter, should we think that there's going to be good momentum on international going into \u201823?\nRafael Santana: Scott, certainly. What we're continuing to work is on building on that momentum. I talked about a strong pipeline there, so it's all about convertibility, making sure we continue to drive convertibility. But as I look across the various geographies, the momentum is there, so it's not a single geography, it's really -- I'll call a number of different elements driving that discussion with customers.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys, appreciate it.\nRafael Santana: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks. It seems like you had really solid progress on FLXDrive during the quarter, just a quick question on that, does that -- when you'd see those orders and I know it's early. Do they tend to drag in orders for other power units? I know it's a system that could probably operate a lot of equipment ages, but nonetheless, they tend to into that potential in the dragging other locals with it. And then just one other one if I may just put both line at once. Any comments on trends that demand Transit systems across U.S. and Europe, how they're doing with maintenance versus schedule if there's any come back demand in the coming years? Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Sure. Thanks.  battery electric first, I think customers are really taking those units into operation to really fast on their own realities. Some of these customers we having parallel discussions in terms of increased demand and demand for new locomotives. And that's a reality and a variety of geographies that are traditional to us and that's where I also, I based some of my comments on strong pipeline route. If I think about Kazakhstan, Australia, or Brazil, I think that's part of the dialogue on transit and transit guidance in specific. We expect offline  more into low single-digits for this year, and the team is really committed to continue to drive profitable growth in the Transit business. As we continue to work there, I think we continue to have opportunities to invest overall, while making what I'll call Wabtec businesses more efficient, and a big chunk of that is -- really we're looking at our footprints. And with that being said, we are continuing to work to do the dynamics of what John highlighted earlier, pricing, inflation and supply chain disruptions. So you could see some variation quarter to quarter, but we see really progress in\u2019 \u201822 driving profitable growth.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. I want to stay on that Transit topic in terms of margin. The margin performance was incredibly strong, kind of what we would view that the prior peak to be. I guess one is a sort of a new step-up for there is just one of those businesses again, some similar to Freight that the equipment growth that you would anticipate in the coming years, given that the funding could be a headwind from mix perspective as we think of Transit. Just trying to think of that business going forward.\nJohn Mastalerz: Hi, Allison, this is John. Yes. Number 1, we're very pleased with the fourth quarter margin results, which were up 2.3 percentage points. But beyond that, they were up on 1.1 points on a full-year basis. And if you go back the last four years, we've been up about 400 basis points. So we're -- we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing from the Transit group. But I'm zeroing in on your question, Allison, and the fourth quarter, the margin was driven by three areas. Number 1 was mix within transit with strong, now this can go both ways. So I wouldn't say that that is structural, but it did benefit us in the quarter. The other two are: the second area, and we talked about this in the third quarter is and it has been a focus of transit for the last couple of years, is really working on more profitable contracts. And each quarter that goes by, we're seeing that take hold and we're seeing it reflected in our margins. And we do believe that is certainly structural going forward. And then the other piece of course, which is also that way, is they're focused on productivity and integration. They've done an absolutely fantastic job of driving productivity, whether it has been continuous improvement on the day-to-day things, or integrating within the transit organization and integration with the broader Wabtec company. So, very pleased with that, and we expect them to continue to drive their mergence forward in the future.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. I just want to go back to free to  beat this up, but I know the sales and equipment going to increase and that's certainly a positive thing in the back half of the year. Is there a way to think about the next headwind within the back half and then also obviously free the backlog and certainly improved. Is there some mix element there that we should be thinking of? I know the contracts and mods have increased as well, just trying to balance out equipment versus some of the other businesses that are improving as well.\nJohn Mastalerz: Allison, this is John, I'll take the question on the Freight mix in 2022. So it is going to be a bit of a drag on overall margin growth, but I wouldn't call it a headwind as such. Any time that we can put an install base out there that's going to be for the next 20 or 30 years, to me, is a tremendous positive. And we will sell year-over-year, a big increase as we believe we hit the trough in locomotive sales in 2021 of locomotives as well as mining Equipment. So with that, the fact is, is that while Freight, I'm sorry, Equipment, has on strong margins. They're in the lower side of the five groups that we have, and they will grow a fair amount faster than the rest of the groups in 2022, as Rafael pointed out, particularly in the back half. And so that  will be a headwind with regards to margins, but we will have those assets out there. We'll continue to service and modernize and put Digital Equipment as well as a component replacement parts. So we feel great about that mix unfavorability going into 2022.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then just the backlog , are we thinking of a similar situation where that equipment backlog is increasing so that mix will -- to your point, it's good growth longer term. From a margin perspective, a drag on margins as we sort of look out into the back half and into \u201823 based on the backlog today?\nJohn Mastalerz: Kind of going back to the previous comment, as we launched from 2021, we took on a lot of long-term service contracts in that mix, so those -- we feel very good about the profitability going forward. And we also increased our mix of international -- or of our local motive orders that we'll see being delivered next year. So I would say that the margin that we're seeing, as we exit the year in terms of overall margin is pretty balanced.\nRafael Santana: I think there's an element here to be considered just on quarter-over-quarter and specific variations, you might have there. But the dynamics as you've heard are very favorable in terms of the amount for mods. I think digital, also I think really turn it into a good old story coming to the year and as we progress forward.\nAllison Poliniak: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Hester with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, good morning, Raphael and John.\nRafael Santana: Morning.\nKen Hoexter: You have a pretty big range in terms of the EPS. Just talk about your assumptions on the upside-downside, is that mix and impacts on cost? And in the past within that, you had 100 basis point margin improvement target for each segment. Does that still hold for \u201822 or not necessarily given some of the margin variations? Thanks.\nRafael Santana: Let me start and I'll let John complement here. Number one, I think the range is very consistent with what we've done for the past years. So I'll just start there. The second thing I would want to highlight is we continue our focus on really driving profitability forward. It's about driving profitable growth in \u201822 and beyond, and I speak on both the segments as well. I mean, we are going through a transition here, as I described, there could be variation quarter-to-quarter, but this is really what we're going after.\nJohn Mastalerz: Yes. Ken. When we look at our EPS guidance of 465 to 55 with a midpoint of 485 represents 14% year-over-year growth on a midpoint of 8% volume growth, we feel very good about the construct of our, of our P&L and the leverage that we'll get as we cascade down through it. When you look at the core drivers of that is on the positive side, is that the productivity and synergies that we expect which we feel very good about. Also the absorption, the fixed cost absorption that will be a tailwind to us in 2022. Those being somewhat offset by the costs that we talked about. So until we get to price cost equilibrium, there will be a headwind on our costs, largely in the first half and then the mix piece, which will be somewhat of a headwind, but a very positive in terms of why that's happening. SG&A, as we talked about, will be lower as a percent of revenue and will continue to invest in technology. And that takes us on to the P&L. We feel very good about the range that we have and we certainly feel good about 2022.\nKen Hoexter: Just to clarify, though, John, then the past 100 basis point margin was for last year, right? It's not -- it continued a 100 basis points on each segment or is that -- was that multiyear in terms of each segment?\nJohn Mastalerz: No, no. That was last year.\nKen Hoexter: Okay.\nJohn Mastalerz: Achieved that. We got 9/10 out of Freight and 1.1 points of margin growth out of Transit. Now, when we look to 2022, what we do expect, Ken, is that operating margin percent will be up on a year-over-year basis. But we're not calling a percent.\nKen Hoexter: Perfect. Thanks for that. And then just to go back to the FLXDrive for a second, Raphael, is there -- when you start thinking about the testing of this, how long till you start thinking this starts getting mass deliveries in terms of really getting implemented and driving obviously. As you mentioned, every company seems to be talking about ESG and the benefits and really counting on the locomotive to get to their multi-year target. Maybe talk us through the progress of from electric and then maybe eventually  whatever the next steps are to get the pulling capacity on over the road type of next-gen locomotives.\nRafael Santana: Let me start with the battery electric, which we're happy with really the testing that we did of the technology we gives us the confidence to move forward with customers here, and ultimately work on a product that really solves for them in terms of the reliability expectations and driving a lot of the value that you described in terms of not just feel de - carbonization ultimately, better operating ratio, but we are working with customers on a variety of solutions. I'm glad you touched alternative fuels, which is a significant element of that. One of the things that we are certainly proud just when you look at the engines that equip our locomotives there, they tend to be at least 4 to 6 points more efficient than the competitor's locomotives, so I'll just start there. But that's at the engine level. When you go to the locomotive level you step it up another one to two points. And by the time you add, really the digital portfolio we have, you are really getting to a double-digit arena here and that scenario, we will continue to step up. And if you think about biofuels and you just stop urge on the top of that. The opportunity to make sure that ultimately, you're driving decarbonization and most efficient way. So we feel strong about these elements and they were belts really over time and we continue to really invest and continuing to find solutions to upgrade installed base and stay ahead of the game here. There are other alternative technologies that are being looked at. I think we talked last year about hydrogen and fuel cell technology, things that we're doing in partnerships. There is really a number of things that we're looking at it. We're working very closely with customers ultimately through that process. Some of this will play longer term as we have described in the fuel cell side. And there's a lot to be validated there. But in terms of alternative fuels, we think that could play shorter-term and with feel strong about well, leading on that front as well.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks, Rafael. Thanks, John. Appreciate the insight.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJames Turley: Hey Guys. James on for Chris. Wanted to ask about services revenue within freight, seems to have stepped up in the quarter. Just wanted to know how much of that was essentially a new rate -- runrate, seasonal or just basically at catch-up from 3Q and just trying to figure out how we should think about that going into \u201822?\nJohn Mastalerz: James, this is John. The Services revenue was up 21.2% in the quarter. If you take away Nordco, we were up 10.1%, and that's really what we've been running on largely throughout the year. And had a good year and we expect growth momentum to continue into 2022 in our services group.\nJames Turley: Got it. And then if we're also just thinking about the unparkings going into \u201822 as well, could you just -- what have you seen year-to-date. And is there a certain level of improvement in locomotive unparkings that you've built into the guidance throughout the year?\nRafael Santana: I think when we looked at the last six months, we've seen on parking to continued. When you look at the specific dynamics on the first quarter here, I think certainly the latter conditions have been really quite disruptive. So that actually has also driven what I'll call demand for the services business. As our customers are investing on that fleets. And if you think about the elements of how the network has slowed down that will allow so -- that be an element of potentially driving on parkings here and more freight cars online. So positive from that perspective.\nJames Turley: Got it. And then just a smaller one. Just wanted to understand if you could, how you're thinking about the buyback in terms of the time frame, and I think there's a benefit from other income in the quarter, just understanding how to think about that going into \u201822. Thank you.\nJohn Mastalerz: Yeah. We couldn't be more thrilled. The board had two approvals in the recent board meeting. One is to up the dividend by 25% and the other is reauthorizing $750 million of share repurchases. The other thing I'm happy to point out is that in the back half of the year, we purchased $300 million. We don't provide guidance going forward on what our share repurchases are, but when we look at the overall capital allocation opportunities that we have, we kind of waterfall that from making sure that we build our balance sheet and strengthen that, protect the dividend and invest in our business. And Raphael just talked about that and some of the technology investments that we're making. Then with the cash that's left over from that. We're largely looking at what opportunities there are M&A activity for accretive strategic bolt-on type M&A work. At the end of the day, when there's excess cash, we are committed to returning that to our shareholders through share repurchases.\nRafael Santana: I'll just emphasize that we're really committed to drive the higher return on investment to our shareholders. And  we're committed to certainly investment-grade and continue to work the discipline that you've seen from us through that process.\nJames Turley: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Elkott: Good morning. Thank you. Rafael, just to follow up on your discussion of the different new technologies on locomotives earlier. Were you suggesting that all these battery electric hydrogen biodiesel RMG can co-exist in the network long term or do you think that the industry will have to call a less behind one or two technologies?\nRafael Santana: So I -- a couple comments there. Number 1, I'll start with just the elements of modernizing the fleets. I think that's 1 of the things that our customers look at that it's probably top in mind. And so that's to a large extent tied not just to the mods business, but it's also tied to investment in Tier 4 and the newest technology that we have there. If you were to ask me what to second on that, I think alternative fuel specifically with biofuels, that's not a key element and that  is very little, I'll call limited the change in terms of how they operate in that context. And as I got a highlight here, the elements of what we got in the digital portfolio, which has continued to equip those fleets with those capabilities that will drive significant, I'll call fuel reduction and ultimately good outcomes for the customers. When I think about the next technology, I think battery is something that's really being tested. I think there is the opportunity here to have a real application of that in terms of certain routes and specific customers, when you talk about mixing, all of that, I think there's a significant degree of sensitiveness around mixing different technologies and different fuels because that would churn into a significant challenge. So ultimately, I think you're going to see evolutionary progress here. There could be an element of hybrid locomotives. Then as you step in to some of this new technologies, I think what's most important is the leadership role we've had on testing those in working them with customers, but there could be an element of some of these being adopted faster with some customers that might have a more simplified logistics than we have in North America, for instance.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. You're suggesting that there will be experimentation with different technologies in the near-to-intermediate term, and maybe we'll have a number of bridge technologies that will take us to a more unified system in the long-term we're talking here like a decade or longer.\nRafael Santana: You got it, I think it's going to be more evolutionary as we look into the next couple of years, before you get to really a transformational .\nMatt Elkott: Got it. And then my follow-up to that is, what do you think this will do? How do you think this kind of fluid and uncertain future as far as new technologies will do to the Class 1 mindset as far as ordering locomotives? Is it going to limit their orders to just basic replacement demand when they absolutely have to, because no one really knows what the locomotive in the future is? And then once we know there will be massive replacement cycle or do you think the railroads will just go on as they have in the past?\nRafael Santana:  that should not because  steps is technology they can apply to existing fleet and upgrade the fleet. So you can work on that transition. So some of the technologies we're talking about, what if I start with alternative fuels? I mean, that's  you will apply on the existing fleet. If you think about all the testing we are doing on batteries, ultimately that leads to potentially considering a hybridization of locomotives. So next thing, as you're thinking about mods, you could be connecting batteries into that mods can drive that fuel efficiency moving forward. So again, back to my comments on evolutionary versus revolutionary, and you got to be very sensitive to the elements of operations and how you make sure you don't disrupt any of the elements that exists there today, especially start switching fields if you go into hydrogen, for instance, I think we certainly have experience with LNG, and that tries a much more significant change in the overall infrastructure.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. And just one final quick question. Sorry if I missed it, but did you guys say anything about the elevated geopolitical risks in and around Ukraine and then previously a couple of months ago with the turbulence in Kazakhstan. And if it's had any -- if it's caused you any concerns about your business over there.\nRafael Santana: With certainly this are very important parts of our portfolio. Let me start first with Russia in specific. While it's an important part of our portfolio and we're I'll say certainly concerned about situation with that being said, Russia accounts for less than 5% of our business. If you think about Kazakhstan yes, we've followed out very closely. We have a significant operation there with employees, but there's really minimum disruption as we went through that process and we continue to operate strongly there.\nMatt Elkott: Thank you very much.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kristine Kubacki for any closing remarks.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Operator. Thank you, everyone for joining us. We look forward to talking to you over the quarter and certainly next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "John Mastalerz",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael. And good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I'll review our fourth quarter results in more detail. We had another good quarter of operational and financial performance. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.07 billion, which reflects a 2.4% increase versus the prior year. Sales were positively impacted by the continued broad recovery we are experiencing across our portfolio, recent pricing and the acquisition of Nordco, partially offset by continued weakness in the North America OE locomotive market, lower year-over-year sales and transit, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. In addition, we continue to experience adverse impacts to our sales results in both segments due to shortages across many component parts, including computer chips, which caused delays in production and customer delivery. We estimate that our enterprise revenues were 3% to 4% lower than they would have been without the supply chain disruptions, and that the majority of these lower revenues represent delayed sales versus lost sales. For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $334 million, which was up 18.0% versus the prior year. Most notably, we delivered margin expansion in both of our segments up 2.1 percentage points on a consolidated basis. Margins were aided by strong mix favorability, realization of synergies, and improved productivity. The team achieved margin expansion across both segments even in the face of a highly disrupted supply chain and a challenging inflationary environment. We estimate that cost headwinds adversely impacted operating margins by $20 million to $25 million during the quarter. In the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were a $1.18, up 20.4% versus prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share were a $1.02, which was up 122% versus the fourth quarter a year ago. In addition to growth in operating margins, GAAP earnings benefited from a significantly lower tax rate. The fourth quarter, 2021, GAAP tax rate of 17.4% was 9.2% points lower than fourth quarter of 2020. This decline in tax rate was due to an election, which accelerated deferred tax benefits from our merger with GE Transportation. GE Transportation. This favorable tax benefit of $25 million is considered one-time in nature, and therefore not included in our adjusted effective tax rate. As Rafael noted, we are pleased with our Q4 results, in particular our sales growth in the phase of supply chain disruptions and our margin growth in the face of continued cost increases. We remain diligent and proactive as we work to minimize these challenges. Turning to Slide 8, let's review our product lines in more detail. Fourth-quarter consolidated sales were up versus last year, driven by higher sales in the freight segment, partially offset by lower transit segment sales. Fourth quarter sales were adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange of 0.8%, and supply chain disruption of 3% to 4%. Equipment sales were down 12.9% year-over-year due to fewer locomotive deliveries this quarter versus last year, and no new locomotive deliveries in North America, partially offset by continued strong mining sales. Component sales continued to show recovery and were up 11.8% year-over-year driven by demand for railcar components and recovery in the industrial end-markets. We remain encouraged by the continuing trend of railcars coming out of storage and higher deliveries of new railcars. In line with an improving outlook for rail, our services sales grew 21.2% versus last year. The year-over-year increase was largely driven from a record quarter of mods deliveries the unparking of locomotives, and the acquisition of Nordco. The superior performance, reliability, and availability of our fleet continues to drive customer demand, as railroads increasingly look for predictable outcomes across their fleet. Excluding Nordco, organic sales for the fourth quarter we're up 10.1%. Digital electronics sales were up 1.8% versus prior year, driven by improved demand for onboard locomotive products, largely offset by ongoing shortages of chips. Notably, our backlog in digital continues to increase. And even more importantly, we continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers globally focused on safety, improved productivity, and increased capacity utilization. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 5.4% versus prior year to $648 million. Sales were down versus last year due to supply chain issues, COVID-related disruptions, and the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange, which adversely impacted revenues by 2.1 percentage points, excluding near-term supply chain challenges. We estimate that transit sales would have been up on a year-over-year basis. We believe the medium and long-term outlook for this segment remains positive as infrastructure spendings for Green initiatives continue. Now, moving to Slide 9, our adjusted gross margin expanded 5.7 percentage points to 31.7% driven by strong product mix. Increased pricing and favorable manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Mix and pricing positively impacted our margins. Mix benefited margins as Services sales outpaced our Equipment and Transit sales. Additionally, higher pricing was realized from price escalations incorporated into many of our long-term contracts, along with other price actions that were implemented to recover increased costs. Raw material costs were up significantly, led by dramatically higher metals costs, including steel, aluminum, copper, and increased transportation and fuel costs. Foreign currency exchange adversely impacted revenues by 0.8% and adversely impacted fourth-quarter gross margins by $5 million. Finally, manufacturing costs were positively impacted by realization of synergies and productivity gains, partially offset by exponentially higher transportation and logistic costs. Container costs continue to be significantly higher than last year. In aggregate, the continuing effects of the supply chain disruptions, higher materials, transportation and logistic, and labor costs are estimated to be $20 million to $25 million higher than last year's fourth quarter. Our team continues to work hard to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures and supply chain disruptions by: triggering price escalation clauses that are included in many of our long-term contracts. Implementing price surcharges and driving operational productivity and lean initiatives. Turning to Slide 10, for the fourth quarter, adjusted operating margin expanded 2.1 percentage points versus last year, driven by higher adjusted gross margin but partially offset by higher SG&A and engineering expenses. Adjusted SG&A was $271 million, which was up $65 million from the prior year due to the normalization of certain expenses, higher incentive compensation, and employee benefit costs, and the acquisition of Nordco. GAAP SG&A includes a net benefit of $7 million primarily of sales of a closed manufacturing facility. Engineering expense increased from last year. We continue to invest engineering resources in current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customer's safety, productivity, and capacity utilization. Now, let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 11, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales improved for the quarter, and segment adjusted operating income was $267 million for the adjusted margin of 18.7% up 2.4 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefits of improved productivity, realization of synergies, and mix across our portfolio were partially offset by higher net input costs. Finally, segment backlog was $18.5 billion, up $615 million from the end of last year due to the broad multi-year order momentum that Rafael discussed earlier. This year's backlog growth was driven by an unusually high number of long-term service contracts. Looking forward, we expect our service long-term orders to normalize in 2022. Turning to Slide 12, transit segment sales were down 5.4%, driven by supply chain disruptions and the negative effects of foreign currency exchange. Adjusted segment operating income was up $11 million to $88 million, which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 13.6%, up a strong 2.3 percentage points versus the prior year, and up 1.1 percentage points for the full year. Across the segment, we continued to drive down cost and improve project execution despite the volatile environment. Finally, transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.67 billion, down slightly versus a year ago. Adjusting for the negative effect of foreign currency exchange, backlog would have been up 3.6%. Now, let's turn to our financial position on Slide 13. We had another strong quarter of cash generation. We generated $314 million of operating cash flow during the quarter, bringing full-year cash flow generated to over $1.07 billion, which as Rafael noted, is a record high for the company. This performance clearly demonstrates the quality of our earnings and our business portfolio. During the quarter, total Capex was $52 million, bringing total year Capex to $130 million. Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter declined to 2.5 times, and our liquidity is robust at 1.67 billion. Also during the quarter, we returned more cash to our shareholders, repurchasing an additional a $100 million of shares, bringing the full year share repurchases to $300 million and paid dividends of $92 million. As you can see in these results, our balance sheet continues to strengthen and we are confident that we can continue to drive solid cash generation, giving us liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital toward the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value. Moving to Slide 14, quickly recapping the year, overall, the team delivered a very strong year for all our stakeholders. Despite challenging dynamics, we drove revenue growth, expanded our operating margins across both segments, and generated robust cash flow. The strong execution provides us a solid foundation and good momentum as we enter into 2022. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael. Thanks, Justin. Yes, we've discussed and taking it back to the third quarter. We certainly had a drag on revenue because of the supply chain disruptions of three to four. And I am sorry, in two to three percentage points. And that increased in the fourth quarter. As we look forward into next year, we've incorporated a catch up into the guidance that we have and would look that to be hopefully over the next couple of quarters. It's very difficult to tell. We see parts of the supply chain improving and other parts getting a little bit worse. So -- and it's kind of spread out beyond just the material piece, the labor with Omicron. So we expect there will be some impact on certainly in the first quarter. And we'll just have to see how things work out over the next few quarters. Justin, that's necessarily additive. It affected us in the third quarter, took revenue down in the fourth quarter as we exited. A way to look at it more is it was three to four percentage points at the midpoint. That's around $72 million. So we're looking year-over-year, not sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. So we would expect to pick up a fair portion of the majority of that $72 million that we believe we were short at the end of the year. Sure. Justin. Let's take the two pieces and start with the gross cost. And you're absolutely right, the $20 million to $30 million is a gross cost or $20 million to $25 million is a gross cost. And again, let me take you back to the third quarter, at the time this all started. And we had higher costs, which were predominantly on the transportation side, but called out the fact that coming behind that on the material side was a lot of costs that were getting caught up in inventory, and that they would release over time. And at that time, we had $15 million to $20 million of costs. We said it would rise, and indeed it did in the fourth quarter, it grew to 20-25. we also saw that piece come in behind us, an inventory grow, which we expected. So as we look forward, Justin, we would expect cost to continue to grow over the next few quarters, certainly in the first half of the year. And as you pointed out, there's 2 sides of this equation, and so that takes us to the other side and the cost recovery or the pricing side of it. Again, taking you back to the third quarter, at that time we said about half of the higher costs of $15 million to $20 million we're being recaptured in terms of pricing. We also talked a little bit about our uniqueness in that the majority of our revenues are tied up and long-term contracts and they have price escalators in them. So we feel very confident that pricing will come, these have been in contracts for decades and  tried and true, but they will come over a period of time and they typically, while some are monthly and most of them are annual, and they'll tick at the anniversary dates and that'll happen throughout the fourth quarter s after the third quarter or throughout the next year. And what we saw in the fourth quarter is exactly, what we would have expected is that price recovery has increased from the 50% into the fourth quarter, and we will expect to see that to continue to increase over the next few quarters as we lapped those anniversary dates and supply  area in our contracts with our customers. Gross costs will certainly go up in the first quarter, and we'll also see the pricing go up. Not saying anything about the net costs. The timing of what comes through this is just a little bit harder to tell because the timing of what comes through the balance sheet or off of inventory. Thank you, Justin. Okay. Scott, so within the prepared remarks, we talked a little bit about the backlog. We're very pleased overall with the growth that we're seeing. Just wanted to point out that in 2021 we had a strong level of orders coming in on -- pretty long-term multiyear orders on the service side. And while we expect backlog to continue to grow into the future, we will see a little bit of normalization in some of those long-term contracts. We picked up a lot of them from some of our largest carriers in 2021. Hi, Allison, this is John. Yes. Number 1, we're very pleased with the fourth quarter margin results, which were up 2.3 percentage points. But beyond that, they were up on 1.1 points on a full-year basis. And if you go back the last four years, we've been up about 400 basis points. So we're -- we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing from the Transit group. But I'm zeroing in on your question, Allison, and the fourth quarter, the margin was driven by three areas. Number 1 was mix within transit with strong, now this can go both ways. So I wouldn't say that that is structural, but it did benefit us in the quarter. The other two are: the second area, and we talked about this in the third quarter is and it has been a focus of transit for the last couple of years, is really working on more profitable contracts. And each quarter that goes by, we're seeing that take hold and we're seeing it reflected in our margins. And we do believe that is certainly structural going forward. And then the other piece of course, which is also that way, is they're focused on productivity and integration. They've done an absolutely fantastic job of driving productivity, whether it has been continuous improvement on the day-to-day things, or integrating within the transit organization and integration with the broader Wabtec company. So, very pleased with that, and we expect them to continue to drive their mergence forward in the future. Allison, this is John, I'll take the question on the Freight mix in 2022. So it is going to be a bit of a drag on overall margin growth, but I wouldn't call it a headwind as such. Any time that we can put an install base out there that's going to be for the next 20 or 30 years, to me, is a tremendous positive. And we will sell year-over-year, a big increase as we believe we hit the trough in locomotive sales in 2021 of locomotives as well as mining Equipment. So with that, the fact is, is that while Freight, I'm sorry, Equipment, has on strong margins. They're in the lower side of the five groups that we have, and they will grow a fair amount faster than the rest of the groups in 2022, as Rafael pointed out, particularly in the back half. And so that  will be a headwind with regards to margins, but we will have those assets out there. We'll continue to service and modernize and put Digital Equipment as well as a component replacement parts. So we feel great about that mix unfavorability going into 2022. Kind of going back to the previous comment, as we launched from 2021, we took on a lot of long-term service contracts in that mix, so those -- we feel very good about the profitability going forward. And we also increased our mix of international -- or of our local motive orders that we'll see being delivered next year. So I would say that the margin that we're seeing, as we exit the year in terms of overall margin is pretty balanced. Yes. Ken. When we look at our EPS guidance of 465 to 55 with a midpoint of 485 represents 14% year-over-year growth on a midpoint of 8% volume growth, we feel very good about the construct of our, of our P&L and the leverage that we'll get as we cascade down through it. When you look at the core drivers of that is on the positive side, is that the productivity and synergies that we expect which we feel very good about. Also the absorption, the fixed cost absorption that will be a tailwind to us in 2022. Those being somewhat offset by the costs that we talked about. So until we get to price cost equilibrium, there will be a headwind on our costs, largely in the first half and then the mix piece, which will be somewhat of a headwind, but a very positive in terms of why that's happening. SG&A, as we talked about, will be lower as a percent of revenue and will continue to invest in technology. And that takes us on to the P&L. We feel very good about the range that we have and we certainly feel good about 2022. No, no. That was last year. Achieved that. We got 9/10 out of Freight and 1.1 points of margin growth out of Transit. Now, when we look to 2022, what we do expect, Ken, is that operating margin percent will be up on a year-over-year basis. But we're not calling a percent. James, this is John. The Services revenue was up 21.2% in the quarter. If you take away Nordco, we were up 10.1%, and that's really what we've been running on largely throughout the year. And had a good year and we expect growth momentum to continue into 2022 in our services group. Yeah. We couldn't be more thrilled. The board had two approvals in the recent board meeting. One is to up the dividend by 25% and the other is reauthorizing $750 million of share repurchases. The other thing I'm happy to point out is that in the back half of the year, we purchased $300 million. We don't provide guidance going forward on what our share repurchases are, but when we look at the overall capital allocation opportunities that we have, we kind of waterfall that from making sure that we build our balance sheet and strengthen that, protect the dividend and invest in our business. And Raphael just talked about that and some of the technology investments that we're making. Then with the cash that's left over from that. We're largely looking at what opportunities there are M&A activity for accretive strategic bolt-on type M&A work. At the end of the day, when there's excess cash, we are committed to returning that to our shareholders through share repurchases."

            "name": "Rafael Santana",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristine and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4 then I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter, and our long-term value framework. John will then cover the financials. Overall, we achieved significant progress against our strategy and delivered a strong fourth quarter as noted by the expansion of adjusted margins by 2.1 percentage points and adjusted earnings per share increase of over 20%. Total cash flow from operations was strong at $314 million. This takes year-to-date cash from operations to over $1 billion, up 37% versus last year, which was a record for the company. This is a solid illustration that the team continues to drive strong operational performance and quality earnings. Cash conversion for the quarter was set 99%. Finally, we ended the year with over $22 billion of multiyear backlog, which was up $578 million in 2021. Overall, our team delivered really strong execution to finish of the year despite significant supply chain disruption and rising costs. On the back of this strong performance and our confidence about the future, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend and reauthorized a $750 million share buyback program. Shifting our focus to Slide 5, let's talk about our end-market conditions in more details. Internationally, freight activity continued to grow in the fourth quarter across our major markets, and our order pipeline remains strong. We expect long-term revenue growth in the majority of our end markets. Freight trends in North America were down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This was not driven by lack of demand, but largely by ongoing global supply chain disruptions. Locomotive parkings continued to decline despite weaker Freight traffic in the quarter. Throughout the year, the advancements we have made in reliability, efficiency, and safety continue to drive manageable outcomes across our customers operations. Last year, our fleet of locomotives traveled more than 1.5 billion miles in some of the world's harshest conditions. Looking ahead, we expect demand for reliability, productivity, and fuel efficiency to continue to increase placing our service's business and Amortization portfolio in a position of strength. When it comes to the North America railcar builds, demand for railcar is increasing. Railcars in storage are below pre-COVID levels with about 19% of the North American fleet car in storage. As a result, industry orders for new railcars are continuing to improve. The industry, delivered just over 29,000 railcars in \u201821 and the outlook for 2022 is for over 40,000 cars. Transitioning to the transit sector, ridership trends continue to be uneven in various markets. However, infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue to be a bright spot, especially as governments globally invest in rail for clean, safe and efficient transportation. Overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remains strong. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss some recent winds that are providing good momentum and visibility as we enter into 2022. Let's start with the shift to battery-electric. In recent weeks, Union Pacific announced an agreement to buy FLXDrive locomotives. This comes on the heels of auto-strategic commitments from international customers in Canada and in Australia, all of which will leverage this next-generation technology to increase productivity, reduce fuel, and slash emissions across their operations. And in transits, Wabtec was named a founding member of Europe's rail joint undertaking, which is investing nearly 1.2 billion euros to fund Green rail projects. These are government labs  projects focused on automation, digitization, and network optimization. The areas where we can help drive innovation and technology adoption across the rail sector. I'd also highlight during the quarter in freight services, we won a significant international long-term service contract, as well as orders for international locomotive modernizations. Overall, the modernization backlog remains strong. Throughout the fourth quarter, we delivered a record number of mods, marking a significant milestone for the team. We also won strategic digital contracts in North America to upgrade PTC hardware, along with an order for smart HBT at a Class 1 to help our customers improve asset utilization, driving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. Looking forward, our backlog gives us the confidence that we will drive long-term profitable growth and leads stay industry in advancing its position in sustainable rail even further. I'll  the call here over to John to review the quarter segment performance and our overall financial position. John. Thanks, John. Let's flip to Slide 15 to discuss our 2022 financial guidance. We believe that there are underlying customer demand for our products and the end market momentum remains strong across our product lines, and our backlog continues to provide visibility into 2022 and beyond. North American freight markets are expected to show growth despite another year of zero locomotive deliveries in North America. Our international pipeline remains strong in order momentum continues to build. International markets continue to be the bright spot, and we expect overall locomotive deliveries to be significantly higher versus 2021. We expect strong growth in equipment in 2022, which will create negative mix for us during the year. When it comes to North American builds, railcars are coming back into use, and we expect railcar deliveries to increase. Our service business continues to benefit from demand for reliable, efficient, and available power, driving the need to modernize and refresh fleets along with the continued unparking of locomotives. In Digital Electronics, our growing backlog of orders supports a return to growth in 2022. Now, on transitioning to Transit, we expect growth as ridership continues to recover and the infrastructure spending increases as governments invest and clean, safe, and efficient means of transport. We are committed to driving adjusted margin expansion in 2022, despite headwinds from supply chain disruptions of unfavorable mix and still challenging cost environment with higher investments in technology. The team is committed to driving strong top line growth while aggressively managing costs; with these factors in mind, we expect sales of $8.3 billion to $8.6 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $4.65 and $5.05 per share. We expect cash flow conversion to be greater than 90%. Now, let's turn to our next slide. Our teams remain committed to delivering long-term profitable growth. Our strategy is built on our significant stall base and deep industry expertise grounded in innovation, breakthrough initiatives and scalable technologies that drive value for our customers. These efforts we will continue to be accelerated by our lean and continuous improvement culture and disciplined capital allocation. I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the fourth quarter despite a challenging environment. You are seeing their efforts in the strength of the company, our 2021 financial results, and our 2022 guidance. As we go forward, the rail sector is well positioned to increase share and address the critical issues facing the world's freight and logistics sector. We will continue to lean into the strong fundamentals of this industry in our company to deliver long-term profitable growth. As we said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose, to move and improve the world. And after demonstrating strong performance in 2021, I'm confident, that this company will continue to deliver and lead the transition to a more sustainable future. With that, I will turn the call back over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine? Hi Courtney, thanks for the question. Let me start with top-line growth at 8%. When we think about \u201822 we have stronger coverage than we had last year, so that's a positive. We're continuing to invest in the business with engineering up as a percent of sales. We liked the momentum on how we were progressing with the deal pipeline. We do have headwinds from inflation, we are going very much through a transition in terms of costs coming in, while our teams are working on both elements of pricing, but also continue to manage costs. I think mix is relevant elements, especially with equipment s really growing at a faster rate than the rest of the company. Our teams are focused on driving what I call profitable growth into \u201822 and beyond. And with EPS growing up double-digits, you asked a little bit about the dynamics between first half of the year and second half of the year. We would say revenues relatively similar to what you saw last year with maybe a couple of points higher in the second half of the year. Profitability on the other way around, you should think about profitability a bit higher in the first half of the year versus the second half, and that's really driven by, again, the mix as we have deliveries of what I call new locomotives into the second half of the year. Reporting a strong  results on that side. We had also, I think very strong orders last year. And those are multiyear orders, I think in the fourth-quarter in specific. We're continue to pick up momentum internationally on that, which I think provides a significant opportunity for us to continue grow so that business line is growing in \u201822 and we see the opportunity to continue to grow beyond that. There's just a significant opportunity for us to modernize units really drive a lot of the technology that we've developed with fuel and now automation and demand is  there. Thanks Morning. Justin, I would like to add the following. I mean, just in the fourth quarter and just transitioning here between fourth quarter and first, we saw record absenteeism in the business, something we hadn't seen before. And well, needless to say, some of the continuation of some of the supply delays. But that has ultimately just delayed revenues and in that case for the fourth quarter was over $70 million. Where with BOP fast got peak and we have a strong team who's executed well, and we're seeing that coming through in the first quarter. Good morning, Jerry. Jerry, I think strong progress here we're considering to work closely with customers. And this is an area we're a leader and we will continue to be in that space. We're continuing to adapt dialogues with a number of orders announced now, more recently in North America. But we've had orders in Canada and Australia. There's a conversations are continuing with customers in other geographies. So the pipeline, it's continued to build up and we are confident about that when you think about the deliveries here, they are mostly into the 24-time frame, and that's when you're going to be seeing more of that. With that, I mean, we're excited to see some of the evolution on the technologies and a lot of the elements of what we consider today in terms of power density, in terms of what's possible, we see growth in that power density. And combining that with really the digital portfolio we have, we still like we're uniquely positioned to really do energy management and drive significant value for customers in terms of the results they get from this technology. Yes. I think if you look at the announcements is about 20 at this point, but I think a lot of it is tied to customer testing that technology into their specific operations. Jerry, we're not going to be commenting on specific numbers around these orders, but we're picking up. If you think about when we really started to talk about this, this is reality. It's got application in a variety of areas for customers and will ultimately help them drive, not just the fuel expense down that will ultimately also help down meet decarbonization goals, which most of them have put out there. Thank you. Morning. Yes, it was a comparison between first half and second half, Justin. Sorry, Scott. Yes. Scott, let me add the following. When you look at how it we finished last year, 12-month backlog growing double-digits. But really, I think what's most informing here is providing higher conversion into \u201822 versus swat we had a year ago. So stepping into the OMIX of the guidance we've provided we certainly have higher cost assets based on that backlog conversion that we have moving forward. We talked about equipment growth off which it's really tied to international locomotive orders, largely concentrated in the second half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter. And those were the comments that I made earlier associated with mix in the elements of higher margins in the first half of \u201822 versus second half of \u201822. Scott, certainly. What we're continuing to work is on building on that momentum. I talked about a strong pipeline there, so it's all about convertibility, making sure we continue to drive convertibility. But as I look across the various geographies, the momentum is there, so it's not a single geography, it's really -- I'll call a number of different elements driving that discussion with customers. Thanks. Sure. Thanks.  battery electric first, I think customers are really taking those units into operation to really fast on their own realities. Some of these customers we having parallel discussions in terms of increased demand and demand for new locomotives. And that's a reality and a variety of geographies that are traditional to us and that's where I also, I based some of my comments on strong pipeline route. If I think about Kazakhstan, Australia, or Brazil, I think that's part of the dialogue on transit and transit guidance in specific. We expect offline  more into low single-digits for this year, and the team is really committed to continue to drive profitable growth in the Transit business. As we continue to work there, I think we continue to have opportunities to invest overall, while making what I'll call Wabtec businesses more efficient, and a big chunk of that is -- really we're looking at our footprints. And with that being said, we are continuing to work to do the dynamics of what John highlighted earlier, pricing, inflation and supply chain disruptions. So you could see some variation quarter to quarter, but we see really progress in' \u201822 driving profitable growth. I think there's an element here to be considered just on quarter-over-quarter and specific variations, you might have there. But the dynamics as you've heard are very favorable in terms of the amount for mods. I think digital, also I think really turn it into a good old story coming to the year and as we progress forward. Morning. Let me start and I'll let John complement here. Number one, I think the range is very consistent with what we've done for the past years. So I'll just start there. The second thing I would want to highlight is we continue our focus on really driving profitability forward. It's about driving profitable growth in \u201822 and beyond, and I speak on both the segments as well. I mean, we are going through a transition here, as I described, there could be variation quarter-to-quarter, but this is really what we're going after. Let me start with the battery electric, which we're happy with really the testing that we did of the technology we gives us the confidence to move forward with customers here, and ultimately work on a product that really solves for them in terms of the reliability expectations and driving a lot of the value that you described in terms of not just feel de - carbonization ultimately, better operating ratio, but we are working with customers on a variety of solutions. I'm glad you touched alternative fuels, which is a significant element of that. One of the things that we are certainly proud just when you look at the engines that equip our locomotives there, they tend to be at least 4 to 6 points more efficient than the competitor's locomotives, so I'll just start there. But that's at the engine level. When you go to the locomotive level you step it up another one to two points. And by the time you add, really the digital portfolio we have, you are really getting to a double-digit arena here and that scenario, we will continue to step up. And if you think about biofuels and you just stop urge on the top of that. The opportunity to make sure that ultimately, you're driving decarbonization and most efficient way. So we feel strong about these elements and they were belts really over time and we continue to really invest and continuing to find solutions to upgrade installed base and stay ahead of the game here. There are other alternative technologies that are being looked at. I think we talked last year about hydrogen and fuel cell technology, things that we're doing in partnerships. There is really a number of things that we're looking at it. We're working very closely with customers ultimately through that process. Some of this will play longer term as we have described in the fuel cell side. And there's a lot to be validated there. But in terms of alternative fuels, we think that could play shorter-term and with feel strong about well, leading on that front as well. Thank you. I think when we looked at the last six months, we've seen on parking to continued. When you look at the specific dynamics on the first quarter here, I think certainly the latter conditions have been really quite disruptive. So that actually has also driven what I'll call demand for the services business. As our customers are investing on that fleets. And if you think about the elements of how the network has slowed down that will allow so -- that be an element of potentially driving on parkings here and more freight cars online. So positive from that perspective. I'll just emphasize that we're really committed to drive the higher return on investment to our shareholders. And  we're committed to certainly investment-grade and continue to work the discipline that you've seen from us through that process. So I -- a couple comments there. Number 1, I'll start with just the elements of modernizing the fleets. I think that's 1 of the things that our customers look at that it's probably top in mind. And so that's to a large extent tied not just to the mods business, but it's also tied to investment in Tier 4 and the newest technology that we have there. If you were to ask me what to second on that, I think alternative fuel specifically with biofuels, that's not a key element and that  is very little, I'll call limited the change in terms of how they operate in that context. And as I got a highlight here, the elements of what we got in the digital portfolio, which has continued to equip those fleets with those capabilities that will drive significant, I'll call fuel reduction and ultimately good outcomes for the customers. When I think about the next technology, I think battery is something that's really being tested. I think there is the opportunity here to have a real application of that in terms of certain routes and specific customers, when you talk about mixing, all of that, I think there's a significant degree of sensitiveness around mixing different technologies and different fuels because that would churn into a significant challenge. So ultimately, I think you're going to see evolutionary progress here. There could be an element of hybrid locomotives. Then as you step in to some of this new technologies, I think what's most important is the leadership role we've had on testing those in working them with customers, but there could be an element of some of these being adopted faster with some customers that might have a more simplified logistics than we have in North America, for instance. You got it, I think it's going to be more evolutionary as we look into the next couple of years, before you get to really a transformational . that should not because  steps is technology they can apply to existing fleet and upgrade the fleet. So you can work on that transition. So some of the technologies we're talking about, what if I start with alternative fuels? I mean, that's  you will apply on the existing fleet. If you think about all the testing we are doing on batteries, ultimately that leads to potentially considering a hybridization of locomotives. So next thing, as you're thinking about mods, you could be connecting batteries into that mods can drive that fuel efficiency moving forward. So again, back to my comments on evolutionary versus revolutionary, and you got to be very sensitive to the elements of operations and how you make sure you don't disrupt any of the elements that exists there today, especially start switching fields if you go into hydrogen, for instance, I think we certainly have experience with LNG, and that tries a much more significant change in the overall infrastructure. With certainly this are very important parts of our portfolio. Let me start first with Russia in specific. While it's an important part of our portfolio and we're I'll say certainly concerned about situation with that being said, Russia accounts for less than 5% of our business. If you think about Kazakhstan yes, we've followed out very closely. We have a significant operation there with employees, but there's really minimum disruption as we went through that process and we continue to operate strongly there. Thank you."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to Wabtec's third quarter 2021 earnings call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, John Olin; and Senior Vice President of Finance, John Mastalerz.  Today's slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures were posted on our website earlier today, and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Some statements we are making today are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements, please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics, and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. I will now turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kristine, and good morning everyone. Joining me today is our new Chief Financial Officer, John Olin. John is a well respected leader with broad operational and financial experience. He is already bringing a great perspective to our business and long-term strategy with a clear focus on growing shareholder value. We are thrilled to have him on the team.  I also want to take a moment to thank Pat Dugan for his nearly 20 years of service to Wabtec. We are grateful for all that he has contributed to the company.  With that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 4. I will start with an update on our business, my perspective on the quarter and our long-term value framework and then, John will cover the financials. Overall, we made significant progress against our strategy and delivered a strong third quarter as noted by our sales growth, adjusted margins and adjusted earnings per share, each of which were up year-over-year.  Total sales for the quarter were $1.9 billion, driven by growing demand in freight services and components, but offset by continued weakness in the North America OEM market. Adjusted operating margin was 17%, driven by strong mix and productivity, ongoing lean initiatives, and cost actions. Total cash flow from operations was $244 million. This takes year-to-date cash from operations to $759 million versus $458 million a year ago. This is a solid illustration of how the team is driving good operational performance. Cash conversion for the year is at a 103%.  Finally, we ended third quarter with adjusted EPS of $1.14, up 20% year-over-year. Today, we are also pleased to share that we have achieved our $250 million synergy runrate of full year earlier than expected at the time of the GE Transportation acquisition. We have consolidated and optimized our operations, reduced costs to drive stronger profitability, accelerated lean across the enterprise, and created additional capabilities in best cost countries.  We are already feeling the benefit of these efforts, which will continue to improve our competitiveness. So overall, really strong execution by the team as we continue to deliver on our long-term strategy.  Shifting our focus to Slide 5, let\u2019s talk about our end-market conditions in more detail. Internationally, freight activity continued to improve in the third quarter across our major markets and our order pipeline remains strong. We expect long-term revenue growth in Russia, CIS, Brazil, Africa, Asia and then Australia.  Freight trends in North America weakened slightly year-over-year in the third quarter, not driven by lack of demand but by global supply chain disruption that has impacted intermodal volumes and our production. Consumer and industrial activity continued to spur volume growth in chemicals, metals and materials.  Locomotive parkings continued to decline despite weaker freight traffic in the quarter. We expect demand for reliability, productivity and fuel efficiencies to continue to increase placing our services business in a position of strength. When it comes to the North America railcar builds, demand for railcars is improving. About 21% of the North America railcar fleet remains in storage, a slight improvement from the previous quarter and in line with pre-COVID levels.  As a result, industry orders for new railcars are starting to improve. We forecast the railcar build this year will be in the neighborhood of 30,000 cars.  Transitioning to the transit sector, ridership remains a bit uneven in some markets. However, infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue to be a bright spot, especially as governments globally churn to rail for clean, safe, and efficient transportation. Overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remains strong. Shifting to Slide 6, we are developing innovative solutions that address the main cost drivers for our customers, including fuel efficiency and increased velocity in the transportation sector. Our commitment to succeed in these efforts is underscored by our focus on continuing to position rail transportation as the safest and most sustainable way to move freight and people over land.  Today, we have the capability and expertise to transition diesel-powered locomotives to battery power and drastically reduce emissions as we are going with our FLX drive locomotive. We expect to extend this technology farther to hydrogen fuel cells and help lead the industry to a zero emission rail network of the future. And we are not stopping there. We have extended battery technology to other areas of our business as well. And we are driving cellular technology breakthroughs to boost transit efficiency and reduce emissions and \u2013 An example of this is our Green Friction technology, which drastically reduces brake emissions by up to 90%, an incredible milestone in significantly improving the quality of air in our metros. We are also leading the change to create a safer and more efficient rail network.  A great example of this and a solution of growing interest among class one customers is Trip Optimizers zero to zero. These advanced technologies allows an operator to autonomously start a train from zero miles per hour and stop it using software integrated with positive train control. It builds on Trip Optimizer\u2019s proven performance, which have saved railroads more than 400 million gallons of fuel since its inception and reduces emissions by over 500,000 tons per year.  Looking forward, we will continue to advance efforts towards cleaner, more energy efficient transport and will share our progress on this front as well as our broader environmental, social and governance priorities in our next sustainability report, which will be released in a couple weeks.  Next, let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 to discuss how our next gen technology is helping us win in the market by covering a few recent business highlights. In the third quarter, we secured new orders for our FLX drive locomotives. We also closed a significant order for international locomotive test and won additional contracts in Asia to help our customers improve asset utilization and reduce emissions.  In freight services, we won a significant long-term service contract as well as an order for a 100 locomotive modernizations in North America. Overall, mod backlog remains strong and we are showing good momentum on deliveries.  Finally, in transits, we won new power collection, HVACs and service contracts in Germany, Switzerland and the UK. Looking ahead, we are confident Wabtec will continue to capture growth with innovative and scalable technologies that addressed our customers\u2019 most pressing needs. We also will continue to control what we can and leverage the strength to combat the current challenges that we are facing due to supply chain disruptions increasing metal and commodity costs and labor shortages.  This dynamic have adversely impacted our third quarter results and have resulted in significant cost increases. Across the board, our team is working hard to mitigate the impacts of these pressures by triggering price escalations and surcharges as well as driving operational efficiencies wherever we can. We anticipate that cost will continue to increase over the next few quarters and we will continue to aggressively manage these challenges.  I will turn the call over John now to discuss this in more detail, as well as review the quarter, segment performance and our overall financial position. John? \nJohn Olin: Thanks, Rafael and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s great to be with you and I am very excited to join the team at Wabtec. It is a historic company with incredible talent, deep innovation, and best-in-class differentiated technologies that is well positioned to deliver the future of rail, whilst growing shareholder value. And I look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. Now turning to Slide 8, before getting into the financials, we would like to discuss the dynamic cost environment and supply chain challenges that we face. During the third quarter, we experienced delays in production and deliveries of our products as well as significant increases in many key input costs.  On the revenue side, we are experiencing adverse impacts to our sales results due to shortages across many component parts, including computer chips, which are causing delays in production and customer delivery. We believe that our enterprise revenues were 2% to 3% lower than they would have been without the supply chain disruptions and that the majority of these lower revenues represent delayed sales, not lost sales.  The impacts to Wabtec\u2019s cost structure come in four areas. First, commodity inflation where markets year-over-year are up more than 200% for steel, 94% for aluminum and roughly 40% for copper. The second area of impact is elevated freight and logistics cost, which in many cases are up over 3 to 4 times from pre-COVID levels.  Third is wage inflation and labor availability, which are adversely impacting the business. And finally, we are experiencing lost manufacturing efficiencies largely due to component and chip shortages. Our costs have increased during the quarter and have impacted both our freight and transit segments. We estimate that cost increases in the third quarter are in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Having said that, we expect these inwards to intensify as the full cost of rising metals and lower manufacturing efficiencies work their way through our inventories and purchase contracts. We anticipate cost to continue to increase over the next few quarters. Our team is working hard to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures and supply chain disruptions by, triggering price escalation causes that are included in many of our long-term contracts, implementing price surcharges, driving operational productivity and lean initiatives and finally through higher realization of synergies.  Turning to Slide 9, I will review our third quarter results in more detail. We had good operational and financial performance during the quarter. Sales for the third quarter were $1.91 billion, which reflects a 2.2% increase versus the prior year. Sales were positively impacted by the continued broad based recovery we are experiencing across much of our portfolio, the acquisition of Nordco and favorable currency exchange, partially offset by continued weakness in the North America OE locomotive market and lower year-over-year sales and transit.  For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $325 million, which was up 10.6% versus the prior year. Most notably, we delivered margin expansion in both our segments up 1.3 percentage points on a consolidated basis. Margins were aided by strong mix favorability, improved productivity and better than expected realization of synergies.  As Rafael stated, during the quarter, we achieved our goal of $250 million of synergy runrate, a significant milestone delivered a full year earlier than originally forecasted. What makes this quarter\u2019s margin expansion even more impressive is the fact that our margin gains were achieved in the phase of an incredibly dynamic supply chain and inflationary environment.  Looking at some of the detailed line items for the third quarter, adjusted SG&A was $257 million, which was up $16.1 million from the prior year due to the normalization of certain expenses, higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs and the acquisition of Nordco.  For the full year, we expect SG&A to be above 12.25% of sales, adjusted SG&A excludes $12 million of restructuring and transition expenses, of which most was allocated to further optimize our European footprint.  Engineering expense increased from last year. We continue to invest engineering resources in current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing on the future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve safety, productivity and capacity utilization. Our 2021 investment in technology, which includes engineering expense remains at 6% to 7% of sales.  Amortization expense was $72.5 million and our adjusted effective tax rate during the quarter was 24.8% bringing our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate to 25.8%. For the full year, we still expect to have an effective tax rate of about 26% excluding discrete items.  In the third quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.69 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.14, up 20% versus prior year. We are pleased with our Q3 results, in particular, our sales growth in the phase of supply chain disruptions, our margin growth in the phase of sharp cost increases, we remain diligent and proactive as we work to minimize these challenges.  Now let\u2019s take a look at segment results on Slide 10 starting with the freight segment. Across the freight segment, total sales increased 4.7% from last year to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by continued strong growth in our services and component businesses. In terms of product lines, equipment sales were down 5.7% year-over-year due to fewer locomotive deliveries this quarter versus last year and no new locomotive deliveries in North America, partially offset by strong mining sales. This year-over-year performance demonstrates the resiliency of our equipment portfolio.  In line with that improved outlook for rail, our services sales grew a robust 13.6% versus last year. The year-over-year sales increase was largely driven by higher aftermarket sales from our customers modernizing their fleets, the unparking of locomotives and the acquisition of Nordco. The performance, reliability, and availability of our fleet continues to drive customer demand as railroads increasingly look for predictable outcomes across their fleet. Excluding Nordco, organic sales for the third quarter were up 6.1%.  Digital electronics sales were down 3.6% year-over-year driven by delays in purchase decisions, due to economic and cost uncertainties as well as chip shortages. We continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers globally focused on safety, improved productivity, increased capacity and utilization . Component sales continued to show recovery, and were up 6.7% year-over-year driven by demand for railcar components and recovery in industrial end-markets. We remain encouraged by the continuing trend of railcars coming out of storage, higher order rates for new railcars and accelerated recovery across industrial end-markets.  Shifting to operating income for this segment. Freight segment adjusted operating income was $266 million, for an adjusted margin of 20.6%, up 1.7 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefit of higher volumes, improved mix across our portfolio and increased synergies and productivity were partially offset by significantly higher input costs.  Finally, segment backlog was $18.2 billion, up $375 million from the prior quarter on the broad multi-year order momentum that Rafael discussed across the segment.  Turning to Slide 11. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 2.5% year-over-year to $612 million. Sales were down versus last year due in large part to supply chain issues and COVID-related disruptions. This was partially offset by positive ridership trends. Excluding near-term supply chain challenges, we estimate that Transit sales would have been up slightly on a year-over-year basis.  We believe the medium and long-term outlook for this segment remains positive as infrastructure spending for Green initiatives continues. Adjusted segment operating income was $77 million, which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 12.5%, up 50 basis points versus the prior year. Across the segment, we continued to drive down cost and improve project execution despite the volatile cost environment. For the year, we remain committed to deliver about a 100 basis points of margin improvement for the segment and the team continues to take aggressive action to mitigate rising cost and supply chain disruption, which will pressure the pace of near-term margin improvement. As we execute in the fourth quarter, we expect significantly improve operating margin driven by strong productivity gains, improved project mix and more favorable comps versus the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. Finally, transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.6 billion which was flat with the prior quarter after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange.  Now let's turn to our financial position on slide 12. We had another strong quarter of cash generation. We generated $244 million of operating cash flow during the quarter, bringing year-to-date cash flow generated to over $759 million. This performance clearly demonstrates the quality of our business portfolio.  During the quarter total CapEx was $23 million bringing year-to-date CapEx to $78.5 million. In 2021, we now expect CapEx to be approximately $120 million. This is $20 million lower than our previous guidance as the team judiciously manages every dollar of spend.  Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.6 times and our liquidity is robust at $1.62 billion. Also during the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders repurchasing $199 million of shares. As you can see in these results, our balance sheet continues to strengthen and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash generation giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital towards the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value.  With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Rafael. \nRafael Santana: Thanks, John. Let\u2019s flip to Slide 13 to discuss our updated 2021 financial guidance. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and the end-market momentum remains strong. As John indicated, we do expect continued headwinds from a more challenging sales and cost environment into the fourth quarter.  Taking into consideration this market backdrop and volatile cost environment, combined with our solid performance in the first three quarters, we are narrowing our full year revenue and earnings per share guidance. We expect sales of $7.9 billion to $8.05 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $4.20 and $4.30 per share. We expect cash flow conversion to remain greater than 90% resulting in strong cash generation of about $1 billion for the full year.  Now, let\u2019s turn to our final slide. Everything we outlined today reinforces that we have a clear strategy to accelerate long-term profitable growth. That strategy is built on our extensive installed base and deep industry expertise grounded in innovation, breakthrough initiatives and scalable technologies that drive value for our customers and accelerated by our lean continuous improvement culture and disciplined capital allocation.  I am proud of the strong execution by the team in the third quarter despite a challenging supply chain, cost, and market environment. You are seeing their efforts in the strength of the company and our financial results. As we go forward, the rail sector is well positioned to increase share and address the critical issues facing the world\u2019s freight and logistics sector.  We will continue to lean into the strong fundamentals of this industry and our company to deliver long-term profitable growth. As we said before, Wabtec\u2019s mission holds a larger purpose to move and improve the world.  After demonstrating strong performance in the first three quarters of 2021, I am confident that this company will continue to deliver and lead the transition to a more sustainable future.  With that, I will turn the call back over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine?\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions. But before we do and out of consideration for others on the call, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are now ready for our first question. \nOperator:  Our first question comes from Justin Long from Stephens. You may now go ahead. \nJustin Long: Thanks. Good morning and John, congrats on the new role. Look forward to working with you. \nJohn Olin: Thank you. \nRafael Santana: Good morning, Justin. \nJustin Long: I guess, to start, I had a question on the revenue guidance. If we just take the low end of the revenue guidance, it still implies a pretty sequential pickup in revenue in the fourth quarter. I think it\u2019s around 13% of an increase sequentially to hit the low end of that guide. Can you just give a little bit more color around the areas where you see that sequential improvement and just the level of visibility you have? \nRafael Santana: So, let me start there, Justin. I\u2019ll start with the pipeline of deals that continues to strengthen. I mean, when you look at the impact on the quarter, it\u2019s really tied to supply chain disruption. If anything versus last time we thought, I\u2019d say, we have a stronger pipeline. If you think about the 12 month backlog, it\u2019s up double-digit versus a year ago. This is the highest backlog we had since what, fourth quarter 2019.  And this is a pipeline we continue to work on convertibility here. I think commodity demand remains overall strong for both agriculture and mining. In North America, even in the quarter demand for services and supports for both fuel savings and reliability remains strong. Locomotives are running harder. Demand for freight car is on the rise from the forecast we had earlier in the year. And I think most important we also continue to build momentum on the battery electric solution with customers around the world.  So, this is not a question around demand. I think the adjustment we judged in the guidance for the year reflects some of that disruption including going into the fourth quarter which is reflected in guidance we provided. \nJustin Long: Okay. And secondly I wanted to ask about margins. One of the things that really stood out in the quarter was the adjusted operating margins for the freight segment. We saw a sequential decline in revenue for freight in the third quarter, but I believe the adjusted operating margins improved by over 200 basis points sequentially. So is there any color you can provide around that? Was there anything that was one-time? And then, maybe on the cost headwinds going forward that you said would intensify? Any way to think about the order of magnitude around that and the pickup you expect?\nJohn Olin: Hi, Justin, this is John. Justin, with regards to the sequential and also year-over-year, the margin gains were about the same. Year-over-year, 1.7 points, on a sequential basis, 2.1 points. The driver of that in the freight organization is really the mix between the groups and mix within the groups. And when you look between the group, we had services which has got higher than average margin up 13.6% and in transit and equipment down anywhere between 2.5% and 5.7%. So that\u2019s really the driver of both the sequential and the year-over-year margin improvement.  With regards to the cost side of the question, we talked about the $15 million to $20 million and that\u2019s Justin, what has actually flown through the P&L. And so just to make sure that we are all straight, the largest of the predominance of that cost that we are seeing on the front end is towards freight and I am sorry, yes, freight and logistics cost. Those don\u2019t flow through inventory and they hit us upfront. So the predominance of the $15 million to $20 million is in freight cost. The other piece of it is the materials rising as everyone knows has risen a lot as well as manufacturing inefficiencies. Now those get inventoried in the flow through inventory and they\u2019ll be released in the future as those products are sold. If we look at what\u2019s on the balance sheet, that\u2019s at about the same amount that we saw pass through on the P&L in the third quarter. So there is another $15 million to $20 million on the balance sheet that will come and that\u2019s what we talked about in the prepared remarks is that we would expect cost to rise in the fourth quarter and the next few quarters. \nJustin Long: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the time.\nRafael Santana: Thank you. \nJohn Olin: Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. You may now go ahead. \nJerry Revich : Good morning, everyone. And John, welcome.\nJohn Olin: Thank you. \nRafael Santana: Hi, Jerry. \nJerry Revich : Rafael, I am wondering if you could talk about the mod business. You\u2019ve been on a really strong multiyear trajectory on that part of the portfolio. Can you talk about how the backlog looks? And how attractive that option is for rails as they figure out the emissions reduction strategy longer term? Do you anticipate similar level of production growth for your mods business in 2022 as what you are delivering this year? \nRafael Santana: Yes. Jerry, so first, we do see, I mean, development in that business coming to this year. I think demand is still out there on this. When we think about growth, I think a lot of the elements of growth here for the mods business is more international. I think it remains so robust part of the solution for our customers in North America and justified very much with the announcement we made, but you kind of see us talking about some announcements around off shoring internationally for mod. So that\u2019s where I think a larger part of that opportunity is. \nJerry Revich : Okay, terrific. And then, in terms of the international locomotive contracts, I know obviously you are not taking the commodity cost risk on those multiyear projects. But do your customers have the budgets to cover the significant raw material increases and what\u2019s the process like to recover the additional cost that obviously it\u2019s going to take to complete those projects? \nRafael Santana: I think a lot of those customers are actually benefiting from that, Jerry. So it\u2019s very much connected to it in terms of the opportunities present to grow volume. A lot of it\u2019s demand around both the elements of mining, but also the elements of the agri business. And those remain robust and the forecast that\u2019s positive as we look around the world going back very much my remarks. It\u2019s not a function of a single geography. We are really seeing a pickup on different geographies. \nJerry Revich : And so, no issues on customers\u2019 rail riding taxes. They are facing higher steel cost and multiyear contracts it sounds like. Okay. Thank you. \nRafael Santana: And Jerry, to give more color to it, so number of customer we view is when we get multiyear contracts. So those already call it, provide them some visibility in terms of cost escalations to that process and I mean, we\u2019ve been with a lot of and most of these customers we had a longstanding relationship. So, we\u2019ve gone through times like this. \nJerry Revich : Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. You may now go ahead. \nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks for taking my questions. Sticking on international locomotives, could you just update us on what you are seeing there? What were deliveries in the quarter and maybe some guidance around growth into 2022? \nRafael Santana: Sure. Well, first, I think it\u2019s markets to where we continue to see good momentum. So, when I think about the 2022, 2023 timeframe, I think we see a positive momentum. It\u2019s all around the convertibility of this pipeline into orders and again, as I described it touches different geographies and different elements of that. So, we do expect growth associated to that when we go to the 2022, 2023 timeframe. With regards to guidance into 2022, it\u2019s kind of early stages for us to really be discussing guidance at this point. But favorable demand in the 2022, 2023 timeframe. \nSaree Boroditsky: And then, can you just talk through just on the digital side and freight? Comparables were lot you did this quarter, but you are still down. So, when do you expect this to inflect positively? \nRafael Santana: I\u2019ll start with number one efficiency, productivity, safety, those continue to be imperatives for our customers. We continue to see a strong commitment from them. Book-to-bill is above one year-to-date. We had some strong quarters looking back in terms of some of the multiyear orders and I think internationally we are keeping expanding our penetration. One of the products I think I\u2019ve talked about it before is PTC. Still be an opportunity to that is when I think about outside of the U.S. as big as the U.S. opportunity, we\u2019ve started to execute now in PTC through three different countries outside of the U.S. Now, those are opportunities that it takes some time in terms of working those through. In a lot of cases we are doing also with governments on adopting it. But a very good positive progress up to this point. And I think we have significant room to grow in terms of helping customers hear with both the elements of driving productivity and decarbonization, which touches directly these products. So it\u2019s going to go with automation and fuel savings at the end of the day. \nSaree Boroditsky: And then, just squeeze one in from a perspective, what was the contribution of Nordco to sales in the quarter? \nRafael Santana: 2.1 percentage points on an enterprise-wide basis. I am sorry. I am sorry. U.S. contribution, that was for sales. So we benefited in overall consolidated sales because of Nordco by 2.1 percentage points. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. You may now go ahead. \nRob Wertheimer : Thank you. Thanks for the commentary on cost and inflation and how it cycles through the balance sheet and P&L. I mean, also the gross margin was really good. So I am just wondering if there is anything else to call out in fact in the mix factors John that you already talked about on gross margin. And then just for clarification, with the price escalators and actions you are talking, do those coincide with \u2013 when that comes through or do we have a quarter, quarter two or whatever? And then we get back to the more positive dynamic. \nJohn Olin: Great, Rob. In terms of freight margin, yes, I \u2013 certainly mix was a driver, but the productivity and the synergy that the organization is spinning out is absolutely building our margins in those areas. Again, we talked about the synergy piece in achieving the overall synergies a year early. We are seeing some of our actual delivery of that flows through the P&L in the third quarter as well as on the entire organization focused on productivity and integrating these companies continues to drive strong productivity. And again, that\u2019s partially offset by escalating cost. So, let\u2019s talk a little bit more about that. We know that the costs are up $15 million to $20 million in the third quarter. We know that that\u2019s going to grow into the fourth quarter. And when we look at how we are going to cover that as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is we will do it through a series of price escalations, pricing and price surcharges, as well as a lot ahead of work on accelerating productivity and kind of pushing of these cost increases as best we can. But to your question, let\u2019s talk a little bit about the price escalators. Again, over half the company\u2019s revenue is tied up, I mean, locked into long-term contracts. So we\u2019ve got built-in protection for a situation as we are experiencing now. There is not a lot \u2013 there is nothing that we have to do what\u2019s already pre-determined for us on how these costs will be covered. So, the question is, yes there tend to be a lag. Various contracts have different start days. Some are monthly and those adjust every month, quarterly and annual. So that we would expect over the next couple quarters that we would continue to build up the revenue side of this cost equation and track to be price cost neutral to positive as we go forward. The other piece of it is aside from the escalator. So a little bit less than half of the overall cost increases are being dealt with pricing and price surcharges.  This is all been factored into the guidance which we talked about the 50 point increase, 50 basis point increase in margins. And again, we are absorbing some of these costs. It\u2019s still hitting the guidance that we previously put out there. \nRob Wertheimer : Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead. \nCourtney Yakavonis: Great. Thanks, guys. If we could just maybe just follow-up on the comments about price escalations. Just to be clear, those will \u2013 are exposed to the commodities that you specifically called out, John. Steel, aluminum, copper and then, if we see those prices eventually would track to the price escalations stay or would we expect pricing to adjust downward in those contracts as well? \nJohn Olin: Yes. Courtney, it\u2019s a little bit of mix, nobody call them as price escalators because there are also price de-escalators when cost go down. So, again, these are long-term contracts could be many, many years long. So all of this is prescribed and yes they do cover all those commodities, as well as labor and transportation costs. So, we feel very good about where we are sitting in that part of the cost structure that\u2019s backed up by those long-term contracts. \nRafael Santana: Yes, we do have expense with those escalators as we look at over time, the combination of this escalation plus the productivity we drive, I\u2019ll call positive outcomes. So that I want to tell you that. \nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just going back to some of the longer term wins that you called out this quarter, Rafael, between the mods, the cost one service agreement, Trip Optimizer, can you just help - international loco, can you just frame out when you would expect with the timeframe of those orders apply to and when we could expect deliveries on them? And I don\u2019t think you called out any incremental zero, zero, but just give us an update on whether you are making traction on that product line as well. \nRafael Santana: Well, we are making progress. So I will start there. Expect some continued announcement here as we drive convertibility. We expect, especially when you think of the OE side, some of those might hit us more on the 2023 than the 2022 timeframe. But that\u2019s why I told you about the 2022, 2023 positive dynamics in terms of what we see out there in terms of revenue growth. So, with that and considering the dynamics, we still have in North America. We see the opportunity here to drive profitable growth in the 2022, 2023 timeframe despite still looking at, well, deliveries for North America locomotives still at zero, which is the same that we had this year. \nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, just lastly one more follow-up on the supply chain. It did sound like the $15 million to $20 million cost that you called out. Was that a gross number or a net number? It sounded like that was mostly for logistics and I am just wondering should that not covered under any of those escalations. So we should think about those costs are been kind of more substantial and harder to price out. Is that correct? \nRafael Santana: Yes. Good question, Courtney. The $15 million to $20 million of higher cost is a gross number. And again, when we look at a net number, we are triggering some of those price escalators in the quarter and we also got some flow arrangements where they get priced automatically and again the team is looking at surcharges and what not. If we take the other side of this equation which is the revenue piece of this, it is about little over half of the $15 million to $20 million. So we are covering about half of that through these mechanisms. And again, we are on our way to price neutrality to positive and we would expect that in the next couple of quarters that we will have some margin compression as we kind of deal with the lag of mainly the long-term contracts that have price escalators in it. \nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay. Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may now go ahead. \nIvan Yi: Good morning. This is Ivan Yi on for Scott Group. First I want to go back to the gross margins. Gross margins of 37% were higher than we\u2019ve seen in some time. Is that level sustainable? Or how much would you expect that to tick down given the escalating cost that you mentioned? Thank you. \nRafael Santana: So, first, I think you will continue to see variation quarter-over-quarter on margins and sales and I think for reasons we described before, which can include timing of projects and input mix, under absorption. So I will stay away from what we are really bidding us down on any specific results in an any given quarter. I think the overall commitment which John spoke to is despite of this pressure as we talked to you on previous earnings, the commitment is there despite a higher risk to drive 50 basis points of improvements for the year and despite of the pressure on margins moving forward the team is continuing to work on really offsetting those with some of the mechanisms we described that they are certainly elements of looking at alternative sourcing that the team is looking at it and we certainly got the elements of also austerity on costs that we can add to the elements of pricing and the other things that John described. \nIvan Yi: Thank you. And then, I know you are not providing 2022 guidance, but can you provide some additional initial color on next year? Do you expect a recovery in the North American local market with railcars? So I guess, what end-markets kind of feel best and what end-markets feel worst? Thank you. \nRafael Santana: I\u2019d start with overall, especially when I look in the 2022, 2023 timeframe. I think we see overall positivism. It\u2019s certainly I think even more positive when I think about the elements of international. I talked a little bit earlier about zero locomotives in North America. I think ultimately, even when you think about the 2022, 2023 timeframe the net impact of absorption, I think certainly lessen as we first, I mean, there is a lap or the impact of 2021 which is just a repeat of no locomotives this year. And we see the opportunity here to outrage what I will call increased volume across, literally more optimized cost structure as a result of the synergies and the cost actions that the team has driven. So, despite of this margin pressure, we continue on our commitment here to drive profitable growth for the longer term for the business. \nIvan Yi: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may now go ahead. \nSteve Barger : Hi, good morning. I know we are early in the process for the seven megawatt battery electric locomotives. But can you talk about how this changes? How customers are talking about equipment acquisition in coming years? Does this increase mods and decrease OE to some extent while customers wait for this? Or how are they talking to you about it? \nRafael Santana: I think customers wait for this. I think that some of the things that we announced here on the quarter it\u2019s really us continue to build momentum in battery electric solutions. And this was customers really around the world. So I think the importance of this is really we do expect and we told about it on building what I\u2019ll call is solid baseline demand that actually helps us accelerate the introduction of this technology which builds up on the long-term profitable growth for the business. So there is a not a way to show lot more in terms of our discussion on how to best integrate that into their operations through some discussions that happen along the lines of applying that into specific corridors where they are able to have that dedicated fleet and that\u2019s some of this premise is out. And I think what\u2019s important to our test, what I will call the invention of this product, this is really about spudding into riding new services and working with customers to accelerate introduction in the areas that it makes sense. \nSteve Barger : And as that starts to roll out, is that positive for mix for you? \nRafael Santana: Yes. We like this product very much. There is positives in terms of how we look at, what we are introducing to keep in minds, we are not just introducing, what I\u2019ll call locomotive, a lot of it\u2019s still goes with that locomotive upfront. So, we like a lot of the dynamics on what that can provide in terms of value for both our customers and ourselves. \nSteve Barger : Got it. And then, John, I know, it\u2019s early to talk about 2022, but do you have a general view on what consolidating \u2013 consolidated incremental margins should like in a modest growth environment or better if you want to drill that into the two segments, how you think about incrementals? \nRafael Santana: You know, Steve, what we are going to do is spend the next three months really refining our plans, absorbing the car shack that we have now and we will back again in about three months and provide a good view as to what we do believe will happen in margins in 2022. But at this point, we feel good as we look forward. \nJohn Olin: We see the opportunity on the 2022, 2023 timeline to drive profitable growth as I had highlighted. In terms of some of the specific segments, I think would then open about it in terms of all the nodes start for our transit business, which is really getting margins to the methane. It should continue to drive margin improvements for our freight businesses as well. \nSteve Barger : Understood. Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. You may now go ahead. \nAllison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. I just want to go back to the digital business specifically. Obviously, component and chip shortages been well documented here. Is there a way to understand what that specific headwind to grow for that product category has been? And then, I guess, Rafael, your comment around, certainly delayed but not failed, how do you expect that to kind of, I guess, if you have any thoughts on when that starts to smooth out for you? Whether it\u2019s based on just the availability of those components? Or it\u2019s kind of things that you are doing to sort of attack that, as well? \nRafael Santana: So, let me start with the second part of your question. When we gave the guidance associated with this year, that certainly implies what I\u2019ll call stronger headwinds than we\u2019ve had in the third quarter when it comes down to supply chain disruptions with that come in a series of actions being taken by the team and really proud to see the progress the team has had. So, I am not going to just state, when those will finish or not, I think this is a very dynamic situation and we are really focused on things that we control and it\u2019s really tied to a cost austerity, continuing to drive productivity, making sure that we are looking at alternative sourcing and that we are acting on pricing. I think those are some of the things that we are focused on. On digital electronics, we \u2013 the dynamics are - I am going to call, moving in the right direction here with the business as I look into the book-to-bill, moving the right side strong opportunity here for us to grow penetration and that we have the opportunity, especially as we evolve some of these technologies. We talked quite a bit about battery electric. It\u2019s really significant opportunity to have a much more interconnected ecosystem and that\u2019s going to drive significant value for our customers. It\u2019s going to drive competitiveness for rail overall. And we can certainly benefit from that. \nAllison Poliniak : Got it. Helpful. And then, John, obviously, these leverage at Wabtec, strong cash performance, would love to get your perspective on capital deployments and where you think the priorities should be at this point?\nJohn Olin: Well, Allison, number one is I would say, I can\u2019t wait to get our owners\u2019 perspective on capital deployment, on the capital structure now. I will be out in the next several talking to a lot of them to get their feedback. The second thought that I have on the topic is what a great problem to have, some of these done a fantastic job of becoming very consistent and delivering a very strong cash conversion ratio and as we look at this quarter, $1 billion of free cash. So, number one is to make sure that we maintain a strong balance sheet, which the company has and continued to strengthen that. The second area, Allison, is to continue invest in the organic side of the business. I\u2019ve been here out seven, eight weeks and I\u2019ve seen a lot of capital requests and the returns are absolutely fantastic on those investments in terms of driving improved profits over that period of time. And then finally is on the remainder of the cash, we will look at M&A and share buybacks no differently. We will prioritize the returns t the shareholders and we will continue the buybacks as we did in the third quarter. So, again a great quarter in terms of share buybacks at a $199 million. And we will apply what makes sense in terms of strategic acquisitions and look to how do we continue to drive the shareholder value of the company forward. \nAllison Poliniak : Perfect. Thank you so much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. You may now go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys. It\u2019s James on for Chris. Wanted to talk about perhaps about brake services revenue. I think does this really show the seasonal step up you might normally expect. Just kind of wonder and expand the puts and takes around that and sort of how we should sort of think about the fourth quarter? Is that\u2019s essentially sort of the baseline to operate off of? Is that some of that pushed out just want to understand the dynamics there? \nRafael Santana: Let me take that, starting with freight services. I mean, revenues are up 13.6% and even if we were to discount the acquisition of Nordco, you would still have seen a sales increase of 6% into the quarter. That\u2019s some of the elements of we could see variation quarter-to-quarter and that stays on timing of projects and mix as well it can play an element there. But this is a business that continues to have, what I\u2019ll call high demand for really the elements of providing reliable power. Unparking of locomotives continue and demand for really modernization, it\u2019s also lot there. And we are continuing to see higher aftermarket demand as some of the fleets get on part. So, right dynamics nothing specific to highlight on the business. \nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Got it. And then, I guess, given the dynamics you highlighted around the unparkings and moving into the fourth quarter and further out, should we start to see essentially sequential improvement off of that? Just like the math of the unparkings would suggest that you guys step up off of what you have in the third quarter there? \nRafael Santana: When I look at the 2022, 2023 timeframe, I think the expectation is that, I mean, when you look, show an opportunity here for growing demand. I\u2019ll stay away from really highlight specifics on going through the early part of next year just based on a lot of the things that we described here through the call. But demand is there. What we\u2019ve seen up to this point is really disruption tied to supply chain and we see the opportunity to continue to drive long-term profitable growth for the business. The team is executing on the strategy and we are confident about our ability to position here the company for that long-term profitable growth. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen. You may now go ahead. \nMatt Elkott : Good morning. Good to see the sequential increase in the total backlog and I think year-over-year both the total backlog and the 12 month backlog increased. But Rafael and John, can you talk about the decrease sequentially in the 12 month backlog? What are the reasons behind it? Are there order deferrals? And specifically on the change of backlog, because I think this is the second quarter in a row that we see a sequential decrease in the 12 months backlog. \nJohn Olin: Sure, Matt. This is John. Matt, as we look at the 12 month backlog, you are right. It is down about a $115 million or a couple percent. And that is driven by transit and there are two things which are driving that reduction. One is about half of it is on foreign exchange. So pick that right off the top. The other piece on \u2013 the other half of it in transit is our exiting some non-profitable contracts. I just remember a couple of quarters ago, the company talked about a UK restructuring and so these are contracts that we are exiting because they weren\u2019t delivering the level of profits that we would expect from our transit organization. So those are the two pieces that explain the bulk of the reduction from the second quarter to the third quarter. But I\u2019d also point out, Matt is when you look on a year-over-year basis, so, a year ago quarter, 12 month back log is actually up very strong. It\u2019s up over 10%. \nRafael Santana: And I will just add, we just went through our strategic planning and as I look at the onus of both transit and the overall franchise we have the option here to drive profitable growth. \nMatt Elkott : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, a question on the \u2013 it\u2019s good to see the locomotive, park locomotives decreased heading in the right direction, but if you listen to at least the couple of the railroads so far their locomotive fleets have declined a bit. So, any thoughts on that, Rafael or John? \nRafael Santana: This is a very dynamic environment. So I am not going to pretend to explain any movements on any specific railroads at this point. But as you look at the dynamics of demand, especially as you go into the 2022, 2023 timeframe, those are largely positive and I think we have the opportunity here to benefit from that. \nMatt Elkott : Got it. And, Rafael, this is a question that I\u2019ve been willing to ask you on the call, but can you just talk about the Trip Optimizer and its interoperability with the competition? Just trying to get a gauge on, if the industry has to head in one direction or another as far as software? \nRafael Santana: I think we have invested in a portfolio of solutions over time. I think despite of the cycles that\u2019s a commitment we have had which is really longer term and I think we have come up with a number of solutions that can benefit, not just our own fleets, but can be taken into serving other fleets. We\u2019ve demonstrated the ability to do that with PTC. And it\u2019s something that we are certainly looking at it. It\u2019s the opportunity to take that into other markets and other products. \nMatt Elkott : Great. Thank you very much. \nRafael Santana: Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes sour question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kristine Kubacki for any closing remarks.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you for your participation everybody. We look forward to meeting with you over the next couple of months and certainly next quarter. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Olin",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you and I am very excited to join the team at Wabtec. It is a historic company with incredible talent, deep innovation, and best-in-class differentiated technologies that is well positioned to deliver the future of rail, whilst growing shareholder value. And I look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. Now turning to Slide 8, before getting into the financials, we would like to discuss the dynamic cost environment and supply chain challenges that we face. During the third quarter, we experienced delays in production and deliveries of our products as well as significant increases in many key input costs.  On the revenue side, we are experiencing adverse impacts to our sales results due to shortages across many component parts, including computer chips, which are causing delays in production and customer delivery. We believe that our enterprise revenues were 2% to 3% lower than they would have been without the supply chain disruptions and that the majority of these lower revenues represent delayed sales, not lost sales.  The impacts to Wabtec's cost structure come in four areas. First, commodity inflation where markets year-over-year are up more than 200% for steel, 94% for aluminum and roughly 40% for copper. The second area of impact is elevated freight and logistics cost, which in many cases are up over 3 to 4 times from pre-COVID levels.  Third is wage inflation and labor availability, which are adversely impacting the business. And finally, we are experiencing lost manufacturing efficiencies largely due to component and chip shortages. Our costs have increased during the quarter and have impacted both our freight and transit segments. We estimate that cost increases in the third quarter are in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Having said that, we expect these inwards to intensify as the full cost of rising metals and lower manufacturing efficiencies work their way through our inventories and purchase contracts. We anticipate cost to continue to increase over the next few quarters. Our team is working hard to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures and supply chain disruptions by, triggering price escalation causes that are included in many of our long-term contracts, implementing price surcharges, driving operational productivity and lean initiatives and finally through higher realization of synergies.  Turning to Slide 9, I will review our third quarter results in more detail. We had good operational and financial performance during the quarter. Sales for the third quarter were $1.91 billion, which reflects a 2.2% increase versus the prior year. Sales were positively impacted by the continued broad based recovery we are experiencing across much of our portfolio, the acquisition of Nordco and favorable currency exchange, partially offset by continued weakness in the North America OE locomotive market and lower year-over-year sales and transit.  For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $325 million, which was up 10.6% versus the prior year. Most notably, we delivered margin expansion in both our segments up 1.3 percentage points on a consolidated basis. Margins were aided by strong mix favorability, improved productivity and better than expected realization of synergies.  As Rafael stated, during the quarter, we achieved our goal of $250 million of synergy runrate, a significant milestone delivered a full year earlier than originally forecasted. What makes this quarter's margin expansion even more impressive is the fact that our margin gains were achieved in the phase of an incredibly dynamic supply chain and inflationary environment.  Looking at some of the detailed line items for the third quarter, adjusted SG&A was $257 million, which was up $16.1 million from the prior year due to the normalization of certain expenses, higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs and the acquisition of Nordco.  For the full year, we expect SG&A to be above 12.25% of sales, adjusted SG&A excludes $12 million of restructuring and transition expenses, of which most was allocated to further optimize our European footprint.  Engineering expense increased from last year. We continue to invest engineering resources in current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing on the future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve safety, productivity and capacity utilization. Our 2021 investment in technology, which includes engineering expense remains at 6% to 7% of sales.  Amortization expense was $72.5 million and our adjusted effective tax rate during the quarter was 24.8% bringing our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate to 25.8%. For the full year, we still expect to have an effective tax rate of about 26% excluding discrete items.  In the third quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.69 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.14, up 20% versus prior year. We are pleased with our Q3 results, in particular, our sales growth in the phase of supply chain disruptions, our margin growth in the phase of sharp cost increases, we remain diligent and proactive as we work to minimize these challenges.  Now let's take a look at segment results on Slide 10 starting with the freight segment. Across the freight segment, total sales increased 4.7% from last year to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by continued strong growth in our services and component businesses. In terms of product lines, equipment sales were down 5.7% year-over-year due to fewer locomotive deliveries this quarter versus last year and no new locomotive deliveries in North America, partially offset by strong mining sales. This year-over-year performance demonstrates the resiliency of our equipment portfolio.  In line with that improved outlook for rail, our services sales grew a robust 13.6% versus last year. The year-over-year sales increase was largely driven by higher aftermarket sales from our customers modernizing their fleets, the unparking of locomotives and the acquisition of Nordco. The performance, reliability, and availability of our fleet continues to drive customer demand as railroads increasingly look for predictable outcomes across their fleet. Excluding Nordco, organic sales for the third quarter were up 6.1%.  Digital electronics sales were down 3.6% year-over-year driven by delays in purchase decisions, due to economic and cost uncertainties as well as chip shortages. We continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers globally focused on safety, improved productivity, increased capacity and utilization . Component sales continued to show recovery, and were up 6.7% year-over-year driven by demand for railcar components and recovery in industrial end-markets. We remain encouraged by the continuing trend of railcars coming out of storage, higher order rates for new railcars and accelerated recovery across industrial end-markets.  Shifting to operating income for this segment. Freight segment adjusted operating income was $266 million, for an adjusted margin of 20.6%, up 1.7 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefit of higher volumes, improved mix across our portfolio and increased synergies and productivity were partially offset by significantly higher input costs.  Finally, segment backlog was $18.2 billion, up $375 million from the prior quarter on the broad multi-year order momentum that Rafael discussed across the segment.  Turning to Slide 11. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 2.5% year-over-year to $612 million. Sales were down versus last year due in large part to supply chain issues and COVID-related disruptions. This was partially offset by positive ridership trends. Excluding near-term supply chain challenges, we estimate that Transit sales would have been up slightly on a year-over-year basis.  We believe the medium and long-term outlook for this segment remains positive as infrastructure spending for Green initiatives continues. Adjusted segment operating income was $77 million, which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 12.5%, up 50 basis points versus the prior year. Across the segment, we continued to drive down cost and improve project execution despite the volatile cost environment. For the year, we remain committed to deliver about a 100 basis points of margin improvement for the segment and the team continues to take aggressive action to mitigate rising cost and supply chain disruption, which will pressure the pace of near-term margin improvement. As we execute in the fourth quarter, we expect significantly improve operating margin driven by strong productivity gains, improved project mix and more favorable comps versus the prior year's fourth quarter. Finally, transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.6 billion which was flat with the prior quarter after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange.  Now let's turn to our financial position on slide 12. We had another strong quarter of cash generation. We generated $244 million of operating cash flow during the quarter, bringing year-to-date cash flow generated to over $759 million. This performance clearly demonstrates the quality of our business portfolio.  During the quarter total CapEx was $23 million bringing year-to-date CapEx to $78.5 million. In 2021, we now expect CapEx to be approximately $120 million. This is $20 million lower than our previous guidance as the team judiciously manages every dollar of spend.  Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.6 times and our liquidity is robust at $1.62 billion. Also during the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders repurchasing $199 million of shares. As you can see in these results, our balance sheet continues to strengthen and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash generation giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital towards the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Rafael. Thank you. Hi, Justin, this is John. Justin, with regards to the sequential and also year-over-year, the margin gains were about the same. Year-over-year, 1.7 points, on a sequential basis, 2.1 points. The driver of that in the freight organization is really the mix between the groups and mix within the groups. And when you look between the group, we had services which has got higher than average margin up 13.6% and in transit and equipment down anywhere between 2.5% and 5.7%. So that's really the driver of both the sequential and the year-over-year margin improvement.  With regards to the cost side of the question, we talked about the $15 million to $20 million and that's Justin, what has actually flown through the P&L. And so just to make sure that we are all straight, the largest of the predominance of that cost that we are seeing on the front end is towards freight and I am sorry, yes, freight and logistics cost. Those don't flow through inventory and they hit us upfront. So the predominance of the $15 million to $20 million is in freight cost. The other piece of it is the materials rising as everyone knows has risen a lot as well as manufacturing inefficiencies. Now those get inventoried in the flow through inventory and they'll be released in the future as those products are sold. If we look at what's on the balance sheet, that's at about the same amount that we saw pass through on the P&L in the third quarter. So there is another $15 million to $20 million on the balance sheet that will come and that's what we talked about in the prepared remarks is that we would expect cost to rise in the fourth quarter and the next few quarters. Thanks. Thank you. Great, Rob. In terms of freight margin, yes, I \u2013 certainly mix was a driver, but the productivity and the synergy that the organization is spinning out is absolutely building our margins in those areas. Again, we talked about the synergy piece in achieving the overall synergies a year early. We are seeing some of our actual delivery of that flows through the P&L in the third quarter as well as on the entire organization focused on productivity and integrating these companies continues to drive strong productivity. And again, that's partially offset by escalating cost. So, let's talk a little bit more about that. We know that the costs are up $15 million to $20 million in the third quarter. We know that that's going to grow into the fourth quarter. And when we look at how we are going to cover that as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is we will do it through a series of price escalations, pricing and price surcharges, as well as a lot ahead of work on accelerating productivity and kind of pushing of these cost increases as best we can. But to your question, let's talk a little bit about the price escalators. Again, over half the company's revenue is tied up, I mean, locked into long-term contracts. So we've got built-in protection for a situation as we are experiencing now. There is not a lot \u2013 there is nothing that we have to do what's already pre-determined for us on how these costs will be covered. So, the question is, yes there tend to be a lag. Various contracts have different start days. Some are monthly and those adjust every month, quarterly and annual. So that we would expect over the next couple quarters that we would continue to build up the revenue side of this cost equation and track to be price cost neutral to positive as we go forward. The other piece of it is aside from the escalator. So a little bit less than half of the overall cost increases are being dealt with pricing and price surcharges.  This is all been factored into the guidance which we talked about the 50 point increase, 50 basis point increase in margins. And again, we are absorbing some of these costs. It's still hitting the guidance that we previously put out there. Yes. Courtney, it's a little bit of mix, nobody call them as price escalators because there are also price de-escalators when cost go down. So, again, these are long-term contracts could be many, many years long. So all of this is prescribed and yes they do cover all those commodities, as well as labor and transportation costs. So, we feel very good about where we are sitting in that part of the cost structure that's backed up by those long-term contracts. We see the opportunity on the 2022, 2023 timeline to drive profitable growth as I had highlighted. In terms of some of the specific segments, I think would then open about it in terms of all the nodes start for our transit business, which is really getting margins to the methane. It should continue to drive margin improvements for our freight businesses as well. Well, Allison, number one is I would say, I can't wait to get our owners' perspective on capital deployment, on the capital structure now. I will be out in the next several talking to a lot of them to get their feedback. The second thought that I have on the topic is what a great problem to have, some of these done a fantastic job of becoming very consistent and delivering a very strong cash conversion ratio and as we look at this quarter, $1 billion of free cash. So, number one is to make sure that we maintain a strong balance sheet, which the company has and continued to strengthen that. The second area, Allison, is to continue invest in the organic side of the business. I've been here out seven, eight weeks and I've seen a lot of capital requests and the returns are absolutely fantastic on those investments in terms of driving improved profits over that period of time. And then finally is on the remainder of the cash, we will look at M&A and share buybacks no differently. We will prioritize the returns t the shareholders and we will continue the buybacks as we did in the third quarter. So, again a great quarter in terms of share buybacks at a $199 million. And we will apply what makes sense in terms of strategic acquisitions and look to how do we continue to drive the shareholder value of the company forward. Sure, Matt. This is John. Matt, as we look at the 12 month backlog, you are right. It is down about a $115 million or a couple percent. And that is driven by transit and there are two things which are driving that reduction. One is about half of it is on foreign exchange. So pick that right off the top. The other piece on \u2013 the other half of it in transit is our exiting some non-profitable contracts. I just remember a couple of quarters ago, the company talked about a UK restructuring and so these are contracts that we are exiting because they weren't delivering the level of profits that we would expect from our transit organization. So those are the two pieces that explain the bulk of the reduction from the second quarter to the third quarter. But I'd also point out, Matt is when you look on a year-over-year basis, so, a year ago quarter, 12 month back log is actually up very strong. It's up over 10%."

            "name": "Rafael Santana",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristine, and good morning everyone. Joining me today is our new Chief Financial Officer, John Olin. John is a well respected leader with broad operational and financial experience. He is already bringing a great perspective to our business and long-term strategy with a clear focus on growing shareholder value. We are thrilled to have him on the team.  I also want to take a moment to thank Pat Dugan for his nearly 20 years of service to Wabtec. We are grateful for all that he has contributed to the company.  With that, let's turn to Slide 4. I will start with an update on our business, my perspective on the quarter and our long-term value framework and then, John will cover the financials. Overall, we made significant progress against our strategy and delivered a strong third quarter as noted by our sales growth, adjusted margins and adjusted earnings per share, each of which were up year-over-year.  Total sales for the quarter were $1.9 billion, driven by growing demand in freight services and components, but offset by continued weakness in the North America OEM market. Adjusted operating margin was 17%, driven by strong mix and productivity, ongoing lean initiatives, and cost actions. Total cash flow from operations was $244 million. This takes year-to-date cash from operations to $759 million versus $458 million a year ago. This is a solid illustration of how the team is driving good operational performance. Cash conversion for the year is at a 103%.  Finally, we ended third quarter with adjusted EPS of $1.14, up 20% year-over-year. Today, we are also pleased to share that we have achieved our $250 million synergy runrate of full year earlier than expected at the time of the GE Transportation acquisition. We have consolidated and optimized our operations, reduced costs to drive stronger profitability, accelerated lean across the enterprise, and created additional capabilities in best cost countries.  We are already feeling the benefit of these efforts, which will continue to improve our competitiveness. So overall, really strong execution by the team as we continue to deliver on our long-term strategy.  Shifting our focus to Slide 5, let's talk about our end-market conditions in more detail. Internationally, freight activity continued to improve in the third quarter across our major markets and our order pipeline remains strong. We expect long-term revenue growth in Russia, CIS, Brazil, Africa, Asia and then Australia.  Freight trends in North America weakened slightly year-over-year in the third quarter, not driven by lack of demand but by global supply chain disruption that has impacted intermodal volumes and our production. Consumer and industrial activity continued to spur volume growth in chemicals, metals and materials.  Locomotive parkings continued to decline despite weaker freight traffic in the quarter. We expect demand for reliability, productivity and fuel efficiencies to continue to increase placing our services business in a position of strength. When it comes to the North America railcar builds, demand for railcars is improving. About 21% of the North America railcar fleet remains in storage, a slight improvement from the previous quarter and in line with pre-COVID levels.  As a result, industry orders for new railcars are starting to improve. We forecast the railcar build this year will be in the neighborhood of 30,000 cars.  Transitioning to the transit sector, ridership remains a bit uneven in some markets. However, infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue to be a bright spot, especially as governments globally churn to rail for clean, safe, and efficient transportation. Overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remains strong. Shifting to Slide 6, we are developing innovative solutions that address the main cost drivers for our customers, including fuel efficiency and increased velocity in the transportation sector. Our commitment to succeed in these efforts is underscored by our focus on continuing to position rail transportation as the safest and most sustainable way to move freight and people over land.  Today, we have the capability and expertise to transition diesel-powered locomotives to battery power and drastically reduce emissions as we are going with our FLX drive locomotive. We expect to extend this technology farther to hydrogen fuel cells and help lead the industry to a zero emission rail network of the future. And we are not stopping there. We have extended battery technology to other areas of our business as well. And we are driving cellular technology breakthroughs to boost transit efficiency and reduce emissions and \u2013 An example of this is our Green Friction technology, which drastically reduces brake emissions by up to 90%, an incredible milestone in significantly improving the quality of air in our metros. We are also leading the change to create a safer and more efficient rail network.  A great example of this and a solution of growing interest among class one customers is Trip Optimizers zero to zero. These advanced technologies allows an operator to autonomously start a train from zero miles per hour and stop it using software integrated with positive train control. It builds on Trip Optimizer's proven performance, which have saved railroads more than 400 million gallons of fuel since its inception and reduces emissions by over 500,000 tons per year.  Looking forward, we will continue to advance efforts towards cleaner, more energy efficient transport and will share our progress on this front as well as our broader environmental, social and governance priorities in our next sustainability report, which will be released in a couple weeks.  Next, let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss how our next gen technology is helping us win in the market by covering a few recent business highlights. In the third quarter, we secured new orders for our FLX drive locomotives. We also closed a significant order for international locomotive test and won additional contracts in Asia to help our customers improve asset utilization and reduce emissions.  In freight services, we won a significant long-term service contract as well as an order for a 100 locomotive modernizations in North America. Overall, mod backlog remains strong and we are showing good momentum on deliveries.  Finally, in transits, we won new power collection, HVACs and service contracts in Germany, Switzerland and the UK. Looking ahead, we are confident Wabtec will continue to capture growth with innovative and scalable technologies that addressed our customers' most pressing needs. We also will continue to control what we can and leverage the strength to combat the current challenges that we are facing due to supply chain disruptions increasing metal and commodity costs and labor shortages.  This dynamic have adversely impacted our third quarter results and have resulted in significant cost increases. Across the board, our team is working hard to mitigate the impacts of these pressures by triggering price escalations and surcharges as well as driving operational efficiencies wherever we can. We anticipate that cost will continue to increase over the next few quarters and we will continue to aggressively manage these challenges.  I will turn the call over John now to discuss this in more detail, as well as review the quarter, segment performance and our overall financial position. John? Thanks, John. Let's flip to Slide 13 to discuss our updated 2021 financial guidance. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and the end-market momentum remains strong. As John indicated, we do expect continued headwinds from a more challenging sales and cost environment into the fourth quarter.  Taking into consideration this market backdrop and volatile cost environment, combined with our solid performance in the first three quarters, we are narrowing our full year revenue and earnings per share guidance. We expect sales of $7.9 billion to $8.05 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $4.20 and $4.30 per share. We expect cash flow conversion to remain greater than 90% resulting in strong cash generation of about $1 billion for the full year.  Now, let's turn to our final slide. Everything we outlined today reinforces that we have a clear strategy to accelerate long-term profitable growth. That strategy is built on our extensive installed base and deep industry expertise grounded in innovation, breakthrough initiatives and scalable technologies that drive value for our customers and accelerated by our lean continuous improvement culture and disciplined capital allocation.  I am proud of the strong execution by the team in the third quarter despite a challenging supply chain, cost, and market environment. You are seeing their efforts in the strength of the company and our financial results. As we go forward, the rail sector is well positioned to increase share and address the critical issues facing the world's freight and logistics sector.  We will continue to lean into the strong fundamentals of this industry and our company to deliver long-term profitable growth. As we said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose to move and improve the world.  After demonstrating strong performance in the first three quarters of 2021, I am confident that this company will continue to deliver and lead the transition to a more sustainable future.  With that, I will turn the call back over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine? Good morning, Justin. So, let me start there, Justin. I'll start with the pipeline of deals that continues to strengthen. I mean, when you look at the impact on the quarter, it's really tied to supply chain disruption. If anything versus last time we thought, I'd say, we have a stronger pipeline. If you think about the 12 month backlog, it's up double-digit versus a year ago. This is the highest backlog we had since what, fourth quarter 2019.  And this is a pipeline we continue to work on convertibility here. I think commodity demand remains overall strong for both agriculture and mining. In North America, even in the quarter demand for services and supports for both fuel savings and reliability remains strong. Locomotives are running harder. Demand for freight car is on the rise from the forecast we had earlier in the year. And I think most important we also continue to build momentum on the battery electric solution with customers around the world.  So, this is not a question around demand. I think the adjustment we judged in the guidance for the year reflects some of that disruption including going into the fourth quarter which is reflected in guidance we provided. Thank you. Hi, Jerry. Yes. Jerry, so first, we do see, I mean, development in that business coming to this year. I think demand is still out there on this. When we think about growth, I think a lot of the elements of growth here for the mods business is more international. I think it remains so robust part of the solution for our customers in North America and justified very much with the announcement we made, but you kind of see us talking about some announcements around off shoring internationally for mod. So that's where I think a larger part of that opportunity is. I think a lot of those customers are actually benefiting from that, Jerry. So it's very much connected to it in terms of the opportunities present to grow volume. A lot of it's demand around both the elements of mining, but also the elements of the agri business. And those remain robust and the forecast that's positive as we look around the world going back very much my remarks. It's not a function of a single geography. We are really seeing a pickup on different geographies. And Jerry, to give more color to it, so number of customer we view is when we get multiyear contracts. So those already call it, provide them some visibility in terms of cost escalations to that process and I mean, we've been with a lot of and most of these customers we had a longstanding relationship. So, we've gone through times like this. Sure. Well, first, I think it's markets to where we continue to see good momentum. So, when I think about the 2022, 2023 timeframe, I think we see a positive momentum. It's all around the convertibility of this pipeline into orders and again, as I described it touches different geographies and different elements of that. So, we do expect growth associated to that when we go to the 2022, 2023 timeframe. With regards to guidance into 2022, it's kind of early stages for us to really be discussing guidance at this point. But favorable demand in the 2022, 2023 timeframe. I'll start with number one efficiency, productivity, safety, those continue to be imperatives for our customers. We continue to see a strong commitment from them. Book-to-bill is above one year-to-date. We had some strong quarters looking back in terms of some of the multiyear orders and I think internationally we are keeping expanding our penetration. One of the products I think I've talked about it before is PTC. Still be an opportunity to that is when I think about outside of the U.S. as big as the U.S. opportunity, we've started to execute now in PTC through three different countries outside of the U.S. Now, those are opportunities that it takes some time in terms of working those through. In a lot of cases we are doing also with governments on adopting it. But a very good positive progress up to this point. And I think we have significant room to grow in terms of helping customers hear with both the elements of driving productivity and decarbonization, which touches directly these products. So it's going to go with automation and fuel savings at the end of the day. 2.1 percentage points on an enterprise-wide basis. I am sorry. I am sorry. U.S. contribution, that was for sales. So we benefited in overall consolidated sales because of Nordco by 2.1 percentage points. Yes, we do have expense with those escalators as we look at over time, the combination of this escalation plus the productivity we drive, I'll call positive outcomes. So that I want to tell you that. Well, we are making progress. So I will start there. Expect some continued announcement here as we drive convertibility. We expect, especially when you think of the OE side, some of those might hit us more on the 2023 than the 2022 timeframe. But that's why I told you about the 2022, 2023 positive dynamics in terms of what we see out there in terms of revenue growth. So, with that and considering the dynamics, we still have in North America. We see the opportunity here to drive profitable growth in the 2022, 2023 timeframe despite still looking at, well, deliveries for North America locomotives still at zero, which is the same that we had this year. Yes. Good question, Courtney. The $15 million to $20 million of higher cost is a gross number. And again, when we look at a net number, we are triggering some of those price escalators in the quarter and we also got some flow arrangements where they get priced automatically and again the team is looking at surcharges and what not. If we take the other side of this equation which is the revenue piece of this, it is about little over half of the $15 million to $20 million. So we are covering about half of that through these mechanisms. And again, we are on our way to price neutrality to positive and we would expect that in the next couple of quarters that we will have some margin compression as we kind of deal with the lag of mainly the long-term contracts that have price escalators in it. So, first, I think you will continue to see variation quarter-over-quarter on margins and sales and I think for reasons we described before, which can include timing of projects and input mix, under absorption. So I will stay away from what we are really bidding us down on any specific results in an any given quarter. I think the overall commitment which John spoke to is despite of this pressure as we talked to you on previous earnings, the commitment is there despite a higher risk to drive 50 basis points of improvements for the year and despite of the pressure on margins moving forward the team is continuing to work on really offsetting those with some of the mechanisms we described that they are certainly elements of looking at alternative sourcing that the team is looking at it and we certainly got the elements of also austerity on costs that we can add to the elements of pricing and the other things that John described. I'd start with overall, especially when I look in the 2022, 2023 timeframe. I think we see overall positivism. It's certainly I think even more positive when I think about the elements of international. I talked a little bit earlier about zero locomotives in North America. I think ultimately, even when you think about the 2022, 2023 timeframe the net impact of absorption, I think certainly lessen as we first, I mean, there is a lap or the impact of 2021 which is just a repeat of no locomotives this year. And we see the opportunity here to outrage what I will call increased volume across, literally more optimized cost structure as a result of the synergies and the cost actions that the team has driven. So, despite of this margin pressure, we continue on our commitment here to drive profitable growth for the longer term for the business. I think customers wait for this. I think that some of the things that we announced here on the quarter it's really us continue to build momentum in battery electric solutions. And this was customers really around the world. So I think the importance of this is really we do expect and we told about it on building what I'll call is solid baseline demand that actually helps us accelerate the introduction of this technology which builds up on the long-term profitable growth for the business. So there is a not a way to show lot more in terms of our discussion on how to best integrate that into their operations through some discussions that happen along the lines of applying that into specific corridors where they are able to have that dedicated fleet and that's some of this premise is out. And I think what's important to our test, what I will call the invention of this product, this is really about spudding into riding new services and working with customers to accelerate introduction in the areas that it makes sense. Yes. We like this product very much. There is positives in terms of how we look at, what we are introducing to keep in minds, we are not just introducing, what I'll call locomotive, a lot of it's still goes with that locomotive upfront. So, we like a lot of the dynamics on what that can provide in terms of value for both our customers and ourselves. You know, Steve, what we are going to do is spend the next three months really refining our plans, absorbing the car shack that we have now and we will back again in about three months and provide a good view as to what we do believe will happen in margins in 2022. But at this point, we feel good as we look forward. So, let me start with the second part of your question. When we gave the guidance associated with this year, that certainly implies what I'll call stronger headwinds than we've had in the third quarter when it comes down to supply chain disruptions with that come in a series of actions being taken by the team and really proud to see the progress the team has had. So, I am not going to just state, when those will finish or not, I think this is a very dynamic situation and we are really focused on things that we control and it's really tied to a cost austerity, continuing to drive productivity, making sure that we are looking at alternative sourcing and that we are acting on pricing. I think those are some of the things that we are focused on. On digital electronics, we \u2013 the dynamics are - I am going to call, moving in the right direction here with the business as I look into the book-to-bill, moving the right side strong opportunity here for us to grow penetration and that we have the opportunity, especially as we evolve some of these technologies. We talked quite a bit about battery electric. It's really significant opportunity to have a much more interconnected ecosystem and that's going to drive significant value for our customers. It's going to drive competitiveness for rail overall. And we can certainly benefit from that. Let me take that, starting with freight services. I mean, revenues are up 13.6% and even if we were to discount the acquisition of Nordco, you would still have seen a sales increase of 6% into the quarter. That's some of the elements of we could see variation quarter-to-quarter and that stays on timing of projects and mix as well it can play an element there. But this is a business that continues to have, what I'll call high demand for really the elements of providing reliable power. Unparking of locomotives continue and demand for really modernization, it's also lot there. And we are continuing to see higher aftermarket demand as some of the fleets get on part. So, right dynamics nothing specific to highlight on the business. When I look at the 2022, 2023 timeframe, I think the expectation is that, I mean, when you look, show an opportunity here for growing demand. I'll stay away from really highlight specifics on going through the early part of next year just based on a lot of the things that we described here through the call. But demand is there. What we've seen up to this point is really disruption tied to supply chain and we see the opportunity to continue to drive long-term profitable growth for the business. The team is executing on the strategy and we are confident about our ability to position here the company for that long-term profitable growth. And I will just add, we just went through our strategic planning and as I look at the onus of both transit and the overall franchise we have the option here to drive profitable growth. This is a very dynamic environment. So I am not going to pretend to explain any movements on any specific railroads at this point. But as you look at the dynamics of demand, especially as you go into the 2022, 2023 timeframe, those are largely positive and I think we have the opportunity here to benefit from that. I think we have invested in a portfolio of solutions over time. I think despite of the cycles that's a commitment we have had which is really longer term and I think we have come up with a number of solutions that can benefit, not just our own fleets, but can be taken into serving other fleets. We've demonstrated the ability to do that with PTC. And it's something that we are certainly looking at it. It's the opportunity to take that into other markets and other products. Thank you."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to Wabtec's second quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With us today are President and CEO Rafael Santana, CFO Pat Dugan, Chief Technology Officer, Eric Gebhardt and Senior VP of Finance, John Mastalerz. Today's slide presentation along with our earnings release, financial disclosures were posted on our website earlier today, and they can be accessed on our Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Some statements we're making today are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements, please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics, and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. I will now turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kristine, and good morning everyone. Let's begin on slide 4. We delivered a strong second quarter as noted by our sales growth, adjusted margin and adjusted earnings per share, each of which were up sequentially and year-over-year. Total sales for the quarter were $2 billion driven by growing demand in freight services, components and transit, but offset by weakness in the North America OEM market. Adjusted operating margin was 15.2% driven by ongoing lean initiatives, cost actions and the realization of synergies. Total cash flow from operations was $223 million. This takes the year-to-date cash from operations to $515 million versus $229 million a year ago. It's a solid illustration of how the team is driving good operational performance and focused working capital management. Cash conversion for the year is over 100%. Our year-to-date book-to-bill continues to be a positive story. We ended the first half of the year, greater than one and we have a strong order pipeline for international locomotives. Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $21.5 billion providing strong visibility into 2021 and beyond. Finally, we ended second quarter with adjusted EPS of $1.06, up 22% year-over-year. In the area of synergies we are on track to achieve our full run rate of $250 million this year and we are feeling the benefits of our footprint consolidation and aggressive actions on structural costs. So overall, really strong execution by the team as we continue to deliver on our long-term strategy. I am confident that with strong execution, focused cost measures, our team's drive on productivity and continued improvements in our end markets, we will continue to deliver long-term profitable growth. Now let's turn in to slide 5. To discuss a few of our recent business highlights starting with our strategic partnership we recently announced with CSX.\nPat Dugan: Thanks, Rafael, and good morning everyone. We had solid operational and financial performance during the quarter. As markets continue to gradually recover, we demonstrated our ability to deliver on synergies to generate strong cash flow and to invest in the future and position Wabtec for profitable growth. Turning to Slide 6. I'll review the second quarter in more detail. Sales for the second quarter were $2 billion, which reflects a 16% increase versus the prior year, driven by a broad based recovery across our portfolio offset somewhat by lower North America OE freight markets. For the quarter, operating income was $203 million and adjusted operating income was $306 million, which was up 17% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income excluded pre-tax expenses of $103 million of which $73 million was for non-cash amortization and $30 million for restructuring of which the majority was for our UK operations and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Nordco. Adjusted operating margin was 10 basis points higher than the second quarter last year and up from the first quarter. Versus last year, adjusted operating margin benefited from higher sales and the realization of synergies. Now, looking at some of the detailed line items for the second quarter, adjusted SG&A was $254 million which was 12.6% of sales. This was up from last year due to the normalization of certain expenses compared to the temporary cost actions taken during the depth of the pandemic, a year ago. Adjusted SG&A excludes $9 million of restructuring and transaction expenses. For the full year, we expect adjusted SG&A to be about 12% of sales. We will continue to aggressively manage headcount and structural costs. Engineering expense increased from last year. This was largely due to higher volume outlook for the year. Overall, our investment in technology is still expected to be about 6% to 7% of sales. Amortization expense was $73 million. For 2021 we expect non-cash amortization expense to be about $290 million and depreciation expense of about $205 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate during the quarter was 25.3%, bringing our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate to be about 26.3%. For the full year we still expect an effective tax rate of about 26%. In the second quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.66 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.06. Now, let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 7. Across the freight segment total sales increased to 11% from last year to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by strong growth in services and aftermarket and higher demand for components. In terms of product lines equipment sales were down 2% year-over-year due to fewer locomotive deliveries in North America.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Pat and shifting our focus to markets on slide 11. We are continuing to see good signs of recovery. While the trough in the OE North American market remains, we are seeing sequential improvement in freight rail volumes.\nEric Gebhardt: Thanks Rafael, and good morning everyone. I'm Eric Gebhardt, Chief Technology Officer for Wabtec and I'm thrilled to be here with you to share some of the transformative advancements we're driving in the clean energy transportation sector. Turning to slide 12. As you may be aware, today rail represents the cleanest, most energy efficient and safest mode of moving freight and people on land, moving 40% of freight per ton-mile in the US alone. Current trends indicate that freight and passenger activity will more than double by 2050 as the sector pushes for more sustainable transportation. At Wabtec we're innovating to help our customers increase efficiency, reduce costs and cut their overall carbon footprint through the development of low emitting locomotive technologies. Including Tier 4 locomotives running on renewable fuels and battery electric locomotive. We're also pushing the boundaries into alternative fuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel and hydrogen which I'll share more on in a moment. Over the last year we built and tested in revenue operation with BNSF Railway and the California Air Resources Board the world's first heavy-haul 100% battery electric locomotive called FLXdrive. This locomotive which operated in a comp sys between two other locomotives had a battery capacity of 2.4 megawatt hours and generated most of its energy from regenerative braking. At the conclusion of this rigorous three month tests that span 13,000 miles, the FLXdrive exceeded expectations delivering more than 11% average reduction in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emission. That's the equivalent of eliminating 6,200 gallons of diesel fuel and flashing 69 tons of CO2 emissions; and it's just the beginning. At more than seven megawatt hours, which is the next version of the FLXdrive we currently have in development and expect to bring to market in 2023, we anticipate further reducing fuel consumption and emissions by up to 30%. This reduction is tied to a tightly coupled system that Wabtec is driving in the marketplace that includes batteries, Trip Optimizer, power electronics and even our braking systems to capture all the available regenerative braking energy. And by owning the complete system, we can control the comp sys to optimize fuel burn or emissions, battery life or speed depending on the operators need on a specific route. Our second-generation battery electric locomotive will operate independently and leverage General Motors Ultium battery technology that Rafael mentioned earlier. It's a winning combination. When we bring our expertise in energy management and systems optimization for heavy-haul locomotives, we're taking full advantage of GM's advanced technologies and speed-to-market. In addition to these efforts we're also re-imagining the future of rail utilization, safety and logistics optimization. Our vision is to expand the use of freight rail, enable the elimination of over 300 million tons of carbon dioxide annually across the global transportation network, reduce road congestion in our cities and make transportation significantly safer for everyone. Put us on this path we've installed positive train control systems and software on more than 24,000 locomotives. This technology has revolutionized rail safety in the US over the last decade and helped make the rail sector more efficient and effective. Our next generation systems will take efficiency even further by enabling moving block and virtual coupling instead of the traditional fixed block signaling used today, while still maintaining the most stringent safety standards. Similarly, our Trip Optimizer solution or smart cruise control system which is installed on over 11,000 locomotives has helped save customers more than 400 million gallons of fuel and 4.5 million tons of CO2. Together with Movement Planner, these digital solutions are revolutionizing locomotive fuel efficiency and real-time network planning. We're also helping move goods more efficiently using the existing rail network, all while reducing energy use emissions and waste. Looking to the future on Slide 13. We will accelerate the shift to green energy solutions and bring to market a heavy-haul zero emission hydrogen hybrid locomotive. And we have a clear roadmap to get there, one that drives us across the path with batteries as a focal point across the entire spectrum. And one that is already underway with FLXdrive. Our vision is to leverage battery technology while burning hydrogen in the internal combustion engine similar to what we're doing today with natural gas in Florida. This step is a retrofittable approach, we can take 80% to 90% of the energy content and make it hydrogen driving a dramatic drop in emissions. In parallel, we will develop a hydrogen fuel cell locomotive and ruggedized the fuel cells so they can operate in a harsh rail environment. GM's hydrogen capabilities give us an advantage here as well. Their hydro-tech hydrogen fuel cell power cubes are compact and easy to package and can be used in a wide range of applications including locomotives. Our vision is clear, to have an operation fully decarbonized trains utilizing battery electric and hydrogen technology. The recent partnerships we announced with Carnegie Mellon University, the nation's leading university in artificial intelligence and robotics and Genesee & Wyoming, the nation's largest short line and regional freight railroad put us on a path to do just that. By working together we believe the transition to a more utilized efficient and zero emission rail network is absolutely within reach, and we're committed to helping the industry get there. With that, Rafael I'll turn it back over to you.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Eric. You had a great example of how we're driving breakthrough technology investments in scalable and sustainable products that will position Wabtec and the industry for long-term profitable growth. Let's turn to our final slide. Everything we've outlined today reinforces our strategy to accelerate long-term profitable growth. That strategy is based on our expansive install base, deep expertise, innovation and breakthrough initiatives and scalable technologies, rigorous operations, continuous improvement culture and disciplined capital allocation. I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the second quarter despite a still challenging environment. As we go forward, we will continue to lean into the strong fundamentals of the company to execute on synergies, drive margin expansion, generate strong cash flow and deliver long-term profitable growth. As we've said before Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose to move and improve the world. After demonstrating strong performance in the first half of '21. I'm confident that the company will continue to deliver and lead the transition to a more sustainable future. We look forward to sharing more on the company technologies in our long-term vision in the fourth quarter when we plan to host an Investor Day. More information on this will be shared shortly. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to question. But before we do and out of consideration for others on the call. I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question today comes from Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning.\nPat Dugan: Good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning Justin.\nJustin Long: I'll start with one on the guidance. Could you share how much of the guidance raise was a function of the second quarter, beating your expectations versus the change in second half expectations? And maybe as you answer that, I got the impression last quarter that in Q2 we'd have a little bit of a dip in terms of locomotive deliveries and mods and then we'd see a re-acceleration in the back half. So, just curious if that's still the right cadence to be thinking about?\nRafael Santana: Yes, so Justin and I'll start with the second quarter. I think the team has been able to really overcome. I think some of the headwinds that we had referred to in terms of supply chain and there are some significant challenges in India. So I think we've executed better than what we had expected, which is good, helps us derisk any elements of the second half of the year and really we feel like we're very much on track to continue margin expansion into the second half of the year. So, I think some of the guidance change really reflects I think an improved environment ahead. I think we've certainly seen that with, I'll call a number of our end markets certainly internationally. We're continuing to see on parking locomotives and freight cars. So, if you look at freight cars, the numbers we're looking at it for now in the year are better than what we have guided earlier on.\nJustin Long: Okay. And thinking about the international locomotive market, so you've noted orders have picked up here recently. It sounds like the pipeline is strengthening as well. Any way you could give us an update on your expectations for international locomotive deliveries this year, the level of visibility you have into next year, just to help us think through that pick up?\nRafael Santana: Sure. So like you said, our pipeline of deals continues to strengthen. You will continue to see the backlog expansion. This is the highest backlog we've had since second quarter and we have a stronger pipeline that we are working on. We've had a number of significant international equipment deals that are under negotiation and starting to see some of those convert. First one you saw was here in South America, but we've got some of those really cutting across, we see it in Asia, in specific in Australia, Russia, CIS, to a large extent. I would say tied to commodity exports that have really strengthened for some of our key customers with growing demand in mining. I think -- So the internationally. That's really I think something that's playing out across.\nJustin Long: Okay, I'll leave it there. I appreciate the time.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Could you just talk a little bit about the freight margin performance because you saw a pickup in some of the higher, what I would think is higher margin categories such as services versus locomotives, but then margin decline year-over-year. So what's the key driver there, and what do you need to show margin improvement? How are you thinking about getting back to 2019 levels? Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Well, first let me just start with -- you're going to see margin expansion into the year across both segments. I think we've been very specific with regards to transit that doesn't change. As you go into the second half of the year we expect over 50 basis points of margin improvement versus the first half of the year. And with that I want to highlight, you will continue to see variation in specific quarters. I mean those are tied to timing of projects, they could be time, they could be associated with mix. If you look at it year-over-year. certainly transit is growing faster than the rest of the portfolio and within transit certainly OE is growing at much faster rate. There's also elements of how under absorption plays along the year. So as we look at it, there is an element of sometimes locomotive deliveries versus what the build plan is for the year. So overall, committed to really deliver on margin improvements for the year and better than what we guided early in the year.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great, thanks for that color. And then maybe if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the digital side. You talked about some projects on PTC outside the US. Maybe just help us think about what's the global opportunity for PTC generally? And then when would you expect digital to get back to 2019 levels?\nRafael Santana: Yes, well two things. I'll start with our customers continue to be focused on efficiency, productivity and safety, which is what digital is all about. We continue to see a strong commitment there. Our book-to-bill was strong in the past three quarters, well above one. As you mentioned, I think we've seen some significant progress internationally on expanding our penetration. A good example is PTC as you mentioned. We're now executing it in three different countries outside the US, we've got a number of other countries where we are discussing the opportunity. I think one of the things I would highlight about the business. This has been largely as you're looking at the past transactional business. So if the locomotive order drop, you would see really pressure to revenues on our digital electronics segment. Our teams continue to take steps to further drive what I call, recurring revenues in the business. We expect some of these multi-year orders to continue and I think a big chunk of the focus for this year is to drive convertability for the business and improve the forecast for the year. But largely committed; this is a significant element of how we are also going to do this energy transition with battery electric. It really comes down to having a strong portfolio that allows you for a really strong energy management on the comp sys. So, overall positive. I think we're still working on convertability for the year at this point.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nPat Dugan: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: So, I had a small one. What was the issue with the restructuring in transit 23 million, I apologize if I missed this in the prepared remarks. I thought you were more or less past some of that. And then my bigger question is, so there is a bit of a perception out there that all the efficiencies in rail means locomotives are less needed in the future and we don't share that but it's out there. But I loved the overview of the efficiencies you're bringing with a variety of technologies to the market. I'm just curious what the reaction, the conversations are like with your rail customers on efficiency driving upgrades to new as opposed to just mods. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Let me start and I'll pass it on to Pat on the specifics of the restructuring. But when we look at where we are in rail, I think the demand for more reliable power continues to be there. We've continued to see improvement in terms of the on-parking. So, I think those were largely tied to the dynamics over the last couple of years, not just in terms of carloads also in terms of PSR. I think that's largely in. So, when we look at moving forward. I think the focus on both reliability of the fleet that's significant positive for us when you look at our services business. The other element is a continued focus from customers now on really making sure that you're getting more productivity. And I think that will tie very well with some of the solutions that we have out there that drive fuel savings. We've talked about the FDL advantage. There's also I think significant elements in terms of upgrades that we can continue to drive. You've heard about us implementing the Tier 4 engine with our CSX now, this is something that we can apply not only to our platform, but to other platforms out there as well. And we're really excited about the opportunity here on this energy transition with battery electric. We are currently responding to a number of really questions coming from request for quotes and requests for information from customers, not just in North America, around the world. So we see battery here as a significant element of how you really call, renew some of the fleets driving value for customers and driving value for ourselves. So I think we are really building off on a positive momentum here ahead of us.\nPat Dugan: So to talk about the restructuring. We've talked about this in the past it's specific to our UK operations where we're seeing some of the larger projects wind down and conclude. And so we're looking at all of our footprint in the UK and consolidating operations. There is an element of impairment and other severance that comes through in that number. The majority of that restructuring is non-cash. So there's just a lumpiness here in the second quarter. I would tell you that when you look at the full year we still expect our restructuring to be less than it was a year ago. We also expect that restructuring is going to continue as we drive that margin improvement for our transit segment. We are consolidating footprint, taking steps to improve our productivity and improve margin overall. So there would still be more in the future, but we're down year-over-year.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Scott.\nPat Dugan: Good morning.\nScott Group: I want to just come back to the margin outlook for a second because when we look at the new revenue guidance and earnings guidance. It looks like the implied margins have come down a little bit from the prior guidance. And I just want to get your sense on why that is and maybe why we're not seeing just better leverage on the sales upside? Is it just mix or is there anything else going on. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Scott, I'll really go back to what I said, you're going to see margin expansion going through the second half of the year by more than 50 basis points versus the first half. If you look at our regional guidance we had given for the year, we're going to be seeing margins expanding better than that our original guidance was. I think there's always going to be again elements of variation in the quarter as I had highlighted in terms of timing of projects. Mix can also be an element here, especially as you think about, well the speed of growth here on the transit segment versus the freight segment. But as you look into some of the other elements, even SG&A were consistent with 12% we had guided earlier in the year. So very much committed and executing for the $250 million of synergies that we have talked about, we expect to deliver those earlier in the second half of the year than later and I think to our depositors, we're moving forward into what I call a second phase of integration 2.0, which a lot of it is really tied to a continuous improvement culture and that will continue to drive our productivity. So we are committed to continue to drive profitable growth with improved margins going into next year as well.\nScott Group: Okay. And then, you talked about locos getting on parked, maybe can you just talk how many locos were un-parked in the second quarter. What your outlook is for the back half of the year and then what's the revenue opportunity for you from each loco getting un-parked?\nRafael Santana: I think the best way to answer you there is, yes, we look into the second half. I think we expect here certainly a continued rebound out a gradual pace, of course when you compare  year-over-year they become a little more challenging. I think the good news is when you look at the fleet that's running out there. I mean, you're really looking for reliability and availability and those locomotives are running harder than they were before. Even though, if you look at the overall fleet, you're not necessarily back to pre-COVID levels. I think we are positioned well here with the newer fleets, that really provide I will call the battery reliability for customers, which is certainly needed right now when you look at improve being service levels ahead. So, I wouldn't speculate in terms of the levels of unparking. This is an active dialog we have with customers and it involves, not just the elements of unparking, it involves a strategy around modernizations, new locomotives. So, it's a broader equation than just tied to un-parking of existing fleets, which will potentially come with sometimes penalties tied to reliability of the overall system.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nPat Dugan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi, good morning everyone.\nPat Dugan: Good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Jerry.\nRafael Santana: Rafael, can you talk about the mod pipeline and where it stands today? Nice to see the really strong deliveries in the quarter where you had the tough comp from a year ago, and I'm wondering, what's the backlog look like, what's the pipeline and level of activity overall?\nRafael Santana: Jerry, mods was a significant step up this year versus last year. That helped us say partially offset even some of the elements of new locomotive deliveries. As we look at moving forward, I think good momentum there. So, if you think about the things that we're bringing to market that allows us to even upgrade some of the existing fleets with better fuel efficiency, some of the elements of automation. So we see that as a trend continuing, certainly going to next year. I think there is an element here of just, I mean step up in growth we saw year-over-year. I do not expect the same going into next year but mods does have a significant opportunity for us and as you look at internationally as well. It's been a significant element of discussions with international customers too.\nJerry Revich: Very interesting and you know on the international locomotive pipeline, can you help us put a finer point on the timing and magnitude of project opportunities? And if you can comment on whether they are from countries where you have existing operations versus areas where you might need to build assembly capacity? Thanks.\nRafael Santana: So I think that's really a part of, I think the good dynamics we're seeing. Those are countries that we largely operate in, we have strong relationships with customers and we see that momentum there picking up. So I'm not going to speculate here with specific the elements of when some of those orders converts, but what I'll tell you as I look into the framework for a lot, '22 - '23 timeframe that's certainly a positive, there is good momentum. I am just not going to speculate in the elements of exactly when orders get finalized, but the momentum is there. Pipeline is stronger and we feel positive about growth in the international market moving forward.\nJerry Revich: And Rafael, just to clarify '22 - '23 timeframe, is that when you expect to deliver the locomotives or when you expect the firm orders?\nRafael Santana: No, we expect the firm orders this year. So that's more of an element of delivery as you look into the future. So that's why I don't want to speculate how much it goes into the specifics of next year or 2023, but it's a positive as I look at it and those are units that we will largely be building in that timeframe.\nJerry Revich: Terrific, thank you.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning.\nRafael Santana: Morning.\nAllison Poliniak: I just want to go back to the digital businesses for you, obviously it sounds like a lot of momentum is building back sort of post this COVID lull. I guess one question, you had mentioned, the thought behind building that recurring revenue, how big is that as a percentage of digital today and I think as you enter this year you're expecting digital to be flat, is that still the case with the momentum really impacting next year more importantly? Any thoughts there?\nRafael Santana: So, Allison, when you look at the recurring revenue, I go back couple years ago This was in the teens, I look at it today, it's above 20% and I think the team is continuing to work on that regard. So I think just more recurring revenues as a function of that. I think some of the challenges tied to the year is really getting orders that you can convert in the year. So I think we still have some challenges in the year in terms of increasing the revenue in any significant manner. But it feels very positive in terms of the multi-year orders we've been able to get for the past three quarters. I mean, our book-to-bill has been well above one and I think that translates into growth for the business going unto next year and beyond. I think we've often talked about growing two to three times faster on that segment, and that's a story that doesn't change. As you look into -- also the other comment I made with regards to battery electric, that's such a critical portfolio in terms of how you manage a comp sys. I think you will have the opportunity to hear more on it but I think you will need our portfolio of Trip Optimizer with Zero-to-Zero to ultimately make sure that you're really taking advantage of improved fuel savings moving forward.\nAllison Poliniak: Great, that's helpful. And then you made a comment about projects being pushed to the right a little bit more to in general. We've heard that I would say across manufacturing complex, do you feel like people are getting a better handle on where you're seeing more conversion on time as we enter the back half or does this feel like it's going to be an ongoing situation where it could continue to get pushed into maybe next year even?\nRafael Santana: Might - again as we look into the year we feel confident, otherwise we wouldn't have raised the guidance overall, and as we look into the dynamics going into next year, it really points out to a profitable growth year for us. I think the elements here of projects, I think we - why don't you talk about transit, why don't you talk about freight in transit. We see largely authorities and governments committed to invest in the transit system. So that continues. We haven't really seen again any cancellations or anything like that. If anything, I think there is opportunity for growing momentum there, especially as you look at a number of stimulus packages going across. And on freight my comment here, sometimes more on the elements of the timing of orders, I mean it's certainly I'd say requires more I think negotiations, than some of the elements of North America but positive momentum forward.\nAllison Poliniak: Perfect, thanks. I'll pass it along.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen\nMatt Elkott: Good morning. Thank you. So on the synergies front, I think most of your synergies have been on the cost side from the deal so far and that's understandable given that you guys inherited a backlog from GE. But as you take in more new orders, are you finding opportunities on the revenue synergy front?\nRafael Santana: Yes, we are. And it's really one that goes into various areas. I'll start with transit. I think some of the relationships that we've had with the broader company, it is allowing us to grow our share into some markets that traditionally we would not be present, and I think that's a positive and we are seeing the opportunity here to be early on, on projects we expect in and to really work on what I will call a category of products that we are able to supply into transit. It's certainly true also for a number of regions. So what if I think about Eastern Europe, what if I think about Russia and CIS, those are areas that traditionally we've had a very strong footprint strong relationships with customers and you see that as a function of opportunities for us to grow transit faster and more profitably as well. I think on the freight side, I think some of those, we've talked about it in the past. There's certainly an opportunity for us to continue to do that and a piece of that is also looking at taking advantage of competitors platforms and being able to implement some of the elements of mods and things like that, which were capabilities that we brought with merger of the company. So you'll see more of that and opportunities for us to be expanding our solutions into other competitive platforms.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. So, Rafael, you do think that Wabtec legacy content in new locomotive orders should be higher than pre deal and for new order?\nRafael Santana: Short answer is yes, it should, and especially as you look at like new platforms that we're launching, we're certainly taking advantage of a lot of this, I'll call core technologies that really ultimately guarantee the value for the customer. So if you think about core, we call them vital organs, I think that has expanded and those platforms largely will reflect that. So it's a growing penetration of our products into these future platforms.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. And just my second question on the Infrastructure Bill. Sorry if I missed any commentary you made, but as you know the $550 billion Infrastructure Bill took a step forward yesterday, I think there is about $100 billion for rail and public transit. Can you talk about any potential benefits for you guys from this?\nRafael Santana: Well, the sector will benefit from the build, this is a positive for Wabtec, I think there is a couple of opportunities here on both fronts, I think certainly in transit, I think we'll see some of that reflected in terms of some of the opportunities we have, but also on the freight side as we talk about some of the technology development, those are some of the discussions that continue in terms of really government supports to accelerate some of the elements of decarbonization and efficiency for our customers. So we see it largely as positive news and something that will benefit rail and will benefit us.\nMatt Elkott: Great. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSteve Barger: Hey thanks, Rafael you brought up how things can be lumpy quarter to quarter. Should we be thinking Q4 sees the typical step up in revenue and EPS from Q3 or can you just talk about back half cadence?\nRafael Santana: So I'd be thinking about sequential improvements as you go into the second half of the year. There is of course an element sometimes of seasonality between third and fourth quarter, traditionally we would have seen third quarter, I'm going to call especially stronger with some of the elements of the mix, but I'll call sequential improvement. Pat..\nPat Dugan: Yes, I think if you go back, we're still seeing some disruption, a little bit in the normal seasonality because of everybody coming off of COVID, but if you go back to '19 and even before you would see third quarter was really usually strong in the freight services side. It kind of ties to our customers maintenance cycle and when they do things. Meanwhile, in the fourth quarter, there is usually some strength in the transit aftermarket business. So all those things are going to play out here in the second half of the year. I think we have a lot of confidence in what the second half will look like. There is still looking at sequential improvement but considering those things might be coming back to more normal situations.\nSteve Barger: So just so I understand, sequential improvement meaning Q3 better than Q2 and Q4 better than Q3 this year?\nPat Dugan: That's our expectation, yes.\nSteve Barger: Okay, got it.\nRafael Santana: From an EPS perspective. Yes.\nPat Dugan: From an EPS perspective, correct.\nSteve Barger: Sure. And if I model out to the midpoint of your guide I get mid 15% range operating margin, which gives about a low 20% incremental for the year. Can you tell us what the impact of mix or unusual items were this year in terms of margin impact, relative to your original thinking? And just remind us how we should think about incremental margin going forward in an environment where you can drive high single-digit growth?\nRafael Santana: So, here I'll emphasize the element that we will expand margins this year and we'll continue to expand as we go into next year, I think it would be worth taking some time offline with you just walk you through some of these elements as mix certainly plays out through especially the element here of the year per se, but that's variation on quarter-over-quarter. I think, again 50 basis points, margin improvement going into the second half of the year. We're going to be better than the 50 basis points and profitable growth ahead. Pat?\nPat Dugan: Yes, I understand your math. I think you just want to factor in the full-year impact in that you're going to have some variation quarter to quarter. We don't give quarterly guidance on margin percentages, but really focus on the full year in the impact of all the cost and productivity savings and synergy savings as well as sales mix and how that would impact us.\nSteve Barger: Yes, that's really the motivation of the question is thinking about annuals on a go forward basis, which is to say if we're in an environment where you can drive high single-digit growth in the future, and as you think about your backlog mix, can you do better than a low 20% incremental for a full year?\nRafael Santana: So the short answer is, in terms of incrementals, yes we expect that.\nSteve Barger: Got it.\nPat Dugan: Yes, I think the volumes. I mean, I think we demonstrated on the variations in the past and with the increasing revenue and absorption, you get those kinds of contribution margin you are talking about.\nSteve Barger: And I know we're late in the call, can I ask a quick one for Eric or if there is someone behind me, I'll just jump out of queue.\nRafael Santana: Go ahead .\nSteve Barger: Okay. Yes. Slide 13 is great for showing us the technology progression to carbon zero locomotives, I know you're inventing a lot of this, so it's hard to predict timing but any best guess on timing for battery electric lead and then hydrogen, are we talking five years, ten years?\nEric Gebhardt: So when we look at the battery electric coming off the successful testing that we did out in California, we're already in the process of quoting the battery electric and should be shipping in '23 is kind of the timeframe we're looking at there, so that should be getting out there in '23. And that will come with the lead capability and what I mean by the lead capability is that it won't have to run in a comp sys between two diesel electric, you can have multiple battery electric working together at that point. So we are very proud of moving forward on that. And then, the hydrogen will lag by a couple of years behind that. There's more invention happening in the hydrogen, but when you look at what we're doing with GM right now, that's accelerating us both on the batteries, as well as the hydrogen side there. And then, I think one of the key points also is that, we're also developing all the elements around it. It's a system that really works together. So, the battery system working with the power conversion working with Trip Optimizer to optimize all of that, even the braking, working the braking in there so that you can capture as much energy as possible and that's how we get to the 30% emissions and 30% fuel improvement.\nSteve Barger: So if I'm hearing you right, it sounds like you expect a hydrogen freight locomotive in this decade.\nEric Gebhardt: Yes, in the next few years.\nSteve Barger: Great. All right, thanks.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.\nChris Wetherbee: Hi guys. James Ronnigan on for Chris, I think you talked about 50 basis points margin expansion in the back half, I was wondering if you could talk about your expectation for margin expansion in the back half of three and then understanding how much of that might be due to mix or the flow through synergies or anything else?\nRafael Santana: So when you think about margin expansion, we have not breaking that out on freight, We haven't guided that specifically but for transits we have guided to 100 basis points and we continue to be on that track. So that's part of the guidance, that includes continue to expand transit margins year-over-year by more than 100 basis points for this year. And on freights, we've also, I think being very clear about margin expansion there to, so I think that 50 basis points towards more to really make sure we give a framework of how we expect margins to grow into the second half of the year with greater than 50 basis points overall expansion when you look at the segments combined.\nChris Wetherbee: Got it. And then there was a stark improvement in services revenue and I think you've called out the un-parking of equipment had a lot to do with that. Just wondering, could you give us an understanding of like what the business is running at in July so far, maybe in June with the amount of un-parking and equipment that's come out of storage, so far. And then just maybe sort of understand how essentially as activity picks up, do you expect sort of the services revenue to accelerate through the back half.\nPat Dugan: So the un-parkings really haven't commented on anything specifically. We see these locomotives coming back into service. I mean it very much correlates exactly with the overall freight traffic for the North America, really to not something that to comment on and like in July or anything like that as you asked but we just see this trend to continue, and it gives us a lot of confidence and a lot of visibility as to the strength of what's going to happen with our freight services business.\nRafael Santana: Maybe just to add on, in terms of rebound. I mean we expect more of a gradual pace here into the second half of the year. So the comps are again different. I think one of the things that we're seeing is a stronger demand for reliable power and the newer locomotives are running and running. I'm going to call, harder, so more megawatt hours. So that's what I think largely drives a continuation of some of the dynamics you see in services. So we see stronger services ahead, not necessarily a slowdown going into the second half.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: This will conclude our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Kristine Kubacki for any closing remarks.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Irene . Thank you to everyone participation today. We look forward to talking with you and speaking with you through the quarter. Thank you. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Rafael, and good morning everyone. I'm Eric Gebhardt, Chief Technology Officer for Wabtec and I'm thrilled to be here with you to share some of the transformative advancements we're driving in the clean energy transportation sector. Turning to slide 12. As you may be aware, today rail represents the cleanest, most energy efficient and safest mode of moving freight and people on land, moving 40% of freight per ton-mile in the US alone. Current trends indicate that freight and passenger activity will more than double by 2050 as the sector pushes for more sustainable transportation. At Wabtec we're innovating to help our customers increase efficiency, reduce costs and cut their overall carbon footprint through the development of low emitting locomotive technologies. Including Tier 4 locomotives running on renewable fuels and battery electric locomotive. We're also pushing the boundaries into alternative fuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel and hydrogen which I'll share more on in a moment. Over the last year we built and tested in revenue operation with BNSF Railway and the California Air Resources Board the world's first heavy-haul 100% battery electric locomotive called FLXdrive. This locomotive which operated in a comp sys between two other locomotives had a battery capacity of 2.4 megawatt hours and generated most of its energy from regenerative braking. At the conclusion of this rigorous three month tests that span 13,000 miles, the FLXdrive exceeded expectations delivering more than 11% average reduction in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emission. That's the equivalent of eliminating 6,200 gallons of diesel fuel and flashing 69 tons of CO2 emissions; and it's just the beginning. At more than seven megawatt hours, which is the next version of the FLXdrive we currently have in development and expect to bring to market in 2023, we anticipate further reducing fuel consumption and emissions by up to 30%. This reduction is tied to a tightly coupled system that Wabtec is driving in the marketplace that includes batteries, Trip Optimizer, power electronics and even our braking systems to capture all the available regenerative braking energy. And by owning the complete system, we can control the comp sys to optimize fuel burn or emissions, battery life or speed depending on the operators need on a specific route. Our second-generation battery electric locomotive will operate independently and leverage General Motors Ultium battery technology that Rafael mentioned earlier. It's a winning combination. When we bring our expertise in energy management and systems optimization for heavy-haul locomotives, we're taking full advantage of GM's advanced technologies and speed-to-market. In addition to these efforts we're also re-imagining the future of rail utilization, safety and logistics optimization. Our vision is to expand the use of freight rail, enable the elimination of over 300 million tons of carbon dioxide annually across the global transportation network, reduce road congestion in our cities and make transportation significantly safer for everyone. Put us on this path we've installed positive train control systems and software on more than 24,000 locomotives. This technology has revolutionized rail safety in the US over the last decade and helped make the rail sector more efficient and effective. Our next generation systems will take efficiency even further by enabling moving block and virtual coupling instead of the traditional fixed block signaling used today, while still maintaining the most stringent safety standards. Similarly, our Trip Optimizer solution or smart cruise control system which is installed on over 11,000 locomotives has helped save customers more than 400 million gallons of fuel and 4.5 million tons of CO2. Together with Movement Planner, these digital solutions are revolutionizing locomotive fuel efficiency and real-time network planning. We're also helping move goods more efficiently using the existing rail network, all while reducing energy use emissions and waste. Looking to the future on Slide 13. We will accelerate the shift to green energy solutions and bring to market a heavy-haul zero emission hydrogen hybrid locomotive. And we have a clear roadmap to get there, one that drives us across the path with batteries as a focal point across the entire spectrum. And one that is already underway with FLXdrive. Our vision is to leverage battery technology while burning hydrogen in the internal combustion engine similar to what we're doing today with natural gas in Florida. This step is a retrofittable approach, we can take 80% to 90% of the energy content and make it hydrogen driving a dramatic drop in emissions. In parallel, we will develop a hydrogen fuel cell locomotive and ruggedized the fuel cells so they can operate in a harsh rail environment. GM's hydrogen capabilities give us an advantage here as well. Their hydro-tech hydrogen fuel cell power cubes are compact and easy to package and can be used in a wide range of applications including locomotives. Our vision is clear, to have an operation fully decarbonized trains utilizing battery electric and hydrogen technology. The recent partnerships we announced with Carnegie Mellon University, the nation's leading university in artificial intelligence and robotics and Genesee & Wyoming, the nation's largest short line and regional freight railroad put us on a path to do just that. By working together we believe the transition to a more utilized efficient and zero emission rail network is absolutely within reach, and we're committed to helping the industry get there. With that, Rafael I'll turn it back over to you. So when we look at the battery electric coming off the successful testing that we did out in California, we're already in the process of quoting the battery electric and should be shipping in '23 is kind of the timeframe we're looking at there, so that should be getting out there in '23. And that will come with the lead capability and what I mean by the lead capability is that it won't have to run in a comp sys between two diesel electric, you can have multiple battery electric working together at that point. So we are very proud of moving forward on that. And then, the hydrogen will lag by a couple of years behind that. There's more invention happening in the hydrogen, but when you look at what we're doing with GM right now, that's accelerating us both on the batteries, as well as the hydrogen side there. And then, I think one of the key points also is that, we're also developing all the elements around it. It's a system that really works together. So, the battery system working with the power conversion working with Trip Optimizer to optimize all of that, even the braking, working the braking in there so that you can capture as much energy as possible and that's how we get to the 30% emissions and 30% fuel improvement. Yes, in the next few years."

            "content": "Thanks, Rafael, and good morning everyone. We had solid operational and financial performance during the quarter. As markets continue to gradually recover, we demonstrated our ability to deliver on synergies to generate strong cash flow and to invest in the future and position Wabtec for profitable growth. Turning to Slide 6. I'll review the second quarter in more detail. Sales for the second quarter were $2 billion, which reflects a 16% increase versus the prior year, driven by a broad based recovery across our portfolio offset somewhat by lower North America OE freight markets. For the quarter, operating income was $203 million and adjusted operating income was $306 million, which was up 17% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income excluded pre-tax expenses of $103 million of which $73 million was for non-cash amortization and $30 million for restructuring of which the majority was for our UK operations and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Nordco. Adjusted operating margin was 10 basis points higher than the second quarter last year and up from the first quarter. Versus last year, adjusted operating margin benefited from higher sales and the realization of synergies. Now, looking at some of the detailed line items for the second quarter, adjusted SG&A was $254 million which was 12.6% of sales. This was up from last year due to the normalization of certain expenses compared to the temporary cost actions taken during the depth of the pandemic, a year ago. Adjusted SG&A excludes $9 million of restructuring and transaction expenses. For the full year, we expect adjusted SG&A to be about 12% of sales. We will continue to aggressively manage headcount and structural costs. Engineering expense increased from last year. This was largely due to higher volume outlook for the year. Overall, our investment in technology is still expected to be about 6% to 7% of sales. Amortization expense was $73 million. For 2021 we expect non-cash amortization expense to be about $290 million and depreciation expense of about $205 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate during the quarter was 25.3%, bringing our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate to be about 26.3%. For the full year we still expect an effective tax rate of about 26%. In the second quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.66 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.06. Now, let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 7. Across the freight segment total sales increased to 11% from last year to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by strong growth in services and aftermarket and higher demand for components. In terms of product lines equipment sales were down 2% year-over-year due to fewer locomotive deliveries in North America. Good morning. Thanks. So to talk about the restructuring. We've talked about this in the past it's specific to our UK operations where we're seeing some of the larger projects wind down and conclude. And so we're looking at all of our footprint in the UK and consolidating operations. There is an element of impairment and other severance that comes through in that number. The majority of that restructuring is non-cash. So there's just a lumpiness here in the second quarter. I would tell you that when you look at the full year we still expect our restructuring to be less than it was a year ago. We also expect that restructuring is going to continue as we drive that margin improvement for our transit segment. We are consolidating footprint, taking steps to improve our productivity and improve margin overall. So there would still be more in the future, but we're down year-over-year. Good morning. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, I think if you go back, we're still seeing some disruption, a little bit in the normal seasonality because of everybody coming off of COVID, but if you go back to '19 and even before you would see third quarter was really usually strong in the freight services side. It kind of ties to our customers maintenance cycle and when they do things. Meanwhile, in the fourth quarter, there is usually some strength in the transit aftermarket business. So all those things are going to play out here in the second half of the year. I think we have a lot of confidence in what the second half will look like. There is still looking at sequential improvement but considering those things might be coming back to more normal situations. That's our expectation, yes. From an EPS perspective, correct. Yes, I understand your math. I think you just want to factor in the full-year impact in that you're going to have some variation quarter to quarter. We don't give quarterly guidance on margin percentages, but really focus on the full year in the impact of all the cost and productivity savings and synergy savings as well as sales mix and how that would impact us. Yes, I think the volumes. I mean, I think we demonstrated on the variations in the past and with the increasing revenue and absorption, you get those kinds of contribution margin you are talking about. So the un-parkings really haven't commented on anything specifically. We see these locomotives coming back into service. I mean it very much correlates exactly with the overall freight traffic for the North America, really to not something that to comment on and like in July or anything like that as you asked but we just see this trend to continue, and it gives us a lot of confidence and a lot of visibility as to the strength of what's going to happen with our freight services business."

            "name": "Rafael Santana",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristine, and good morning everyone. Let's begin on slide 4. We delivered a strong second quarter as noted by our sales growth, adjusted margin and adjusted earnings per share, each of which were up sequentially and year-over-year. Total sales for the quarter were $2 billion driven by growing demand in freight services, components and transit, but offset by weakness in the North America OEM market. Adjusted operating margin was 15.2% driven by ongoing lean initiatives, cost actions and the realization of synergies. Total cash flow from operations was $223 million. This takes the year-to-date cash from operations to $515 million versus $229 million a year ago. It's a solid illustration of how the team is driving good operational performance and focused working capital management. Cash conversion for the year is over 100%. Our year-to-date book-to-bill continues to be a positive story. We ended the first half of the year, greater than one and we have a strong order pipeline for international locomotives. Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $21.5 billion providing strong visibility into 2021 and beyond. Finally, we ended second quarter with adjusted EPS of $1.06, up 22% year-over-year. In the area of synergies we are on track to achieve our full run rate of $250 million this year and we are feeling the benefits of our footprint consolidation and aggressive actions on structural costs. So overall, really strong execution by the team as we continue to deliver on our long-term strategy. I am confident that with strong execution, focused cost measures, our team's drive on productivity and continued improvements in our end markets, we will continue to deliver long-term profitable growth. Now let's turn in to slide 5. To discuss a few of our recent business highlights starting with our strategic partnership we recently announced with CSX. Thanks, Pat and shifting our focus to markets on slide 11. We are continuing to see good signs of recovery. While the trough in the OE North American market remains, we are seeing sequential improvement in freight rail volumes. Thanks, Eric. You had a great example of how we're driving breakthrough technology investments in scalable and sustainable products that will position Wabtec and the industry for long-term profitable growth. Let's turn to our final slide. Everything we've outlined today reinforces our strategy to accelerate long-term profitable growth. That strategy is based on our expansive install base, deep expertise, innovation and breakthrough initiatives and scalable technologies, rigorous operations, continuous improvement culture and disciplined capital allocation. I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the second quarter despite a still challenging environment. As we go forward, we will continue to lean into the strong fundamentals of the company to execute on synergies, drive margin expansion, generate strong cash flow and deliver long-term profitable growth. As we've said before Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose to move and improve the world. After demonstrating strong performance in the first half of '21. I'm confident that the company will continue to deliver and lead the transition to a more sustainable future. We look forward to sharing more on the company technologies in our long-term vision in the fourth quarter when we plan to host an Investor Day. More information on this will be shared shortly. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Good morning Justin. Yes, so Justin and I'll start with the second quarter. I think the team has been able to really overcome. I think some of the headwinds that we had referred to in terms of supply chain and there are some significant challenges in India. So I think we've executed better than what we had expected, which is good, helps us derisk any elements of the second half of the year and really we feel like we're very much on track to continue margin expansion into the second half of the year. So, I think some of the guidance change really reflects I think an improved environment ahead. I think we've certainly seen that with, I'll call a number of our end markets certainly internationally. We're continuing to see on parking locomotives and freight cars. So, if you look at freight cars, the numbers we're looking at it for now in the year are better than what we have guided earlier on. Sure. So like you said, our pipeline of deals continues to strengthen. You will continue to see the backlog expansion. This is the highest backlog we've had since second quarter and we have a stronger pipeline that we are working on. We've had a number of significant international equipment deals that are under negotiation and starting to see some of those convert. First one you saw was here in South America, but we've got some of those really cutting across, we see it in Asia, in specific in Australia, Russia, CIS, to a large extent. I would say tied to commodity exports that have really strengthened for some of our key customers with growing demand in mining. I think -- So the internationally. That's really I think something that's playing out across. Thank you. Well, first let me just start with -- you're going to see margin expansion into the year across both segments. I think we've been very specific with regards to transit that doesn't change. As you go into the second half of the year we expect over 50 basis points of margin improvement versus the first half of the year. And with that I want to highlight, you will continue to see variation in specific quarters. I mean those are tied to timing of projects, they could be time, they could be associated with mix. If you look at it year-over-year. certainly transit is growing faster than the rest of the portfolio and within transit certainly OE is growing at much faster rate. There's also elements of how under absorption plays along the year. So as we look at it, there is an element of sometimes locomotive deliveries versus what the build plan is for the year. So overall, committed to really deliver on margin improvements for the year and better than what we guided early in the year. Yes, well two things. I'll start with our customers continue to be focused on efficiency, productivity and safety, which is what digital is all about. We continue to see a strong commitment there. Our book-to-bill was strong in the past three quarters, well above one. As you mentioned, I think we've seen some significant progress internationally on expanding our penetration. A good example is PTC as you mentioned. We're now executing it in three different countries outside the US, we've got a number of other countries where we are discussing the opportunity. I think one of the things I would highlight about the business. This has been largely as you're looking at the past transactional business. So if the locomotive order drop, you would see really pressure to revenues on our digital electronics segment. Our teams continue to take steps to further drive what I call, recurring revenues in the business. We expect some of these multi-year orders to continue and I think a big chunk of the focus for this year is to drive convertability for the business and improve the forecast for the year. But largely committed; this is a significant element of how we are also going to do this energy transition with battery electric. It really comes down to having a strong portfolio that allows you for a really strong energy management on the comp sys. So, overall positive. I think we're still working on convertability for the year at this point. Thank you. Good morning, Rob. Let me start and I'll pass it on to Pat on the specifics of the restructuring. But when we look at where we are in rail, I think the demand for more reliable power continues to be there. We've continued to see improvement in terms of the on-parking. So, I think those were largely tied to the dynamics over the last couple of years, not just in terms of carloads also in terms of PSR. I think that's largely in. So, when we look at moving forward. I think the focus on both reliability of the fleet that's significant positive for us when you look at our services business. The other element is a continued focus from customers now on really making sure that you're getting more productivity. And I think that will tie very well with some of the solutions that we have out there that drive fuel savings. We've talked about the FDL advantage. There's also I think significant elements in terms of upgrades that we can continue to drive. You've heard about us implementing the Tier 4 engine with our CSX now, this is something that we can apply not only to our platform, but to other platforms out there as well. And we're really excited about the opportunity here on this energy transition with battery electric. We are currently responding to a number of really questions coming from request for quotes and requests for information from customers, not just in North America, around the world. So we see battery here as a significant element of how you really call, renew some of the fleets driving value for customers and driving value for ourselves. So I think we are really building off on a positive momentum here ahead of us. Good morning, Scott. Scott, I'll really go back to what I said, you're going to see margin expansion going through the second half of the year by more than 50 basis points versus the first half. If you look at our regional guidance we had given for the year, we're going to be seeing margins expanding better than that our original guidance was. I think there's always going to be again elements of variation in the quarter as I had highlighted in terms of timing of projects. Mix can also be an element here, especially as you think about, well the speed of growth here on the transit segment versus the freight segment. But as you look into some of the other elements, even SG&A were consistent with 12% we had guided earlier in the year. So very much committed and executing for the $250 million of synergies that we have talked about, we expect to deliver those earlier in the second half of the year than later and I think to our depositors, we're moving forward into what I call a second phase of integration 2.0, which a lot of it is really tied to a continuous improvement culture and that will continue to drive our productivity. So we are committed to continue to drive profitable growth with improved margins going into next year as well. I think the best way to answer you there is, yes, we look into the second half. I think we expect here certainly a continued rebound out a gradual pace, of course when you compare  year-over-year they become a little more challenging. I think the good news is when you look at the fleet that's running out there. I mean, you're really looking for reliability and availability and those locomotives are running harder than they were before. Even though, if you look at the overall fleet, you're not necessarily back to pre-COVID levels. I think we are positioned well here with the newer fleets, that really provide I will call the battery reliability for customers, which is certainly needed right now when you look at improve being service levels ahead. So, I wouldn't speculate in terms of the levels of unparking. This is an active dialog we have with customers and it involves, not just the elements of unparking, it involves a strategy around modernizations, new locomotives. So, it's a broader equation than just tied to un-parking of existing fleets, which will potentially come with sometimes penalties tied to reliability of the overall system. Thank you. Good morning, Jerry. Rafael, can you talk about the mod pipeline and where it stands today? Nice to see the really strong deliveries in the quarter where you had the tough comp from a year ago, and I'm wondering, what's the backlog look like, what's the pipeline and level of activity overall? Jerry, mods was a significant step up this year versus last year. That helped us say partially offset even some of the elements of new locomotive deliveries. As we look at moving forward, I think good momentum there. So, if you think about the things that we're bringing to market that allows us to even upgrade some of the existing fleets with better fuel efficiency, some of the elements of automation. So we see that as a trend continuing, certainly going to next year. I think there is an element here of just, I mean step up in growth we saw year-over-year. I do not expect the same going into next year but mods does have a significant opportunity for us and as you look at internationally as well. It's been a significant element of discussions with international customers too. So I think that's really a part of, I think the good dynamics we're seeing. Those are countries that we largely operate in, we have strong relationships with customers and we see that momentum there picking up. So I'm not going to speculate here with specific the elements of when some of those orders converts, but what I'll tell you as I look into the framework for a lot, '22 - '23 timeframe that's certainly a positive, there is good momentum. I am just not going to speculate in the elements of exactly when orders get finalized, but the momentum is there. Pipeline is stronger and we feel positive about growth in the international market moving forward. No, we expect the firm orders this year. So that's more of an element of delivery as you look into the future. So that's why I don't want to speculate how much it goes into the specifics of next year or 2023, but it's a positive as I look at it and those are units that we will largely be building in that timeframe. Thank you. Morning. So, Allison, when you look at the recurring revenue, I go back couple years ago This was in the teens, I look at it today, it's above 20% and I think the team is continuing to work on that regard. So I think just more recurring revenues as a function of that. I think some of the challenges tied to the year is really getting orders that you can convert in the year. So I think we still have some challenges in the year in terms of increasing the revenue in any significant manner. But it feels very positive in terms of the multi-year orders we've been able to get for the past three quarters. I mean, our book-to-bill has been well above one and I think that translates into growth for the business going unto next year and beyond. I think we've often talked about growing two to three times faster on that segment, and that's a story that doesn't change. As you look into -- also the other comment I made with regards to battery electric, that's such a critical portfolio in terms of how you manage a comp sys. I think you will have the opportunity to hear more on it but I think you will need our portfolio of Trip Optimizer with Zero-to-Zero to ultimately make sure that you're really taking advantage of improved fuel savings moving forward. Might - again as we look into the year we feel confident, otherwise we wouldn't have raised the guidance overall, and as we look into the dynamics going into next year, it really points out to a profitable growth year for us. I think the elements here of projects, I think we - why don't you talk about transit, why don't you talk about freight in transit. We see largely authorities and governments committed to invest in the transit system. So that continues. We haven't really seen again any cancellations or anything like that. If anything, I think there is opportunity for growing momentum there, especially as you look at a number of stimulus packages going across. And on freight my comment here, sometimes more on the elements of the timing of orders, I mean it's certainly I'd say requires more I think negotiations, than some of the elements of North America but positive momentum forward. Thank you. Yes, we are. And it's really one that goes into various areas. I'll start with transit. I think some of the relationships that we've had with the broader company, it is allowing us to grow our share into some markets that traditionally we would not be present, and I think that's a positive and we are seeing the opportunity here to be early on, on projects we expect in and to really work on what I will call a category of products that we are able to supply into transit. It's certainly true also for a number of regions. So what if I think about Eastern Europe, what if I think about Russia and CIS, those are areas that traditionally we've had a very strong footprint strong relationships with customers and you see that as a function of opportunities for us to grow transit faster and more profitably as well. I think on the freight side, I think some of those, we've talked about it in the past. There's certainly an opportunity for us to continue to do that and a piece of that is also looking at taking advantage of competitors platforms and being able to implement some of the elements of mods and things like that, which were capabilities that we brought with merger of the company. So you'll see more of that and opportunities for us to be expanding our solutions into other competitive platforms. Short answer is yes, it should, and especially as you look at like new platforms that we're launching, we're certainly taking advantage of a lot of this, I'll call core technologies that really ultimately guarantee the value for the customer. So if you think about core, we call them vital organs, I think that has expanded and those platforms largely will reflect that. So it's a growing penetration of our products into these future platforms. Well, the sector will benefit from the build, this is a positive for Wabtec, I think there is a couple of opportunities here on both fronts, I think certainly in transit, I think we'll see some of that reflected in terms of some of the opportunities we have, but also on the freight side as we talk about some of the technology development, those are some of the discussions that continue in terms of really government supports to accelerate some of the elements of decarbonization and efficiency for our customers. So we see it largely as positive news and something that will benefit rail and will benefit us. Thank you. So I'd be thinking about sequential improvements as you go into the second half of the year. There is of course an element sometimes of seasonality between third and fourth quarter, traditionally we would have seen third quarter, I'm going to call especially stronger with some of the elements of the mix, but I'll call sequential improvement. Pat.. From an EPS perspective. Yes. So, here I'll emphasize the element that we will expand margins this year and we'll continue to expand as we go into next year, I think it would be worth taking some time offline with you just walk you through some of these elements as mix certainly plays out through especially the element here of the year per se, but that's variation on quarter-over-quarter. I think, again 50 basis points, margin improvement going into the second half of the year. We're going to be better than the 50 basis points and profitable growth ahead. Pat? So the short answer is, in terms of incrementals, yes we expect that. Go ahead . Thank you. So when you think about margin expansion, we have not breaking that out on freight, We haven't guided that specifically but for transits we have guided to 100 basis points and we continue to be on that track. So that's part of the guidance, that includes continue to expand transit margins year-over-year by more than 100 basis points for this year. And on freights, we've also, I think being very clear about margin expansion there to, so I think that 50 basis points towards more to really make sure we give a framework of how we expect margins to grow into the second half of the year with greater than 50 basis points overall expansion when you look at the segments combined. Maybe just to add on, in terms of rebound. I mean we expect more of a gradual pace here into the second half of the year. So the comps are again different. I think one of the things that we're seeing is a stronger demand for reliable power and the newer locomotives are running and running. I'm going to call, harder, so more megawatt hours. So that's what I think largely drives a continuation of some of the dynamics you see in services. So we see stronger services ahead, not necessarily a slowdown going into the second half."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. I'd like to turn the conference call over to Miss Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Wabtec's first quarter 2021 earnings call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, Pat Dugan; and Senior VP of Finance, John Mastalerz.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Turning to slide three, we continue to see a recovery across the global freight and transit rail markets, with North American freight volumes and equipment utilization sequentially improving in the first quarter, and investments in transit infrastructure are continuing. This directional trends along with the focus performance of our team and execution against our strategic plan are reflected in our first quarter results. Total sales for the quarter were $1.8 billion. This was largely driven by international freight markets services and a recovery in transit, but offset by continued weakness in the North America OEM market. Adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, driven by lean initiatives, cost actions and favorable mix from mining and mods. Cash conversion was strong, with cash flow from operations of $292 million. Cash generation was due in large part to good working capital management, allowing us to deliver on our financial priorities, including strategic acquisition of Nordco, which I'll touch upon more in a moment. Total multiyear backlog was $21.7 billion, up sequentially over the prior quarter, providing us better visibility into 2021 and beyond. Overall, we ended the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.89, a strong enforcement that our teams are continuing to take the necessary steps to control what we can deliver long term growth of the company and increase shareholder value. In the area of synergies, we're on track to deliver the full run rate of $250 million in synergies this year, and we have positioned the company for long term profitable growth. In the first quarter, we exited all shared service agreements stemming from the huge transportation merger ahead of schedule. This was a tremendous execution by the team on a complex transaction.\nPat Dugan: Thanks, Rafael, and good morning everyone. We had a solid operational start to the year despite the challenges in our North America, OEM markets and ongoing disruption from the pandemic. We demonstrated our ability to deliver on synergies, generate cash flow, invest for the future, and position Wabtec for profitable growth. Turning to slide four, our view of the first quarter in more detail. Sales for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, which reflects a 5% decrease versus the prior year, driven by lower North America OE freight markets as a result of the disruption caused by the pandemic. For the quarter, operating income was $192 million, and adjusted operating income was $277 million, which was down 9% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income, excluded pre-tax expenses of $85 million, of which $70 million was for non-cash amortization and $15 million of restructuring and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Nordco, along with restructuring due to the 2021 locomotive volumes and restructuring in our UK operations. Adjusted operating margin was 60 basis points lower than the first quarter last year, but up 110 basis points from the fourth quarter. Versus last year, adjusted operating margin was impacted by under-absorption costs at our manufacturing facilities, stemming from fewer locomotive deliveries, as well as sales mix impacted from lower digital electronics and a higher level of transit sale. At March 31st, our multiyear backlog was $21.7 billion, up quarter-over-quarter, a rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multi-year, was $5.7 billion and continues to provide good visibility into the year. Looking at some of the detailed line items for the first quarter, adjusted SG&A declined to 2% year-over-year to $224 million. This was the result of cost actions during the downturn, and excludes $11 million of restructuring and transaction expenses. SG&A expense benefited from headcount reductions and the realization of synergies.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide eight, let's look at some of the market dynamics by segments. Overall, we're seeing a gradual recovery across most end markets as global economic activity improves. And we're continuing to monitor the evolving COVID situation in regions like India. This aligns with what you've heard from our customers, as well. While we continue to work through the trough in the North American market, where new local orders remain stagnant, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement in freight volumes and a broad recovery across the agriculture, intermodal and industrial markets. Locomotive parking after peaking to a record high in 2020 are improving as a result of increased freight traffic and demand stemming from weather disruptions during the quarter. We expect the demand for reliability and productivity to improve as railroads continue to recover. This will put us in a position of strength across our freight portfolio. When it comes to North America rail car build, rail cars are coming back into use, more than 20% of the North American rail car fleet remains in storage, but it's back to pre-COVID levels. Industry orders for new rail cars remain weak and forecast estimate the rail car build this year to be below 30,000 cars. We have a strong order pipeline internationally, and we expect long term revenue growth in several of these markets going forward. And in mining, market conditions are also improving. Transitioning to the transit sector, ridership is uneven, but recovering as economies open up. We are watching short term dynamics as the pandemic evolves in several geographies, including India and Europe. Overall, the long term market drivers for passenger transport remains strong and infrastructure spending for green initiatives continues to be a focus, especially as governments globally turn to rail for clean, safe and efficient transport. Turning to guidance for the year. We are updating our sales guidance to $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion and updating adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.05 to $4.30. This largely reflects upside from the acquisition of Nordco, our operational execution to date, and visibility to backlog. Consistent with our initial forecast for 2021, with more growth weighted to the second half of the year, we expect second quarter earnings only slightly higher than the first quarter. This is in line with the positive and gradual trend in our freight markets. That said, we are seeing disruption from the resurgence of COVID, especially in a key region for us like India, and we will continue to take swift and necessary action as conditions evolve. Finally, we remain confident in delivering strong cash generation for the year, as well as margin expansion to prioritize cost actions. Turning to slide nine, and to conclude, I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the first quarter, despite a challenging environment. As we go forward, we will continue to lean into the strong long-term fundamentals of the company and remain committed to executing on our strategic plan. This includes reducing costs and executing on synergies, driving margin expansion across our freight and transit segments, generating strong cash flow, and delivering long term profitable growth. As we've said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose, to move and to improve the world. And our teams globally live up to this mission every day. After demonstrating a strong performance in 2020, and in the first quarter of 2021, I'm confident that this company will drive profitable long term growth and be a leader in transitioning our customers and the industry to a more sustainable future. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions.  We are now ready for our first question.\nOperator:  First question comes from Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi everyone, this is  for Jerry Revich. With investments stepping up in the decarbonization product portfolio, I'm wondering if you can provide any details on the proportion of total R&D related to next generation fuel technologies?\nRafael Santana: We're continuing to step up investments there. And I think we've been clear around the 6% to 7% range of investments tied to the overall sales. We're very much committed to lead the path here to decarbonization. We're working on a number of areas with customers, those include really developing some of the elements of upgrade kits. We're working on a number of areas to introduce biofuels, renewable fuels, but taking all the way to electric. And we're also, of course, working along the lines to lead in fuel sales. And that's kind of the stairway we see on progressing through it.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, and then, I'm just wondering if you can comment on the pace of mods activity and sort of how that's trending in 2021, how that compares to 2020?\nRafael Santana: We've had a significant step up, healthy double digit growth, you see that reflected in the first quarter where we have significant positive from that and we believe mods will continue to be an area of growth for us. It's clearly a pathway for us to introduce, what I call, upgrades into the fleet and make them more fuel-efficient, make them safer, and more overall, just efficient.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Justin Long of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJustin Long : Thanks, and good morning. I wanted to ask about the guidance. And I was curious if you could share the revenue and EPS impact that you're baking in from the Nordco acquisition this year? And if you set that acquisition aside, can you just talk from a high level about any other changes that you've made to some of the assumptions that are underlying that 2021 guidance?\nRafael Santana: Let me start and then I'll let Pat continue, but we have narrowed the guidance. We have raised the midpoints given the strong operational strikes of the year, I think in the quarter the positives include mining, executional modernizations. And so, we continue to see strong numbers around locomotives being on part and we also have the acquisition of Nordco. At the same time, Justin, we continue to see supply chain headwinds, with disruptions driven by COVID. I think most impactful is situation we currently have in India, which we're falling on, but certainly had wins when it comes to transportation costs, and commodity prices over all of that is reflected in the guidance we've provided. I'd say, overall momentum is positive. And we are continuing to see a gradual recovery across most of our end markets.\nPat Dugan: Hey, Justin. So this is Pat. We're similar to what we had disclosed when we did the earnings -- the press release on the Nordco acquisition, about $175 million of sales on an annual basis and $14 million of EBITDA for on an annual basis. So we bought it basically at the end of the first quarter, beginning of second quarter. So it kind of pro rata for the rest of the year. The EPS impact, we've talked about it, is around $0.06 for the full year. So, that's included in the guidance and gave us a lot of the confidence, obviously, to increase the bottom end of the range. Plus, some of our good performance so far ultimately where we got it today.\nJustin Long: Okay, great. That's helpful. And secondly, I wanted to follow up, Rafael, on something you mentioned a couple times on parked locomotives. Could you give us a sense for how locomotive utilization has recently trended? And what percentage of the fleet is still in storage today? And then also, as you answer that, I'm curious what percentage of that stored fleet you feel like is actually usable, because on the rail car side we always hear that we're effectively fully utilized with, call it, mid-teens, maybe low teens percentage of that fleet and storage? So we'd love to get your thoughts around that.\nRafael Santana: So just overall, the industry is not back to pre-COVID levels yet, from just the locomotive parkings perspective, we're still good with the progress especially regarding our fleets. I think we're ahead of the overall industry, which is a positive for us, when we look at our overall fleets operating globally. So that's certainly a positive trend. So you still have a little bit, I think last from units that were part, what are called post-COVID. Now, and when you look at the unit storage part, pre-COVID, those units, it's a smaller number that can potentially be utilized in here. So I think momentum is positive, we're going to continue to watch that closely here, especially as we're going to the second half of the year. And we're especially pleased with the performance we're having with customers in terms of reliability and availability, which ultimately is really the differentiator for us to winning more share of wallet. So, positives. The last piece out mentioned, you've probably seen a number of customers are looking for, what I call, spare power available out there, including some recent announcements, I'll say the good news is, those are Wabtec locomotives, it's  positive for us.\nJustin Long : Great, that's helpful. I appreciate the time. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group : Hey, thanks, good morning. Just going back to the guidance here. So it looks like you're assuming the second half is about 30% higher than the first half of the year from an earnings standpoint, give or take, and we don't typically see that level of seasonality. Can you just help us understand what's driving such a big ramp in the second half of the year?\nRafael Santana: Scott, I think consistent with initial forecasts we have for 2021, we have more growth weighted to the second half of the year. I think in that regard, we're continuing to see sequential improvements in the first quarter. If you think about your orders to book to bill, it's increased to 1.2, some of these are multiyear orders, while there's an impact in 2021, the impact goes beyond 2021. I think our pipeline of deals has continued to strengthen, so I think there's just good momentum coming out of a tough year being last year and we have also good progress quarter today. Our 12 month rolling backlog is up about 3.5%, and we've got good momentum and to focus really on convertibility of our pipeline of orders into this year and building forward. I think just start with regards to second quarter May day  is -- we -- as previously discussed, I think we've got some elements of volatility, especially tied to COVID disruptions. We think those are contained very much into the quarter. But that's the situation we'll continue to monitor, especially with regards to India, which is important market for us.\nScott Group : Okay, just a follow up there. So is the second half more about transit or freight or domestic versus international? Just some additional color would be great.\nRafael Santana: I think international markets continue to be robust, if you think about it, just in terms of sales, we've grown our business more internationally than in the US. So I think largely the North American market is going to be tied to the continued on parking of locomotives. Internationally, I think growth has been, call it, more robust in some ways, the team is very much focused on convertibility, we've got some very foreign opportunities around the OE side that teams working to convert between here second and third quarter. So, those are critical elements of continuing to build profitable growth.\nScott Group: Would you say international is back at pre-COVID levels?\nRafael Santana: I'd say largely, when you think about the services from ; Scott, I think there's room for a lot more momentum forward. And if you think about it, on how much of our business was, let's say, last year, international versus now, it's gained about five basis points in terms of momentum there. So you think about it, we're probably at a rate close to 65% in the first quarter with international. So that gives you a sense of our both the strength there, but the weakness in North America.\nScott Group: Okay, thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Next question is from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about freight and maybe how we can think about in the context of that ramp in the second half of the year, how do you think about sort of incremental margins in that business? I know you have the synergies that you're working through, but fixed costs absorption, obviously, has been one of the challenges for you as the volume and revenue dynamic has been more challenging over the course of the last several quarters. So is that something where we could see potentially somewhat large snapback as we move into the second half of the year?\nRafael Santana: Let me answer in two ways. Number one, we are committed to improve margins on both the freight and the transit side. On the transit side, I think we've been more clear in terms of what we expect that to be. And the team is certainly working towards striving 100 base points, we expect improvement on the freight side, we're working through some of those dynamics here, taking the necessary actions. When it comes to the OE sides, there's probably really not much opportunity in terms of really gaining volume for the year, but there's certainly opportunity when it comes to the services side. And we also have mining really improving overall. So mining is also a positive here for us into the year. So that's just maybe the way to think about it.\nPat Dugan: Yes, Chris, what I keep reminding everybody is at quarter to quarter, there can be some margin impact from the timing of projects and the type of deliveries. But what you really need to look at the full year margin, and we talked about a transit improvement explicitly for the full company, at least a 40 basis point improvement in overall margin as we progress through the year, that's being driven by a combination of synergies being achieved, of the volumes coming back, offset a little bit by some cost and absorption items and normalization of our other costs in SG&A. But that overall improvement really is a year view and a full year view and should be considered.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And then, just picking up on the synergy comment, obviously you have a target for this year. As you think beyond 2021, what do you think the opportunity is? Obviously, you've had the combined company now for a period of time, had the opportunity to kind of go through and see what the opportunities are? And obviously, it's been a challenging macro backdrop, to say the least. As we go into 2022 and maybe get on more firmer footing, can you give us a sense of what you think the potential sort of bigger-picture synergy opportunities might be?\nRafael Santana: I think I'll qualify those beyond this year last about synergies. I think we're really working hard to make sure that we progress with a lean culture approach. And I think there is a lot to be done there. I think we've started in a number of key and critical sites. And think more in terms of how we think about productivity gains, how we can change some of the work around really rationalizing our footprint, doing more, I think some of you think about acquisition of Nordco. I think it provides us a good opportunity to expand internationally and utilize that footprint of customers and a volume recovery will also be positive in that regard. So it's all around productivity, efficiency, really lean mindsets, and make sure that we drive productivity.\nPat Dugan: Yes, I would just add to that is, we've tried to be very disciplined about how we look at synergies and communicate that, because it was such a big part of the strategic rationale putting the companies together, but truthfully, the DNA of the company has always been about productivity gains, lean initiatives, all the things that Rafael just referred to, so we just continuously look at how we can improve margin going into future years.\nRafael Santana: Largely, if you think about our sites, there has been a focus here today, especially in 15 of them. We got to expand that to really drive broader impact in terms of productivity moving forward.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo, please go ahead. \nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just turning to the digital side, you know, kind of like your comments suggested an incredibly active market and the guidance for flattish growth, it certainly leads to that as well. Could you maybe help us understand the progression of digital through the year to get to that flattish? I mean, it sounds like it's going to be a significantly stronger second half for you. Is this something where the time from order to I would say implementation is pretty short, that gives you that comfort here?\nRafael Santana : So Allison, I think we continue to see a strong commitment here from customers. We certainly saw that internationally. Our book-to-bill was strong on both fourth quarter of last year and first quarter this year. So that just provides back into what I just said. But customers, when you look at last year, they pushed out some of those investments due to COVID. With that being said both efficiency, productivity and safety remain an imperative. We expect those multi-year awards to continue. The team is very focused on compatibility for the year at this point. So with the strong book-to-bill we saw some of that impact beyond this year. So really a lot of focus on convertibility for this year at this point, we're continuing to invest in the business that business will continue to provide long term growth for us. I think there is more an element here of delay and keep in mind also the element of locomotives shipments. Whenever ship locomotives into North America that goes with the significant number what I call digital software and hardware. So with that drop, we're not seeing that. So that's another element of being packed that I just want to highlight.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. Thank you. And then just on the lines of locomotives, the flex drive, you know, that you completed the test in revenue service. You mentioned some interest in the locomotive, you know, how should we think about those in terms of the quality, the inquiries. Is something that, you know, could be revenue generating and sort of \u201822 whereas of more of a \u201823 timeframe for you?\nRafael Santana : Allison, interest is strong, we have proposals outs. That would not be an impact for next year specifically, but we expect a battery electric to be part of long term growth with the company. And so we see a number of areas where that could be applied. So we're having some strong discussions with customers. And this really combines with a strong focus from the ESG side. And I think the flash drive is very unique product to address these challenges. So I do expect that momentum to continue and we're working with customers and the number of pilots out there.\nAllison Poliniak: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Alcott of Cowen. Please go ahead. \nMatt Alcott: Good morning. Thank you. So I think you're a backlog you're total backlog increased by $80 million sequentially from December. But your 12 month backlog increased by about $186 million. So I was wondering if there was some pull forward from the out years or if he has had any cancellations in the years that were more than offset by new orders for the next 12 month if that makes any sense? \nRafael Santana : We let me start with the end part of your question. So we have not had cancellations. Yet, I think we're continuing to see momentum on both segments, where it fits freight and whether it fits transits. Of course, there's an element of projects into our business, which can lead to some lumpiness on quarter-by-quarter, but momentum is good. We see that with the book-to-build in quarter today. So we've also had, I think, a good momentum to continue on that trend; that's kind of that.\nPat Dugan: Yes, so I would also there's an element of FX that impacted the backlog number. And, you know, if you imagine that our international operations are more multiyear projects, and the International impact of those can be spread out over a longer period of time. And we have foreign exchange hurt, our backlog number by about $170 million. And so I think that FX impact is more overly weighted into the full number, not the 12 month number. \nMatt Alcott: That's helpful. And then just for my second question. It's been over a year now, since the beginning of the pandemic. And there were a lot of concerns about the long term prospects of transit, patent referral. Now, you know, do you have any more clarity from your conversations with customers about a potential secular shift in transit long term?\nRafael Santana : We're seeing both customers and governments very committed to transit overall. So with that, just reiterating no cancellations of orders received projects. So moving forwards, you see very much systems continue to operate. And that's shown in the resilience of our service numbers. On the top of that, I think we're continuing to see just transit part of the solution in terms of how you de-carbonize things moving forward, I think there's a number of improvements being thought through but strong fundamentals for that business moving forward.\nMatt Alcott: Thank you very much.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question from Ari Rosa, Bank of America. Please, go ahead.\nAri Rosa: Yes, hi. Good morning. So, you've mentioned COVID impacts in India and obviously, we're seeing regrettable surge in cases there. Maybe you could go into a little more detail around kind of what you're seeing there, what you think the potential impacts could be? And if you've had any discussions with customers there? I know, India has been a big focus area in terms of the growth. Do you see that kind of shifting the timeline there or the prospects?\nRafael Santana: Well, so first, no really chuffed in terms of the prospects as you look term. In fact, if you think about freight volumes in India, it's actually positive year to-date. So just give your perspective. This is really more tied to disruptions associated with lockdown, certainly impacting our suppliers, sub-suppliers, our customers as well. We're following up that closely to this point. We see it more as an impact, potentially to the quarter. But we'll continue to monitor and take the necessary actions here and we'll report on any relevant changes.\nAri Rosa: Got it, understood. Very helpful. And then just if we could return to kind of the North American market, maybe you could give your latest thoughts on where we are in terms of emerging from a cycle, compared to past cycles. How do things look in terms of the timeline? Do you think by 2022, 2023, we could get back to kind of a more normalized rate of demand from customers? Or do you see this kind of lingering for longer?\nRafael Santana: It's good to see the momentum here. We're walking into the first half of the year. We are working with customers closely and watching on that momentum towards the second half of the year, which I think will be determinant in terms of how customers will think about their fleet strategies, which will include contributing  modernizations are certainly opportunities here for parts as they continue to consider on parking of units and new locomotives is also going to be part of the discussions with customers. So, I see that largely as a second half discussion based on concerning momentum for the first half of the year.\nAri Rosa: Between locomotives and rail cars, do you typically see one piece of that business lead the other?\nRafael Santana: I think it tends to be connected, but just could be  just tied to the levels of parking. If you think about freight cars, we're already back to pre-COVID levels. If you think from an overall locomotive fleet, we're not yet back to pre-COVID level. So, there could be some elements of delays there, which are sometimes really driven by just think about velocity and dwell times in the network, which ultimately could be determinant factors on these.\nAri Rosa: Got it. Great. Thank you for time.\nRafael Santana: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Saree Boroditsky at Jefferies. Please, go ahead.\nSaree Boroditsky: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Locomotives were down almost 6%  in the quarter and you know this is largely due to North American shipments. You've been positive on the long-term view of international locomotives. But just for clarity, were international locomotive also down in the quarter? And should they decline for the full year?\nRafael Santana: I think we're seeing more of growth opportunities when I think about the international markets. So, to your point, I think largely the impacts here in the quarter was driven by a drop by 50% on those. I think if you look at specially our equipment business, I think you've got to keep in mind that some of that we've been able to offset by really double-digit growth in mining. So that's being a positive and I think even more significant growth in our mods business. So, there's opportunities there.\nPat Dugan: So, Saree, just said specific to your question about the variance year-over-year is that we had a large number of international loco shipments in Q1 of 2020, specific to the Middle East. I think we've talked about this at various time. So we had an overweighting of the of the locos in the first quarter of last year versus this year. But our full year locomotive phasing for international purposes are going to be largely the same as for the full year.\nRafael Santana: And we've got long-term orders there tied to some key markets, which includes India, includes Brazil, includes Kazakhstan. So that's the audit I'll keep in mind.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great. And then could you just provide a little bit more color on free margins? You've done a great job realizing synergies that are obviously being impacted by under absorption. When do you think you'd get back to 2019-levels? And what revenue do you need for that?\nPat Dugan: I think I don't know that we've talked about any kind of breakeven or kind of contribution margin impact. I think the way to look at it is that last year, the decremental margin on the lower volume was in the low 20% range. I think that you would imagine, you would expect that we would have a similar kind of impact with volume recovering. But you always have to consider the mix in the timing, and projects, how that volume comes back? Obviously services and parts and modernizations really are -- and digital electronics tend to be positive mix. Some of the OE elements of this can be below the company average. Ultimately, what we're focused on is that as we talked about earlier on the call, is that we're achieving synergies, driving lean initiatives, productivity gains and all the normal, continuous improvement-type activity that Wabtec has always focused on.\nRafael Santana: We're committed to improve margins across Wabtec and that includes on both segments for this year and that's really what we're driving forward going to next year as well.\nSaree Boroditsky: Okay, but just given that service parts and modern digital are all positive to the margin mix, and you have synergies, is it fair to say that you should be able to reach 2019 margins on a lower revenue base?\nPat Dugan: I think at this point, to give that kind of guidance in when we would get to back to 2019 margin is a little early. But we're committed to that driving that margin up. I think that it's early in 2021 and we see a lot of really good things happening with the volume recovery and I think we've considered that in the guidance for the year.\nSaree Boroditsky: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nPat Dugan: Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Kristine Kubacki. Please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Nick. Thank you for everyone's participation today.

            "content": "Thanks, Rafael, and good morning everyone. We had a solid operational start to the year despite the challenges in our North America, OEM markets and ongoing disruption from the pandemic. We demonstrated our ability to deliver on synergies, generate cash flow, invest for the future, and position Wabtec for profitable growth. Turning to slide four, our view of the first quarter in more detail. Sales for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, which reflects a 5% decrease versus the prior year, driven by lower North America OE freight markets as a result of the disruption caused by the pandemic. For the quarter, operating income was $192 million, and adjusted operating income was $277 million, which was down 9% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income, excluded pre-tax expenses of $85 million, of which $70 million was for non-cash amortization and $15 million of restructuring and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Nordco, along with restructuring due to the 2021 locomotive volumes and restructuring in our UK operations. Adjusted operating margin was 60 basis points lower than the first quarter last year, but up 110 basis points from the fourth quarter. Versus last year, adjusted operating margin was impacted by under-absorption costs at our manufacturing facilities, stemming from fewer locomotive deliveries, as well as sales mix impacted from lower digital electronics and a higher level of transit sale. At March 31st, our multiyear backlog was $21.7 billion, up quarter-over-quarter, a rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multi-year, was $5.7 billion and continues to provide good visibility into the year. Looking at some of the detailed line items for the first quarter, adjusted SG&A declined to 2% year-over-year to $224 million. This was the result of cost actions during the downturn, and excludes $11 million of restructuring and transaction expenses. SG&A expense benefited from headcount reductions and the realization of synergies. Hey, Justin. So this is Pat. We're similar to what we had disclosed when we did the earnings -- the press release on the Nordco acquisition, about $175 million of sales on an annual basis and $14 million of EBITDA for on an annual basis. So we bought it basically at the end of the first quarter, beginning of second quarter. So it kind of pro rata for the rest of the year. The EPS impact, we've talked about it, is around $0.06 for the full year. So, that's included in the guidance and gave us a lot of the confidence, obviously, to increase the bottom end of the range. Plus, some of our good performance so far ultimately where we got it today. Yes, Chris, what I keep reminding everybody is at quarter to quarter, there can be some margin impact from the timing of projects and the type of deliveries. But what you really need to look at the full year margin, and we talked about a transit improvement explicitly for the full company, at least a 40 basis point improvement in overall margin as we progress through the year, that's being driven by a combination of synergies being achieved, of the volumes coming back, offset a little bit by some cost and absorption items and normalization of our other costs in SG&A. But that overall improvement really is a year view and a full year view and should be considered. Yes, I would just add to that is, we've tried to be very disciplined about how we look at synergies and communicate that, because it was such a big part of the strategic rationale putting the companies together, but truthfully, the DNA of the company has always been about productivity gains, lean initiatives, all the things that Rafael just referred to, so we just continuously look at how we can improve margin going into future years. Yes, so I would also there's an element of FX that impacted the backlog number. And, you know, if you imagine that our international operations are more multiyear projects, and the International impact of those can be spread out over a longer period of time. And we have foreign exchange hurt, our backlog number by about $170 million. And so I think that FX impact is more overly weighted into the full number, not the 12 month number. So, Saree, just said specific to your question about the variance year-over-year is that we had a large number of international loco shipments in Q1 of 2020, specific to the Middle East. I think we've talked about this at various time. So we had an overweighting of the of the locos in the first quarter of last year versus this year. But our full year locomotive phasing for international purposes are going to be largely the same as for the full year. I think I don't know that we've talked about any kind of breakeven or kind of contribution margin impact. I think the way to look at it is that last year, the decremental margin on the lower volume was in the low 20% range. I think that you would imagine, you would expect that we would have a similar kind of impact with volume recovering. But you always have to consider the mix in the timing, and projects, how that volume comes back? Obviously services and parts and modernizations really are -- and digital electronics tend to be positive mix. Some of the OE elements of this can be below the company average. Ultimately, what we're focused on is that as we talked about earlier on the call, is that we're achieving synergies, driving lean initiatives, productivity gains and all the normal, continuous improvement-type activity that Wabtec has always focused on. I think at this point, to give that kind of guidance in when we would get to back to 2019 margin is a little early. But we're committed to that driving that margin up. I think that it's early in 2021 and we see a lot of really good things happening with the volume recovery and I think we've considered that in the guidance for the year. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Turning to slide three, we continue to see a recovery across the global freight and transit rail markets, with North American freight volumes and equipment utilization sequentially improving in the first quarter, and investments in transit infrastructure are continuing. This directional trends along with the focus performance of our team and execution against our strategic plan are reflected in our first quarter results. Total sales for the quarter were $1.8 billion. This was largely driven by international freight markets services and a recovery in transit, but offset by continued weakness in the North America OEM market. Adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, driven by lean initiatives, cost actions and favorable mix from mining and mods. Cash conversion was strong, with cash flow from operations of $292 million. Cash generation was due in large part to good working capital management, allowing us to deliver on our financial priorities, including strategic acquisition of Nordco, which I'll touch upon more in a moment. Total multiyear backlog was $21.7 billion, up sequentially over the prior quarter, providing us better visibility into 2021 and beyond. Overall, we ended the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.89, a strong enforcement that our teams are continuing to take the necessary steps to control what we can deliver long term growth of the company and increase shareholder value. In the area of synergies, we're on track to deliver the full run rate of $250 million in synergies this year, and we have positioned the company for long term profitable growth. In the first quarter, we exited all shared service agreements stemming from the huge transportation merger ahead of schedule. This was a tremendous execution by the team on a complex transaction. Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide eight, let's look at some of the market dynamics by segments. Overall, we're seeing a gradual recovery across most end markets as global economic activity improves. And we're continuing to monitor the evolving COVID situation in regions like India. This aligns with what you've heard from our customers, as well. While we continue to work through the trough in the North American market, where new local orders remain stagnant, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement in freight volumes and a broad recovery across the agriculture, intermodal and industrial markets. Locomotive parking after peaking to a record high in 2020 are improving as a result of increased freight traffic and demand stemming from weather disruptions during the quarter. We expect the demand for reliability and productivity to improve as railroads continue to recover. This will put us in a position of strength across our freight portfolio. When it comes to North America rail car build, rail cars are coming back into use, more than 20% of the North American rail car fleet remains in storage, but it's back to pre-COVID levels. Industry orders for new rail cars remain weak and forecast estimate the rail car build this year to be below 30,000 cars. We have a strong order pipeline internationally, and we expect long term revenue growth in several of these markets going forward. And in mining, market conditions are also improving. Transitioning to the transit sector, ridership is uneven, but recovering as economies open up. We are watching short term dynamics as the pandemic evolves in several geographies, including India and Europe. Overall, the long term market drivers for passenger transport remains strong and infrastructure spending for green initiatives continues to be a focus, especially as governments globally turn to rail for clean, safe and efficient transport. Turning to guidance for the year. We are updating our sales guidance to $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion and updating adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.05 to $4.30. This largely reflects upside from the acquisition of Nordco, our operational execution to date, and visibility to backlog. Consistent with our initial forecast for 2021, with more growth weighted to the second half of the year, we expect second quarter earnings only slightly higher than the first quarter. This is in line with the positive and gradual trend in our freight markets. That said, we are seeing disruption from the resurgence of COVID, especially in a key region for us like India, and we will continue to take swift and necessary action as conditions evolve. Finally, we remain confident in delivering strong cash generation for the year, as well as margin expansion to prioritize cost actions. Turning to slide nine, and to conclude, I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the first quarter, despite a challenging environment. As we go forward, we will continue to lean into the strong long-term fundamentals of the company and remain committed to executing on our strategic plan. This includes reducing costs and executing on synergies, driving margin expansion across our freight and transit segments, generating strong cash flow, and delivering long term profitable growth. As we've said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose, to move and to improve the world. And our teams globally live up to this mission every day. After demonstrating a strong performance in 2020, and in the first quarter of 2021, I'm confident that this company will drive profitable long term growth and be a leader in transitioning our customers and the industry to a more sustainable future. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. We're continuing to step up investments there. And I think we've been clear around the 6% to 7% range of investments tied to the overall sales. We're very much committed to lead the path here to decarbonization. We're working on a number of areas with customers, those include really developing some of the elements of upgrade kits. We're working on a number of areas to introduce biofuels, renewable fuels, but taking all the way to electric. And we're also, of course, working along the lines to lead in fuel sales. And that's kind of the stairway we see on progressing through it. We've had a significant step up, healthy double digit growth, you see that reflected in the first quarter where we have significant positive from that and we believe mods will continue to be an area of growth for us. It's clearly a pathway for us to introduce, what I call, upgrades into the fleet and make them more fuel-efficient, make them safer, and more overall, just efficient. Let me start and then I'll let Pat continue, but we have narrowed the guidance. We have raised the midpoints given the strong operational strikes of the year, I think in the quarter the positives include mining, executional modernizations. And so, we continue to see strong numbers around locomotives being on part and we also have the acquisition of Nordco. At the same time, Justin, we continue to see supply chain headwinds, with disruptions driven by COVID. I think most impactful is situation we currently have in India, which we're falling on, but certainly had wins when it comes to transportation costs, and commodity prices over all of that is reflected in the guidance we've provided. I'd say, overall momentum is positive. And we are continuing to see a gradual recovery across most of our end markets. So just overall, the industry is not back to pre-COVID levels yet, from just the locomotive parkings perspective, we're still good with the progress especially regarding our fleets. I think we're ahead of the overall industry, which is a positive for us, when we look at our overall fleets operating globally. So that's certainly a positive trend. So you still have a little bit, I think last from units that were part, what are called post-COVID. Now, and when you look at the unit storage part, pre-COVID, those units, it's a smaller number that can potentially be utilized in here. So I think momentum is positive, we're going to continue to watch that closely here, especially as we're going to the second half of the year. And we're especially pleased with the performance we're having with customers in terms of reliability and availability, which ultimately is really the differentiator for us to winning more share of wallet. So, positives. The last piece out mentioned, you've probably seen a number of customers are looking for, what I call, spare power available out there, including some recent announcements, I'll say the good news is, those are Wabtec locomotives, it's  positive for us. Scott, I think consistent with initial forecasts we have for 2021, we have more growth weighted to the second half of the year. I think in that regard, we're continuing to see sequential improvements in the first quarter. If you think about your orders to book to bill, it's increased to 1.2, some of these are multiyear orders, while there's an impact in 2021, the impact goes beyond 2021. I think our pipeline of deals has continued to strengthen, so I think there's just good momentum coming out of a tough year being last year and we have also good progress quarter today. Our 12 month rolling backlog is up about 3.5%, and we've got good momentum and to focus really on convertibility of our pipeline of orders into this year and building forward. I think just start with regards to second quarter May day  is -- we -- as previously discussed, I think we've got some elements of volatility, especially tied to COVID disruptions. We think those are contained very much into the quarter. But that's the situation we'll continue to monitor, especially with regards to India, which is important market for us. I think international markets continue to be robust, if you think about it, just in terms of sales, we've grown our business more internationally than in the US. So I think largely the North American market is going to be tied to the continued on parking of locomotives. Internationally, I think growth has been, call it, more robust in some ways, the team is very much focused on convertibility, we've got some very foreign opportunities around the OE side that teams working to convert between here second and third quarter. So, those are critical elements of continuing to build profitable growth. I'd say largely, when you think about the services from ; Scott, I think there's room for a lot more momentum forward. And if you think about it, on how much of our business was, let's say, last year, international versus now, it's gained about five basis points in terms of momentum there. So you think about it, we're probably at a rate close to 65% in the first quarter with international. So that gives you a sense of our both the strength there, but the weakness in North America. Let me answer in two ways. Number one, we are committed to improve margins on both the freight and the transit side. On the transit side, I think we've been more clear in terms of what we expect that to be. And the team is certainly working towards striving 100 base points, we expect improvement on the freight side, we're working through some of those dynamics here, taking the necessary actions. When it comes to the OE sides, there's probably really not much opportunity in terms of really gaining volume for the year, but there's certainly opportunity when it comes to the services side. And we also have mining really improving overall. So mining is also a positive here for us into the year. So that's just maybe the way to think about it. I think I'll qualify those beyond this year last about synergies. I think we're really working hard to make sure that we progress with a lean culture approach. And I think there is a lot to be done there. I think we've started in a number of key and critical sites. And think more in terms of how we think about productivity gains, how we can change some of the work around really rationalizing our footprint, doing more, I think some of you think about acquisition of Nordco. I think it provides us a good opportunity to expand internationally and utilize that footprint of customers and a volume recovery will also be positive in that regard. So it's all around productivity, efficiency, really lean mindsets, and make sure that we drive productivity. Largely, if you think about our sites, there has been a focus here today, especially in 15 of them. We got to expand that to really drive broader impact in terms of productivity moving forward. So Allison, I think we continue to see a strong commitment here from customers. We certainly saw that internationally. Our book-to-bill was strong on both fourth quarter of last year and first quarter this year. So that just provides back into what I just said. But customers, when you look at last year, they pushed out some of those investments due to COVID. With that being said both efficiency, productivity and safety remain an imperative. We expect those multi-year awards to continue. The team is very focused on compatibility for the year at this point. So with the strong book-to-bill we saw some of that impact beyond this year. So really a lot of focus on convertibility for this year at this point, we're continuing to invest in the business that business will continue to provide long term growth for us. I think there is more an element here of delay and keep in mind also the element of locomotives shipments. Whenever ship locomotives into North America that goes with the significant number what I call digital software and hardware. So with that drop, we're not seeing that. So that's another element of being packed that I just want to highlight. Allison, interest is strong, we have proposals outs. That would not be an impact for next year specifically, but we expect a battery electric to be part of long term growth with the company. And so we see a number of areas where that could be applied. So we're having some strong discussions with customers. And this really combines with a strong focus from the ESG side. And I think the flash drive is very unique product to address these challenges. So I do expect that momentum to continue and we're working with customers and the number of pilots out there. We let me start with the end part of your question. So we have not had cancellations. Yet, I think we're continuing to see momentum on both segments, where it fits freight and whether it fits transits. Of course, there's an element of projects into our business, which can lead to some lumpiness on quarter-by-quarter, but momentum is good. We see that with the book-to-build in quarter today. So we've also had, I think, a good momentum to continue on that trend; that's kind of that. We're seeing both customers and governments very committed to transit overall. So with that, just reiterating no cancellations of orders received projects. So moving forwards, you see very much systems continue to operate. And that's shown in the resilience of our service numbers. On the top of that, I think we're continuing to see just transit part of the solution in terms of how you de-carbonize things moving forward, I think there's a number of improvements being thought through but strong fundamentals for that business moving forward. Thank you. Well, so first, no really chuffed in terms of the prospects as you look term. In fact, if you think about freight volumes in India, it's actually positive year to-date. So just give your perspective. This is really more tied to disruptions associated with lockdown, certainly impacting our suppliers, sub-suppliers, our customers as well. We're following up that closely to this point. We see it more as an impact, potentially to the quarter. But we'll continue to monitor and take the necessary actions here and we'll report on any relevant changes. It's good to see the momentum here. We're walking into the first half of the year. We are working with customers closely and watching on that momentum towards the second half of the year, which I think will be determinant in terms of how customers will think about their fleet strategies, which will include contributing  modernizations are certainly opportunities here for parts as they continue to consider on parking of units and new locomotives is also going to be part of the discussions with customers. So, I see that largely as a second half discussion based on concerning momentum for the first half of the year. I think it tends to be connected, but just could be  just tied to the levels of parking. If you think about freight cars, we're already back to pre-COVID levels. If you think from an overall locomotive fleet, we're not yet back to pre-COVID level. So, there could be some elements of delays there, which are sometimes really driven by just think about velocity and dwell times in the network, which ultimately could be determinant factors on these. Thanks. I think we're seeing more of growth opportunities when I think about the international markets. So, to your point, I think largely the impacts here in the quarter was driven by a drop by 50% on those. I think if you look at specially our equipment business, I think you've got to keep in mind that some of that we've been able to offset by really double-digit growth in mining. So that's being a positive and I think even more significant growth in our mods business. So, there's opportunities there. And we've got long-term orders there tied to some key markets, which includes India, includes Brazil, includes Kazakhstan. So that's the audit I'll keep in mind. We're committed to improve margins across Wabtec and that includes on both segments for this year and that's really what we're driving forward going to next year as well. Thank you."

After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Wabtec's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, John Olin; and Senior Vice President of Finance, John Mastalerz. Today's slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures were posted on our website earlier today and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Some statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. I will now turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks Kristine and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s move to Slide 4, I will start with an update on our business, my perspectives in the quarter, our progress against our long-term value creation framework, and then John will cover the financials. We delivered a strong fourth quarter which is evidenced by strong sales growth, an increase in adjusted earnings per share. We achieved this despite significant headwinds, including a volatile macro environment, supply chain disruptions, and negative FX. Sales were roughly $2.3 billion, which was up 11% versus prior year.  Revenue was driven by strong performance across the freight segment, but partially offset by unfavorable FX. Total cash flow from operations was $410 million, which brings year-to-date cash flow to over $1 billion, achieving a full year cash conversion rate of over 90%. Overall, our financial position remains strong. We continue to allocate capital to maximize shareholder returns by investing for future growth, executing on a strategic M&A, and returning cash to shareholders.  Total multiyear backlog was $22.4 billion up $272 million year-over-year and excluding the headwinds from foreign exchange, backlog was up $680 million or up 3% from last year. We continued our progress against our long-term growth strategies. Overall, we have a strong finish to the year despite a number of challenges. As a result of this strong performance and our confidence in the future, our Board of Directors reauthorized a $750 million share buyback and approved the 13% increase in the quarterly dividend. We entered 2023 with strength and momentum across the portfolio and we're well positioned to continue to drive profitable growth even with near-term uncertainty and volatility in the global economy. Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about our end market conditions in more details. As we look at key metrics across our freight businesses, we remain encouraged by underlying business momentum and the strong pipeline of opportunities. North America carloads were down slightly in the quarter, but locomotive parkings are down from the same time last year despite lower freight traffic. We continue to see significant opportunities in demand for modernizations and new locomotives as our customers invest in their aging fleets and they also place a greater focus on reliability, productivity, and fuel efficiency. Looking at the North American rail car build, demand for rail cars continued to show strength with industry backlog about 60,000 cars. Railcars in storage are below pre COVID levels with about 18% of the North American railcar fleet in storage. As a result, industry orders for new rail cars continued to improve and the industry outlook for 2023 is for about 40,000 to 45,000 cars to be delivered. Overall, we believe we have an opportunity to continue building significant long-term momentum with growth in modernizations in new locomotive sales, in rail car builds, and enrolling stock. Internationally, activity has also continued to show positive signs and will continue to execute on a strong pipeline of opportunities. Finally, transitioning to the transit sector, the long-term secular drivers are positive as the globe continues to increase investments in clean, safe, and efficient transportation solutions. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few recent business highlights. We recently secured additional Tier 4 locomotive orders in North America. These orders now total over 100 units to be delivered across 2023 and 2024. We also signed two international deals in Asia and South America to deliver new rolling stock and also won two international long term service contracts in South America and in Kazakhstan. Finally, Wabtec\u2019s FLXdrive locomotive was recognized for sustainable innovation by the Business Intelligence Group and awarded The Commercial Technology of the Year by S&P Global. Looking ahead, all of this demonstrates the strong pipeline of opportunities we continue to execute on. Wabtec\u2019s well positioned to continue to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers most pressing needs. Turning to Slide 7, I want to briefly touch on why we're strongly positioned to deliver resilience and more predictable earnings in volatile times. We believe our demonstrated execution combined with favorable end markets and our leading technologies and solutions will enable us to remain resilient during times of increasing volatility. This resiliency comes in part from our multiyear backlog and strong base of recurring revenues. Our multiyear backlog of over $22 billion provides visibility and support for both short and long term growth. Similarly, our base of recurring revenues of 44% of total sales, which grew by 3 percentage points in 2022, provides high margin and stable earnings. And finally, we have a track record of strong operating margin expansion across the business, as evidenced by our ability to realize price, deliver productivity, and aggressively manage costs. Now let's turn to Slide 8. To further illustrate the point of our ability to drive consistent, predictable earnings I wanted to provide more color about our combined new locomotive and modernization deliveries in North America. Over the past six years, North America and new locomotive deliveries have been challenged due to weak carload growth, PFR [ph] and COVID. Over that period, the investment in the fleet has come primarily through modernization of locomotives, but this still remains below historical replacement levels.  As we have discussed in past calls, the core North American active mainline fleet of heavy haul locomotives is made-up of roughly 16,000 locomotives. With a replacement cycle of roughly 25 years per locomotive, we estimate the annual replacement rate overtime to be over 600 new locomotives and/or modernizations per year. As you can see, the industry has been operating at roughly half of that level for the past six years. Yet, looking forward, we expect a growing age for refreshment of that fleet. And with record fleet age and growing obsolescence driven by Next Gen technologies along with the expectation of rail share gains versus truck, and the need to reduce greenhouse gases by 2030 that the demand for reliable and efficient power is increasing. This expected demand provides Wabtec the opportunity to fill our existing capacity for delivery of new and modernized locomotive solutions in an effective and efficient fashion over the next several years. Looking forward, we believe our execution combined with strength of our business, leading products, and technologies result in Wabtec being resilient through economic cycles, delivering more predictable earnings and superior shareholder returns. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results, and our overall financial performance. John.\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Rafael and good morning. Turning to Slide 9, I will review our fourth quarter results in more detail. We finished the year with another good quarter of operational and financial performance despite continued challenges in foreign currency exchange, still elevated input costs, and persistent supply chain disruptions. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.31 billion, which reflects an 11.2% increase versus the prior year. Freight segment sales were very strong up 17.1%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacting sales in our transit segment.  Q4 sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange which reduced our revenue growth in the quarter by 4.5 percentage points. For the quarter GAAP operating income was $17 million driven by higher restructuring costs. Adjusted operating margin in Q4 was 15.3% down 0.8 percentage points versus prior year. We expect that our margin to be lower in the quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. The key drivers of the year-over-year margin performance include unfavorable mix within business groups, in particular, within equipment and services due to strong sales of locomotives and modernizations versus last year's performance, some of which pushed from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and higher technology spend associated with investment in future growth and costs associated with the commercialization of the first battery electric locomotives.  GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.86, which was down 15.7% versus the fourth quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pretax charges of $32 million for restructuring, largely related to our integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec's operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. I will talk more about our progress on integration 2.0 in a moment. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.30, up 10.2% versus the prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another solid quarter of results, demonstrating the underlying strength of the business and our ability to navigate through volatile macroeconomic conditions.  Turning to Slide 10, let's review our product lines in more detail. Fourth quarter consolidated sales were strong, up 11.2% excluding foreign currency exchange, sales were up 15.7%. Equipment sales were up 14.1% from last year due to higher locomotive sales this quarter versus last year. Component sales were up 10.6% year-over-year, largely driven by higher OE railcar build. Digital Electronics sales were up a strong 34.7%, which was driven by robust demand for onboard locomotive products and software upgrades along with revenue contribution from the strategic bolt-on acquisitions of Beena Vision and ARINC earlier in the year.  Our services sales grew 16.6% versus last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher sales from a larger active fleet versus last year and increased MOD sales. Superior performance, reliability, and availability of our fleet continues to drive increased customer demand for our services and solutions. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 1.7% versus prior year to $637 million. Sales were down versus last year due to the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange. Absent the impacts of foreign currency, Transit sales would have been up 9.3%. The momentum in this segment remains positive as mega trends such as urbanization and decarbonization drive increased investments in green infrastructure.  Now moving to Slide 11. As forecasted, gross profit margin was lower driven by unfavorable mix, adverse foreign currency exchange, and higher input costs, partially offset by increased pricing and productivity. Pricing actions implemented to recover increased costs positively impacted our margins during the quarter. Mix was unfavorable, especially within our equipment and services businesses behind strong sales of locomotives and MODs. Raw material costs, while down from recent highs over the last year were up again year-over-year. Foreign currency exchange adversely impacted revenues by 4.5 percentage points and adversely impacted fourth quarter gross profits by $21 million. Finally, manufacturing costs were favorable due to productivity gains, which were partially offset by higher transportation costs. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lean initiatives.  Turning to Slide 12, for the fourth quarter, as expected, operating margin declined on both a GAAP and adjusted basis, driven by lower gross margins and increased investment in future technologies. GAAP SG&A was up $8 million versus prior year due to higher net restructuring costs related to integration 2.0. Adjusted SG&A was $271 million which was flat versus prior year, but down 1.3 percentage points as a percentage of sales. Engineering expense increased from last year according to plan. We continue to invest in engineering resources and current business opportunities but more importantly, we are investing in our future as the industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization, and safety. Now let's take a look at our segment results on Slide 13, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales were strong for the quarter, and GAAP segment operating income was $209 million for an operating margin of 12.5%, down 2 percentage points, which was impacted by increased restructuring expenses versus the year ago quarter. Segment adjusted operating income was $284 million, down 1.7 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefits of higher sales and improved productivity were offset by unfavorable mix within business groups and higher technology investments and costs associated with the commercialization of the first battery electric locomotives. Finally, segment backlog was $18.64 billion, up $139 million or 0.8% and from the end of Q4 last year. On a constant currency basis, segment backlog was up $344 million from last year.  Turning to Slide 14, transit segment sales were down 1.7%, driven by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacted segment sales by 11 percentage points. GAAP operating income was $63 million, down 2.3 percentage points, which was impacted by increased restructuring expenses versus the year ago quarter, largely related to our integration 2.0 initiative. Adjusted segment operating income increased by $7 million to $95 million, which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 14.8% and up 1.2 percentage points versus the prior year, driven by strong productivity, benefits from prior restructuring activities and disciplined cost management. Finally, transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.8 billion, up 3.6% versus a year ago. On a constant currency basis, backlog would have been up 9.2%.  Moving to Slide 15, I would like to briefly touch on our progress against our integration 2.0 initiative. Recall that during our Investor Day last March, we announced a restructuring program comprised of an estimated onetime expenses between $135 million and $165 million that would yield an incremental $75 million to $90 million of run rate cost savings by 2025. These savings were to be achieved through a combination of actions which simplify, streamline, and consolidate parts of our operations.  A great example of the actions we are taking to drive these savings occurred in the fourth quarter, including two consolidation projects across our manufacturing footprint, which will eliminate a total of four facilities and a third project focused on streamlining and optimizing our North American distribution network. With full year restructuring expenses of $46 million in 2022, we achieved an initial $5 million of savings during the year. We expect investment to increase more meaningfully in 2023 and are on track to meet our 2025 goals, positioning Wabtec to drive multiyear margin expansion.  Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 16. We had strong cash generation in the quarter. Q4 cash flow was $410 million, bringing total cash for the year to $1.04 billion for a cash conversion rate of 93%. Cash flow benefited from higher earnings but was impacted versus last year by the proactive build of inventories ahead of our 2023 growth expectations and managing supply disruptions of critical parts. Our debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter declined to 2.2 times, and our liquidity is robust at $2.29 billion. And finally, we returned a significant amount of capital back to shareholders in 2022 with $584 million returned through share repurchases and dividends. And as Rafael mentioned, our Board of Directors approved a $750 million share buyback reauthorization and increased our quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share, up 13%. As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong, and we continue to allocate capital in a balanced strategy to maximize shareholder returns.  Now moving to Slide 17, quickly recapping the year. Overall, the team delivered a strong year for all our stakeholders. Despite challenging dynamics, we drove revenue growth, expanded our operating margins, and generated robust cash flow. The resiliency of the business and strong execution provides us a solid foundation and good momentum as we enter 2023. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, John. Let's flip to Slide 18 to discuss our 2023 financial guidance. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and solutions remain strong across our product lines and our backlog continues to provide visibility into 2023 and beyond. We are committed to driving adjusted margin expansion into 2023 despite FX volatility, a still challenging cost environment, and continued investments in technology. The team is committed to driving strong top line growth while aggressively managing costs. With these factors in mind, we expect 2023 sales of $8.7 billion to $9 billion, which is up nearly 6% at the midpoint and adjusted EPS to be between $5.15 and $5.55 per share, which is up 10% at the midpoint. We expect cash flow conversion to be greater than 90%.  Now let's wrap up on Slide 19. As you heard today, our team delivered a solid quarter to finish out the strong year. We delivered on our full year commitments despite a challenging and volatile environment, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world-class team, innovative technologies, and our relentless focus on our customers. These results were in line with our five-year outlook we provided at our Investor Day last year. With strong momentum across the portfolio, increased visibility through our multiyear backlog, and relentless focus on continuous cost improvement, Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable long-term growth and maximize shareholder returns. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine?\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions. But before we do and out of consideration for others on the call, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. if you have additional questions please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Hi, good morning. \nRafael Santana: Good morning Allison.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: I want to turn to the services outlook. You noted an uptick in locomotive. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit more context on how impactful you're thinking about that for 2023, is it sort of a point offset something bigger, I know there's a lot of moving parts in that business right now, just any thoughts?\nRafael Santana: Yes. With the comment specifically with regards to services, Allison?\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Yes, yes.\nRafael Santana: Okay. Allison, I mean, we're certainly when you think about North America carloads being down year-to-date, so we're continuing to see demand for both MODs and new locomotives. I think a lot of that is really tied to driving productivity, driving efficiency, driving reliability, and [indiscernible] is certainly an element if you think about the CAPEX for Class 1s in the U.S. We see that up for the year. So those are potentially some of the headwinds could come with, I think, lower carloads right now, and we're really planning for flattish in terms of that context.  But I think what's most important is really the element of the backlog coverage that we've got for the year. It's a hedge of what we had a year ago. This is probably one of the highest 12-month backlogs we've had since 2019, which really just further strengthens our position to deliver in 2023 and last year, we have signed a number of multiyear orders, I think, for both new locomotives, but for modernizations as well. So this provides additional visibility not just in to 2023 but in the case of MODs all the way into 2025 for new locomotives beyond that. So we have a strong pipeline of deals and we continue to see good momentum in both the pipeline of deals in North America and internationally.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: No, that's great. And then just a point, you mentioned sort of that replacement level for locomotives under the assumption that you probably wouldn't reach that level this year. But how quickly, I mean, there's ESG targets and so forth, is it sort of a 2024-2025 that you think you could reach that sort of run rate for replacement there or above, just any thoughts there on how you see this walk towards that level? Thanks.\nRafael Santana: Allison, I wouldn't speculate how that will progress. But I think it was strongly still coming from the trough. And so when you look at some of the elements of the age of the fleet, continued investment to make sure you have productivity, but you also drive reliability on that fleet and the elements of ESG, I think we have a lot of opportunity here to help customers bridge that existing power into cleaner power. So it comes with upgrades and incorporating technologies like hybrid and things like that. So I think we're well positioned in that regard.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Great, thank you. \nRafael Santana: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead. \nJustin Long: Thanks. I wanted to ask about freight margins. I know you were expecting negative mix and some sequential weakness there, but the magnitude of the weakness was a bit surprising, especially when you look at the different businesses within freight, digital electronics and services revenue was up pretty significantly on a sequential basis and equipment revenue was actually down a bit. So I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the mix impact you saw maybe within those different businesses, and I know you called out the tech costs as well, so maybe a quantification of the headwind you saw there?\nJohn Olin: Okay, Justin, this is John. So again, let's step back in the full year guidance. We expected it to be up in 2022, and we talked about margin growth in the first half and margin contraction in the back half, which you had mentioned, Justin. And that's exactly what happened. The first half was up 1.4 percentage points and the second half was down 0.7 points. And the fourth quarter was right in line with the second half being down that 0.7 point. So overall, fourth quarter was down 0.8 points.  A couple of things driving that is first the unfavorable mix that was the biggest driver of the reduction. And Justin, that was business that was mixed within our business groups. You had mentioned between our business groups, right and some of our higher margin products did grow at a faster rate, but that was offset by unfavorable mix within the groups. And in particular, that was within the equipment and services group behind very strong sales of locomotives and modernizations versus last year. And to put it in perspective, we sold 30% of all combined locos and MODs were sold in the fourth quarter. So that put that pressure on it.  And if you recall, Justin, in the third quarter, mix [ph] margins came in a little bit better than what we had anticipated. And at that time, we talked about some of our international local MOD deliveries being pushed from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that was why it was a little bit more pronounced maybe than was expected. So that was a big piece of it. The other piece was really our continued investment in the future of our business and decarbonization. So part of that was the technology spend. And as you can see on the face of the P&L, that was up $8 million on a year-over-year basis. And again, that is our investment in hydrogen and battery electric as well as digital.  And the other piece with regards to our investment in the future were costs associated with the commercialization of the first battery electric locomotives. So we -- about a year from now, we'll be shipping out the first battery electrics. We couldn't be more thrilled or excited about that. And in the fourth quarter, we had costs and as you remember, we wouldn't have had those same costs in 2021. So that's what's driving the negative variance on those. But overall, we're right where we expect it to be on a full year basis. And certainly looking forward to moving into a strong 2023.\nJustin Long: That's helpful. And is there a way to quantify the costs related to the battery electric commercialization that you referenced?\nJohn Olin: Well, I would say generally, overall, half of it was mix and the other half was a combination of the investment in both technology as well as the commercialization costs.\nJustin Long: Got it. Got it. Very helpful. And then on the 2023 guidance, are buybacks assumed within that outlook? And maybe, John, you could give a little bit of color on the expected quarterly cadence of that guidance because to the point you just made, we can see some fluctuations based on the timing of locomotive deliveries and MODs?\nJohn Olin: Yes. First, Justin, the first question is the use of the generation of cash that we expect to have in 2023 is part of our -- included in our guidance. You had mentioned repurchases, again, that could come in the form of acquisitions. It could come in the form of share repurchases. It all depends on if we have the right M&A, we'll invest it that way. But the cash generation is contemplated in the guidance that we provided this morning. When -- the second question is, when we move to revenue and margin cadence. I think the most important part is on a full year basis, we expect our operating margins to be up moderately versus 2022 margins of the 16.2 and to be generally in line with our long-term margin growth framework that we presented at our Investor Day about a year ago, Justin.  So okay, let's talk about revenue and margin guidance for 2023. I want to start with 2022 because it certainly plays into what we expect in 2023. All through 2022, we characterized our revenue and margin cadence as higher margin growth in the first half and higher revenue growth in the back half. And that's exactly the way it played out. In 2023, we expect to see the opposite cadence that we had in 2022. Consequently, we expect higher revenue growth in the first half versus the second half of 2023, and we expect our full year margin growth to come largely in the second half of 2023. And as you can imagine, the drivers of this are the cadence that we continue to see with -- I'm sorry, the driver of the cadence is the mix impact of our international locomotive sales. And Justin, as we talked about it, they were pretty pronounced in the back half of 2022 and we would expect more mix headwinds in the front half of 2023 as some -- as we execute on some of those international locomotive sales. And then the second reason is that we're comping against higher 22% margins in the first half and stronger 2022 revenue growth in the second half.\nJustin Long: Great. I appreciate all that detail. Thanks for the time. \nJohn Olin: Thank you, Justin.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. So any color on the new Tier 4 local orders, is that one rail or multiple rails, and can you say who it's with and how you expect that order to be split out over the next couple of years? And then just maybe just separately, as I think about like markets, any update here on ECP breaks, it's in the news a little bit, how you think about that opportunity?\nRafael Santana: Scott, I think first, I mean, we are continuing to see our demand for both new locomotives and for modernizations as we had highlighted on previous calls. So we've been able to secure at this point, over 100 units. They will be delivered between 2023 and 2024 and it's really a function of us working through the supply chain here, but that's how we see it playing out. And we continue to look at certainly, I think, expanding some of the penetration of some of the products that we have. I think specifically with brakes that's something we talked earlier on during -- when we started the integration. So it's something we're certainly looking at incorporating the new products, and it's certainly an opportunity that we'll continue to look at it.\nScott Group: Okay. And then as I think about last year and now your guidance for this year, right, better revenue growth is sort of coinciding with maybe some margin pressure and I know sort of when revenue growth slows, some better margins. Is there something we can do to sort of get both at the same time of good revenue growth and margin improvement sort of coinciding with each other, I'm just curious how you think about that over the next few years?\nRafael Santana: Well, I'll just start with, I think we're well positioned to both revenue and margin expansion going to 2023. I think what gives us, I'll call greater confidence than maybe before even is the fact that we have the backlog coverage that goes not just into 2023, I think you saw some of my comments when it comes down to visibility into 2024 and 2025. So we believe our guidance here is pretty prudent in the light of all the headwinds we had in the past couple of years. So we feel pretty really committed to be driving here strong mid-single digits up on the revenue line and double digits on EPS.\nScott Group: Okay, thank you guys. \nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is Matt on for Chris. Thanks so much for taking the question. If you guys could just touch a little bit more on how you're evaluating acquisition opportunities and sort of how we should be thinking about the year in 2023 and if you think sort of in 2022, if there is any comparable metrics on that front, just sort of show your puts and takes on how you're thinking about that moving forward into this year?\nJohn Olin: Hi Matt, this is John. Matt, just in general, when we look at capital allocation, we are very interested in doing strong strategic bolt-on M&A that is accretive to overall margins. So that being said, first, if we don't have that, we're very, very happy to return the cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. And that's exactly what you saw in 2022. We had on three acquisitions totaling about $90 million of investment, and then we returned $473 million in share repurchases and then another 100-plus in dividends. But as we look forward, we have a very robust process that we follow, that we look at all the opportunities that we have. We certainly have areas of focus that we're pressing on to largely in the digital and some of the new technologies that will be the future of rail. But we are very focused on garnering strong acquisitions, and we're working hard at it.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome. Thanks so much for that detail. And just following up on a little bit of a separate topic, just touching on rail volumes in general. I know that you said they came in a little bit softer in the fourth quarter and that potentially wait on business some aspect. I didn't know if you had any sort of comments regarding rail volumes, seeing a little bit of a weaker freight economy in the first half of this year. And do you think that, that -- if there's any risk associated with that 2022 guidance that you guys issued? Thanks. \nRafael Santana: So I think -- I mean, you got to look at both, and I think we're seeing a pipeline of opportunities both strong in North America and internationally. I think quarter-to-date we've made more progress in some key geographies. Some that I would highlight to you is certainly Kazakhstan and Africa. You'll see us continue to expand on both new locomotive modernizations and service orders. We have a number of projects under discussion in Asia, where the volume dynamics continue to be a positive. In mining, the demand continues. Similar to what I said on the previous quarter we're seeing services growing faster than equipment. In North America, I think despite of carloads being down, we continue to see interest and demand on both modernizations and to new locomotives. In transit, I think the infrastructure spending continues. Governments are continuing to invest. Our OEMs have very strong backlogs. We'll see some of that converting to orders for our transit business and we're continuing to increase investment into technologies. So when you think of battery electric, I think we're excited about some of the opportunities there. First delivery is happening next year and we're continuing to make progress on that as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks so much for the detail.\nOperator: The next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nSaree Boroditsky: Good morning. So you highlighted $5 million of savings realized this year as part of integration 2.0. Could you provide any color on how you're thinking about these savings into 2023?\nJohn Olin: Yes. So number one, integration 2.0. we just launched about a year ago, and we couldn't be more pleased. We spent -- invested $46 million little bit higher than we first anticipated when we put the program together, which is great news, and that our team's got the projects off announced and set quicker than we thought. And so we would expect the savings to be garnered a little bit ahead of our schedule as well. But the first year of $5 million, we feel great because a lot of those projects didn't start until later in the year. And we would expect a pretty quick ramp on that because as we exit 2025, we'll be at the run rate of $75 million to $90 million of savings. So that's just a couple of years away. So we would expect a pretty sizable increase, both in 2023 and 2024, leading up to 2025.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks. And then one of your competitors recently took a large impairment charge on the lower outlook for locals and MODs. Could you maybe talk about the competitive environment and how you're thinking about market share gains?\nRafael Santana: On that one, we continue to really focus on partnering and creating value for our customers, and that comes with really innovative solutions that drive value for them and that drives value for us as well. As a result, I think we're well positioned to drive long-term profitable growth for the business. We'll not comment on the specifics of any announcements here at this point.\nSaree Boroditsky: Okay, thanks for taking the questions. \nRafael Santana: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nJerry Revich: Yes, hi, good morning everyone. I was really impressed with the transit performance in the quarter, both from margins and bookings standpoint. Can you just talk about your expectations for margins in 2023 for that segment in particular and if you could just give us color on what drove the bookings and the margin profile of what's coming in the book now?\nRafael Santana: Jerry, a couple of things. Number one, we do expect both margin expansion across both segments and revenue expansion on both segments for the year. On transit and specific in the fourth quarter, I think there's benefit from really a catch-up in the quarter. Some of that was an element of supply chain disruptions, which we've had. There was certainly the cyber incident, which had a significant impact there in the third quarter. And -- but we also have had, what I'll call, underlying growth for the business. The fundamentals for the business are good. The book-to-bill is above one. The 12-month backlog on a constant current basis is above 14%. Our multiyear backlog on a constant currency basis above 9%. And at the same time, while we're pleased with the progress, I think we still have significant work ahead to really simplify the footprint, further improve margins. We will have variation quarter-to-quarter but we're committed to continuing to expand margins here and take action to drive profitable growth in the business.\nJerry Revich: Great. And separately, Rafael, can I ask about MODs, you folks have been growing deliveries by it looks like mid-teens for a bit here. I'm wondering in 2023 as you ramp up on Union Pacific deliveries does that growth rate for MOD deliveries accelerate further? And can you remind us from a capacity standpoint, what's the constraint to ramping up production, how much would you be able to ramp up with your existing footprint versus needed to make significant investments for MOD specifically? Thanks.\nRafael Santana: Jerry, MODs growing double digits. The good news there is the element of multiyear orders that give us visibility, in this case all the way out to 2025. So we feel strong about that. And when you have that visibility, you're actually really able to translate that into, what I'll call efficiencies across the supply chain, which drives both quality and the product. So product performance being up, the other elements you're able to translate that into also I will call economies that you're able to pass around to your customer. And I don't see necessary constraints tied to our overall capacity. The one thing I would highlight to you, I mean, we're certainly continuing to operate in a very challenging supply chain environment. There are some areas that have improved, but electronics, I think, is an area that we continue to see bottlenecks there. And some of those will extend throughout the first half this year at least as far as we look at it. So I think that's the element to keep it in mind.\nJerry Revich: Appreciate the discussion, thank you. \nRafael Santana: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Hoster with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nKenneth Hoexter: Great, good morning. Just two clarifications, I guess, before I jump in. Is this a legacy contract on international locomotives or is that just structurally lower margins? And then mix, John, you mentioned, I think, three times already that the mix within category like equipment, is that because you have lower margins on MODs versus new equipment or is there something else that I'm missing? Just if I can understand those two.\nJohn Olin: So Ken, I think that the first question is just the cadence of the way the orders unraveled. So we've got various orders coming or various international locomotives being built for around the world. And we have a period of delivery in the back half of 2022 and the front half of 2023. That's a little bit lower margin, and we're seeing some of that progress through the system. Other than that, the book is typically lower margin for both MODs and new locomotives versus the company average. So when we talk about things such as an increase, a strong increase and the volume related to that, it translates into lower margins within the groups that house those. So I called out equipment and services, equipment is where we book new locomotives and the services business kind of houses the modernizations. So with those growing very strong in the fourth quarter, that brought those margins down in those groups and that's what drove the mix unfavorability.\nKenneth Hoexter: Okay. I got that, John. I just thought you meant within the group. But if you just mean one group being equipment versus services, then I get that. And then Rafael, you talked about the $600 million kind of run rate per year. I think you got a question on that earlier. Is there any reason you don't give number of MODs or new builds in order to track how you're doing versus that historical level, obviously, we know when it was zero it becomes irrelevant, but as it scales and gets larger, is there still a competitive differentiation in giving that number to understand when we're getting back towards a normal run rate as we get into the few hundred in that mix?\nRafael Santana: We think there especially when it comes down to the number of customers that we have out there. So we do see this as an element of competitive nature that we do not want to not disclose. On the other side, I think we're trying to really make sure we provide greater visibility in terms of what we're seeing in terms of the demand, especially with regards to MOD -- and also new locomotives through that process. So does that answer your question?\nKenneth Hoexter: Yes. So you're saying even to break it out -- even to put them together, both MODs and locos, it's still...\nRafael Santana: And the way to think about it today, to a larger extent, we're utilizing the same supply chain for that. So a lot of the plants that were originally really thought around just dedicated to new units, I mean we've gotten those now and really able to flex between those two. So I think it makes sense to up those two together. And just I think through that process, gives you at least visibility here in terms of how utilization looks like for the company.\nKenneth Hoexter: And then my just last one on the -- John, you had a question before about the progress on the expense cost specifically in 2023, right. Obviously, you had $46 million. Are you not talking specifically to a number and kind of what's in that guidance just so we can understand and then you talked about two plants being shut down or I think it was four plants you mentioned. What are the -- are there big projects coming in 2023 that we can kind of look at as far as where you get those synergistic gains?\nJohn Olin: Yes, Ken. So the overall program we're expecting a onetime spending of $135 million or investment of $135 million to $165 million. We saw the $46 million in 2022, we would expect 2023 to be higher than that and then we start to taper off in 2024 in terms of our investment. And at the same time, we would expect to see those savings escalate. Now with the $43 million of restructuring investment that we made in 2022, $32 million of it came in the fourth quarter. And again, we talked about the teams have been very good at lining up the projects. And an example of those were three that we were doing, two would take out on four facilities. They were both in Europe and looking at streamlining some of the network there, manufacturing network and then the distribution in North America. So that they were kicked off in the third quarter. That's when a lot of the reserves are set up, and we'll begin to see the savings in 2023 and 2024 from those.\nKenneth Hoexter: And are those in SG&A and corporate costs or is\u2026?\nJohn Olin: No, no, no. I'm sorry, maybe we're not talking about the same thing. The $46 million is integration 2.0 savings and they're not in our adjusted numbers. They're in our GAAP numbers. And then we've got a bridge in the financials that show the bridge between adjusted and GAAP. And that's where this investment is recorded -- reflected.\nKenneth Hoexter: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen. Please go ahead. \nMatthew Elkott: Good morning and thank you. First, just a quick follow-up to the competitive landscape question earlier. Historically, how much have you guys done in the line of upgrading non-Wabtec locomotives and do you think there are opportunities there going forward?\nRafael Santana: We do have opportunities there. We have call -- started a process around those, and we're currently upgrading units to non-Wabtec. So that's certainly an opportunity that we look at it, and we look at it not just in North America, we're also doing the same internationally.\nMatthew Elkott: That's good to know Rafael. And speaking of international, I think last month, Siemens announced the 1,200 freight locomotive order with Indian railways. Is that something you guys would have bid on and just generally, any update on the India opportunity for you guys will be helpful, there's a significant infrastructure effort there, and I think they just raised their CAPEX for that for the next fiscal year to 10 trillion Rupees or $120 billion?\nRafael Santana: John and I have the opportunity to be in India end of last year. And I mean, we certainly see, I think growing momentum in terms of the opportunities there. As you know, we have long-term agreements. We are -- we have, at this point, delivered over 500 units of that agreement. I think there is good opportunities here to further build on that momentum. I think there is demand for more, transit has a very significant footprint and I think one that we can take advantage. We've been, I think, earlier into the market from that perspective. When it comes down to evaluating order opportunities for the business, that's something we do always. And if we see an opportunity to step into a market with a differentiated product we'll certainly do that and that\u2019s something that we'll continue to evaluate for the business to certainly take from our customers in various parts of the world, a request that we look at some of those opportunities.\nJohn Olin: And then the order Siemens, that was for electric locomotives that we are currently not in the market.\nMatthew Elkott: Yes. And John, I'm sorry if I missed it. The sequential decrease in the total backlog this quarter and last quarter, did you say anything about that, I know it's not significant, but it nonetheless has decreased?\nJohn Olin: Yes, Matt. It's just the -- our technical term is lumpiness of backlogs. When we look at 2022, we had a very strong year in overall backlog. So they were both up -- but if you look at it on a quarterly basis, there is a lot of volatility. So the first half -- the first quarter in 2022, we're up $0.5 billion, $600 million in the second quarter and then down in the third quarter, about $4 million to $5 million and down 500 in the fourth. So it's just a nature of how the backlogs come in and go out and what we're comparing to and lapping. So you're always going to see a fair amount of volatility from quarter-to-quarter.\nRafael Santana: Matt, one of the things that I think it's very important to keep in mind are the following. When orders that cover now three years ahead, you're not going to see those repeat itself every year. And we've got quite a bit of those, which actually provide, I think, a lot of the visibility that I described to you guys. So I'd be careful on looking on I'm going to call separate quarters basis. What we have is, I'll call, stronger coverage than probably we've had since 2019, to be very honest, as I look into the next 12 months and specific when it comes down to modernization, that goes out now to 25%. And for new units, I mean, as we have some long-term agreements, I mean some of those goes way out there, especially in the case of India.\nMatthew Elkott: Yes. Makes sense. Thanks Rafael, thanks John, thanks Kristine.\nRafael Santana: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Dylan Cumming with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nDillon Cumming: Great, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I just wanted to play devil's advocate for a second on the kind of new local outlook. I think a lot of the factors that you mentioned in terms of elevated fleet age, right, desire to kind of increase fuel efficiency that have been present in the market for a while. So in terms of the visibility that you have to get to that kind of above 600-unit milestone you laid out, I guess, is my short kind of question is like what time -- like why is this time different, are you having conversations with Class 1s that are giving you visibility to that number or what's actually driving the confidence in reaching that milestone?\nRafael Santana: So I'll go back to my early comments, I'm not going to speculate on how the recovery or volume I have looks like. What I can tell you is we've got great coverage done we had in the business especially if I go back like 2019, and that's represented by backlog we have. I think the other point we wanted to make there is that we're still at trough levels and if you connect out to the age of the fleet, if you connect that to the elements of how you continue to drive productivity, if you start thinking about obsolescence of components into that fleet together with the component of the ESG, I think you've got a lot of opportunity here to continue to build out on that momentum. That's really the point that we want to make.\nDillon Cumming: Got you. Thanks Rafael. And if I can just ask a little more on the digital growth in the quarter. It was super strong. I know there was some M&A tailwind in there as well. But considering it was one of the last verticals that are going to recover post COVID, I know a lot of the Class 1s had pushed out investment in that area now seems to be really materializing in your own revenue profile. If you want to assume a barricades for Class 1 CAPEX and rail volumes in next year, just how durable could that digital growth be just considering that, that investment has been pushed out to the right for so long on the part of the Class 1s?\nRafael Santana: So I'll start with double digits growth last year. We see the opportunity to drive double-digits again for this year. We had about $1 billion in orders for Digital Electronics in 2022. I think this is, well, number one, a significant increase versus the year before. And book-to-bill was really above -- very positive, in fact, for 2021 and 2022, one of the highest between our businesses. Some of these are multiyear agreements. So no different than the past couple of years. We need to drive convertibility of orders in 2023 to cover that. North America continues to improve. Internationally, the pipeline continues to be very strong. I think some progress made here on recurring revenues, I think we talked about that a little bit into the business. We've got some additional work to be done there. And supply chain has improved the bet into the fourth quarter here, and that's, I think, some of the goodness you saw. But as I mentioned, I think we're continuing to see tough dynamics in supply chain in the first half of the year in terms of chip shortages and semiconductors and some auto ones.\nDillon Cumming: Good, appreciate the time. \nRafael Santana: Thank you. \nOperator: Next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nSteve Barger: Thanks. On the guidance slide, it looks like you expect growth in all the categories you list. Are those rank ordered by growth rate and do you expect anything in the portfolio will contract in 2023?\nJohn Olin: They're not listed in rank order. We have talked at Investor Day that we do expect equipment to be the fastest growing over the next several years. We certainly saw that in 2022 but they're not listed in rank order, Steve.\nSteve Barger: Can you give us any more color around the growth rates that you do expect for those categories?\nJohn Olin: No, we don't break out that. We've talked about the $8.7 billion to $9 million is growth of 4% to 8%. We expect that to be achieved through both our Freight segment as well as transit to both be up in revenue and in margin but we don't break out the individual pieces of that.\nSteve Barger: Can you tell us how much of the 6% projected growth is price?\nJohn Olin: So no, we don't have that broken out. We don't typically break that out as well. As we look to next year, we got a lot of uncertainties and we feel very good about the overall margin growth or revenue growth at a midpoint of 6%. But if I was to add color, I mean, of course, double-digit growth sharing the services, MODs really being a key driver of that. On equipment, I mean, we continue to see the momentum internationally. I think the question, it's really more around the speed in which you convert some of these orders, but there's certainly a very robust pipeline there. And digital I just made some of the comments here. So overall, I think we have the opportunity here to drive both revenue and margin expansion for our businesses, and that's what we're focused on, and that's really across the board.\nSteve Barger: Thanks Rafael. And just to make sure we're thinking correctly about the cadence comments. If I assume a first half freight margin similar to 4Q, and transient margin around the average of last year, it looks like first half EPS will be down somewhere mid to high single digit versus 2022, is that how you're thinking about that first half progression?\nJohn Olin: Steve, we're not providing quarterly EPS guidance. Suffice to say that during 2023, we expect higher revenue growth in the first half versus the second half, and we expect full year margin growth to largely come in the second half of the year.\nSteve Barger: Understood. But given the mix issues that you're talking about, should we assume that the first half freight margin is similar to 4Q?\nJohn Olin: We're not providing that look. We expect there'll be more mix pressure in the first half, and that will result in more margin growth coming from the second half of the year.\nSteve Barger: Got it. Thanks. \nRafael Santana: Thank you Steve. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kristine Kubacki for any closing remarks.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone for your participation today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Olin",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael and good morning. Turning to Slide 9, I will review our fourth quarter results in more detail. We finished the year with another good quarter of operational and financial performance despite continued challenges in foreign currency exchange, still elevated input costs, and persistent supply chain disruptions. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.31 billion, which reflects an 11.2% increase versus the prior year. Freight segment sales were very strong up 17.1%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacting sales in our transit segment.  Q4 sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange which reduced our revenue growth in the quarter by 4.5 percentage points. For the quarter GAAP operating income was $17 million driven by higher restructuring costs. Adjusted operating margin in Q4 was 15.3% down 0.8 percentage points versus prior year. We expect that our margin to be lower in the quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. The key drivers of the year-over-year margin performance include unfavorable mix within business groups, in particular, within equipment and services due to strong sales of locomotives and modernizations versus last year's performance, some of which pushed from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and higher technology spend associated with investment in future growth and costs associated with the commercialization of the first battery electric locomotives.  GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.86, which was down 15.7% versus the fourth quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pretax charges of $32 million for restructuring, largely related to our integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec's operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. I will talk more about our progress on integration 2.0 in a moment. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.30, up 10.2% versus the prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another solid quarter of results, demonstrating the underlying strength of the business and our ability to navigate through volatile macroeconomic conditions.  Turning to Slide 10, let's review our product lines in more detail. Fourth quarter consolidated sales were strong, up 11.2% excluding foreign currency exchange, sales were up 15.7%. Equipment sales were up 14.1% from last year due to higher locomotive sales this quarter versus last year. Component sales were up 10.6% year-over-year, largely driven by higher OE railcar build. Digital Electronics sales were up a strong 34.7%, which was driven by robust demand for onboard locomotive products and software upgrades along with revenue contribution from the strategic bolt-on acquisitions of Beena Vision and ARINC earlier in the year.  Our services sales grew 16.6% versus last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher sales from a larger active fleet versus last year and increased MOD sales. Superior performance, reliability, and availability of our fleet continues to drive increased customer demand for our services and solutions. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 1.7% versus prior year to $637 million. Sales were down versus last year due to the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange. Absent the impacts of foreign currency, Transit sales would have been up 9.3%. The momentum in this segment remains positive as mega trends such as urbanization and decarbonization drive increased investments in green infrastructure.  Now moving to Slide 11. As forecasted, gross profit margin was lower driven by unfavorable mix, adverse foreign currency exchange, and higher input costs, partially offset by increased pricing and productivity. Pricing actions implemented to recover increased costs positively impacted our margins during the quarter. Mix was unfavorable, especially within our equipment and services businesses behind strong sales of locomotives and MODs. Raw material costs, while down from recent highs over the last year were up again year-over-year. Foreign currency exchange adversely impacted revenues by 4.5 percentage points and adversely impacted fourth quarter gross profits by $21 million. Finally, manufacturing costs were favorable due to productivity gains, which were partially offset by higher transportation costs. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lean initiatives.  Turning to Slide 12, for the fourth quarter, as expected, operating margin declined on both a GAAP and adjusted basis, driven by lower gross margins and increased investment in future technologies. GAAP SG&A was up $8 million versus prior year due to higher net restructuring costs related to integration 2.0. Adjusted SG&A was $271 million which was flat versus prior year, but down 1.3 percentage points as a percentage of sales. Engineering expense increased from last year according to plan. We continue to invest in engineering resources and current business opportunities but more importantly, we are investing in our future as the industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization, and safety. Now let's take a look at our segment results on Slide 13, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales were strong for the quarter, and GAAP segment operating income was $209 million for an operating margin of 12.5%, down 2 percentage points, which was impacted by increased restructuring expenses versus the year ago quarter. Segment adjusted operating income was $284 million, down 1.7 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefits of higher sales and improved productivity were offset by unfavorable mix within business groups and higher technology investments and costs associated with the commercialization of the first battery electric locomotives. Finally, segment backlog was $18.64 billion, up $139 million or 0.8% and from the end of Q4 last year. On a constant currency basis, segment backlog was up $344 million from last year.  Turning to Slide 14, transit segment sales were down 1.7%, driven by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacted segment sales by 11 percentage points. GAAP operating income was $63 million, down 2.3 percentage points, which was impacted by increased restructuring expenses versus the year ago quarter, largely related to our integration 2.0 initiative. Adjusted segment operating income increased by $7 million to $95 million, which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 14.8% and up 1.2 percentage points versus the prior year, driven by strong productivity, benefits from prior restructuring activities and disciplined cost management. Finally, transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.8 billion, up 3.6% versus a year ago. On a constant currency basis, backlog would have been up 9.2%.  Moving to Slide 15, I would like to briefly touch on our progress against our integration 2.0 initiative. Recall that during our Investor Day last March, we announced a restructuring program comprised of an estimated onetime expenses between $135 million and $165 million that would yield an incremental $75 million to $90 million of run rate cost savings by 2025. These savings were to be achieved through a combination of actions which simplify, streamline, and consolidate parts of our operations.  A great example of the actions we are taking to drive these savings occurred in the fourth quarter, including two consolidation projects across our manufacturing footprint, which will eliminate a total of four facilities and a third project focused on streamlining and optimizing our North American distribution network. With full year restructuring expenses of $46 million in 2022, we achieved an initial $5 million of savings during the year. We expect investment to increase more meaningfully in 2023 and are on track to meet our 2025 goals, positioning Wabtec to drive multiyear margin expansion.  Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 16. We had strong cash generation in the quarter. Q4 cash flow was $410 million, bringing total cash for the year to $1.04 billion for a cash conversion rate of 93%. Cash flow benefited from higher earnings but was impacted versus last year by the proactive build of inventories ahead of our 2023 growth expectations and managing supply disruptions of critical parts. Our debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter declined to 2.2 times, and our liquidity is robust at $2.29 billion. And finally, we returned a significant amount of capital back to shareholders in 2022 with $584 million returned through share repurchases and dividends. And as Rafael mentioned, our Board of Directors approved a $750 million share buyback reauthorization and increased our quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share, up 13%. As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong, and we continue to allocate capital in a balanced strategy to maximize shareholder returns.  Now moving to Slide 17, quickly recapping the year. Overall, the team delivered a strong year for all our stakeholders. Despite challenging dynamics, we drove revenue growth, expanded our operating margins, and generated robust cash flow. The resiliency of the business and strong execution provides us a solid foundation and good momentum as we enter 2023. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael. Okay, Justin, this is John. So again, let's step back in the full year guidance. We expected it to be up in 2022, and we talked about margin growth in the first half and margin contraction in the back half, which you had mentioned, Justin. And that's exactly what happened. The first half was up 1.4 percentage points and the second half was down 0.7 points. And the fourth quarter was right in line with the second half being down that 0.7 point. So overall, fourth quarter was down 0.8 points.  A couple of things driving that is first the unfavorable mix that was the biggest driver of the reduction. And Justin, that was business that was mixed within our business groups. You had mentioned between our business groups, right and some of our higher margin products did grow at a faster rate, but that was offset by unfavorable mix within the groups. And in particular, that was within the equipment and services group behind very strong sales of locomotives and modernizations versus last year. And to put it in perspective, we sold 30% of all combined locos and MODs were sold in the fourth quarter. So that put that pressure on it.  And if you recall, Justin, in the third quarter, mix [ph] margins came in a little bit better than what we had anticipated. And at that time, we talked about some of our international local MOD deliveries being pushed from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that was why it was a little bit more pronounced maybe than was expected. So that was a big piece of it. The other piece was really our continued investment in the future of our business and decarbonization. So part of that was the technology spend. And as you can see on the face of the P&L, that was up $8 million on a year-over-year basis. And again, that is our investment in hydrogen and battery electric as well as digital.  And the other piece with regards to our investment in the future were costs associated with the commercialization of the first battery electric locomotives. So we -- about a year from now, we'll be shipping out the first battery electrics. We couldn't be more thrilled or excited about that. And in the fourth quarter, we had costs and as you remember, we wouldn't have had those same costs in 2021. So that's what's driving the negative variance on those. But overall, we're right where we expect it to be on a full year basis. And certainly looking forward to moving into a strong 2023. Well, I would say generally, overall, half of it was mix and the other half was a combination of the investment in both technology as well as the commercialization costs. Yes. First, Justin, the first question is the use of the generation of cash that we expect to have in 2023 is part of our -- included in our guidance. You had mentioned repurchases, again, that could come in the form of acquisitions. It could come in the form of share repurchases. It all depends on if we have the right M&A, we'll invest it that way. But the cash generation is contemplated in the guidance that we provided this morning. When -- the second question is, when we move to revenue and margin cadence. I think the most important part is on a full year basis, we expect our operating margins to be up moderately versus 2022 margins of the 16.2 and to be generally in line with our long-term margin growth framework that we presented at our Investor Day about a year ago, Justin.  So okay, let's talk about revenue and margin guidance for 2023. I want to start with 2022 because it certainly plays into what we expect in 2023. All through 2022, we characterized our revenue and margin cadence as higher margin growth in the first half and higher revenue growth in the back half. And that's exactly the way it played out. In 2023, we expect to see the opposite cadence that we had in 2022. Consequently, we expect higher revenue growth in the first half versus the second half of 2023, and we expect our full year margin growth to come largely in the second half of 2023. And as you can imagine, the drivers of this are the cadence that we continue to see with -- I'm sorry, the driver of the cadence is the mix impact of our international locomotive sales. And Justin, as we talked about it, they were pretty pronounced in the back half of 2022 and we would expect more mix headwinds in the front half of 2023 as some -- as we execute on some of those international locomotive sales. And then the second reason is that we're comping against higher 22% margins in the first half and stronger 2022 revenue growth in the second half. Thank you, Justin. Hi Matt, this is John. Matt, just in general, when we look at capital allocation, we are very interested in doing strong strategic bolt-on M&A that is accretive to overall margins. So that being said, first, if we don't have that, we're very, very happy to return the cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. And that's exactly what you saw in 2022. We had on three acquisitions totaling about $90 million of investment, and then we returned $473 million in share repurchases and then another 100-plus in dividends. But as we look forward, we have a very robust process that we follow, that we look at all the opportunities that we have. We certainly have areas of focus that we're pressing on to largely in the digital and some of the new technologies that will be the future of rail. But we are very focused on garnering strong acquisitions, and we're working hard at it. Yes. So number one, integration 2.0. we just launched about a year ago, and we couldn't be more pleased. We spent -- invested $46 million little bit higher than we first anticipated when we put the program together, which is great news, and that our team's got the projects off announced and set quicker than we thought. And so we would expect the savings to be garnered a little bit ahead of our schedule as well. But the first year of $5 million, we feel great because a lot of those projects didn't start until later in the year. And we would expect a pretty quick ramp on that because as we exit 2025, we'll be at the run rate of $75 million to $90 million of savings. So that's just a couple of years away. So we would expect a pretty sizable increase, both in 2023 and 2024, leading up to 2025. So Ken, I think that the first question is just the cadence of the way the orders unraveled. So we've got various orders coming or various international locomotives being built for around the world. And we have a period of delivery in the back half of 2022 and the front half of 2023. That's a little bit lower margin, and we're seeing some of that progress through the system. Other than that, the book is typically lower margin for both MODs and new locomotives versus the company average. So when we talk about things such as an increase, a strong increase and the volume related to that, it translates into lower margins within the groups that house those. So I called out equipment and services, equipment is where we book new locomotives and the services business kind of houses the modernizations. So with those growing very strong in the fourth quarter, that brought those margins down in those groups and that's what drove the mix unfavorability. Yes, Ken. So the overall program we're expecting a onetime spending of $135 million or investment of $135 million to $165 million. We saw the $46 million in 2022, we would expect 2023 to be higher than that and then we start to taper off in 2024 in terms of our investment. And at the same time, we would expect to see those savings escalate. Now with the $43 million of restructuring investment that we made in 2022, $32 million of it came in the fourth quarter. And again, we talked about the teams have been very good at lining up the projects. And an example of those were three that we were doing, two would take out on four facilities. They were both in Europe and looking at streamlining some of the network there, manufacturing network and then the distribution in North America. So that they were kicked off in the third quarter. That's when a lot of the reserves are set up, and we'll begin to see the savings in 2023 and 2024 from those. No, no, no. I'm sorry, maybe we're not talking about the same thing. The $46 million is integration 2.0 savings and they're not in our adjusted numbers. They're in our GAAP numbers. And then we've got a bridge in the financials that show the bridge between adjusted and GAAP. And that's where this investment is recorded -- reflected. And then the order Siemens, that was for electric locomotives that we are currently not in the market. Yes, Matt. It's just the -- our technical term is lumpiness of backlogs. When we look at 2022, we had a very strong year in overall backlog. So they were both up -- but if you look at it on a quarterly basis, there is a lot of volatility. So the first half -- the first quarter in 2022, we're up $0.5 billion, $600 million in the second quarter and then down in the third quarter, about $4 million to $5 million and down 500 in the fourth. So it's just a nature of how the backlogs come in and go out and what we're comparing to and lapping. So you're always going to see a fair amount of volatility from quarter-to-quarter. They're not listed in rank order. We have talked at Investor Day that we do expect equipment to be the fastest growing over the next several years. We certainly saw that in 2022 but they're not listed in rank order, Steve. No, we don't break out that. We've talked about the $8.7 billion to $9 million is growth of 4% to 8%. We expect that to be achieved through both our Freight segment as well as transit to both be up in revenue and in margin but we don't break out the individual pieces of that. So no, we don't have that broken out. We don't typically break that out as well. As we look to next year, we got a lot of uncertainties and we feel very good about the overall margin growth or revenue growth at a midpoint of 6%. But if I was to add color, I mean, of course, double-digit growth sharing the services, MODs really being a key driver of that. On equipment, I mean, we continue to see the momentum internationally. I think the question, it's really more around the speed in which you convert some of these orders, but there's certainly a very robust pipeline there. And digital I just made some of the comments here. So overall, I think we have the opportunity here to drive both revenue and margin expansion for our businesses, and that's what we're focused on, and that's really across the board. Steve, we're not providing quarterly EPS guidance. Suffice to say that during 2023, we expect higher revenue growth in the first half versus the second half, and we expect full year margin growth to largely come in the second half of the year. We're not providing that look. We expect there'll be more mix pressure in the first half, and that will result in more margin growth coming from the second half of the year."

            "name": "Rafael Santana",
            "content": "Thanks Kristine and good morning everyone. Let's move to Slide 4, I will start with an update on our business, my perspectives in the quarter, our progress against our long-term value creation framework, and then John will cover the financials. We delivered a strong fourth quarter which is evidenced by strong sales growth, an increase in adjusted earnings per share. We achieved this despite significant headwinds, including a volatile macro environment, supply chain disruptions, and negative FX. Sales were roughly $2.3 billion, which was up 11% versus prior year.  Revenue was driven by strong performance across the freight segment, but partially offset by unfavorable FX. Total cash flow from operations was $410 million, which brings year-to-date cash flow to over $1 billion, achieving a full year cash conversion rate of over 90%. Overall, our financial position remains strong. We continue to allocate capital to maximize shareholder returns by investing for future growth, executing on a strategic M&A, and returning cash to shareholders.  Total multiyear backlog was $22.4 billion up $272 million year-over-year and excluding the headwinds from foreign exchange, backlog was up $680 million or up 3% from last year. We continued our progress against our long-term growth strategies. Overall, we have a strong finish to the year despite a number of challenges. As a result of this strong performance and our confidence in the future, our Board of Directors reauthorized a $750 million share buyback and approved the 13% increase in the quarterly dividend. We entered 2023 with strength and momentum across the portfolio and we're well positioned to continue to drive profitable growth even with near-term uncertainty and volatility in the global economy. Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about our end market conditions in more details. As we look at key metrics across our freight businesses, we remain encouraged by underlying business momentum and the strong pipeline of opportunities. North America carloads were down slightly in the quarter, but locomotive parkings are down from the same time last year despite lower freight traffic. We continue to see significant opportunities in demand for modernizations and new locomotives as our customers invest in their aging fleets and they also place a greater focus on reliability, productivity, and fuel efficiency. Looking at the North American rail car build, demand for rail cars continued to show strength with industry backlog about 60,000 cars. Railcars in storage are below pre COVID levels with about 18% of the North American railcar fleet in storage. As a result, industry orders for new rail cars continued to improve and the industry outlook for 2023 is for about 40,000 to 45,000 cars to be delivered. Overall, we believe we have an opportunity to continue building significant long-term momentum with growth in modernizations in new locomotive sales, in rail car builds, and enrolling stock. Internationally, activity has also continued to show positive signs and will continue to execute on a strong pipeline of opportunities. Finally, transitioning to the transit sector, the long-term secular drivers are positive as the globe continues to increase investments in clean, safe, and efficient transportation solutions. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few recent business highlights. We recently secured additional Tier 4 locomotive orders in North America. These orders now total over 100 units to be delivered across 2023 and 2024. We also signed two international deals in Asia and South America to deliver new rolling stock and also won two international long term service contracts in South America and in Kazakhstan. Finally, Wabtec's FLXdrive locomotive was recognized for sustainable innovation by the Business Intelligence Group and awarded The Commercial Technology of the Year by S&P Global. Looking ahead, all of this demonstrates the strong pipeline of opportunities we continue to execute on. Wabtec's well positioned to continue to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers most pressing needs. Turning to Slide 7, I want to briefly touch on why we're strongly positioned to deliver resilience and more predictable earnings in volatile times. We believe our demonstrated execution combined with favorable end markets and our leading technologies and solutions will enable us to remain resilient during times of increasing volatility. This resiliency comes in part from our multiyear backlog and strong base of recurring revenues. Our multiyear backlog of over $22 billion provides visibility and support for both short and long term growth. Similarly, our base of recurring revenues of 44% of total sales, which grew by 3 percentage points in 2022, provides high margin and stable earnings. And finally, we have a track record of strong operating margin expansion across the business, as evidenced by our ability to realize price, deliver productivity, and aggressively manage costs. Now let's turn to Slide 8. To further illustrate the point of our ability to drive consistent, predictable earnings I wanted to provide more color about our combined new locomotive and modernization deliveries in North America. Over the past six years, North America and new locomotive deliveries have been challenged due to weak carload growth, PFR [ph] and COVID. Over that period, the investment in the fleet has come primarily through modernization of locomotives, but this still remains below historical replacement levels.  As we have discussed in past calls, the core North American active mainline fleet of heavy haul locomotives is made-up of roughly 16,000 locomotives. With a replacement cycle of roughly 25 years per locomotive, we estimate the annual replacement rate overtime to be over 600 new locomotives and/or modernizations per year. As you can see, the industry has been operating at roughly half of that level for the past six years. Yet, looking forward, we expect a growing age for refreshment of that fleet. And with record fleet age and growing obsolescence driven by Next Gen technologies along with the expectation of rail share gains versus truck, and the need to reduce greenhouse gases by 2030 that the demand for reliable and efficient power is increasing. This expected demand provides Wabtec the opportunity to fill our existing capacity for delivery of new and modernized locomotive solutions in an effective and efficient fashion over the next several years. Looking forward, we believe our execution combined with strength of our business, leading products, and technologies result in Wabtec being resilient through economic cycles, delivering more predictable earnings and superior shareholder returns. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results, and our overall financial performance. John. Thanks, John. Let's flip to Slide 18 to discuss our 2023 financial guidance. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and solutions remain strong across our product lines and our backlog continues to provide visibility into 2023 and beyond. We are committed to driving adjusted margin expansion into 2023 despite FX volatility, a still challenging cost environment, and continued investments in technology. The team is committed to driving strong top line growth while aggressively managing costs. With these factors in mind, we expect 2023 sales of $8.7 billion to $9 billion, which is up nearly 6% at the midpoint and adjusted EPS to be between $5.15 and $5.55 per share, which is up 10% at the midpoint. We expect cash flow conversion to be greater than 90%.  Now let's wrap up on Slide 19. As you heard today, our team delivered a solid quarter to finish out the strong year. We delivered on our full year commitments despite a challenging and volatile environment, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world-class team, innovative technologies, and our relentless focus on our customers. These results were in line with our five-year outlook we provided at our Investor Day last year. With strong momentum across the portfolio, increased visibility through our multiyear backlog, and relentless focus on continuous cost improvement, Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable long-term growth and maximize shareholder returns. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine? Good morning Allison. Yes. With the comment specifically with regards to services, Allison? Okay. Allison, I mean, we're certainly when you think about North America carloads being down year-to-date, so we're continuing to see demand for both MODs and new locomotives. I think a lot of that is really tied to driving productivity, driving efficiency, driving reliability, and [indiscernible] is certainly an element if you think about the CAPEX for Class 1s in the U.S. We see that up for the year. So those are potentially some of the headwinds could come with, I think, lower carloads right now, and we're really planning for flattish in terms of that context.  But I think what's most important is really the element of the backlog coverage that we've got for the year. It's a hedge of what we had a year ago. This is probably one of the highest 12-month backlogs we've had since 2019, which really just further strengthens our position to deliver in 2023 and last year, we have signed a number of multiyear orders, I think, for both new locomotives, but for modernizations as well. So this provides additional visibility not just in to 2023 but in the case of MODs all the way into 2025 for new locomotives beyond that. So we have a strong pipeline of deals and we continue to see good momentum in both the pipeline of deals in North America and internationally. Allison, I wouldn't speculate how that will progress. But I think it was strongly still coming from the trough. And so when you look at some of the elements of the age of the fleet, continued investment to make sure you have productivity, but you also drive reliability on that fleet and the elements of ESG, I think we have a lot of opportunity here to help customers bridge that existing power into cleaner power. So it comes with upgrades and incorporating technologies like hybrid and things like that. So I think we're well positioned in that regard. Thanks. Scott, I think first, I mean, we are continuing to see our demand for both new locomotives and for modernizations as we had highlighted on previous calls. So we've been able to secure at this point, over 100 units. They will be delivered between 2023 and 2024 and it's really a function of us working through the supply chain here, but that's how we see it playing out. And we continue to look at certainly, I think, expanding some of the penetration of some of the products that we have. I think specifically with brakes that's something we talked earlier on during -- when we started the integration. So it's something we're certainly looking at incorporating the new products, and it's certainly an opportunity that we'll continue to look at it. Well, I'll just start with, I think we're well positioned to both revenue and margin expansion going to 2023. I think what gives us, I'll call greater confidence than maybe before even is the fact that we have the backlog coverage that goes not just into 2023, I think you saw some of my comments when it comes down to visibility into 2024 and 2025. So we believe our guidance here is pretty prudent in the light of all the headwinds we had in the past couple of years. So we feel pretty really committed to be driving here strong mid-single digits up on the revenue line and double digits on EPS. So I think -- I mean, you got to look at both, and I think we're seeing a pipeline of opportunities both strong in North America and internationally. I think quarter-to-date we've made more progress in some key geographies. Some that I would highlight to you is certainly Kazakhstan and Africa. You'll see us continue to expand on both new locomotive modernizations and service orders. We have a number of projects under discussion in Asia, where the volume dynamics continue to be a positive. In mining, the demand continues. Similar to what I said on the previous quarter we're seeing services growing faster than equipment. In North America, I think despite of carloads being down, we continue to see interest and demand on both modernizations and to new locomotives. In transit, I think the infrastructure spending continues. Governments are continuing to invest. Our OEMs have very strong backlogs. We'll see some of that converting to orders for our transit business and we're continuing to increase investment into technologies. So when you think of battery electric, I think we're excited about some of the opportunities there. First delivery is happening next year and we're continuing to make progress on that as well. On that one, we continue to really focus on partnering and creating value for our customers, and that comes with really innovative solutions that drive value for them and that drives value for us as well. As a result, I think we're well positioned to drive long-term profitable growth for the business. We'll not comment on the specifics of any announcements here at this point. Thank you. Jerry, a couple of things. Number one, we do expect both margin expansion across both segments and revenue expansion on both segments for the year. On transit and specific in the fourth quarter, I think there's benefit from really a catch-up in the quarter. Some of that was an element of supply chain disruptions, which we've had. There was certainly the cyber incident, which had a significant impact there in the third quarter. And -- but we also have had, what I'll call, underlying growth for the business. The fundamentals for the business are good. The book-to-bill is above one. The 12-month backlog on a constant current basis is above 14%. Our multiyear backlog on a constant currency basis above 9%. And at the same time, while we're pleased with the progress, I think we still have significant work ahead to really simplify the footprint, further improve margins. We will have variation quarter-to-quarter but we're committed to continuing to expand margins here and take action to drive profitable growth in the business. Jerry, MODs growing double digits. The good news there is the element of multiyear orders that give us visibility, in this case all the way out to 2025. So we feel strong about that. And when you have that visibility, you're actually really able to translate that into, what I'll call efficiencies across the supply chain, which drives both quality and the product. So product performance being up, the other elements you're able to translate that into also I will call economies that you're able to pass around to your customer. And I don't see necessary constraints tied to our overall capacity. The one thing I would highlight to you, I mean, we're certainly continuing to operate in a very challenging supply chain environment. There are some areas that have improved, but electronics, I think, is an area that we continue to see bottlenecks there. And some of those will extend throughout the first half this year at least as far as we look at it. So I think that's the element to keep it in mind. Thank you. We think there especially when it comes down to the number of customers that we have out there. So we do see this as an element of competitive nature that we do not want to not disclose. On the other side, I think we're trying to really make sure we provide greater visibility in terms of what we're seeing in terms of the demand, especially with regards to MOD -- and also new locomotives through that process. So does that answer your question? And the way to think about it today, to a larger extent, we're utilizing the same supply chain for that. So a lot of the plants that were originally really thought around just dedicated to new units, I mean we've gotten those now and really able to flex between those two. So I think it makes sense to up those two together. And just I think through that process, gives you at least visibility here in terms of how utilization looks like for the company. We do have opportunities there. We have call -- started a process around those, and we're currently upgrading units to non-Wabtec. So that's certainly an opportunity that we look at it, and we look at it not just in North America, we're also doing the same internationally. John and I have the opportunity to be in India end of last year. And I mean, we certainly see, I think growing momentum in terms of the opportunities there. As you know, we have long-term agreements. We are -- we have, at this point, delivered over 500 units of that agreement. I think there is good opportunities here to further build on that momentum. I think there is demand for more, transit has a very significant footprint and I think one that we can take advantage. We've been, I think, earlier into the market from that perspective. When it comes down to evaluating order opportunities for the business, that's something we do always. And if we see an opportunity to step into a market with a differentiated product we'll certainly do that and that's something that we'll continue to evaluate for the business to certainly take from our customers in various parts of the world, a request that we look at some of those opportunities. Matt, one of the things that I think it's very important to keep in mind are the following. When orders that cover now three years ahead, you're not going to see those repeat itself every year. And we've got quite a bit of those, which actually provide, I think, a lot of the visibility that I described to you guys. So I'd be careful on looking on I'm going to call separate quarters basis. What we have is, I'll call, stronger coverage than probably we've had since 2019, to be very honest, as I look into the next 12 months and specific when it comes down to modernization, that goes out now to 25%. And for new units, I mean, as we have some long-term agreements, I mean some of those goes way out there, especially in the case of India. Thank you. So I'll go back to my early comments, I'm not going to speculate on how the recovery or volume I have looks like. What I can tell you is we've got great coverage done we had in the business especially if I go back like 2019, and that's represented by backlog we have. I think the other point we wanted to make there is that we're still at trough levels and if you connect out to the age of the fleet, if you connect that to the elements of how you continue to drive productivity, if you start thinking about obsolescence of components into that fleet together with the component of the ESG, I think you've got a lot of opportunity here to continue to build out on that momentum. That's really the point that we want to make. So I'll start with double digits growth last year. We see the opportunity to drive double-digits again for this year. We had about $1 billion in orders for Digital Electronics in 2022. I think this is, well, number one, a significant increase versus the year before. And book-to-bill was really above -- very positive, in fact, for 2021 and 2022, one of the highest between our businesses. Some of these are multiyear agreements. So no different than the past couple of years. We need to drive convertibility of orders in 2023 to cover that. North America continues to improve. Internationally, the pipeline continues to be very strong. I think some progress made here on recurring revenues, I think we talked about that a little bit into the business. We've got some additional work to be done there. And supply chain has improved the bet into the fourth quarter here, and that's, I think, some of the goodness you saw. But as I mentioned, I think we're continuing to see tough dynamics in supply chain in the first half of the year in terms of chip shortages and semiconductors and some auto ones. Thank you. Thank you Steve."

I now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Kris Kubacki, please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Wabtec's third quarter 2022 earnings call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, John Olin; and Senior Vice President of Finance, John Mastalerz. Today's slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures were posted to our website earlier today and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Some statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. I will now turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4. I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the third quarter, and progress on our long-term value framework, John will then cover the financials. We delivered a strong third quarter, which is evidenced by strong sales growth and an increase in adjusted earnings per share. We achieved this despite significant headwinds including the loss of business in Russia, supply chain disruptions and negative FX. Sales were roughly $2 billion which was up 9% versus prior year. Revenue was driven by strong performance across the freight segment but partially offset by unfavorable FX. Strong cash flow from operations was $204 million which ranks year-to-date cash flow to $628 million. Overall, our financial position remains strong. We continue to invest our future growth reduced average and return cash for shareholders. Total multiyear backlog was $22.6 billion up $767 million year-over-year and excluding the headwinds from foreign exchange backlog was up $1.5 billion or up 7% from last year. We continued our progress against our long-term strategies as evidenced by continued expansion in the total backlog versus last year. Overall, we have a strong quarter which was very much in line with our plan for the year. We continue to invest for the future as we execute commercially and operationally with discipline and vigor and we're well-positioned to continue to drive long-term growth even with near term uncertainty and volatility in the global economy. Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about our end-market conditions in more details. As we look at key metrics across our freight businesses, we are encouraged by underlying business momentum and strong pipeline of opportunities. North America carloads were up slightly in the quarter after being down for the four previous quarters and locomotive parkings are down from the same time last year despite lower year-to-date freight traffic. We continue to see significant opportunities and demand for new locomotives and modernizations as our customers invest in their ageing fleets, and place a greater focus on reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency. When it comes to the North American railcar build, demand for railcars is increasing from what we believe were trough levels in 2021. Railcars in storage are below pre-COVID levels with about 17% of the North American railcar fleet in storage. As a result, industry order for new railcars continue to improve and the industry outlook for 2022 is for about 40,000 cars to be delivered. Overall, we believe we have an opportunity to continue building significant long-term momentum with growth in modernizations, in new locomotive sales, in railcar builds and in rolling stock. Internationally, freight activity also continues to show positive signs. We have been growing our international fleet in the mid-single digits on average over the last five years. And we continue to execute on a strong pipeline of order opportunities. This strength is reflected in this quarter's equipment sales growth of 32%. Finally, transitioning to the transit sector, the long-term secular drivers are positive as the industry continues to trend towards clean, safe, and efficient transportation solutions. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few recent business highlights. During the quarter, we signed a strategic $600 million MOU with KTZ the national railway company in Kazakhstan. This agreement will bring state-of-the-art technologies to both their yards and mainline operations that will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and operating costs. This historic framework includes a 150 flex drive battery electric shunters along with kits to convert the traditional diesel locomotives to LNG. We will also collaborate on digital solutions for the fleet beginning with Trip Optimizer. We also recently signed two key deals in Australia to deliver additional locomotive kits. These locomotives will be built in Australia and sold to various Eastern Australian railroad customers. We also closed an order for new locomotives in Africa during the quarter. Finally, in transits, we secured the key order to supply platform doors for Panama's monorail station which marks Wabtec's first transit project in Central America. We also signed a strategic five year services contract with Akiem, a leading European rolling stock leasing company which provides the critical maintenance for 100s of locomotives in France and in Germany. Turning to Slide 7. Before turning it over to John, I want to briefly discuss our ability to deliver predictable earnings to the economic cycle. During our Investor Day earlier this year, we talked about our track record of managing through challenging markets and significant disruptions. As a company, we are uniquely positioned to deliver resilience and predictable earnings given our favorable end-market a robust backlog of high-level of recurring revenues and disciplined execution. All of which drives profitable growth and value for our shareholders. We believe our favorable end-markets combines with our leading technologies and solutions will enable us to remain resilient during times of increased volatility. In freight, the demand put here is to accelerate, the need to grow, and refresh our expansive global install base, accelerate the adoption of next gen technologies and expand our international footprint. In transit, the investment in green infrastructure continues with structurally high energy prices and climate change making the need more urgent. Our multiyear backlog of over $22 billion provide significant visibility and support for long-term growth. The backlog has consistently grown over the past two years despite the challenging economic backdrop. In addition, we have a strong level of recurring revenues which is overshared in its profit contributions of approximately 60%. And finally, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to execute our strategies and deliver growth. Our track record of strong operating margin expansion across the business is evidence of our ability to realize price, deliver productivity and aggressively manage costs. Our execution combines with the strength of our business, leading products and technologies result in Wabtec being resilient to economic cycles delivering predictable earnings and superior shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter segment results in our overall financial performance. John?\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Rafael, and good morning. Turning to Slide 8. I will review our third quarter results in more detail. We had another good quarter of operational and financial performance despite continued challenges in foreign currency exchange, supply chain disruptions and still elevated input costs. Sales for the third quarter were $2.08 billion which reflects a 9.1% increase versus the prior year. Freight segment sales were very strong up 18.2% partially offset by lower year-over-year sales in our transit segment. Q3 sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable currency exchange which reduced our revenue growth in the quarter by 5.2%'age points. For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $343 million which was up 5.5% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in Q3 was 16.4%, down 0.6%'age points. While we expected our margin to be down in the quarter behind unfavorable mix, margins came in modestly higher than we had expected. We now anticipate Q4 operating margins to be slightly lower than our Q3 operating margins. In the third quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were a $1.22, up 7% versus the prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.88 which was up 27.5% versus the third quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pre-tax charges of $9 million for restructuring and other one-time charges largely related to our integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. We are pleased with our Q3 results especially in the face of significant foreign currency exchange headwinds, continue supply disruptions and strong mix headwinds which was expected in the quarter. We remain diligent and proactive as we focus on execution and work to minimize these challenges. Turning to Slide 9. Let's review our product lines in more detail. Third quarter consolidated sales were strong, up 9.1%. Excluding foreign currency exchange, sales were up 14.3%. Equipment sales were up a strong 32.2% from last year due to higher locomotive deliveries this quarter versus last year. Component sales were up 4.5% year-over-year largely driven by the higher OE railcar build. Digital electronic sales were up 20.6% which was driven by robust demand for onboard locomotive products and software upgrades along with revenue contribution from the strategic bolt-on acquisitions of Beena Vision and ARINC last quarter. We are particularly pleased with our organic growth in Q3 as it was delivered in the phase of continuing chip shortages. Our services sales grew at 14.8% versus last year. A year-over-year increase was driven by higher sales from a larger fleet versus last year, an increase MOD deliveries. The superior performance, reliability, and availability of our fleet continues to drive increased customer demand for our services and solutions as railroads increasingly see predictable outcomes across their fleets. Towards our transit segment, sales decreased 10.1% versus prior year to $550 million. Sales were down versus last year due to the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange. As of the int tax of foreign currency, transit sales would have been up 2.6%. We believe the medium and long-term outlook of this segment remains positive as megatrends such as urbanization and decarbonization drive increased investments in green infrastructure. Now, moving to Slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin decline as expected by 1.4%'age points to 31.4%. gross profit margin was lower, driven by unfavorable mix, adverse foreign currency exchange and higher input costs, partially offset by increased pricing and strong productivity. Pricing positively impacted our margins. Higher pricing was realized from price escalations incorporated into many of our long-term contracts along with other price actions that were implemented to recover increased costs. Mix was unfavorable in the quarter as we significantly increased our sales of locomotives and a lower margin than the average. While material costs were up again year-over-year, led by dramatically higher energy costs and increased metal costs. Foreign currency exchange adversely impacted revenues by 5.2%'age points and adversely impacted third quarter gross profits by $20 million. Finally, manufacturing cost were favorable due to productivity gains which were largely offset by higher transportation and logistics cost. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lien initiatives. Turning to Slide 11. For the third quarter, adjusted operating margin decline 0.6%'age points versus last year. As expected, our margins were lower due to mix and increased investment in future technologies but were partially offset by lower adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales. Adjusted SG&A was $256 million which was largely flat versus prior year but down 1.2%'age points as a percent of sales to 12.3%. Engineering expense increased from last year according to plan. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities but more importantly we are investing in our future as the industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customer's productivity, capacity utilization, and safety. Now let's take a look at the segment sales results on Slide 12 starting with the freight segment. As I already discussed, freight segment sales were strong for the quarter and segment adjusted operating income was $307 million for an adjusted margin of 19.9% down 0.7%'age points versus the prior year. The benefits of higher sales and improved productivity were offset by unfavorable mix in higher engineering investment. Finally, segment backlog was $19.17 billion up $961 million or 5.3% from the end of Q3 last year. On a constant currency basis, segment backlog was up $1.26 billion from last year. Now turning to Slide 13. Transit segment sales were down 10.1% driven by the negative FX of foreign currency exchange and the cyber incident that occurred late in the second quarter. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacted segment sales by 12.7%'age points and we estimate an additional 5%'age points due to the cyber incident. Adjusted segment operating income decreased by $17 million to $16 million which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of an 11.0% down 1.5%'age points versus the prior year. We estimate that the temporary labor inefficiencies driven by the cyber incident was roughly $8 million during the quarter. Excluding these temporary inefficiencies, adjusted operating margin would have been largely flat to prior year. We do not expect an adverse impact to our transit sales or earnings due to the cyber incident in the fourth quarter. Transit continues to focus on driving down costs, implementing lien and improving operational efficiencies despite the volatile environment. Finally, transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.44 billion down 5.4% versus a year ago. However, on a constant currency basis, backlog would have been up 7.2%. Now, let's turn to our financial position on Slide 14. During the quarter, we generated $204 million of operating cash flow resulting in a cash conversion rate of 72%. This brings our year-to-date operating cash flow to $628 million. Cash flow benefitted from higher earnings but was impacted by the proactive build of inventories ahead of our strong second half growth expectations and managing supply disruption of critical parts. Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter declined a 2.3 times and our liquidity is robust at $2.14 billion. During the quarter, we amended and extended our existing credit facility, increasing liquidity by $300 million and extended the facility through 2027. In addition, we established an 18 month delayed draw term loan from $250 million. As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong and we are confident that we can continue to drive solid cash generation giving us liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital toward the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value. With that, I'd like turn the call back to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, John. Let's flip to Slide 15 to discuss our 2022 financial guidance. We continue to feel strong about our portfolio businesses and we have delivered against our regional plan financials despite the loss of business in Russia, high input costs, ongoing supply chain disruptions, unfavorable FX, and a cyber incident. We are adjusting our sales range to $8.15 billion to $8.35 billion which reflects the expected impact from unfavorable FX in the second half. We're also nearing our adjusted earnings per share range to $4.75 to $4.95 while keeping our full-year cash convergent guidance of greater than 90%. Now, let's wrap up on Slide 16. As you've heard today, our team delivered a strong quarter despite a challenging and evolving environment, thanks in large part to our resilient install base, best-in-class technologies and our teams focus on our customers. For this these reasons and more, we are confident Wabtec is well-positioned for long-term profitable growth. Looking forward, we will lean further into the strong fundamentals of the industry and our company to extend our leadership position in rail to delivering innovative and scalable technologies for our customers in harness the power of our continuous improvement culture. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning, and I'll turn the call over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine?\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions. Before we do, and out of considerations for others on the call, I ask you that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you.  And our first question today comes from Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Justin.\nJustin Long: John, I wanted to start with a comment you made about fourth quarter operating margin stepping down from the third quarter slightly. I would think with mix supposed to improve I believe MOD should be up, the cyber security incident seems like it's behind us. I would think that margin should be getting better sequentially. So, can you just help us understand what might be offsetting some of those tailwinds I mentioned sequentially? And then, I know you're not giving guidance on 2023 today but any directional thoughts on margins next year versus this exit rate in 2022?\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Justin. Nothing has really changed since we've come out on the year. The back half is going to be lower than prior year and certainly in the first half largely driven by mix. And Justin, the zero win on the fourth quarter, we do expect mix to still be the largest driver or the lower margin. What we said last quarter though was that we expected the third quarter to be the lowest margin of the year. And the reason I'm sorry, and given where we ended up at 16.4 that came in, I'm exceeding our expectations and really what that does Justin is just puts us the fourth quarter down to be slightly lower than the third quarter.\nRafael Santana: Justin, I would add a couple of things there. Just keeping in mind we have over 60% of the new locomotives been shipped in the second half of the year. So, with that we've got some give and some takes between third and fourth quarter. I think most important is we expect margin expansions '22 and most importantly that our teams are executing well and that we're in a strong position to continue our margin expansion into '23 and beyond.\nJustin Long: Okay, great. That's helpful. And thinking about next year there's a little bit more concern around rail volumes and where we shake out. We're in an environment where rail volumes are down low-single digits maybe even mid-single digits. Is that still an environment where you feel like you can grow freight segment revenue given your backlog for MODs and international locomotives and digital?\nRafael Santana: Yes. It's early certainly to provide guidance in '23 but we continue to see this strong demand across the business. When we think about the pipeline of deals, we have relevant opportunities across geographies. We have progressed with the pipeline of opportunities both in North America and then internationally. We expect to finish the year with book to bill, Justin, about one for all the businesses as we did in '21. I say we're very much on track to finish '22 with double digit increase on orders versus five year despite of FX. And that just provides us strong coverage for '23 and beyond. We pose to extend a little bit on what we're seeing across various geographies, we certainly saw some of the winds we had in Australia and Africa. Volume dynamics continue to be positive in Kazakhstan. We have a number of projects under discussion in Asia. Even mining demand continues to hold with that at this point services' actually growing faster than equipment sales as we go into '23. In North America, I think despite of the carloads being down here today, we continue to see demands for both MODs and new locomotives to a number of discussions going to that. And certainly significant opportunity for some of the class ones to further improve operating ratio and to while so bring significant impact to their ESG targets. So, transits I think infrastructure spanning continues to be a positive for us. And I think all-in-all going to '23 we're well-positioned from a backlog coverage and I had from a backlog coverage from what we had a year ago.\nJustin Long: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone.\nRafael Santana: Hi, Jerry.\nJohn Olin: Good morning, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Hi, thanks. I'm wondering if you can talk about the pricing cadence that you folks have seen in the freight segment over the course of the year, really strong organic growth in the quarter. What proportion of that is pricing and what we're seeing from other industrials is actually pricing accelerating into early '23. I'm wondering if you can comment on whether that cadence supply's for your business as well, please.\nJohn Olin: Yes, Jerry. I think the year is unfolding very much the way we expected with regards to the cost that we're seeing and they are continuing to rise and we saw them rise quite a bit in the second quarter into the third quarter. In addition, we were seeing a pricing rise. And we talked about as we exited the second quarter, we read price on cost equilibrium at that point. We continue to remain there. But on to your point, Jerry, we did see a large jump in the pricing recovery that we got during the quarter as well as on the higher cost that we and hedged up well with the higher cost that we realize.\nRafael Santana: Jerry, I'd say in the near term we expect inflation to persist and as an organization we'll remain diligent on both cost management and on pricing.\nJerry Revich: Okay. And as you look forward to hopefully the supply chain loosening at some point over next 12 to 18 months, how should we think about the efficiency gains in that environment? Should we think of the company getting to keep that spread as we have less rework, less waiting for parts et cetera? Do we keep that as a margin at some point using the lower cost structure that you folks have established to improve margins versus the three supply chain environment, is that an opportunity?\nRafael Santana: Jerry, we would expect the same thing as we saw going up as is coming down. Hopefully the cost will come down, we're seeing a lot of mixed signals. Some are moving in the lower direction and others are actually still rising. But if they do come down, they'll be very similar and the fact that remember that about 60% of our revenue is tied up in long-term contracts that have price escalators. And so, they will adjust as we see those prices adjust. And the additional 40% of cost are going up, will go up and get more pricing and as they come down, we may see a little bit of a benefit there.\nJerry Revich: Okay, super. Thanks.\nRafael Santana: Good.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen.\nMatt Elkott: Good morning. Thank you, Rafael. I think before the GE acquisition you guys did two to three bolt-on acquisitions per year. Do you think you'll ease back into that phase next year or the year after? And any update on the acquisition opportunities, would be helpful.\nRafael Santana: Well, we're continuing to explore bolt-on acquisitions. I think we're going to be again opportunistic here. We'll need to be strategic with stronger returns and helping us drive ROIC higher and driving faster good also. We're continued to evaluate opportunities there. We think there's opportunity for prices to still come down on those. And with that, I mean, we're committed to ultimately just really by our cash flow and certain buyer returns to shareholders. So, share repurchase will also be a something we're looking at.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. And then, just my second question is you're on pace for '22 revenue that's about 37% of the year-end backlog in the '20, again the 2021. Yes, I know that's not necessarily a perfect metric to gauge future revenues. But, is there any reason why that percentage should be vastly different next year?\nRafael Santana:: Well, as I mentioned before, I think going to 2023, we're well-positioned from a backlog, certainly, ahead of what we were a year ago, I think even the underlying performance of the business we're really very well-positioned to deliver on the five-year guidance that we provided during the Investor Day, last March. So this is less than just about 2023. It's really making sure we're progressing towards the guidance we provided during Investor Day. In our 12 month backlog, adjusted for currency is up approximately 15% at this point in the year versus prior year.\nAnalyst: Thanks, Raphael. Thanks, John.\nRafael Santana:: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Scott Group of Wolf Research.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to ask, the one year freight backlog was down about 5% from last quarter. I don't know if there's any FX impact there. But any color. And then you talked about mix of the headwind for Q4. Any early thoughts about mix of the headwind or tailwind for next year?\nJohn Olin: Scott. With regards to the backlog, we certainly saw it come down sequentially by 4.7%. However, on a year to date basis, we're up 9.8% prior to currency. And when you adjust for currency, we're seeing it up about 15%. And again, we've talked about backlogs, sometimes they can be a little bit lumpy. So sequentially, we're down a little bit, but I think the right way to look at it is over time. And we certainly feel very good about the fact that X currency were up 15% for the 12 month backlog. The second question was with regards to.\nScott Group: Mix you talked about the headwind Q4, if you have any thoughts on next year?\nJohn Olin: Yes. I think that overall, Scott, over the next several years, mix is going to be a headwind, right. And this is what we talked about investor day, as we look to the railroads are starting to renew their fleets. And we saw some of that activity this year with the UPE and CN as well as the NS module deals that we're going to have to face some lower or headwind or mix headwinds over the next several years. But having said that, we've got a lot of growth and a lot of fixed costs to absorb. And we would expect to see our margins grow by 250 to 300 basis points over the next five years. So call it an average of about a 0.5% over that period of time. That's inclusive of mix headwinds.\nScott Group: Okay. And then just last thing, is there anything in this IRA bill that that benefits you guys for next year?\nJohn Olin: The IRA bill.\nScott Group: The inflation Reduction Act, anything happen there that could help you guys next year, starting next year?\nRafael Santana:: No, no, there's not. Scott. With regards to the Inflation Reduction Act, there's a couple of things. One is there's a tax on, I'm sure repurchases that everyone's aware of. Secondly, there is a minimum tax that could have an impact on our cash on next year. At this point, we don't know enough, because not enough of the regulations are out. But they should be out in the first half. And we'll know a little bit more of the overall impact of the company then.\nScott Group: I was thinking like maybe along like the lines of the investment in battery or hydrogen that you guys are doing, if there's something that could help?\nRafael Santana:: We're seeing some specific opportunities is really tied to the railroads and some of the operators there, Scott, and we're following up with those opportunities as we work along, I mean, my only comments would be just in battery electric overall, I think the interest continues to be strong on that portfolio that we continue to build, certainly saw that with the order or the MOU we've signed with Kazakhstan and the level of interest continuous across various geographies. So to your point, we could see some benefit coming from some specific projects customers will look at driving in North America.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys.\nRafael Santana:: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. And the next question comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Can we talk on transit a little bit? I know you talked about infrastructure funds benefiting. But if you as we think of that flow through over the next few years, does it become more impactful in 2023 or 2024? Is it more even? Just trying to understand how it shaping to that in our model?\nRafael Santana:: Let me start. Allison on transit just overall. I think, if you think about really underlying drivers for the business, they're positive. If you look at the backlog coverage for the year, at the end of the third quarter, we're five points ahead at the same time last year. Our 12 month backlog, if you look at constant currency, it's about 16.5%. Our total backlog is up 7.2% on the same basis, and we'll finish 2022 with a book-to-bill above one. So with that being said, I think we're continuing to take action to drive profitable growth in the business. And we're continuing to see investment in that regard.\nJohn Olin: Allison, when we look in the near term, we are certainly seeing some headwinds in our transit business. Currency being the most notable. And again, when you look at the quarter with revenues being down 10.1%, you reverse out currency, you'd be up 2.6%. And then again, we had the other headwind of the year, which is the cyber event that largely hit our transit group. That held back about 5% of revenue in the third quarter. So we'd be up over 7% in the underlying business. And that's the best we've been in numerous quarters. So we feel good about that. And again, from a margin standpoint, while margins were down in the quarter, 1.5 points. That's explained again, by the cyber incident. We had about $8 million of temporary variable labor inefficiencies. So this is on labor that was idled more severely underutilized as we work through the cyber incident. And with those are both behind us. And as we look forward, we would expect no impact from cyber moving forward.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thanks. And then just -I made a misstep at the cutbacks, there's a slight reduction there. Just anything notable driving the change in that number?\nJohn Olin: No. I think it's just the fact that the team is very focused on. I'm doing more with less, and of the overall lean principles that are being deployed throughout the company as it's coming through in our capital budgets as well. So we're - as you noted, from 2% of revenue estimate, we're down to one and three quarters percent. And also to note that we didn't talk about in the prepared remarks is our effective tax rate is down from an expectation of 26% to 25%.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.  And the next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is Matt on for Chris. We wanted to touch a little bit more on just broader demand topics. We were wondering what you guys are seeing in terms of the trends in 4Q and more specifically, how the inflationary environment supply chain dislocations have impacted ordering? And where do you see those trends moving forward? I know you touched a little bit on 4Q. But also, if you could give any additional color on 2023 that would that would be fantastic as well? Thanks.\nRafael Santana:: Let me start. I'll pass it on down to John. But with transit in specific, at this point, we're not seeing any operational disruptions with regards to cyber, as John described. In fact, when we think about the fourth quarter, we would actually expect some level of both manufacturing production and revenue catch up during the fourth quarter on that. In terms of overall dynamics, we're continuing to see a strong pipeline of opportunities out there. I did mention here, that strength really playing out across various geographies. And in many ways across the business. It's all about really driving convertibility into that. So we're certainly proud of what we've seen in the digital electronics business, which is one that I mean, we're continuing to also see very positive dynamics, year today being one of the highest businesses from the book-to-bill perspective. So it's all about converting that pipeline of opportunities. And we are certainly in a stronger position to be driving profitable into 2023 than we were a year ago. And we feel certainly strong about five-year outlook we're providing the business during Investor Day.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks so much.\nRafael Santana:: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Dillon Cumming with Morgan Stanley.\nDillon Cumming: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to go back to the discussion on freight margins for a second. I think there wasn't kind of as much margin dilution in the quarter that would have expected just given a step up in loco deliveries. Can you just talk to you if that was more of a function of maybe better than effected buying leverage on those deliveries or that there was kind of a mix element to it. John, you mentioned that you thought mix would be a kind of quarter on quarter had been going into 4Q? I think historically you've had some like maintenance activity and aftermarket activity, the possible number pulled forward and 3Q, you're not sure that was kind of a driver in the quarter as well. But I'm just wondering if you can kind of speak to those dynamics of the quarter?\nJohn Olin: Yes. When we look at the freight margin and coming in a little bit higher than expected. I think there's two things though to look at Dillon. Number one is mix was a little bit less unfavorable. And then secondly, the foreign currency exchange, right, that was actually a benefit, the margins during the quarter, and it came in a little bit more than we had expected in terms of the overall impact on our business. But again, it hurts on profits, but helped out margins a little bit.\nDillon Cumming: Got it. Thanks, John. And then maybe just that last one. In terms of the progression of locomotive and parkings, just given that carload volumes kind of moved positive year on year in the quarter. I know last year was really a story of network disruption and network congestion kind of driving higher active fleets. But now that kind of carloads trends seem to be stabilizing a bit. Is the message in the Class 1 that they actually need more fleet to service more carloads? Do they feel like fleets are relatively right sized, the level of kind of volume growth that we've been seeing in 3Q, maybe at the end of the year?\nRafael Santana:: I think, certainly to describe what we'll see in 2023, from a volume perspective, but certainly, I think with some of the elements, what you described in both terms of network velocity improving, and well, time reducing that could be a headwind, parkings, I think on the other side, I think we've got enough tailwind to offset that with both the amount for mods and demand for services overall. So that's, I think at the end of day they are positive for us?\nDillon Cumming: Great. Thanks for the time.\nRafael Santana:: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes around Ross Kowski with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, Adam on for Ken Hoexter. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to drill down on the one of the last questions. I believe you mentioned about you expected a third of the locomotive deliveries in 2022 to happen in the third quarter. So is that relatively in line? Maybe just give me a sense of that and where you expect in 4Q? And maybe also if that was part of the mixed benefit in 3Q? Thanks.\nRafael Santana:: So my comment was with regards to the second half of the year, and I said over 60% of the new locomotive deliveries would have happened in the second half. With that there is again, some give and take between third quarter and fourth quarter. And as you'd expect, we could see some variation here, as we progress through that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then maybe just clarify. So, velocities improving, volumes improving and also dwell time coming down a little bit. So net-net, as we think about 2023, should we be still be thinking, growth in the freight services business with the mods built into that? And maybe just any thoughts on mixing margins as well? Thanks.\nRafael Santana:: So yes, we do expect growth in the service business, despite of the dynamics you just described there. And I think I'll go back to -- we continue to drive towards margin expansion. We feel we're in a strong position here to do so as we look at the coverage we've got going into next year. So that's a positive. We've got strong digital growth, as you see it in the numbers as well. And so yes, we do expect margin expansion going through 2023 and beyond.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Thank you.\nRafael Santana:: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Felix Boeschen with Raymond James.\nFelix Boeschen: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nRafael Santana:: Good morning.\nFelix Boeschen: Hey, John, I was hoping we could hone in on the cost side of things real quick. I think you mentioned your price cost equilibrium in the quarter. Just want to understand if that was a common inclusive of the higher energy costs. And if you have any more directional color around how operations are tracking in Europe in light of all of that?\nJohn Olin: Yes. The comment was inclusive of all of our costs, rising cost of goods sold, basically. Yes, we're at price costs equilibrium, as we exit the third quarter. With regards to, I think your question specifically on energy, we're managing the best we can. We've got a lot of alternative energy sources in our facilities in Europe, but costs are rising quite a bit. We're certainly happy to see some of the cost controls coming out. But we're in the same boat as all of our competitors are, and probably from a locational standpoint, maybe a little bit better positioned in some of the countries that we're in. And we're managing through it the best we can.\nRafael Santana:: I'll just add. Our teams continue to work through contingency plans. So we're certainly looking at dual supplier sourcing, that's something they've been looking at as we really prepare ourselves for an outcome. That it's still uncertain in a lot of ways. But we have invested on really moving some of our sites into lower energy and tasked to use and continue to invest on alternative energy sources there. And also, the cost side of that is like any other rising costs, we will look the price to cover it. And manage our margins, regardless of whether it's an energy spike, or a metal spike or a labor spike, we're very focused on continuing to build those margins.\nFelix Boeschen: Okay. That's super helpful. And then just secondly, for me. I think Nordco has been the model for just over a year at this point. And I'm just curious if you could maybe touch on how Nordco performing against the original estimates, maybe both from a top line and a synergy perspective, if that's possible?\nRafael Santana:: So, were happy with the acquisition of Nordco. We're ahead of the performer. The team continues to progress very well. We're certainly excited about the opportunities here to drive growth beyond what we have planned for, especially in the international markets. And that's something the team is very focused on. It's about utilizing the footprint that we already have established in other countries to be able to drive down product line, there's a couple geographies that are really keen for us here. And you'll hear more on some of the progress there, the following quarters.\nFelix Boeschen: Thank you.\nRafael Santana:: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes the question and answer session. I would like to turn the call to Kristine Kubacki, the Vice President, Investor Relations for closing comments.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone for participating today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "John Olin",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael, and good morning. Turning to Slide 8. I will review our third quarter results in more detail. We had another good quarter of operational and financial performance despite continued challenges in foreign currency exchange, supply chain disruptions and still elevated input costs. Sales for the third quarter were $2.08 billion which reflects a 9.1% increase versus the prior year. Freight segment sales were very strong up 18.2% partially offset by lower year-over-year sales in our transit segment. Q3 sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable currency exchange which reduced our revenue growth in the quarter by 5.2%'age points. For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $343 million which was up 5.5% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in Q3 was 16.4%, down 0.6%'age points. While we expected our margin to be down in the quarter behind unfavorable mix, margins came in modestly higher than we had expected. We now anticipate Q4 operating margins to be slightly lower than our Q3 operating margins. In the third quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were a $1.22, up 7% versus the prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.88 which was up 27.5% versus the third quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pre-tax charges of $9 million for restructuring and other one-time charges largely related to our integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. We are pleased with our Q3 results especially in the face of significant foreign currency exchange headwinds, continue supply disruptions and strong mix headwinds which was expected in the quarter. We remain diligent and proactive as we focus on execution and work to minimize these challenges. Turning to Slide 9. Let's review our product lines in more detail. Third quarter consolidated sales were strong, up 9.1%. Excluding foreign currency exchange, sales were up 14.3%. Equipment sales were up a strong 32.2% from last year due to higher locomotive deliveries this quarter versus last year. Component sales were up 4.5% year-over-year largely driven by the higher OE railcar build. Digital electronic sales were up 20.6% which was driven by robust demand for onboard locomotive products and software upgrades along with revenue contribution from the strategic bolt-on acquisitions of Beena Vision and ARINC last quarter. We are particularly pleased with our organic growth in Q3 as it was delivered in the phase of continuing chip shortages. Our services sales grew at 14.8% versus last year. A year-over-year increase was driven by higher sales from a larger fleet versus last year, an increase MOD deliveries. The superior performance, reliability, and availability of our fleet continues to drive increased customer demand for our services and solutions as railroads increasingly see predictable outcomes across their fleets. Towards our transit segment, sales decreased 10.1% versus prior year to $550 million. Sales were down versus last year due to the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange. As of the int tax of foreign currency, transit sales would have been up 2.6%. We believe the medium and long-term outlook of this segment remains positive as megatrends such as urbanization and decarbonization drive increased investments in green infrastructure. Now, moving to Slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin decline as expected by 1.4%'age points to 31.4%. gross profit margin was lower, driven by unfavorable mix, adverse foreign currency exchange and higher input costs, partially offset by increased pricing and strong productivity. Pricing positively impacted our margins. Higher pricing was realized from price escalations incorporated into many of our long-term contracts along with other price actions that were implemented to recover increased costs. Mix was unfavorable in the quarter as we significantly increased our sales of locomotives and a lower margin than the average. While material costs were up again year-over-year, led by dramatically higher energy costs and increased metal costs. Foreign currency exchange adversely impacted revenues by 5.2%'age points and adversely impacted third quarter gross profits by $20 million. Finally, manufacturing cost were favorable due to productivity gains which were largely offset by higher transportation and logistics cost. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lien initiatives. Turning to Slide 11. For the third quarter, adjusted operating margin decline 0.6%'age points versus last year. As expected, our margins were lower due to mix and increased investment in future technologies but were partially offset by lower adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales. Adjusted SG&A was $256 million which was largely flat versus prior year but down 1.2%'age points as a percent of sales to 12.3%. Engineering expense increased from last year according to plan. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities but more importantly we are investing in our future as the industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customer's productivity, capacity utilization, and safety. Now let's take a look at the segment sales results on Slide 12 starting with the freight segment. As I already discussed, freight segment sales were strong for the quarter and segment adjusted operating income was $307 million for an adjusted margin of 19.9% down 0.7%'age points versus the prior year. The benefits of higher sales and improved productivity were offset by unfavorable mix in higher engineering investment. Finally, segment backlog was $19.17 billion up $961 million or 5.3% from the end of Q3 last year. On a constant currency basis, segment backlog was up $1.26 billion from last year. Now turning to Slide 13. Transit segment sales were down 10.1% driven by the negative FX of foreign currency exchange and the cyber incident that occurred late in the second quarter. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacted segment sales by 12.7%'age points and we estimate an additional 5%'age points due to the cyber incident. Adjusted segment operating income decreased by $17 million to $16 million which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of an 11.0% down 1.5%'age points versus the prior year. We estimate that the temporary labor inefficiencies driven by the cyber incident was roughly $8 million during the quarter. Excluding these temporary inefficiencies, adjusted operating margin would have been largely flat to prior year. We do not expect an adverse impact to our transit sales or earnings due to the cyber incident in the fourth quarter. Transit continues to focus on driving down costs, implementing lien and improving operational efficiencies despite the volatile environment. Finally, transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.44 billion down 5.4% versus a year ago. However, on a constant currency basis, backlog would have been up 7.2%. Now, let's turn to our financial position on Slide 14. During the quarter, we generated $204 million of operating cash flow resulting in a cash conversion rate of 72%. This brings our year-to-date operating cash flow to $628 million. Cash flow benefitted from higher earnings but was impacted by the proactive build of inventories ahead of our strong second half growth expectations and managing supply disruption of critical parts. Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter declined a 2.3 times and our liquidity is robust at $2.14 billion. During the quarter, we amended and extended our existing credit facility, increasing liquidity by $300 million and extended the facility through 2027. In addition, we established an 18 month delayed draw term loan from $250 million. As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong and we are confident that we can continue to drive solid cash generation giving us liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital toward the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value. With that, I'd like turn the call back to Rafael. Thanks, Justin. Nothing has really changed since we've come out on the year. The back half is going to be lower than prior year and certainly in the first half largely driven by mix. And Justin, the zero win on the fourth quarter, we do expect mix to still be the largest driver or the lower margin. What we said last quarter though was that we expected the third quarter to be the lowest margin of the year. And the reason I'm sorry, and given where we ended up at 16.4 that came in, I'm exceeding our expectations and really what that does Justin is just puts us the fourth quarter down to be slightly lower than the third quarter. Good morning, Jerry. Yes, Jerry. I think the year is unfolding very much the way we expected with regards to the cost that we're seeing and they are continuing to rise and we saw them rise quite a bit in the second quarter into the third quarter. In addition, we were seeing a pricing rise. And we talked about as we exited the second quarter, we read price on cost equilibrium at that point. We continue to remain there. But on to your point, Jerry, we did see a large jump in the pricing recovery that we got during the quarter as well as on the higher cost that we and hedged up well with the higher cost that we realize. Scott. With regards to the backlog, we certainly saw it come down sequentially by 4.7%. However, on a year to date basis, we're up 9.8% prior to currency. And when you adjust for currency, we're seeing it up about 15%. And again, we've talked about backlogs, sometimes they can be a little bit lumpy. So sequentially, we're down a little bit, but I think the right way to look at it is over time. And we certainly feel very good about the fact that X currency were up 15% for the 12 month backlog. The second question was with regards to. Yes. I think that overall, Scott, over the next several years, mix is going to be a headwind, right. And this is what we talked about investor day, as we look to the railroads are starting to renew their fleets. And we saw some of that activity this year with the UPE and CN as well as the NS module deals that we're going to have to face some lower or headwind or mix headwinds over the next several years. But having said that, we've got a lot of growth and a lot of fixed costs to absorb. And we would expect to see our margins grow by 250 to 300 basis points over the next five years. So call it an average of about a 0.5% over that period of time. That's inclusive of mix headwinds. The IRA bill. Allison, when we look in the near term, we are certainly seeing some headwinds in our transit business. Currency being the most notable. And again, when you look at the quarter with revenues being down 10.1%, you reverse out currency, you'd be up 2.6%. And then again, we had the other headwind of the year, which is the cyber event that largely hit our transit group. That held back about 5% of revenue in the third quarter. So we'd be up over 7% in the underlying business. And that's the best we've been in numerous quarters. So we feel good about that. And again, from a margin standpoint, while margins were down in the quarter, 1.5 points. That's explained again, by the cyber incident. We had about $8 million of temporary variable labor inefficiencies. So this is on labor that was idled more severely underutilized as we work through the cyber incident. And with those are both behind us. And as we look forward, we would expect no impact from cyber moving forward. No. I think it's just the fact that the team is very focused on. I'm doing more with less, and of the overall lean principles that are being deployed throughout the company as it's coming through in our capital budgets as well. So we're - as you noted, from 2% of revenue estimate, we're down to one and three quarters percent. And also to note that we didn't talk about in the prepared remarks is our effective tax rate is down from an expectation of 26% to 25%. Yes. When we look at the freight margin and coming in a little bit higher than expected. I think there's two things though to look at Dillon. Number one is mix was a little bit less unfavorable. And then secondly, the foreign currency exchange, right, that was actually a benefit, the margins during the quarter, and it came in a little bit more than we had expected in terms of the overall impact on our business. But again, it hurts on profits, but helped out margins a little bit. Yes. The comment was inclusive of all of our costs, rising cost of goods sold, basically. Yes, we're at price costs equilibrium, as we exit the third quarter. With regards to, I think your question specifically on energy, we're managing the best we can. We've got a lot of alternative energy sources in our facilities in Europe, but costs are rising quite a bit. We're certainly happy to see some of the cost controls coming out. But we're in the same boat as all of our competitors are, and probably from a locational standpoint, maybe a little bit better positioned in some of the countries that we're in. And we're managing through it the best we can."

I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the third quarter, and progress on our long-term value framework, John will then cover the financials. We delivered a strong third quarter, which is evidenced by strong sales growth and an increase in adjusted earnings per share. We achieved this despite significant headwinds including the loss of business in Russia, supply chain disruptions and negative FX. Sales were roughly $2 billion which was up 9% versus prior year. Revenue was driven by strong performance across the freight segment but partially offset by unfavorable FX. Strong cash flow from operations was $204 million which ranks year-to-date cash flow to $628 million. Overall, our financial position remains strong. We continue to invest our future growth reduced average and return cash for shareholders. Total multiyear backlog was $22.6 billion up $767 million year-over-year and excluding the headwinds from foreign exchange backlog was up $1.5 billion or up 7% from last year. We continued our progress against our long-term strategies as evidenced by continued expansion in the total backlog versus last year. Overall, we have a strong quarter which was very much in line with our plan for the year. We continue to invest for the future as we execute commercially and operationally with discipline and vigor and we're well-positioned to continue to drive long-term growth even with near term uncertainty and volatility in the global economy. Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about our end-market conditions in more details. As we look at key metrics across our freight businesses, we are encouraged by underlying business momentum and strong pipeline of opportunities. North America carloads were up slightly in the quarter after being down for the four previous quarters and locomotive parkings are down from the same time last year despite lower year-to-date freight traffic. We continue to see significant opportunities and demand for new locomotives and modernizations as our customers invest in their ageing fleets, and place a greater focus on reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency. When it comes to the North American railcar build, demand for railcars is increasing from what we believe were trough levels in 2021. Railcars in storage are below pre-COVID levels with about 17% of the North American railcar fleet in storage. As a result, industry order for new railcars continue to improve and the industry outlook for 2022 is for about 40,000 cars to be delivered. Overall, we believe we have an opportunity to continue building significant long-term momentum with growth in modernizations, in new locomotive sales, in railcar builds and in rolling stock. Internationally, freight activity also continues to show positive signs. We have been growing our international fleet in the mid-single digits on average over the last five years. And we continue to execute on a strong pipeline of order opportunities. This strength is reflected in this quarter's equipment sales growth of 32%. Finally, transitioning to the transit sector, the long-term secular drivers are positive as the industry continues to trend towards clean, safe, and efficient transportation solutions. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few recent business highlights. During the quarter, we signed a strategic $600 million MOU with KTZ the national railway company in Kazakhstan. This agreement will bring state-of-the-art technologies to both their yards and mainline operations that will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and operating costs. This historic framework includes a 150 flex drive battery electric shunters along with kits to convert the traditional diesel locomotives to LNG. We will also collaborate on digital solutions for the fleet beginning with Trip Optimizer. We also recently signed two key deals in Australia to deliver additional locomotive kits. These locomotives will be built in Australia and sold to various Eastern Australian railroad customers. We also closed an order for new locomotives in Africa during the quarter. Finally, in transits, we secured the key order to supply platform doors for Panama's monorail station which marks Wabtec's first transit project in Central America. We also signed a strategic five year services contract with Akiem, a leading European rolling stock leasing company which provides the critical maintenance for 100s of locomotives in France and in Germany. Turning to Slide 7. Before turning it over to John, I want to briefly discuss our ability to deliver predictable earnings to the economic cycle. During our Investor Day earlier this year, we talked about our track record of managing through challenging markets and significant disruptions. As a company, we are uniquely positioned to deliver resilience and predictable earnings given our favorable end-market a robust backlog of high-level of recurring revenues and disciplined execution. All of which drives profitable growth and value for our shareholders. We believe our favorable end-markets combines with our leading technologies and solutions will enable us to remain resilient during times of increased volatility. In freight, the demand put here is to accelerate, the need to grow, and refresh our expansive global install base, accelerate the adoption of next gen technologies and expand our international footprint. In transit, the investment in green infrastructure continues with structurally high energy prices and climate change making the need more urgent. Our multiyear backlog of over $22 billion provide significant visibility and support for long-term growth. The backlog has consistently grown over the past two years despite the challenging economic backdrop. In addition, we have a strong level of recurring revenues which is overshared in its profit contributions of approximately 60%. And finally, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to execute our strategies and deliver growth. Our track record of strong operating margin expansion across the business is evidence of our ability to realize price, deliver productivity and aggressively manage costs. Our execution combines with the strength of our business, leading products and technologies result in Wabtec being resilient to economic cycles delivering predictable earnings and superior shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter segment results in our overall financial performance. John? Thanks, John. Let's flip to Slide 15 to discuss our 2022 financial guidance. We continue to feel strong about our portfolio businesses and we have delivered against our regional plan financials despite the loss of business in Russia, high input costs, ongoing supply chain disruptions, unfavorable FX, and a cyber incident. We are adjusting our sales range to $8.15 billion to $8.35 billion which reflects the expected impact from unfavorable FX in the second half. We're also nearing our adjusted earnings per share range to $4.75 to $4.95 while keeping our full-year cash convergent guidance of greater than 90%. Now, let's wrap up on Slide 16. As you've heard today, our team delivered a strong quarter despite a challenging and evolving environment, thanks in large part to our resilient install base, best-in-class technologies and our teams focus on our customers. For this these reasons and more, we are confident Wabtec is well-positioned for long-term profitable growth. Looking forward, we will lean further into the strong fundamentals of the industry and our company to extend our leadership position in rail to delivering innovative and scalable technologies for our customers in harness the power of our continuous improvement culture. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning, and I'll turn the call over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine? Good morning, Justin. Justin, I would add a couple of things there. Just keeping in mind we have over 60% of the new locomotives been shipped in the second half of the year. So, with that we've got some give and some takes between third and fourth quarter. I think most important is we expect margin expansions '22 and most importantly that our teams are executing well and that we're in a strong position to continue our margin expansion into '23 and beyond. Yes. It's early certainly to provide guidance in '23 but we continue to see this strong demand across the business. When we think about the pipeline of deals, we have relevant opportunities across geographies. We have progressed with the pipeline of opportunities both in North America and then internationally. We expect to finish the year with book to bill, Justin, about one for all the businesses as we did in '21. I say we're very much on track to finish '22 with double digit increase on orders versus five year despite of FX. And that just provides us strong coverage for '23 and beyond. We pose to extend a little bit on what we're seeing across various geographies, we certainly saw some of the winds we had in Australia and Africa. Volume dynamics continue to be positive in Kazakhstan. We have a number of projects under discussion in Asia. Even mining demand continues to hold with that at this point services' actually growing faster than equipment sales as we go into '23. In North America, I think despite of the carloads being down here today, we continue to see demands for both MODs and new locomotives to a number of discussions going to that. And certainly significant opportunity for some of the class ones to further improve operating ratio and to while so bring significant impact to their ESG targets. So, transits I think infrastructure spanning continues to be a positive for us. And I think all-in-all going to '23 we're well-positioned from a backlog coverage and I had from a backlog coverage from what we had a year ago. Hi, Jerry. Jerry, I'd say in the near term we expect inflation to persist and as an organization we'll remain diligent on both cost management and on pricing. Jerry, we would expect the same thing as we saw going up as is coming down. Hopefully the cost will come down, we're seeing a lot of mixed signals. Some are moving in the lower direction and others are actually still rising. But if they do come down, they'll be very similar and the fact that remember that about 60% of our revenue is tied up in long-term contracts that have price escalators. And so, they will adjust as we see those prices adjust. And the additional 40% of cost are going up, will go up and get more pricing and as they come down, we may see a little bit of a benefit there. Good. Well, we're continuing to explore bolt-on acquisitions. I think we're going to be again opportunistic here. We'll need to be strategic with stronger returns and helping us drive ROIC higher and driving faster good also. We're continued to evaluate opportunities there. We think there's opportunity for prices to still come down on those. And with that, I mean, we're committed to ultimately just really by our cash flow and certain buyer returns to shareholders. So, share repurchase will also be a something we're looking at. : Well, as I mentioned before, I think going to 2023, we're well-positioned from a backlog, certainly, ahead of what we were a year ago, I think even the underlying performance of the business we're really very well-positioned to deliver on the five-year guidance that we provided during the Investor Day, last March. So this is less than just about 2023. It's really making sure we're progressing towards the guidance we provided during Investor Day. In our 12 month backlog, adjusted for currency is up approximately 15% at this point in the year versus prior year. : Thank you. : No, no, there's not. Scott. With regards to the Inflation Reduction Act, there's a couple of things. One is there's a tax on, I'm sure repurchases that everyone's aware of. Secondly, there is a minimum tax that could have an impact on our cash on next year. At this point, we don't know enough, because not enough of the regulations are out. But they should be out in the first half. And we'll know a little bit more of the overall impact of the company then. : We're seeing some specific opportunities is really tied to the railroads and some of the operators there, Scott, and we're following up with those opportunities as we work along, I mean, my only comments would be just in battery electric overall, I think the interest continues to be strong on that portfolio that we continue to build, certainly saw that with the order or the MOU we've signed with Kazakhstan and the level of interest continuous across various geographies. So to your point, we could see some benefit coming from some specific projects customers will look at driving in North America. : Thank you. : Let me start. Allison on transit just overall. I think, if you think about really underlying drivers for the business, they're positive. If you look at the backlog coverage for the year, at the end of the third quarter, we're five points ahead at the same time last year. Our 12 month backlog, if you look at constant currency, it's about 16.5%. Our total backlog is up 7.2% on the same basis, and we'll finish 2022 with a book-to-bill above one. So with that being said, I think we're continuing to take action to drive profitable growth in the business. And we're continuing to see investment in that regard. : Let me start. I'll pass it on down to John. But with transit in specific, at this point, we're not seeing any operational disruptions with regards to cyber, as John described. In fact, when we think about the fourth quarter, we would actually expect some level of both manufacturing production and revenue catch up during the fourth quarter on that. In terms of overall dynamics, we're continuing to see a strong pipeline of opportunities out there. I did mention here, that strength really playing out across various geographies. And in many ways across the business. It's all about really driving convertibility into that. So we're certainly proud of what we've seen in the digital electronics business, which is one that I mean, we're continuing to also see very positive dynamics, year today being one of the highest businesses from the book-to-bill perspective. So it's all about converting that pipeline of opportunities. And we are certainly in a stronger position to be driving profitable into 2023 than we were a year ago. And we feel certainly strong about five-year outlook we're providing the business during Investor Day. : Thank you. : I think, certainly to describe what we'll see in 2023, from a volume perspective, but certainly, I think with some of the elements, what you described in both terms of network velocity improving, and well, time reducing that could be a headwind, parkings, I think on the other side, I think we've got enough tailwind to offset that with both the amount for mods and demand for services overall. So that's, I think at the end of day they are positive for us? : Thank you. : So my comment was with regards to the second half of the year, and I said over 60% of the new locomotive deliveries would have happened in the second half. With that there is again, some give and take between third quarter and fourth quarter. And as you'd expect, we could see some variation here, as we progress through that. : So yes, we do expect growth in the service business, despite of the dynamics you just described there. And I think I'll go back to -- we continue to drive towards margin expansion. We feel we're in a strong position here to do so as we look at the coverage we've got going into next year. So that's a positive. We've got strong digital growth, as you see it in the numbers as well. And so yes, we do expect margin expansion going through 2023 and beyond. : Thank you. : Good morning. : I'll just add. Our teams continue to work through contingency plans. So we're certainly looking at dual supplier sourcing, that's something they've been looking at as we really prepare ourselves for an outcome. That it's still uncertain in a lot of ways. But we have invested on really moving some of our sites into lower energy and tasked to use and continue to invest on alternative energy sources there. And also, the cost side of that is like any other rising costs, we will look the price to cover it. And manage our margins, regardless of whether it's an energy spike, or a metal spike or a labor spike, we're very focused on continuing to build those margins. : So, were happy with the acquisition of Nordco. We're ahead of the performer. The team continues to progress very well. We're certainly excited about the opportunities here to drive growth beyond what we have planned for, especially in the international markets. And that's something the team is very focused on. It's about utilizing the footprint that we already have established in other countries to be able to drive down product line, there's a couple geographies that are really keen for us here. And you'll hear more on some of the progress there, the following quarters. : Thank you."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristine Kubacki, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Wabtec's second quarter 2022 earnings call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, John Olin; and Senior Vice President of Finance, John Mastalerz. Today's slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures were posted on our website earlier today and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Some statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. I will now turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4. I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the second quarter, progress on our long-term value framework, and then John will cover the financials. We delivered a strong second quarter, which is evidenced by another quarter of adjusted margin expansion of 1.5 percentage points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 16%. More importantly, we continued our progress against our long-term strategies, as evidenced by a significant expansion in the total backlog. Sales were roughly $2 billion, which was up modestly versus prior year. Revenue was driven by strong performance in the freight segment, but partially offset by lower year-over-year revenue in the transit segment. Excluding foreign currency exchange, consolidated revenues would have grown by roughly 5.5%. Total cash flow from operations was $263 million for a cash conversion of over 90%. Total multiyear backlog was over $23 billion, up $1.7 billion and excluding the headwinds from foreign exchange backlog was up $2.3 billion from last year. Finally, we closed two strategic acquisitions in the quarter, Beena Vision and ARINC and deployed over $100 million in share repurchases and dividends. So, all in all, we had a very good quarter. We continue to invest for the future as we execute commercially and operationally with discipline and rigor. And we're well-positioned to continue to drive long-term growth even with uncertainty and volatility in the overall economy. Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about our end-market conditions in more details. As we look at key metrics across our freight businesses, we are encouraged by the continued momentum in our end-markets and the strong pipeline of opportunities. North America carloads are expected to improve in the second half of the year, and locomotive parkings have continued to decline, despite lower year-to-date freight traffic. We continue to see significant opportunities and demand for new locomotives and modernizations as our customers invest in their ageing fleets, and place a greater demand on reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency. When it comes to the North American railcar build, demand for railcars is increasing from what we believe are trough levels. Railcars in storage are below pre-COVID levels, with about 18% of the North American railcar fleet in storage. As a result, industry orders for new railcars continue to improve and the industry outlook for 2022 is for over 40,000 cars to be delivered. Overall, we believe we have the opportunity to build significant long-term momentum with growth in modernizations, in new locomotive sales, in railcar builds and in rolling stock. Internationally, freight car activity also continues to show positive signs. We have been growing our international fleet mid single digits on average over the last 5 years. And we are currently executing on a strong pipeline of order opportunities. Overall, we expect long-term revenue growth in the majority of our end-markets. Finally, transitioning to the transit sector, the long-term market drivers remain positive, with continuing global infrastructure spanning for clean, safe and efficient transportation solutions. Our team is committed to driving growth across both Freight and the Transit segments. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few recent business highlights. We recently secured some strategic orders, including a significant agreement with Union Pacific for 600 locomotive modernizations. These agreements totaling more than a $1 billion will begin delivery next year and run over the next 3 years. It is the largest order for modernized locomotives and rail industry history. The modernizations will enable Union Pacific to move more freight efficiently and sustainably, including a fuel efficiency improvement of up to 18% or more than 80% increase in reliability, and haulage ability increase of more than 55%. This total order will eliminate nearly 200,000 tons of emissions per year, roughly the equivalent of 45,000 passenger cars per year. We also close the significant order with Canadian National for 10 new Tier 4 locomotives, which will begin delivery in 2023 and 50 modernizations. The MODs will be equipped with our DLA advantage technology, which will deliver the best-in-class fuel and emissions reductions. This wins build on several recent announcements we have shared with Canadian National, including their purchase of the flex drive battery electric freight locomotives, and additional order for our precision dispatch system, which will help accelerate network optimization for CN and the entire rail industry. Finally, in Transit, we won a significant order for heating, ventilation and air conditioning units across Atlanta's metro system. This order marks the latest win in our long standing relationship with Stadler and marks the first subway order with the car builder in the U.S. Turning to Slide 7. I wanted to briefly touch on Wabtec's operating system, which drives many aspects of our culture and our performance. Starting with our people and teams, addressing our customer's most critical business needs and developing operating plants, systems and processes to deliver best-in-class performance. We use this operating model to guide what we do to measure how well we execute and to tackle where we need to improve. One of the critical elements of our operating system is our annual strategic planning process. And we are in the midst of this process right now. The goal is to look at opportunities across our markets and our company and identify those areas where we can further leverage our leadership and technology position, build on our expensive install base, capitalize on trends, such as electrification, digitalization, automation, and sustainable transportation, which will all create positive outcomes for our customers. We also look to accelerate investments across the company through our integration 2.0 efforts as well as driving lean operations, continuous improvement and best-in-class productivity, all of which delivers long-term shareholder value. It's also a critical process in aligning our talents, our products, service and software investments to drive long-term profitable growth. We are confident that we're well-positioned for the future and we expect to continue to deliver profitable growth ahead. Since 2019, this process and the Wabtec operating system have been the foundation for driving rigor, strategic alignment and efficiency, especially while navigating profound volatility. As a result, we have been able to bring the full power of Wabtec to our customers, while balancing the need for agility with a clear focus on strategy and execution to own the opportunities before us. With that, I'll turn the call over to, John, to reveal the quarter segment results and our overall financial performance. John?\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Rafael, and hello, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I will review our second quarter results in more detail. We had another good quarter of operational and financial performance despite continued challenges in the supply chain, currency exchange and cost increases. Sales for the second quarter were $2.05 billion, which reflects a 1.8% increase versus the prior year. Freight segment sales were strong, up 11.5%, partially offset by lower year-over-year sales in our Transit segment. Q2 sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable currency exchange, which reduced our revenue growth in the quarter by 3.8 percentage points. For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $340 million, which was up 11.5% versus the prior year. We delivered strong margin expansion, up 1.5 percentage points on an adjusted basis. Margins were aided by mix favorability, increased pricing and improved productivity, partially offset by significantly higher costs. The team achieved margin expansion even in the face of rising costs and continued supply chain disruptions. Through the first half of the year, our revenue growth excluding foreign currency exchange, and our margin growth have been in line with our original plan and in line with the cadence which we discussed when we issued our 2022 guidance. As we look forward to the second half, we continue to expect accelerated growth in revenue from the first half behind significantly increased locomotive deliveries and lower year-over-year margin percent due to unfavorable mix in our equipment sales and comparing against much higher back half margins in 2021. More specifically, we anticipate this margin decline will be more pronounced in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect our full year margin percent will be up modestly. In the second quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.23, up 16.0% versus the prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.91, which was up 37.9% versus the second quarter a year-ago. During the quarter, we had pre-tax charges of $4 million for restructuring and other one-time charges largely related to our integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec's operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. As Rafael noted, we were very pleased with our Q2 results, especially in the face of significant foreign currency exchange headwinds and continued supply disruptions and our strong margin growth in the face of continued cost increases. We remain diligent and proactive as we work to minimize these challenges. Turning to Slide 9, let's review our product lines in more detail. Second quarter consolidated sales were up modestly at 1.8% and the underlying business is performing well up 5.6%, excluding foreign currency exchange. Equipment sales were up a very strong 16.2% from last year due to higher locomotive deliveries in this quarter versus last year and continued strong mining sales. Component sales were up 4.5% year-over-year, driven by higher OE railcar build, lower number of railcars in storage and a recovery in the industrial end-markets. Digital Electronic sales increased 1.2%, driven by a partial quarter of revenue from the strategic bolt on acquisitions of Beena Vision and ARINC, partially offset by ongoing chip shortages. We continue to see improved demand for our core onboard locomotive products and our backlog in digital continues to increase. Our services sales grew 14.3% versus last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher sales for modernizations and the continued unparking of locomotives. The superior performance, reliability and availability from our fleet continues to drive customer demand as railroads increasingly look for predictable outcomes across their fleets. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 17.5% versus the prior year to $558 million. Sales were down versus last year due primarily to the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange. We believe the medium and long-term outlook for this segment remains positive as infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue. Moving to Slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin expanded 1.7 percentage points to 31.6%, driven by a richer mix of products, increased pricing and strong productivity, partially offset by higher input cost and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Mix in pricing positively impacted our margins. Mix benefited margins as freight sales outpaced our transit sales. Additionally, higher pricing was realized for price escalations incorporated into many of our long-term contracts, along with other price actions that were implemented to recover cost increases. Raw material costs were again up significantly, led by increased metal costs and dramatically higher energy costs. Foreign currency exchange adversely impacted revenues by 3.8 percentage points, and adversely impacted second quarter gross profits by $15 million. Finally, manufacturing costs were favorable due to productivity gains, which were largely offset by higher transportation and logistics costs. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures by triggering price escalations, implementing price surcharges and driving operational productivity and lean initiatives. Turning to Slide 11. For the second quarter, adjusted operating margin expanded 1.5 percentage points versus last year. Our margins benefited from higher adjusted gross profit, but were partially offset by higher operating expenses, primarily from increased investment in future technologies. Adjusted SG&A was $257 million, which was up slightly versus prior year, but down 10 basis points as a percentage of sales to 12.5%. Engineering expense increased from last year according to plan. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers productivity, capacity utilization and safety. Now let's take a look at segment results on Slide 12, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales improved for the quarter and segment adjusted operating income was $301 million for an adjusted margin of 20.3%, up 1.8 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefits of higher sales, improved mix and productivity were partially offset by higher operating expenses. Finally, segment backlog was $19.68 billion, up $1.84 billion or up 10.3% from the end of Q2 last year, due to the significant multiyear order momentum that Rafael discussed earlier. Turning to Slide 13, Transit segments sales were down 17.5% driven by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange, the exit of low margin contracts in our U.K business and a late quarter manufacturing disruption caused by a cyber incident. In addition, Transit revenue continues to be adversely impacted by supply chain disruptions. As previously announced, on June 26, we detected a cybersecurity incident that impacted the company's network, which disproportionately affected our Transit business. This disruption modestly reduced Q2 revenues and is expected to have an impact on our Q3 transit results. Adjusted segment operating income decreased by $15 million to $58 million, which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 10.3%, down 0.5 percentage points versus the prior year. Lower absorption, inefficiencies driven by the manufacturing disruption and unfavorable foreign currency exchange were partially offset by strong productivity and lower SG&A.  Transit continues to focus on driving down costs, implementing lean and improving operational efficiencies, despite the volatile environment. Finally, Transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.55 billion, down 4% versus a year-ago. Adjusting for the negative effect of foreign currency exchange, backlog would have been up 5.3%. Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 14. During the quarter, we generated $263 million of operating cash flow resulting in a cash conversion rate of 92%. This brings our year-to-date operating cash flow to $424 million. Cash flow benefited from higher earnings, but was impacted by the proactive build of inventories ahead of our strong growth expectations and managing supply disruptions of critical parts. Looking forward, we are confident that we will generate strong cash flow for the year. Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter declined to 2.4 x and our liquidity is robust at $1.48 billion. We closed on the acquisition of two digital companies Beena Vision and ARINC. The combined purchase price of these two businesses was $69 million. Also during the quarter, we returned more cash to our shareholders, repurchasing an additional $103 million of shares and paid dividends of $27 million. As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong and we are confident that we can continue to drive solid cash generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital towards the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael.\nJohn Olin: Thanks, John. Let's flip to Slide 15 to discuss our 2022 financial guidance. In the first quarter, we issued guidance with sales growth at the midpoint of 8% and EPS of $4.65 to $5.05 or up roughly 14% at the midpoint. Our guidance was based on improving industry momentum, and strong underlying customer demand for our products. With the first half behind us, we continue to feel strong about our businesses and we delivered against our regional planned financials despite unplanned loss of business in Russia, and very unfavorable foreign currency exchange. We are maintaining our full year revenue and cash conversion guidance and we are tightening our full year earnings guidance to $4.70 to $5. I am pleased with the strength and resiliency of our business. And more importantly, I'm extremely proud that our teams continue to deliver despite an ever changing and challenging environment. Now, let's wrap up on Slide 16. As you've heard today, our team delivered a strong quarter despite a challenging and evolving environment, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, best-in-class technologies and our teams focus on our customers. For these reasons and more, we are confident that Wabtec is well-positioned for long-term profitable growth. Looking forward, we will lean further into the strong fundamentals of the industry, and of our company to extend our leadership position in rail to deliver innovative, scalable technologies for our customers, and to harness the power of our lean and continuous improvement culture. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning. And I'll turn the call now over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine?\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions. But before we do and out of considerations for others on the call, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator:  And our first question will come from Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJustin Long: Thanks, and good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Justin.\nJustin Long: I wanted to clarify, was the UNP order for 600 MODs included in the reported backlog, and also just given that announcement and the announcement we saw earlier this year from NS, and I guess we got some orders from CN this quarter as well. What level of growth in MOD is already locked in looking into 2023? I mean, could we be up 100 units, 200 units any order of magnitude just based on what you already have in the backlog for next year?\nRafael Santana: Yes. So number one, yes, it is included in the backlog. And with that, just one thing to also keep in mind is if you think just about the backlog from a quarter-over-quarter impact from FX alone, it's been over $400 million, year-over-year, it's closer to $600 million. So I think it's important to highlight that, otherwise, you might have expected a larger increase, but it is reflected. Second piece is, as you described, I think we have strong momentum. And it's not just internationally as we have largely described before. But as we've been saying for the past 12 months, I think we have a strong pipeline of opportunities that cuts across both internationally and in North America. We continue to have, I would say, opportunities to grow double digits in terms of the modernization demand and of course, we are coming from trough levels in terms of demand for renewable commodities. So it's good to see the momentum. I think the pipeline of opportunities that we see it on today is stronger than the one we described 3 months ago, or six months ago. So continued opportunity here to further expand our backlog.\nJustin Long: Okay. And just to be clear that double-digit growth in MODs was referring to 2023?\nRafael Santana: Exactly. And I think just to add to that, I think one of the important things about this -- this is less about just '23. It's really, I'd say very much aligned on how we described our 5-year plan.\nJustin Long: Understood. And I guess, secondly, for John, thinking about the guidance, so the Transit segment saw a pretty significant sequential decline in adjusted operating income. Can you talk about what you're assuming for the back half in Transit? Are we expecting to get back closer to what we saw in the first quarter from an operating income perspective? And then just anything on the cadence of margins and earnings in 3Q and 4Q? I know you said 3Q would be worse from a margin perspective year-over-year, but the comp is tougher. So I just wanted to think about things on maybe more of an absolute basis in the next two quarters.\nJohn Olin: Well, let's start with -- that's a lot, Justin. Let's start with the Transit business. Starting with revenue, when we look at the overall first half, we find that revenue was down about 12% and operating margins down slightly at tenths of a point. So number one is we believe that Transit's ability to hold margin in the face of lower revenue speaks to its resilience and underlying earnings growth. And more importantly, the decline in the first half revenue was caused by a few items that don't represent the businesses underlying performance or just in the future growth risk potential. These items include the foreign currency exchange, which in the first half was 7 percentage points. And on a quarterly basis, it was up to 9. We talked about in the first quarter the exit of the low margin U.K business that continues into the second quarter. We will not continue beyond it. Now we're lapping the full exit of that. And then finally, the manufacturing disruption we had from the cyber incident, which reduced revenue roughly 5% in the Transit business, and that incident largely hit the Transit business. But excluding these items, Justin, the underlying business is up modestly. As we look to Q3, we do continue to expect headwinds on Transit revenue because of foreign currency, and certainly some spillover of the cyber incident. When we look at the overall margin piece, that's been really driven by a lot lower absorption in the second quarter as well as some of the inefficiencies due to the cyber event. In the back half, we don't provide guidance for the back half. But with that, on Transit -- but with that, Justin, I'll transit into your next question, which is on the cadence. As we've talked about, this year in the cadence, we've talked about really the story of two halves. The first half, we would expect a moderate growth, and ex currency, we were up a little over 5% in the first half. And we also talked about stronger year-over-year earnings -- sorry, margin growth in the first half, and we were up about 1.4 percentage points on the half. So that really played out exactly as we had planned. When we looked at the back half, we said that the back half would be more pressured on margin growth. And actually, we said that it would be lower on a year-over-year basis. And that would be driven by much higher revenue that's coming from our equipment group in the delivery of locomotives, predominantly in the back half. So now if we look at the back half and parse that back a little bit better and talk about the cadence between quarters, we would expect the third quarter and the fourth quarter to be up significantly in revenue, but a little bit more on the third quarter than the fourth quarter. And with regards to operating margin, we would expect the margin percent in the third quarter to be less than what we experienced in the fourth quarter.\nJustin Long: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, John.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please go ahead.\nEli Winski: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. This is Eli Winski on for Chris. So \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nEli Winski: \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 maybe -- good morning. So I just want to go to the revenue segment for a second, in Freight. So I understand that equipment growth will look really strong. Is that where the focus is right now in growth within freight? And I understand that MODs are doing well, but maybe on the Components and just Digital Electronics, like how should we be thinking about some of the revenue growth in those two areas as well?\nRafael Santana: Well, if you take about the quarter per se, it's certainly lab, not just by equipment. You see it on the services side as well. If you think about components, we do expect to continue to gain momentum there as you're coming from the trough, and we do expect that the number of freight cars shipped will be about 40,000. So that's a positive too. I think the other elements, which is on Digital Electronics, we expect strong second half in terms of sales. And certainly when you look at backlog dynamics, it's certainly reflected in both in terms of the Digital Electronics business and the Component business both with book-to-bill above 1.\nEli Winski: Okay, great. That makes sense. Thanks, Rafael. And then, John, I appreciate the help on the cost and the margin. But I feel like there's been a lot of talk about just FX. And just maybe can you help us clarify what the specific impact of FX was in this quarter? And how does it compare to last year? I just want to understand like how that impacted each of the segments and on the full business, and then what that looks like year-over-year?\nJohn Olin: Great. Good question. So let's start with what's driving it. The euro is driving it. The U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically, as you know, against the euro. And if we look at the average euro a year ago, it was at 120. And in the second quarter that we just exited it's at 107. So it's about 12% strengthening against the dollar. What this does is it translates into our revenue, which on a consolidated basis, was down $76 million. And if you look at that, in terms of a percentage of growth, that was 3.8 percentage points of growth that kind of went away because of currency. That was much more predominant when you look at our Transit business. It was $60 million that hit Transit and just shy of 9 percentage points decline in revenue do to it. Now as we lose -- move to the earnings impact, it's considerably less than the impact on revenue and that's a result of the company's natural hedges and the way we're manufacturing and a lot of that being locally. Gross profit in the quarter was down $15 million due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange, and then operating income was only down $4 million.\nEli Winski: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Elkott with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Elkott: Good morning. Thank you. Would love to hear an update on the performance of the FLXdrive and any possible issues that still need to be worked out? Also, any update on the number and cadence of deliveries over the next few years would be appreciated? I know you guys have been taking orders from several railroads over the past year or so. So any insight into when deliveries might kick in over the next few years would be helpful.\nRafael Santana: So let me start with the second half of your question, I'll go down into the FLXdrive question. I think on the pipeline of deals, we really have relevant opportunities across key geographies at this point. I think volume dynamics continue to be a positive in Kazakhstan. We have a number of projects under discussion in Asia and Australia. We continue to follow up specific projects in Africa that are tied to commodity exports. In Brazil, I think despite of the drop in carloads year-to-date, there's significant opportunities tied to renew concessions, and mining is also a positive in that context. I think in North America, despite of carloads being down for the first half, we continue to see growing demand for modernization and new locomotives. And that's, again, driving efficiency and reliability, with a direct impact to the operating ratio of our customers and bringing certainly enormous impact to their ESG targets as well. So when we look at the cadence moving forward, I think we certainly feel we're very well-positioned to deliver 5-year guidance that we provided at our Investor Day. We certainly feel stronger about it now than we did 3 months ago and then we did 6 months ago. And that's very much aligned to, I think, the pipeline of opportunities we've started to describe over a year ago. On the FLXdrive comment there is we continue to see interests from customers out there. We are continuing discussions, and you're going to see that moving through other geographies. And I think that's very much aligned how we see the evolution here and, you're going to see also permutations of that product going to not just full battery electric, but also hybrid as we've also described on previous calls.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. And then just anything -- is everything going as expected as far as the testing and the performance of the FLXdrive, Rafael?\nRafael Santana: Yes, it is. We are certainly paying a lot of attention and working very closely not just with our customers, but also with suppliers in that context and making sure that we continue to progress with all the elements of that and special with regards to the battery. And as you know, we have a partnership here established with GM, and we're working very closely with them in order to make sure we continue to progress in that direction.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. Just one quick follow-up, Rafael. You mentioned mining. We've seen some slight guidance reductions on CapEx from some of the miners this earnings season. Nothing big. I mean, I guess, end-market demand continues to be solid. But given the slight CapEx reductions and the lower commodity prices, are you guys concerned about the Mining segment beyond this year? I know your outlook for this year is positive, but what about 2023?\nRafael Santana: I think that can certainly be an element of, I'm just going to call, the cycle moving forward. We are working very closely with customers and with Komatsu  in that regard. We see solid opportunities ahead, and we will continue to make sure we are balancing that with auto  in the business. I think there's a lot of positive news here in terms of what we could be seeing in terms of opportunities for the rail side. So solid. No concerns for the year. We will continue to work closely here with customers to understand demand into '23 and beyond.\nMatt Elkott: Great. Thank you very much.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nIvan Yi: Yes, good morning. This is Ivan Yi on for Scott.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nIvan Yi: Good morning. First, can you discuss the rough margin percentages on these locomotive modifications -- modernizations? And how does that compare relative to margins on new locomotives?\nJohn Olin: Yes, Ivan, we don't provide specific margins, obviously. But when we look at MODs versus new, the way to think about it is that certainly the revenue is somewhat lower on a MOD than a new. However, the margin is somewhat higher on a MOD than a new.\nIvan Yi: Great. That's helpful. And secondly, what has been the impact of poor rail service on the pace of loco on parkings? And also, have you started having any initial conversations with the rails about buying any new locomotives? Thank you.\nJohn Olin: So true. Thanks. Of course, I think the services have -- as you look at least into the past several months, have translated into unparking of locomotives. That -- I mean, as you look forward, it's got to be balanced with carloads being a bit more positive here in the second half of the year. So I think that's part of balance. When you think about investment on new locomotives, it's part of the construct and the dialogue that we have with North American customers. You see that as part of the announcement of some purchases of Tier 4 units this past quarter. And this is very much part of the dialogue. It's going to depend in some of the solutions in order to solve for some of the productivity and efficiency, while we are convinced that there is an opportunity here to invest and drive both reliability and efficiencies from the existing fleet very much aligned with the opportunity here to improve operating ratios and also aligned to driving, I think, significant elements of the decarbonization targets that were laid out there.\nIvan Yi: Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you and good morning, everybody.\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: My question is a little bit on the bigger picture on inflation margin. You guys have had really solid margin performance, perhaps without as much at least backward-looking cycle and revenue support as some other end-markets. I'm curious if -- I mean, when you look at your supply chain and you look at your costs, is there any wave of inflation coming that you have not yet dealt with? Maybe you could just give sort of a general outlook on how the inflationary cost pressures in your supply chain, your backlog and your outlook compared with your forward looking ability of the price? Thank you.\nJohn Olin: Okay, Rob. The inflation that you're referring to came in an initial wave of higher costs in the third quarter of last year. And it takes a while for that to roll through our inventory, right? And we saw cost build and rise in the third, fourth and first quarter of this year. And we did have and see another cost shock at a much smaller level than what we saw in the third quarter, and that was due to the war in Ukraine. So as some of that rolls through, we would expect cost to rise a little bit from the first cost shock. Now having said that, we are seeing some tempering of costs out there, right? Metals are had a good quarter. They're down, but they're still at historic highs and up on a year-over-year basis. But tempering, we feel good about that. In terms of the logistics costs, we are continuing to see very high cost of transportation and logistics, in particular, in containers coming from Asia, but they've tempered slightly as well. So -- all this is going to take time to get through our P&L, but we would expect costs in the third quarter to be up a bit from what we are seeing here in the second quarter.\nRafael Santana: I will just close saying that, I mean, we are committed to grow margins forward. We could and will have significant variation sometimes quarter-to-quarter. I think this is especially given the mix with much higher growth in equipment. There's also the elements of what John spoke about in terms of inflation. With specific for the second half of the year, I just want to emphasize here how big the mix impact is. And specific in the third quarter, if you think about it, we are -- we have over a third of our shipments of new locomotives happening in the third quarter. So I couldn't highlight enough some of the elements of mix and variation that we can see from that on quarter-over-quarter.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Thanks.\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSaree Boroditsky: Hi. Good morning. Just building on your last comment. You talked about a third of the locomotive shipments happened in the third quarter. Could you quantify how much of the mix headwind do you expect on margins just from these locomotive shipments?\nJohn Olin: We can't quantify that, Saree. Just the overall concept that while we have strong margins and our equipment business are lower than the average. And as Rafael had mentioned, we will have a significant revenue growth driven by that, and that will pull over -- pull down the margin. It's something that we planned on all year long, and we are expecting. And again, that's why we've talked about in the back half that our margins on a year-over-year basis will be lower than a year ago. But on a full year basis, our margins will be up modestly as we've discussed.\nRafael Santana: I will just reemphasize that for the year, we expect results very much aligned to the guidance we provided in February this year and how we described on previous earnings calls. So it's all about higher margins in the first half of the year, higher volume in the second half, with a significant element of mix coming in.\nSaree Boroditsky: Got it. And then you've previously talked to think about the opportunity for 500 MODs per year. Just given the recent orders, how are you executing on this opportunity? And are these orders incremental to this or just in line with your outlook?\nRafael Santana: We have not provided any specific guidance with regards to a total number of MODs. So we certainly see opportunity to continue to expand on that. And I think we've been clear about that on previous calls. So the opportunity is there. It's certainly reflected in the pipeline, and you are seeing that being realized as backlog continues to grow.\nSaree Boroditsky: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nathan Ho with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nNathan Ho: Hi. Good morning, team.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks again . Just a quick question on the cyber attack and sort of the 3Q impact on operations. Would you mind maybe giving a little bit more detail on how this affected both quarterly operations as well as same margins? Thanks.\nRafael Santana: Okay. Just in terms of the second quarter, I think John said it, it was about 5% in the third quarter. \nJohn Olin: 5% in Transit.\nRafael Santana: 5% Transit, in specific. We would expect that to be less in the third quarter. We don't expect impact for the year, and that's part of why we've reaffirmed guidance at this point.\nNathan Ho: Got you. Thank you so much. And also just, John, on your comments regarding supply chain challenges. I mean we've seen some incremental debottlenecking for the auto sector. Are you -- for your Digital Electronics, are you witnessing anything similar there? Is there sort of signs of incremental improvement?\nJohn Olin: Nathan, as we look from first quarter to second quarter, we don't see any improvement. The good news is I don't feel it's getting worse. The unfortunate news is we don't feel it's getting better as well. And again, as Rafael had mentioned earlier, that's certainly a big impact on our first half revenues with digital. But chips are hard to come by. We are not seeing a change from the first quarter, and we're hopeful as we move forward.\nRafael Santana: Just a couple of comments on the Digital. I mean, orders grew double digits last year. Book-to-bill for this year is very positive. It's the highest between our businesses year-to-date. So a number of multiyear agreement. We expect the second half strong sales second half of the year. And with that, as John mentioned, chip shortages have had an impact for the business.\nNathan Ho: Got it. Thanks .\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone.\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: I'm wondering if you folks can talk about your capacity for MODs, how quickly you can ramp up considering the size of the Union Pacific order compared to your production to date? An update on how you're thinking about capacity for that line of business would be helpful. And also, Rafael, if you could comment on your assessment of using MODs to  essentially the greenhouse gas reduction targets for other rails? How optimistic are you on others taking a similar approach?\nRafael Santana: Yes. Jerry, first, in terms of the manufacturing footprint to deliver on these orders and more, we certainly feel strong about having that capacity. And we certainly have the manufacturing capacity to do that, but it's about more than that. It's making sure that we're continuing to work very closely with our customers, suppliers in that process, so we can ultimately anticipate demand. Certainly, lead times, when you look at a couple of years ago, have extended. And I think a big piece has been really making sure that we were close to customers so we could anticipate demand. And you see, to some extent, some of that certainly has impacted our inventory numbers as part of that, but that's a piece of it. When it comes to MODs, I think that continues to be a very positive story, and it's really part of a dialogue that varies customer by customer in terms of the solutions. I think we see some significant opportunities for customers to actually be working on being more productive. And in some cases, means reducing the number of locomotives that pull a certain number of cars, and that has translated into also applying some of the fuel solutions that we've described. And we see opportunity to continue to expand on that. I think what's important here is we see that part of really a growing multiyear backlog. This is I think less about what '23 is going to be. It's back to the comment I made, which is really tied to the 5-year plan that we described. And we feel like we are very well-positioned to deliver on that 5-year guidance that we provided at our Investor Day last March despite of all the macroeconomic uncertainties out there.\nJerry Revich: And speaking of the uncertainties, you folks pointed out the Russia headwind. And looking at your freight results in the quarter, it's tough to pinpoint which lines of business the Russia headwind played out and obviously, organic growth would have been stronger without it. Can you talk about which lines of business the exit impacted the most in the quarter within Freight?\nRafael Santana: Certainly, Freight, probably the combination of equipment and services. That's where we really saw the bulk of that impact.\nJerry Revich: And Rafael, was the full 5 points that you anticipated at Investor Day on a consolidated basis?\nJohn Olin: Jerry, that would be 2%. So the revenues that we had in 2021 were about 2% of our sales.\nJerry Revich: Super. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: But for the year, as we've described, I mean, it's 5%. We can have variation again quarter-to-quarter, but that's about the magnitude of what we expected for the year.\nJerry Revich: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Dillon Cumming with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDillon Cumming: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the question.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nDillon Cumming: Just wanted to go back, Rafael, to one of your comments on the Park local  account. I think we understand why that's kind of moving lower through the year, right, and it's reflective of the service issues at the Class 1 level. I guess from our perceptive, it seems like more of the Class 1s are shifting their tone around potential parkings in the back half. So I guess my question is, in your view, if freight traffic does start to more fundamentally weaken next year, right, that reflects those service issues but more reflective of actual declines in rail demand? Is your view that the Class 1s actually can park more fleet? Or would you say the service issues are more supportive of kind of a structurally higher active fleet?\nRafael Santana: I think the element of parking is not just going to be a function of service improvement, but also what carloads do in that period. So I think that's something that we will continue to watch and work very closely as part of that. And I think what's a positive, I think it's a lot of the underlying investment that you see in terms of really guaranteeing fleet reliability, ultimately driving efficiency across the fleet. And I think we continue to see momentum there. So if that comes counterbalanced with any elements of potential parking, I think that's a story we still see and we will be working closely with our customers in that regard.\nDillon Cumming: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just a question on the back half margin-related issues or headwinds as it relates to international deliveries. I guess I was wondering, longer term, do you have scope to structurally improve the margin profile of those international deliveries? Because I think given your commentary on the pipeline, right, it feels like volume should be accelerating next year and into '24 as well. So just curious if this is more of a recurring issue? Or if you feel like you can actually start getting a better level of incremental margin on those international deliveries going forward?\nRafael Santana: So that's actually a positive, and it's something that we've been able to is to ultimately drive as-delivered margins better than now sold margins, something that we track very closely in the business. So there's certainly continued opportunity there. And I think the other piece is making sure that we are continuing to expand on growth on some of these markets where we've really had really, I will call the best-in-class products to work with customers, and we see some good momentum there.\nDillon Cumming: Okay, great. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kristine Kubacki for any closing remarks.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. And I'd like to thank everybody for their participation today, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Goodbye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Olin",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael, and hello, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I will review our second quarter results in more detail. We had another good quarter of operational and financial performance despite continued challenges in the supply chain, currency exchange and cost increases. Sales for the second quarter were $2.05 billion, which reflects a 1.8% increase versus the prior year. Freight segment sales were strong, up 11.5%, partially offset by lower year-over-year sales in our Transit segment. Q2 sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable currency exchange, which reduced our revenue growth in the quarter by 3.8 percentage points. For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $340 million, which was up 11.5% versus the prior year. We delivered strong margin expansion, up 1.5 percentage points on an adjusted basis. Margins were aided by mix favorability, increased pricing and improved productivity, partially offset by significantly higher costs. The team achieved margin expansion even in the face of rising costs and continued supply chain disruptions. Through the first half of the year, our revenue growth excluding foreign currency exchange, and our margin growth have been in line with our original plan and in line with the cadence which we discussed when we issued our 2022 guidance. As we look forward to the second half, we continue to expect accelerated growth in revenue from the first half behind significantly increased locomotive deliveries and lower year-over-year margin percent due to unfavorable mix in our equipment sales and comparing against much higher back half margins in 2021. More specifically, we anticipate this margin decline will be more pronounced in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect our full year margin percent will be up modestly. In the second quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.23, up 16.0% versus the prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.91, which was up 37.9% versus the second quarter a year-ago. During the quarter, we had pre-tax charges of $4 million for restructuring and other one-time charges largely related to our integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec's operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. As Rafael noted, we were very pleased with our Q2 results, especially in the face of significant foreign currency exchange headwinds and continued supply disruptions and our strong margin growth in the face of continued cost increases. We remain diligent and proactive as we work to minimize these challenges. Turning to Slide 9, let's review our product lines in more detail. Second quarter consolidated sales were up modestly at 1.8% and the underlying business is performing well up 5.6%, excluding foreign currency exchange. Equipment sales were up a very strong 16.2% from last year due to higher locomotive deliveries in this quarter versus last year and continued strong mining sales. Component sales were up 4.5% year-over-year, driven by higher OE railcar build, lower number of railcars in storage and a recovery in the industrial end-markets. Digital Electronic sales increased 1.2%, driven by a partial quarter of revenue from the strategic bolt on acquisitions of Beena Vision and ARINC, partially offset by ongoing chip shortages. We continue to see improved demand for our core onboard locomotive products and our backlog in digital continues to increase. Our services sales grew 14.3% versus last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher sales for modernizations and the continued unparking of locomotives. The superior performance, reliability and availability from our fleet continues to drive customer demand as railroads increasingly look for predictable outcomes across their fleets. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 17.5% versus the prior year to $558 million. Sales were down versus last year due primarily to the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange. We believe the medium and long-term outlook for this segment remains positive as infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue. Moving to Slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin expanded 1.7 percentage points to 31.6%, driven by a richer mix of products, increased pricing and strong productivity, partially offset by higher input cost and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Mix in pricing positively impacted our margins. Mix benefited margins as freight sales outpaced our transit sales. Additionally, higher pricing was realized for price escalations incorporated into many of our long-term contracts, along with other price actions that were implemented to recover cost increases. Raw material costs were again up significantly, led by increased metal costs and dramatically higher energy costs. Foreign currency exchange adversely impacted revenues by 3.8 percentage points, and adversely impacted second quarter gross profits by $15 million. Finally, manufacturing costs were favorable due to productivity gains, which were largely offset by higher transportation and logistics costs. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures by triggering price escalations, implementing price surcharges and driving operational productivity and lean initiatives. Turning to Slide 11. For the second quarter, adjusted operating margin expanded 1.5 percentage points versus last year. Our margins benefited from higher adjusted gross profit, but were partially offset by higher operating expenses, primarily from increased investment in future technologies. Adjusted SG&A was $257 million, which was up slightly versus prior year, but down 10 basis points as a percentage of sales to 12.5%. Engineering expense increased from last year according to plan. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers productivity, capacity utilization and safety. Now let's take a look at segment results on Slide 12, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales improved for the quarter and segment adjusted operating income was $301 million for an adjusted margin of 20.3%, up 1.8 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefits of higher sales, improved mix and productivity were partially offset by higher operating expenses. Finally, segment backlog was $19.68 billion, up $1.84 billion or up 10.3% from the end of Q2 last year, due to the significant multiyear order momentum that Rafael discussed earlier. Turning to Slide 13, Transit segments sales were down 17.5% driven by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange, the exit of low margin contracts in our U.K business and a late quarter manufacturing disruption caused by a cyber incident. In addition, Transit revenue continues to be adversely impacted by supply chain disruptions. As previously announced, on June 26, we detected a cybersecurity incident that impacted the company's network, which disproportionately affected our Transit business. This disruption modestly reduced Q2 revenues and is expected to have an impact on our Q3 transit results. Adjusted segment operating income decreased by $15 million to $58 million, which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 10.3%, down 0.5 percentage points versus the prior year. Lower absorption, inefficiencies driven by the manufacturing disruption and unfavorable foreign currency exchange were partially offset by strong productivity and lower SG&A.  Transit continues to focus on driving down costs, implementing lean and improving operational efficiencies, despite the volatile environment. Finally, Transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.55 billion, down 4% versus a year-ago. Adjusting for the negative effect of foreign currency exchange, backlog would have been up 5.3%. Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 14. During the quarter, we generated $263 million of operating cash flow resulting in a cash conversion rate of 92%. This brings our year-to-date operating cash flow to $424 million. Cash flow benefited from higher earnings, but was impacted by the proactive build of inventories ahead of our strong growth expectations and managing supply disruptions of critical parts. Looking forward, we are confident that we will generate strong cash flow for the year. Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter declined to 2.4 x and our liquidity is robust at $1.48 billion. We closed on the acquisition of two digital companies Beena Vision and ARINC. The combined purchase price of these two businesses was $69 million. Also during the quarter, we returned more cash to our shareholders, repurchasing an additional $103 million of shares and paid dividends of $27 million. As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong and we are confident that we can continue to drive solid cash generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital towards the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael. Thanks, John. Let's flip to Slide 15 to discuss our 2022 financial guidance. In the first quarter, we issued guidance with sales growth at the midpoint of 8% and EPS of $4.65 to $5.05 or up roughly 14% at the midpoint. Our guidance was based on improving industry momentum, and strong underlying customer demand for our products. With the first half behind us, we continue to feel strong about our businesses and we delivered against our regional planned financials despite unplanned loss of business in Russia, and very unfavorable foreign currency exchange. We are maintaining our full year revenue and cash conversion guidance and we are tightening our full year earnings guidance to $4.70 to $5. I am pleased with the strength and resiliency of our business. And more importantly, I'm extremely proud that our teams continue to deliver despite an ever changing and challenging environment. Now, let's wrap up on Slide 16. As you've heard today, our team delivered a strong quarter despite a challenging and evolving environment, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, best-in-class technologies and our teams focus on our customers. For these reasons and more, we are confident that Wabtec is well-positioned for long-term profitable growth. Looking forward, we will lean further into the strong fundamentals of the industry, and of our company to extend our leadership position in rail to deliver innovative, scalable technologies for our customers, and to harness the power of our lean and continuous improvement culture. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning. And I'll turn the call now over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine? Well, let's start with -- that's a lot, Justin. Let's start with the Transit business. Starting with revenue, when we look at the overall first half, we find that revenue was down about 12% and operating margins down slightly at tenths of a point. So number one is we believe that Transit's ability to hold margin in the face of lower revenue speaks to its resilience and underlying earnings growth. And more importantly, the decline in the first half revenue was caused by a few items that don't represent the businesses underlying performance or just in the future growth risk potential. These items include the foreign currency exchange, which in the first half was 7 percentage points. And on a quarterly basis, it was up to 9. We talked about in the first quarter the exit of the low margin U.K business that continues into the second quarter. We will not continue beyond it. Now we're lapping the full exit of that. And then finally, the manufacturing disruption we had from the cyber incident, which reduced revenue roughly 5% in the Transit business, and that incident largely hit the Transit business. But excluding these items, Justin, the underlying business is up modestly. As we look to Q3, we do continue to expect headwinds on Transit revenue because of foreign currency, and certainly some spillover of the cyber incident. When we look at the overall margin piece, that's been really driven by a lot lower absorption in the second quarter as well as some of the inefficiencies due to the cyber event. In the back half, we don't provide guidance for the back half. But with that, on Transit -- but with that, Justin, I'll transit into your next question, which is on the cadence. As we've talked about, this year in the cadence, we've talked about really the story of two halves. The first half, we would expect a moderate growth, and ex currency, we were up a little over 5% in the first half. And we also talked about stronger year-over-year earnings -- sorry, margin growth in the first half, and we were up about 1.4 percentage points on the half. So that really played out exactly as we had planned. When we looked at the back half, we said that the back half would be more pressured on margin growth. And actually, we said that it would be lower on a year-over-year basis. And that would be driven by much higher revenue that's coming from our equipment group in the delivery of locomotives, predominantly in the back half. So now if we look at the back half and parse that back a little bit better and talk about the cadence between quarters, we would expect the third quarter and the fourth quarter to be up significantly in revenue, but a little bit more on the third quarter than the fourth quarter. And with regards to operating margin, we would expect the margin percent in the third quarter to be less than what we experienced in the fourth quarter. Great. Good question. So let's start with what's driving it. The euro is driving it. The U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically, as you know, against the euro. And if we look at the average euro a year ago, it was at 120. And in the second quarter that we just exited it's at 107. So it's about 12% strengthening against the dollar. What this does is it translates into our revenue, which on a consolidated basis, was down $76 million. And if you look at that, in terms of a percentage of growth, that was 3.8 percentage points of growth that kind of went away because of currency. That was much more predominant when you look at our Transit business. It was $60 million that hit Transit and just shy of 9 percentage points decline in revenue do to it. Now as we lose -- move to the earnings impact, it's considerably less than the impact on revenue and that's a result of the company's natural hedges and the way we're manufacturing and a lot of that being locally. Gross profit in the quarter was down $15 million due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange, and then operating income was only down $4 million. Yes, Ivan, we don't provide specific margins, obviously. But when we look at MODs versus new, the way to think about it is that certainly the revenue is somewhat lower on a MOD than a new. However, the margin is somewhat higher on a MOD than a new. So true. Thanks. Of course, I think the services have -- as you look at least into the past several months, have translated into unparking of locomotives. That -- I mean, as you look forward, it's got to be balanced with carloads being a bit more positive here in the second half of the year. So I think that's part of balance. When you think about investment on new locomotives, it's part of the construct and the dialogue that we have with North American customers. You see that as part of the announcement of some purchases of Tier 4 units this past quarter. And this is very much part of the dialogue. It's going to depend in some of the solutions in order to solve for some of the productivity and efficiency, while we are convinced that there is an opportunity here to invest and drive both reliability and efficiencies from the existing fleet very much aligned with the opportunity here to improve operating ratios and also aligned to driving, I think, significant elements of the decarbonization targets that were laid out there. Okay, Rob. The inflation that you're referring to came in an initial wave of higher costs in the third quarter of last year. And it takes a while for that to roll through our inventory, right? And we saw cost build and rise in the third, fourth and first quarter of this year. And we did have and see another cost shock at a much smaller level than what we saw in the third quarter, and that was due to the war in Ukraine. So as some of that rolls through, we would expect cost to rise a little bit from the first cost shock. Now having said that, we are seeing some tempering of costs out there, right? Metals are had a good quarter. They're down, but they're still at historic highs and up on a year-over-year basis. But tempering, we feel good about that. In terms of the logistics costs, we are continuing to see very high cost of transportation and logistics, in particular, in containers coming from Asia, but they've tempered slightly as well. So -- all this is going to take time to get through our P&L, but we would expect costs in the third quarter to be up a bit from what we are seeing here in the second quarter. Thanks, Rob. We can't quantify that, Saree. Just the overall concept that while we have strong margins and our equipment business are lower than the average. And as Rafael had mentioned, we will have a significant revenue growth driven by that, and that will pull over -- pull down the margin. It's something that we planned on all year long, and we are expecting. And again, that's why we've talked about in the back half that our margins on a year-over-year basis will be lower than a year ago. But on a full year basis, our margins will be up modestly as we've discussed. 5% in Transit. Nathan, as we look from first quarter to second quarter, we don't see any improvement. The good news is I don't feel it's getting worse. The unfortunate news is we don't feel it's getting better as well. And again, as Rafael had mentioned earlier, that's certainly a big impact on our first half revenues with digital. But chips are hard to come by. We are not seeing a change from the first quarter, and we're hopeful as we move forward. Jerry, that would be 2%. So the revenues that we had in 2021 were about 2% of our sales."

            "content": "Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4. I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the second quarter, progress on our long-term value framework, and then John will cover the financials. We delivered a strong second quarter, which is evidenced by another quarter of adjusted margin expansion of 1.5 percentage points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 16%. More importantly, we continued our progress against our long-term strategies, as evidenced by a significant expansion in the total backlog. Sales were roughly $2 billion, which was up modestly versus prior year. Revenue was driven by strong performance in the freight segment, but partially offset by lower year-over-year revenue in the transit segment. Excluding foreign currency exchange, consolidated revenues would have grown by roughly 5.5%. Total cash flow from operations was $263 million for a cash conversion of over 90%. Total multiyear backlog was over $23 billion, up $1.7 billion and excluding the headwinds from foreign exchange backlog was up $2.3 billion from last year. Finally, we closed two strategic acquisitions in the quarter, Beena Vision and ARINC and deployed over $100 million in share repurchases and dividends. So, all in all, we had a very good quarter. We continue to invest for the future as we execute commercially and operationally with discipline and rigor. And we're well-positioned to continue to drive long-term growth even with uncertainty and volatility in the overall economy. Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about our end-market conditions in more details. As we look at key metrics across our freight businesses, we are encouraged by the continued momentum in our end-markets and the strong pipeline of opportunities. North America carloads are expected to improve in the second half of the year, and locomotive parkings have continued to decline, despite lower year-to-date freight traffic. We continue to see significant opportunities and demand for new locomotives and modernizations as our customers invest in their ageing fleets, and place a greater demand on reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency. When it comes to the North American railcar build, demand for railcars is increasing from what we believe are trough levels. Railcars in storage are below pre-COVID levels, with about 18% of the North American railcar fleet in storage. As a result, industry orders for new railcars continue to improve and the industry outlook for 2022 is for over 40,000 cars to be delivered. Overall, we believe we have the opportunity to build significant long-term momentum with growth in modernizations, in new locomotive sales, in railcar builds and in rolling stock. Internationally, freight car activity also continues to show positive signs. We have been growing our international fleet mid single digits on average over the last 5 years. And we are currently executing on a strong pipeline of order opportunities. Overall, we expect long-term revenue growth in the majority of our end-markets. Finally, transitioning to the transit sector, the long-term market drivers remain positive, with continuing global infrastructure spanning for clean, safe and efficient transportation solutions. Our team is committed to driving growth across both Freight and the Transit segments. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few recent business highlights. We recently secured some strategic orders, including a significant agreement with Union Pacific for 600 locomotive modernizations. These agreements totaling more than a $1 billion will begin delivery next year and run over the next 3 years. It is the largest order for modernized locomotives and rail industry history. The modernizations will enable Union Pacific to move more freight efficiently and sustainably, including a fuel efficiency improvement of up to 18% or more than 80% increase in reliability, and haulage ability increase of more than 55%. This total order will eliminate nearly 200,000 tons of emissions per year, roughly the equivalent of 45,000 passenger cars per year. We also close the significant order with Canadian National for 10 new Tier 4 locomotives, which will begin delivery in 2023 and 50 modernizations. The MODs will be equipped with our DLA advantage technology, which will deliver the best-in-class fuel and emissions reductions. This wins build on several recent announcements we have shared with Canadian National, including their purchase of the flex drive battery electric freight locomotives, and additional order for our precision dispatch system, which will help accelerate network optimization for CN and the entire rail industry. Finally, in Transit, we won a significant order for heating, ventilation and air conditioning units across Atlanta's metro system. This order marks the latest win in our long standing relationship with Stadler and marks the first subway order with the car builder in the U.S. Turning to Slide 7. I wanted to briefly touch on Wabtec's operating system, which drives many aspects of our culture and our performance. Starting with our people and teams, addressing our customer's most critical business needs and developing operating plants, systems and processes to deliver best-in-class performance. We use this operating model to guide what we do to measure how well we execute and to tackle where we need to improve. One of the critical elements of our operating system is our annual strategic planning process. And we are in the midst of this process right now. The goal is to look at opportunities across our markets and our company and identify those areas where we can further leverage our leadership and technology position, build on our expensive install base, capitalize on trends, such as electrification, digitalization, automation, and sustainable transportation, which will all create positive outcomes for our customers. We also look to accelerate investments across the company through our integration 2.0 efforts as well as driving lean operations, continuous improvement and best-in-class productivity, all of which delivers long-term shareholder value. It's also a critical process in aligning our talents, our products, service and software investments to drive long-term profitable growth. We are confident that we're well-positioned for the future and we expect to continue to deliver profitable growth ahead. Since 2019, this process and the Wabtec operating system have been the foundation for driving rigor, strategic alignment and efficiency, especially while navigating profound volatility. As a result, we have been able to bring the full power of Wabtec to our customers, while balancing the need for agility with a clear focus on strategy and execution to own the opportunities before us. With that, I'll turn the call over to, John, to reveal the quarter segment results and our overall financial performance. John? Good morning, Justin. Yes. So number one, yes, it is included in the backlog. And with that, just one thing to also keep in mind is if you think just about the backlog from a quarter-over-quarter impact from FX alone, it's been over $400 million, year-over-year, it's closer to $600 million. So I think it's important to highlight that, otherwise, you might have expected a larger increase, but it is reflected. Second piece is, as you described, I think we have strong momentum. And it's not just internationally as we have largely described before. But as we've been saying for the past 12 months, I think we have a strong pipeline of opportunities that cuts across both internationally and in North America. We continue to have, I would say, opportunities to grow double digits in terms of the modernization demand and of course, we are coming from trough levels in terms of demand for renewable commodities. So it's good to see the momentum. I think the pipeline of opportunities that we see it on today is stronger than the one we described 3 months ago, or six months ago. So continued opportunity here to further expand our backlog. Exactly. And I think just to add to that, I think one of the important things about this -- this is less about just '23. It's really, I'd say very much aligned on how we described our 5-year plan. Thank you. Good morning. Well, if you take about the quarter per se, it's certainly lab, not just by equipment. You see it on the services side as well. If you think about components, we do expect to continue to gain momentum there as you're coming from the trough, and we do expect that the number of freight cars shipped will be about 40,000. So that's a positive too. I think the other elements, which is on Digital Electronics, we expect strong second half in terms of sales. And certainly when you look at backlog dynamics, it's certainly reflected in both in terms of the Digital Electronics business and the Component business both with book-to-bill above 1. Thank you. So let me start with the second half of your question, I'll go down into the FLXdrive question. I think on the pipeline of deals, we really have relevant opportunities across key geographies at this point. I think volume dynamics continue to be a positive in Kazakhstan. We have a number of projects under discussion in Asia and Australia. We continue to follow up specific projects in Africa that are tied to commodity exports. In Brazil, I think despite of the drop in carloads year-to-date, there's significant opportunities tied to renew concessions, and mining is also a positive in that context. I think in North America, despite of carloads being down for the first half, we continue to see growing demand for modernization and new locomotives. And that's, again, driving efficiency and reliability, with a direct impact to the operating ratio of our customers and bringing certainly enormous impact to their ESG targets as well. So when we look at the cadence moving forward, I think we certainly feel we're very well-positioned to deliver 5-year guidance that we provided at our Investor Day. We certainly feel stronger about it now than we did 3 months ago and then we did 6 months ago. And that's very much aligned to, I think, the pipeline of opportunities we've started to describe over a year ago. On the FLXdrive comment there is we continue to see interests from customers out there. We are continuing discussions, and you're going to see that moving through other geographies. And I think that's very much aligned how we see the evolution here and, you're going to see also permutations of that product going to not just full battery electric, but also hybrid as we've also described on previous calls. Yes, it is. We are certainly paying a lot of attention and working very closely not just with our customers, but also with suppliers in that context and making sure that we continue to progress with all the elements of that and special with regards to the battery. And as you know, we have a partnership here established with GM, and we're working very closely with them in order to make sure we continue to progress in that direction. I think that can certainly be an element of, I'm just going to call, the cycle moving forward. We are working very closely with customers and with Komatsu  in that regard. We see solid opportunities ahead, and we will continue to make sure we are balancing that with auto  in the business. I think there's a lot of positive news here in terms of what we could be seeing in terms of opportunities for the rail side. So solid. No concerns for the year. We will continue to work closely here with customers to understand demand into '23 and beyond. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you. Good morning, Rob. I will just close saying that, I mean, we are committed to grow margins forward. We could and will have significant variation sometimes quarter-to-quarter. I think this is especially given the mix with much higher growth in equipment. There's also the elements of what John spoke about in terms of inflation. With specific for the second half of the year, I just want to emphasize here how big the mix impact is. And specific in the third quarter, if you think about it, we are -- we have over a third of our shipments of new locomotives happening in the third quarter. So I couldn't highlight enough some of the elements of mix and variation that we can see from that on quarter-over-quarter. Thanks. I will just reemphasize that for the year, we expect results very much aligned to the guidance we provided in February this year and how we described on previous earnings calls. So it's all about higher margins in the first half of the year, higher volume in the second half, with a significant element of mix coming in. We have not provided any specific guidance with regards to a total number of MODs. So we certainly see opportunity to continue to expand on that. And I think we've been clear about that on previous calls. So the opportunity is there. It's certainly reflected in the pipeline, and you are seeing that being realized as backlog continues to grow. Good morning. Okay. Just in terms of the second quarter, I think John said it, it was about 5% in the third quarter. 5% Transit, in specific. We would expect that to be less in the third quarter. We don't expect impact for the year, and that's part of why we've reaffirmed guidance at this point. Just a couple of comments on the Digital. I mean, orders grew double digits last year. Book-to-bill for this year is very positive. It's the highest between our businesses year-to-date. So a number of multiyear agreement. We expect the second half strong sales second half of the year. And with that, as John mentioned, chip shortages have had an impact for the business. Thank you. Good morning, Jerry. Yes. Jerry, first, in terms of the manufacturing footprint to deliver on these orders and more, we certainly feel strong about having that capacity. And we certainly have the manufacturing capacity to do that, but it's about more than that. It's making sure that we're continuing to work very closely with our customers, suppliers in that process, so we can ultimately anticipate demand. Certainly, lead times, when you look at a couple of years ago, have extended. And I think a big piece has been really making sure that we were close to customers so we could anticipate demand. And you see, to some extent, some of that certainly has impacted our inventory numbers as part of that, but that's a piece of it. When it comes to MODs, I think that continues to be a very positive story, and it's really part of a dialogue that varies customer by customer in terms of the solutions. I think we see some significant opportunities for customers to actually be working on being more productive. And in some cases, means reducing the number of locomotives that pull a certain number of cars, and that has translated into also applying some of the fuel solutions that we've described. And we see opportunity to continue to expand on that. I think what's important here is we see that part of really a growing multiyear backlog. This is I think less about what '23 is going to be. It's back to the comment I made, which is really tied to the 5-year plan that we described. And we feel like we are very well-positioned to deliver on that 5-year guidance that we provided at our Investor Day last March despite of all the macroeconomic uncertainties out there. Certainly, Freight, probably the combination of equipment and services. That's where we really saw the bulk of that impact. But for the year, as we've described, I mean, it's 5%. We can have variation again quarter-to-quarter, but that's about the magnitude of what we expected for the year. Good morning. I think the element of parking is not just going to be a function of service improvement, but also what carloads do in that period. So I think that's something that we will continue to watch and work very closely as part of that. And I think what's a positive, I think it's a lot of the underlying investment that you see in terms of really guaranteeing fleet reliability, ultimately driving efficiency across the fleet. And I think we continue to see momentum there. So if that comes counterbalanced with any elements of potential parking, I think that's a story we still see and we will be working closely with our customers in that regard. So that's actually a positive, and it's something that we've been able to is to ultimately drive as-delivered margins better than now sold margins, something that we track very closely in the business. So there's certainly continued opportunity there. And I think the other piece is making sure that we are continuing to expand on growth on some of these markets where we've really had really, I will call the best-in-class products to work with customers, and we see some good momentum there. Thanks."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Wabtec's first quarter 2022 earnings call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, John Olin; and Senior Vice President of Finance, John Mastalerz. Today's slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures were posted on our website earlier today and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Some statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll start with an up on our business, my perspectives on the quarter and progress on our long-term value framework. John will then cover the financials. Overall, we achieved significant progress against our long-term strategies that we detailed at our Investor Day in March. We delivered a strong first quarter as shown by the 5% sales growth, adjusted operating margin expansion of 1.4 percentage points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 27%. Total cash flow from operations was $161 million. Finally, we ended the quarter with about $23 billion of multiyear backlog, which was up $1.1 billion from last year. Overall, our team overcame a volatile and disruptive environment and delivered a strong first quarter, despite challenges across the supply chain, higher costs and the impact from the conflict in Ukraine. We are monitoring the devastating situation in Ukraine. Our hearts go out to the people there, their resilience and courage are truly inspirational.  For the year, we expected Russia to account for roughly 5% of our earnings. We do not expect our business in that market to return for the remainder of the year. Given the situation, our first priority is to continue to protect the safety of our employees in the region and abide by all sanctions. On the positive side, we do believe that the rail industry and Wabtec are well poised to benefit from significantly higher energy prices and from the likelihood of shifting global commodity flows over the medium term.  Rail significant fuel advantage over truck is only widening with pricing fuel prices, improving the value proposition for rail. We are enhancing our customer\u2019s productivity, capacity utilization and safety through investments in decarbonization and digital technologies. The breadth of our portfolio, along with our unmatched technologies and deep expertise, means our order pipeline continues to strengthen, and our visibility beyond 2022 continues to increase. Our confidence in our company's future is reflected in our first quarter purchase of $296 million of Wabtec's stock and in the increase of our first quarter dividend by 25%. Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about end market conditions in more detail. As we look at key metrics across our freight businesses, we are encouraged by the underlying momentum of our industry. Many key metrics are improving with the exception of North American carloads. Despite the slow start, we expect carloads to improve as the year progresses. Locomotive parkings continue to decline despite weaker freight traffic in the quarter. We expect demand for reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency to continue to increase placing our services business and modernization portfolio in a position of strength. When it comes to the North American railcar build, demand for railcar is increasing from what we believe are trough levels. Railcars in storage are below pre-COVID levels with about 18% of the North American railcar fleet in storage. As a result, industry orders for new railcars continue to improve. The industry outlook for 2022 is for over 40,000 cars to be delivered. Internationally, freight activity continued to show growth in the first quarter across many of our major markets, and our order pipeline remains strong. We expect long-term revenue growth in the majority of our end markets. Transitioning to the transit sector, ridership trends continue to be uneven in various markets. However, infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue to be a bright spot, especially as governments globally invest in rail for clean, safe and efficient transportation. Overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transportation remained positive. Next, let's turn to Slide 6. When it comes to the long-term shareholder value, we are continuing to drive progress against our value creation framework, which is anchored around five key growth strategies. This includes accelerating, the creation of innovative and scalable technologies and using these technologies to grow and refresh our expensive global installed base. Leading the decarbonization of rail, expanding high-margin recurring revenue streams, which reduces our exposure to economic and industry cycles and most importantly, driving continuous operational improvement and we are making strong progress against this strategy.  In the first quarter, we won several strategic orders, including our largest digital order in India for online monitoring of rolling stock. This new automated system is part of Indian Railways smart yard initiative and it will improve the availability of the railway's fleet of coaches, wagons and locomotives. We also won key digital orders with Class 1s for our next generation dispatch offering, as well as a fleet-wide PTC hardware upgrade. We also secured a strategic order for 330 locomotive modernizations with Norfolk Southern, and we've introduced a new locomotive model to Brazil's freight rail market with deliveries to Romo, MRS and Suzano. Finally, we launched our integration 2.0 restructuring program which, as we outlined at our recent Investor Day, will drive continued footprint rationalization as well as manufacturing and engineering efficiencies across our operations. Through these efforts, we expect to deliver between $75 million to $90 million of additional run rate savings by 2025 and position Wabtec for continued growth.  With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter segment performance and our overall financial position. John?\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Rafael and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. I will review our first quarter results in more detail. We had another good quarter of operational and financial performance, despite challenges in the supply chain, cost increases and the impact of Russia. Sales for the first quarter were $1.93 billion, which reflects a 5.3% increase versus the prior year.  Sales were positively impacted by the continued broad recovery in our freight segment, higher pricing and the acquisition of Nordco, partially offset by lower year-over-year sales in transit, driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and supply chain disruptions.  We continue to experience adverse impacts to our sales results in both segments due to shortages across many component parts, including computer chips, which caused delays in production and customer delivery. For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $319 million, which was up 15.2% versus the prior year. We delivered strong margin expansion, up 1.4 percentage points on an adjusted basis. Margins were aided by mix favorability, increased pricing and improved productivity, driven by higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, partially offset by $45 million to $50 million of higher costs. The team achieved margin expansion even in the face of a highly disrupted supply chain and a challenging inflationary environment. In the first quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.13 and up 27% versus prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.80, which was up 35.6% versus first quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had charges of $7 million for restructuring and other onetime charges, largely related to our integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. As Rafael noted, are pleased with our Q1 results, and particularly our sales growth in the face of supply chain disruptions and unfavorable currency exchange and our margin growth in the face of continued cost increases. We remain diligent and proactive as we work to minimize these challenges.  Turning to Slide 8. Let's review our product lines in more detail. First quarter consolidated sales were up 5.3% versus last year, driven by higher sales in the Freight segment, partially offset by lower transit segment sales. First quarter sales were adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange of 2 percentage points and continued supply disruptions. Equipment sales were up 4.6% year-over-year due to continued strong mining sales. We remain encouraged by the improving trends in our component business. Component sales continued to build momentum and were up 12.8% year-over-year, driven by higher OE railcar build, lower number of railcars in storage and a strengthening recovery in industrial end markets.  In line with an improving outlook for rail, our services sales grew 18.5% versus last year. The year-over-year increase was largely driven from higher sales from modernizations, the unparking of locomotives and the acquisition of Nordco. The superior performance, reliability and availability of our fleet continues to drive customer demand, as railroads increasingly look for predictable outcomes across our fleets. Excluding Nordco, organic sales for the first quarter were up 11.5%. Digital Electronics sales declined 1.9% versus prior year, driven primarily by ongoing shortages of chips. We continue to see improved demand for onboard locomotive products, and our backlog in digital continues to increase. And even more importantly, we continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers globally focus on improved productivity, increased capacity utilization and safety. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 6.5% versus prior year to $605 million. Sales were down versus last year due to supply chain issues, lapping the exit of low-margin UK contracts and the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange. Foreign currency exchange alone adversely impacted revenues by 5.1 percentage points. We believe the medium and long-term outlook for this segment remain positive as infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue.  Moving to Slide 9. Our adjusted gross margin expanded 1.7 percentage points to 31.1%, driven by product mix, increased pricing and favorable manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Mix and pricing positively impacted our margins. Mix benefited margins as freight sales outpaced our transit sales. Additionally, higher pricing was realized from price escalations incorporated into many of our long-term contracts, along with other price actions that were implemented to recover increased costs.  Raw material costs were again up significantly, led by increased metal costs, including steel, aluminum, copper and dramatically higher fuel costs. Foreign currency exchange adversely impacted revenues by 2.0% and adversely impacted first quarter gross profits by $10 million. Finally, manufacturing costs were positively impacted by favorable absorption of fixed costs, partially offset by exponentially higher transportation and logistics costs.  Current global container costs continue to be significantly higher than last year's average. In aggregate, the continuing effects of the supply chain disruptions, higher materials, transportation and labor costs are estimated to be $45 million to $50 million higher than last year's first quarter. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures by triggering price escalation, implementing price surcharges and driving operational productivity and lean initiatives.  Turning to Slide 10. For the first quarter, adjusted operating margin expanded 1.4 percentage points versus last year. Our margins benefited from higher adjusted gross margin, but were partially offset by higher engineering expenses from increased investment in future technologies. Adjusted SG&A was $236 million, which was up $13.0 million from the prior year due to in part, the acquisition of Nordco. Engineering expense increased from last year according to plan.  We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities, but more importantly, our investing in our future as an industry leader in the decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization and safety.  Now let's take a look at segment results on Slide 11, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales improved for the quarter and segment adjusted operating income was $259 million for an adjusted margin of 19.6%, up 1.5 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefits of higher sales, improved mix and increased pricing were partially offset by significantly higher input costs. Finally, segment backlog was $19.02 billion, up $1.02 billion from the end of the first quarter last year due to the broad multiyear order momentum that Rafael discussed earlier. Turning to Slide 12. Transit segment sales were down 6.5%, driven by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange and supply chain disruptions. Adjusted segment operating income decreased by $5 million to $74 million, which resulted in adjusted operating margin of 12.3%, up 0.1 percentage points versus the prior year.  Increased pricing and lower year-over-year SG&A were largely offset by significant increases in input costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Across the segment, the team delivered a strong operational performance as we continue to focus on driving down costs, implementing lean and improving operational efficiencies despite the volatile environment. Finally, Transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.74 billion, up slightly versus a year ago. Adjusting for the negative effect of foreign currency exchange, backlog would have been up roughly 5.5%.  Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 13. During the quarter, we generated $161 million of operating cash flow resulting in a cash conversion of 59%. Our cash conversion rate in Q1 was below our full year target of being over 90%. Cash flow has historically been the lowest in Q1, this was compounded this quarter by proactively building inventories ahead of our strong growth expectations for the back half of the year and managing supply disruption of critical parts. Additionally, as expected, the payment of short-term incentives was considerably higher in Q1 of 2022 versus the COVID impacted Q1 '21 payment. Looking forward, we are confident we will generate strong cash flow for the year. Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter declined to 2.5x and the liquidity is robust at $1.50 billion. Also during the quarter, we returned more cash to our shareholders, repurchasing an additional $296 million of shares and paid dividends of $28 million which was up 25% and versus our prior year dividend rate.  As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong, and we are confident that we can continue to drive solid cash generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital toward the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, John. Let's flip to Slide 14 to discuss our 2022 financial guidance. Last quarter, we issued guidance with sales growth at the midpoint of 8% and EPS of $4.65 to $5.05 or up roughly 14% at the midpoint. Our guidance was based on improving industry momentum and strong underlying customer demand for our products. Despite headwinds from supply chain disruptions, unfavorable mix and a still challenging cost environment with higher investments in technology, we are continuing to take action to drive margin expansion and grow our business overtime.  With the first quarter behind us, we feel strong about our businesses and delivered against our original planned financials, despite unplanned loss of business in Russia. I'm pleased with the strength and resilience of our business and more importantly, I'm extremely proud that our teams found the path to deliver to our plan. despite an ever-changing and challenging environment. The reality is that, our business in Russia was expected to earn about $0.25 per share in 2022, which pressures the top end of our guidance range. However, despite this pressure and recognizing the strong underlying execution, the pipeline of opportunities in the business, and the still volatile market conditions impacting 2022 and beyond, we are not changing our original guidance.  Now let's turn to the next slide. Our team delivered a very strong start to the year despite a challenging and rapidly evolving environment. I'm proud of their efforts to deliver for our customers, drive strong financial results and further strengthen our financial position. As we look forward, the rail sector and Wabtec are well positioned to increase share and solve the critical issues facing the world's freight and logistics, et cetera.  We will continue to lean in the strong fundamentals of the industry and our company to drive long-term profitable growth. Our long-term strategy continues to be built on our deep industry expertise, grounded in innovation, breakthrough initiatives and scalable technologies that drive value for our customers. These efforts will continue to be accelerated by our lean, continuous improvement culture and disciplined capital allocation. As we've said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose to move and improve the world. I am confident that this company will continue to deliver and lead the transition to a more sustainable future.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine?\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions.  Operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator:  Our first question will come from Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead. \nJustin Long: So maybe to start on the guidance, Rafael, you mentioned that Russia was $0.25 of the original guidance for the full year. Just to be clear on that, are you now assuming that number is 0? And if so, with the guidance range unchanged, can you talk about what the positive offsets are to that headwind in Russia?\nRafael Santana: Yes. So that's right. We are considering it's 0 for the year at this point. I think the offsets Justin, I'll start with the first quarter. We're really tied to -- well, first, I think the business is operating well. Our teams have done strong execution. We've also seen positive coming from the unparking of locomotives with demand on the services business. We also have seen a stronger mining business that now we have anticipated.  So, if you think about the year, I think it's continuing to work to find offsets, not just tied to the loss of the business in Russia, but headwinds of inflation and supply chain, transportation costs as well. I think with the first quarter behind us, I think the team continues to work on those offsets. The other thing that I would add is, uncertainly have certainly increased since we last talked in February. But we have probably a stronger pipeline of opportunities in the business. And I think despite of the volatile market conditions, we felt really strong about maintaining guidance at this point.\nJustin Long: Okay. Great. And maybe following up on the pipeline, specifically on international locomotives, do you already have enough in the backlog at this point to say your deliveries will not only be up in 2022, but also in 2023, just from an international locomotive perspective? And are there any data points you can share on new contract wins that are in the market today that you're bidding on?\nRafael Santana: Yes, Justin. Number one, we have fundamentally backlog again for what we need as far as new locomotives being delivered this year. And it's actually started that gains momentum through the year. If you look at the second half of the year, we're going to actually be delivering more than 50% more locomotives than we did on the year before in the second half. So, I think that's one data point.  I think what was more exciting about the quarter was really the backlog. It was a positive again in the quarter. I think we see momentum in the order intake and growing backlog, the pipeline of deals has strengthened again. And this is probably the strongest pipeline of deals we've had over the last five years. And our commercial team here continues to be focused on converting this pipeline. I think you saw some of that progress with the things we announced here in the first quarter.  The strength is also reflected on the 12-month backlog. This is certainly the highest we've had since the merger. And that's for both freight and transit. So, I think there's good momentum there and I think some of the things I described to you certainly helped, I think, '23, '24 and beyond. So multiyear orders that really help us to continue to build momentum. So that is something very positive we signed in the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nJerry Revich: Rafael, interesting developments that we've seen in your business over the years has been just the growth in mods and your strong mods market share. Can you just update us on what mod deliveries look like year-over-year in the first quarter? And what's the cadence look like over the balance of the year in light of the recent order strength you've had for Mod specifically? Thanks.\nRafael Santana: So Jerry, double-digit growth this year versus last year into the Mods business. When you look at across the year, I think there is a relative consistency we could have variation just in terms of time of shipment, but double-digit growth. But I think what's more exciting is I think I had mentioned that before on auto costs. I think what we thought would have been a cap in terms of that volume in North America, we see the opportunity here to further expand that business. And internationally, I think some of the momentum continues. And so we see that business with a strong opportunity here to continue to grow moving forward.\nJerry Revich: And then can you talk about the earnings cadence over the course of the year? When do you expect the revenue burn to accelerate given the moving pieces that you spoke about earlier?\nJohn Olin: Hi Jerry, this is John. With regards to the earnings cadence, we came out last quarter and talked about, we expected the first half to be a little bit lighter in terms of revenue growth. And - but heavier in terms of earnings growth, and that would reverse in the back half. And the big difference between the two is what Rafael just talked about, as our equipment grows and it's going to gain momentum through the back half.  I think what we're seeing in the first quarter is very much in line with that overall sequence. And we had a revenue growth of 5.5% and margin growth of 1.4 percentage points. As we look to the back half, we would expect to see a significant revenue growth. However, our overall margin growth is going to be lower on a year-over-year basis than it is in the first half -- I'm sorry, on a year-over-year basis. That's driven, Jerry, by three things: one is the mix shift because of shipping in a much higher percentage of equipment sales; the second is, easier comps were tougher comps in the back half by about 1.5 percentage points; and the other is what Rafael mentioned as well, we'd expect more cost pressure in the back half because of the most recent cost surge that happened in Q1 with the invasion of Ukraine.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nIvan Yi: Yes, good morning. This is Ivan Yi on for Scott Group. First on Russia, I understand you're expecting 0 for Russia this year, but how are you treating this exposure in your multiyear backlog? Thanks.\nRafael Santana: So, with regards to, number one, the business in Russia, we are complying with all sanctions and legal requirements. We are committed, again, to the safe operations of equipment in the region. And we have say to some extent, providing nominal support for this purpose. Given the uncertainty, given the conflict we have removed Russia from our backlog.\nIvan Yi: Thank you. And my follow-up, can you quantify the number or percentage of locomotive on parkings in 1Q? And what are your expectations for second quarter? Thank you. \nRafael Santana: What I'll tell you there is we continue to see on parking. We're back to numbers that are comparable to the third quarter of 2019. So that's, I think, a good - a positive for the business. Some of those fleets are on part, they've been parked for quite a bit of time, and they demand some level of investments. But I think most importantly, when you look at the fluidity, the velocity and the network, I think the demands for really reliable power and continued investment for our customers in order to continue to improve those metrics. I think that's something that we certainly have, I think, a lot of the solutions for it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nCourtney Yakavonis: I hate to belabor Russia, but just a couple of quick follow-ups. I think you had mentioned at the Analyst Day that the majority of the impact was supposed to hit 1Q from Russia. So I just wanted to confirm that, that and so the majority or the rest of the year will be less impacted from that headwind? And then secondly, if you could just comment at all on freight versus transit exposure. And I think you also mentioned that you had removed Russia from the backlog. So just any impact to those - to the segment level backlogs?\nJohn Olin: Hi Courtney, this is John. Courtney, what we had talked about in Investor Day is that, we would be a little bit older shared in the first quarter in terms of earnings expectations. We did not say the majority of our earnings would be in the first quarter. On a full year basis, we had planned for $0.25. In the first quarter, we probably, $0.03 or $0.04 we shipped before the conflict began, but it was just a little bit overweighted versus an even split across all quarters. And the other piece is, yes, Russia is out of the backlog and we took that out during the quarter - this quarter.\nCourtney Yakavonis: And then just on share repurchases, I think that was a little bit higher than we were expecting. I think you had a $750 million reauthorization that you had announced and now it's close to halfway done. So just as we think about the pace for the rest of the year any guidance you can give to that? And if that was a key offset as well in maintaining the guidance?\nRafael Santana: That was not a key offset to maintaining the guidance, but we're very pleased to have purchased $300 million. And largely Courtney, it's going back. We came out of what we believe is the trough in 2021. And we feel confident in the future. We want to get off to a good start to the year, and we're able to repurchase 300 million shares.  As we look forward, I think I would go back to what we had said at Investor Day with regards to capital allocation. that we are going to focus on making sure that we have a strong balance sheet. We invest in the business in terms of capital and technology spend, which you saw in the first quarter and the dividend and protecting the dividend. Then from there, we would prioritize and continue to prioritize acquisitions as long as they are strategic and accretive over share repurchases. And finally, barring that any excess cash, I'll come back to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please go ahead. \nEli Winski: This is Eli Winski on for Chris. Maybe we can start with the OEM side. We saw that revenues were higher in this quarter than the prior quarters in 2021 and 2020. Could you talk about what the cadence of the growth in that segment might look like given some of the congestion and some of the supply chain issues there.\nRafael Santana: Are you referring to the transit segment?\nEli Winski: I am.\nRafael Santana: Right. What we're seeing as far as transit is overall revenues were down 6.5% and - as we had mentioned, 5.1 percentage points of that is due to currency. The other drag that we had with regards to revenue is about - well, not about a year ago, first quarter, we exited a lot of our UK operations on the service side, so an aftermarket, that was basically our brush product line.  By the time we exited that business, it was the end of the third quarter. And right now, we're lapping those higher revenues from a year ago as we exit that business and that's roughly about the same impact that currency had on our transit business. The third element, obviously is the supply disruptions continue to hit that business a little bit more than others. But excluding those, we would have seen good underlying growth in the transit business.\nEli Winski: And then maybe jumping up to services and the acquisition of Nordco. How is the - how are the expenses coming out of that business now with some of the synergies from that acquisition? It's probably likely that you should be seeing that start to fade off here more now and some of the first quarter, correct?\nRafael Santana: Right. During the acquisition, we had looked to take $10 million of cost out of that business over the next couple of years, and we are tracking with that. I mean that's coming out certainly in operational efficiencies that would hit gross margin as well as a lot of duplicate SG&A expenses are coming out as well. This will be the last quarter that we're lapping that acquisition. And with that, we did see higher SG&A in the quarter, as you'd expect.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please go ahead. \nRob Wertheimer: So I had, I guess, two on transit, one short and one long term. Just short term, just any comments on -- it seems like backlog is progressing pretty well. But on transit customer sentiment on uncertainty in Europe, if that affects anything, perhaps stuff has been delayed and it's pent up. But just any comments on that short-term demand picture around the backlog? And then second, just a more structural question just as you've narrowed focus over the years on transit, what is the feeling on wins, on market share on just how the competitive balance is playing out? And I will stop. Thanks.\nRafael Santana: Yes. I'd say, ridership trends to continue to be uneven across various markets there. We're not seeing any signs of slowdown of the market. And I think to some extent, the current crisis favors rail the energy intensity of rail is a fraction of -- if you were to compare to either passenger cars or well, even trucking into the freight segment. I think the other element I'd mention is certainly Europe, but other parts of the world, the hybrid work model may also increase demand for intercity trains.  So on one side, infrastructure spending continues to be a positive with governments investing in rail. So, you'll see that in the short term. We could continue to see some delay in project execution due to supply chain disruptions. But largely, the fundamentals of the business remain the same, remain strong, consistent of what you might have heard from auto customers and OEMs in that sector.\nRob Wertheimer: And then just any comments on competitive balance if your backlog is growing in line, market shares holding, growing, contracting?\nRafael Santana: I think we have largely been holding market share positions. It, of course, varies product line by product line. I think 1 of the things we made a clear upfront was really working towards the quality of the backlog, which has improved over the last couple of years. And that comes down to also making some of those choices and working in that direction. So, we're continuing to improve those numbers.\nOperator:  Our next question will come from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Just want to go to digital electronics. Obviously, the shortage is certainly impacting your growth there. Is there any way to quantify what that headwind to growth has been for digital electronics? And then as you look through, obviously, a volatile supply chain environment still. But do we expect those chip shortage start to ease, are you building inventory there? Just any color that can help?\nRafael Santana: Yes. So Allison, two things. I think we've made some decisions last year in terms of while trying anticipate some of this, but the lack of computer chips have had a significant impact for the business in the year. We still expect that business to grow. I think some of the good signs are tied to the double-digit order growth you saw last year.  Some were really multiyear agreements we saw again a strong book-to-bill in the first quarter, which was above two for the business. I think, again, a focus area for our teams to make sure that we continue to drive convertibility into 2022 with additional orders. And I think the other comment, I would make is North America continues to be slow, despite of some of the announcements here with May. But we're continuing to gain momentum internationally. I think there's some significant opportunities tied to PTC adoption internationally and some of the other technologies that we have.\nAllison Poliniak: And then just a high-level question. One of the pushbacks we often get with this local in parking and the storage number for the railcars coming in is that it's just being mass or any improvements being masked by the rail service challenges, like that's why we're seeing those numbers. just any high-level color from your perspective, what you're seeing? Is there a real demand behind what's going on? Or does this feel like a temporary surge at this point? Just any thoughts there.\nRafael Santana: Yes. Let me start with what we're saying, and this is broad, and it's more than the North American market. If you think about freight internationally, I think across our key geographies, we see demand are really tied to commodities flow. So think about volume dynamics are positive. If you look at some of the data that we shared in both Kazakhstan and India. I think we have inquiries for new equipment to be delivered in Africa. We have a number of projects under discussion in Australia, in Asia as well as a function of that. Even despite of the volume drop you saw in Brazil, I'd say trends are positive tied to the mid, long term and new concessions.  You mentioned North America. I think we see sequential improvement of unparking of both freight cars and locomotives I think the expectation there is that the investment will continue in terms of customers needing reliable and efficient power to solve through some of the things that we described. And we certainly expect Carlyle to continue to improve throughout the year. So that's maybe just with regards to that part. I think I've made some of the comments on transit. But this is broader than I think North America and I think that goes into some of the comments I made around really the momentum that we saw in the quarter, again, with regards to the growing backlog.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Elkott with Cowen. Please go ahead. \nMatt Elkott: Good morning. Thank you. Rafael, I think the average content in locomotives, freight locomotives in North America prior to GE might have been around $100,000 range. Can you give us an update on where you see the content opportunity going once there are orders in North America, again, as it relates to diesel locomotives? And then also on the FLXdrive, can you remind us how much of the component content on the FLXdrive is actually from Wabtec legacy versus outside suppliers?\nRafael Santana: Yes. So I'll start with the FLXdrive, which I think as being a new product really provides data opportunities for us to bring the full integration of the suite of products we have and translate that to ultimately value for the customer. So, we have a very significant opportunity of expanding that number there. When you think about, I'll call our -- I'm going to use the word legacy products. We have the opportunity to grow that as well. We've been doing that in the international markets.  Some of that is going to be dependent on sizes of fleets customers are looking at and really making sure that as you introduce some of these components, it comes with scale, it comes with, I'll call the right support from a service capability behind it. And - but you'll see that ultimately reflected on digital opportunities, which will continue to grow here, and you've seen some of the numbers we've highlighted in terms of the momentum in orders for that business?\nMatt Elkott: And then one other question on the consolidation front. I think before GE, the rate was two or one to three bolt-on acquisitions per year. Should we expect you guys to ease yourself back into that kind of pace eventually? And can you give us an update on any potential opportunities you're eyeing right now? Is there a pool of potential targets that you're examining? Just anything on the M&A front or the consolidation front would be helpful?\nRafael Santana: I'd say we're continuing to explore acquisitions. We're going to be opportunistic here. It's got to come with the right returns on investments. So. this is not about the number of acquisitions that we do. This is about really value creation and really very consistent with the capital allocation framework that we shared with you guys during Investor Day.\nJohn Olin: Right. Matt, I think we've got a very robust process looking at the opportunities. And again, it's not one to three or how many, it's the quality, how accretive they are and how on strategy they are? I think Nordco, which we did about a year ago at this time is a great example of the value that we can drive through our M&A activity. And more recently, we just had one with Beena Vision and certainly MASU at the end of the year. So, we feel very good about where we're at, as well as our pipeline as we look forward. And it certainly is a priority for the company to continue to do accretive M&A transactions.\nMatt Elkott: Is it safe to assume that freight is the priority when it comes to evaluating M&A?\nRafael Santana: I think the priority is to find good quality, accretive deals that we can grow beyond what the previous owner was able to do to drive overall value for the company.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kristine Kubacki for any closing remarks.\nKristine Kubacki: I'd like to thank everybody for your participation today and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you. Goodbye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Olin",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. I will review our first quarter results in more detail. We had another good quarter of operational and financial performance, despite challenges in the supply chain, cost increases and the impact of Russia. Sales for the first quarter were $1.93 billion, which reflects a 5.3% increase versus the prior year.  Sales were positively impacted by the continued broad recovery in our freight segment, higher pricing and the acquisition of Nordco, partially offset by lower year-over-year sales in transit, driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and supply chain disruptions.  We continue to experience adverse impacts to our sales results in both segments due to shortages across many component parts, including computer chips, which caused delays in production and customer delivery. For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $319 million, which was up 15.2% versus the prior year. We delivered strong margin expansion, up 1.4 percentage points on an adjusted basis. Margins were aided by mix favorability, increased pricing and improved productivity, driven by higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, partially offset by $45 million to $50 million of higher costs. The team achieved margin expansion even in the face of a highly disrupted supply chain and a challenging inflationary environment. In the first quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.13 and up 27% versus prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.80, which was up 35.6% versus first quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had charges of $7 million for restructuring and other onetime charges, largely related to our integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. As Rafael noted, are pleased with our Q1 results, and particularly our sales growth in the face of supply chain disruptions and unfavorable currency exchange and our margin growth in the face of continued cost increases. We remain diligent and proactive as we work to minimize these challenges.  Turning to Slide 8. Let's review our product lines in more detail. First quarter consolidated sales were up 5.3% versus last year, driven by higher sales in the Freight segment, partially offset by lower transit segment sales. First quarter sales were adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange of 2 percentage points and continued supply disruptions. Equipment sales were up 4.6% year-over-year due to continued strong mining sales. We remain encouraged by the improving trends in our component business. Component sales continued to build momentum and were up 12.8% year-over-year, driven by higher OE railcar build, lower number of railcars in storage and a strengthening recovery in industrial end markets.  In line with an improving outlook for rail, our services sales grew 18.5% versus last year. The year-over-year increase was largely driven from higher sales from modernizations, the unparking of locomotives and the acquisition of Nordco. The superior performance, reliability and availability of our fleet continues to drive customer demand, as railroads increasingly look for predictable outcomes across our fleets. Excluding Nordco, organic sales for the first quarter were up 11.5%. Digital Electronics sales declined 1.9% versus prior year, driven primarily by ongoing shortages of chips. We continue to see improved demand for onboard locomotive products, and our backlog in digital continues to increase. And even more importantly, we continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers globally focus on improved productivity, increased capacity utilization and safety. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 6.5% versus prior year to $605 million. Sales were down versus last year due to supply chain issues, lapping the exit of low-margin UK contracts and the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange. Foreign currency exchange alone adversely impacted revenues by 5.1 percentage points. We believe the medium and long-term outlook for this segment remain positive as infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue.  Moving to Slide 9. Our adjusted gross margin expanded 1.7 percentage points to 31.1%, driven by product mix, increased pricing and favorable manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Mix and pricing positively impacted our margins. Mix benefited margins as freight sales outpaced our transit sales. Additionally, higher pricing was realized from price escalations incorporated into many of our long-term contracts, along with other price actions that were implemented to recover increased costs.  Raw material costs were again up significantly, led by increased metal costs, including steel, aluminum, copper and dramatically higher fuel costs. Foreign currency exchange adversely impacted revenues by 2.0% and adversely impacted first quarter gross profits by $10 million. Finally, manufacturing costs were positively impacted by favorable absorption of fixed costs, partially offset by exponentially higher transportation and logistics costs.  Current global container costs continue to be significantly higher than last year's average. In aggregate, the continuing effects of the supply chain disruptions, higher materials, transportation and labor costs are estimated to be $45 million to $50 million higher than last year's first quarter. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures by triggering price escalation, implementing price surcharges and driving operational productivity and lean initiatives.  Turning to Slide 10. For the first quarter, adjusted operating margin expanded 1.4 percentage points versus last year. Our margins benefited from higher adjusted gross margin, but were partially offset by higher engineering expenses from increased investment in future technologies. Adjusted SG&A was $236 million, which was up $13.0 million from the prior year due to in part, the acquisition of Nordco. Engineering expense increased from last year according to plan.  We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities, but more importantly, our investing in our future as an industry leader in the decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization and safety.  Now let's take a look at segment results on Slide 11, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales improved for the quarter and segment adjusted operating income was $259 million for an adjusted margin of 19.6%, up 1.5 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefits of higher sales, improved mix and increased pricing were partially offset by significantly higher input costs. Finally, segment backlog was $19.02 billion, up $1.02 billion from the end of the first quarter last year due to the broad multiyear order momentum that Rafael discussed earlier. Turning to Slide 12. Transit segment sales were down 6.5%, driven by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange and supply chain disruptions. Adjusted segment operating income decreased by $5 million to $74 million, which resulted in adjusted operating margin of 12.3%, up 0.1 percentage points versus the prior year.  Increased pricing and lower year-over-year SG&A were largely offset by significant increases in input costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Across the segment, the team delivered a strong operational performance as we continue to focus on driving down costs, implementing lean and improving operational efficiencies despite the volatile environment. Finally, Transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.74 billion, up slightly versus a year ago. Adjusting for the negative effect of foreign currency exchange, backlog would have been up roughly 5.5%.  Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 13. During the quarter, we generated $161 million of operating cash flow resulting in a cash conversion of 59%. Our cash conversion rate in Q1 was below our full year target of being over 90%. Cash flow has historically been the lowest in Q1, this was compounded this quarter by proactively building inventories ahead of our strong growth expectations for the back half of the year and managing supply disruption of critical parts. Additionally, as expected, the payment of short-term incentives was considerably higher in Q1 of 2022 versus the COVID impacted Q1 '21 payment. Looking forward, we are confident we will generate strong cash flow for the year. Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter declined to 2.5x and the liquidity is robust at $1.50 billion. Also during the quarter, we returned more cash to our shareholders, repurchasing an additional $296 million of shares and paid dividends of $28 million which was up 25% and versus our prior year dividend rate.  As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong, and we are confident that we can continue to drive solid cash generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital toward the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Rafael. Hi Jerry, this is John. With regards to the earnings cadence, we came out last quarter and talked about, we expected the first half to be a little bit lighter in terms of revenue growth. And - but heavier in terms of earnings growth, and that would reverse in the back half. And the big difference between the two is what Rafael just talked about, as our equipment grows and it's going to gain momentum through the back half.  I think what we're seeing in the first quarter is very much in line with that overall sequence. And we had a revenue growth of 5.5% and margin growth of 1.4 percentage points. As we look to the back half, we would expect to see a significant revenue growth. However, our overall margin growth is going to be lower on a year-over-year basis than it is in the first half -- I'm sorry, on a year-over-year basis. That's driven, Jerry, by three things: one is the mix shift because of shipping in a much higher percentage of equipment sales; the second is, easier comps were tougher comps in the back half by about 1.5 percentage points; and the other is what Rafael mentioned as well, we'd expect more cost pressure in the back half because of the most recent cost surge that happened in Q1 with the invasion of Ukraine. Hi Courtney, this is John. Courtney, what we had talked about in Investor Day is that, we would be a little bit older shared in the first quarter in terms of earnings expectations. We did not say the majority of our earnings would be in the first quarter. On a full year basis, we had planned for $0.25. In the first quarter, we probably, $0.03 or $0.04 we shipped before the conflict began, but it was just a little bit overweighted versus an even split across all quarters. And the other piece is, yes, Russia is out of the backlog and we took that out during the quarter - this quarter. Right. Matt, I think we've got a very robust process looking at the opportunities. And again, it's not one to three or how many, it's the quality, how accretive they are and how on strategy they are? I think Nordco, which we did about a year ago at this time is a great example of the value that we can drive through our M&A activity. And more recently, we just had one with Beena Vision and certainly MASU at the end of the year. So, we feel very good about where we're at, as well as our pipeline as we look forward. And it certainly is a priority for the company to continue to do accretive M&A transactions."

            "content": "Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4, and I'll start with an up on our business, my perspectives on the quarter and progress on our long-term value framework. John will then cover the financials. Overall, we achieved significant progress against our long-term strategies that we detailed at our Investor Day in March. We delivered a strong first quarter as shown by the 5% sales growth, adjusted operating margin expansion of 1.4 percentage points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 27%. Total cash flow from operations was $161 million. Finally, we ended the quarter with about $23 billion of multiyear backlog, which was up $1.1 billion from last year. Overall, our team overcame a volatile and disruptive environment and delivered a strong first quarter, despite challenges across the supply chain, higher costs and the impact from the conflict in Ukraine. We are monitoring the devastating situation in Ukraine. Our hearts go out to the people there, their resilience and courage are truly inspirational.  For the year, we expected Russia to account for roughly 5% of our earnings. We do not expect our business in that market to return for the remainder of the year. Given the situation, our first priority is to continue to protect the safety of our employees in the region and abide by all sanctions. On the positive side, we do believe that the rail industry and Wabtec are well poised to benefit from significantly higher energy prices and from the likelihood of shifting global commodity flows over the medium term.  Rail significant fuel advantage over truck is only widening with pricing fuel prices, improving the value proposition for rail. We are enhancing our customer's productivity, capacity utilization and safety through investments in decarbonization and digital technologies. The breadth of our portfolio, along with our unmatched technologies and deep expertise, means our order pipeline continues to strengthen, and our visibility beyond 2022 continues to increase. Our confidence in our company's future is reflected in our first quarter purchase of $296 million of Wabtec's stock and in the increase of our first quarter dividend by 25%. Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about end market conditions in more detail. As we look at key metrics across our freight businesses, we are encouraged by the underlying momentum of our industry. Many key metrics are improving with the exception of North American carloads. Despite the slow start, we expect carloads to improve as the year progresses. Locomotive parkings continue to decline despite weaker freight traffic in the quarter. We expect demand for reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency to continue to increase placing our services business and modernization portfolio in a position of strength. When it comes to the North American railcar build, demand for railcar is increasing from what we believe are trough levels. Railcars in storage are below pre-COVID levels with about 18% of the North American railcar fleet in storage. As a result, industry orders for new railcars continue to improve. The industry outlook for 2022 is for over 40,000 cars to be delivered. Internationally, freight activity continued to show growth in the first quarter across many of our major markets, and our order pipeline remains strong. We expect long-term revenue growth in the majority of our end markets. Transitioning to the transit sector, ridership trends continue to be uneven in various markets. However, infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue to be a bright spot, especially as governments globally invest in rail for clean, safe and efficient transportation. Overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transportation remained positive. Next, let's turn to Slide 6. When it comes to the long-term shareholder value, we are continuing to drive progress against our value creation framework, which is anchored around five key growth strategies. This includes accelerating, the creation of innovative and scalable technologies and using these technologies to grow and refresh our expensive global installed base. Leading the decarbonization of rail, expanding high-margin recurring revenue streams, which reduces our exposure to economic and industry cycles and most importantly, driving continuous operational improvement and we are making strong progress against this strategy.  In the first quarter, we won several strategic orders, including our largest digital order in India for online monitoring of rolling stock. This new automated system is part of Indian Railways smart yard initiative and it will improve the availability of the railway's fleet of coaches, wagons and locomotives. We also won key digital orders with Class 1s for our next generation dispatch offering, as well as a fleet-wide PTC hardware upgrade. We also secured a strategic order for 330 locomotive modernizations with Norfolk Southern, and we've introduced a new locomotive model to Brazil's freight rail market with deliveries to Romo, MRS and Suzano. Finally, we launched our integration 2.0 restructuring program which, as we outlined at our recent Investor Day, will drive continued footprint rationalization as well as manufacturing and engineering efficiencies across our operations. Through these efforts, we expect to deliver between $75 million to $90 million of additional run rate savings by 2025 and position Wabtec for continued growth.  With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter segment performance and our overall financial position. John? Thanks, John. Let's flip to Slide 14 to discuss our 2022 financial guidance. Last quarter, we issued guidance with sales growth at the midpoint of 8% and EPS of $4.65 to $5.05 or up roughly 14% at the midpoint. Our guidance was based on improving industry momentum and strong underlying customer demand for our products. Despite headwinds from supply chain disruptions, unfavorable mix and a still challenging cost environment with higher investments in technology, we are continuing to take action to drive margin expansion and grow our business overtime.  With the first quarter behind us, we feel strong about our businesses and delivered against our original planned financials, despite unplanned loss of business in Russia. I'm pleased with the strength and resilience of our business and more importantly, I'm extremely proud that our teams found the path to deliver to our plan. despite an ever-changing and challenging environment. The reality is that, our business in Russia was expected to earn about $0.25 per share in 2022, which pressures the top end of our guidance range. However, despite this pressure and recognizing the strong underlying execution, the pipeline of opportunities in the business, and the still volatile market conditions impacting 2022 and beyond, we are not changing our original guidance.  Now let's turn to the next slide. Our team delivered a very strong start to the year despite a challenging and rapidly evolving environment. I'm proud of their efforts to deliver for our customers, drive strong financial results and further strengthen our financial position. As we look forward, the rail sector and Wabtec are well positioned to increase share and solve the critical issues facing the world's freight and logistics, et cetera.  We will continue to lean in the strong fundamentals of the industry and our company to drive long-term profitable growth. Our long-term strategy continues to be built on our deep industry expertise, grounded in innovation, breakthrough initiatives and scalable technologies that drive value for our customers. These efforts will continue to be accelerated by our lean, continuous improvement culture and disciplined capital allocation. As we've said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose to move and improve the world. I am confident that this company will continue to deliver and lead the transition to a more sustainable future.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine? Yes. So that's right. We are considering it's 0 for the year at this point. I think the offsets Justin, I'll start with the first quarter. We're really tied to -- well, first, I think the business is operating well. Our teams have done strong execution. We've also seen positive coming from the unparking of locomotives with demand on the services business. We also have seen a stronger mining business that now we have anticipated.  So, if you think about the year, I think it's continuing to work to find offsets, not just tied to the loss of the business in Russia, but headwinds of inflation and supply chain, transportation costs as well. I think with the first quarter behind us, I think the team continues to work on those offsets. The other thing that I would add is, uncertainly have certainly increased since we last talked in February. But we have probably a stronger pipeline of opportunities in the business. And I think despite of the volatile market conditions, we felt really strong about maintaining guidance at this point. Yes, Justin. Number one, we have fundamentally backlog again for what we need as far as new locomotives being delivered this year. And it's actually started that gains momentum through the year. If you look at the second half of the year, we're going to actually be delivering more than 50% more locomotives than we did on the year before in the second half. So, I think that's one data point.  I think what was more exciting about the quarter was really the backlog. It was a positive again in the quarter. I think we see momentum in the order intake and growing backlog, the pipeline of deals has strengthened again. And this is probably the strongest pipeline of deals we've had over the last five years. And our commercial team here continues to be focused on converting this pipeline. I think you saw some of that progress with the things we announced here in the first quarter.  The strength is also reflected on the 12-month backlog. This is certainly the highest we've had since the merger. And that's for both freight and transit. So, I think there's good momentum there and I think some of the things I described to you certainly helped, I think, '23, '24 and beyond. So multiyear orders that really help us to continue to build momentum. So that is something very positive we signed in the quarter. So Jerry, double-digit growth this year versus last year into the Mods business. When you look at across the year, I think there is a relative consistency we could have variation just in terms of time of shipment, but double-digit growth. But I think what's more exciting is I think I had mentioned that before on auto costs. I think what we thought would have been a cap in terms of that volume in North America, we see the opportunity here to further expand that business. And internationally, I think some of the momentum continues. And so we see that business with a strong opportunity here to continue to grow moving forward. So, with regards to, number one, the business in Russia, we are complying with all sanctions and legal requirements. We are committed, again, to the safe operations of equipment in the region. And we have say to some extent, providing nominal support for this purpose. Given the uncertainty, given the conflict we have removed Russia from our backlog. What I'll tell you there is we continue to see on parking. We're back to numbers that are comparable to the third quarter of 2019. So that's, I think, a good - a positive for the business. Some of those fleets are on part, they've been parked for quite a bit of time, and they demand some level of investments. But I think most importantly, when you look at the fluidity, the velocity and the network, I think the demands for really reliable power and continued investment for our customers in order to continue to improve those metrics. I think that's something that we certainly have, I think, a lot of the solutions for it. That was not a key offset to maintaining the guidance, but we're very pleased to have purchased $300 million. And largely Courtney, it's going back. We came out of what we believe is the trough in 2021. And we feel confident in the future. We want to get off to a good start to the year, and we're able to repurchase 300 million shares.  As we look forward, I think I would go back to what we had said at Investor Day with regards to capital allocation. that we are going to focus on making sure that we have a strong balance sheet. We invest in the business in terms of capital and technology spend, which you saw in the first quarter and the dividend and protecting the dividend. Then from there, we would prioritize and continue to prioritize acquisitions as long as they are strategic and accretive over share repurchases. And finally, barring that any excess cash, I'll come back to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Are you referring to the transit segment? Right. What we're seeing as far as transit is overall revenues were down 6.5% and - as we had mentioned, 5.1 percentage points of that is due to currency. The other drag that we had with regards to revenue is about - well, not about a year ago, first quarter, we exited a lot of our UK operations on the service side, so an aftermarket, that was basically our brush product line.  By the time we exited that business, it was the end of the third quarter. And right now, we're lapping those higher revenues from a year ago as we exit that business and that's roughly about the same impact that currency had on our transit business. The third element, obviously is the supply disruptions continue to hit that business a little bit more than others. But excluding those, we would have seen good underlying growth in the transit business. Right. During the acquisition, we had looked to take $10 million of cost out of that business over the next couple of years, and we are tracking with that. I mean that's coming out certainly in operational efficiencies that would hit gross margin as well as a lot of duplicate SG&A expenses are coming out as well. This will be the last quarter that we're lapping that acquisition. And with that, we did see higher SG&A in the quarter, as you'd expect. Yes. I'd say, ridership trends to continue to be uneven across various markets there. We're not seeing any signs of slowdown of the market. And I think to some extent, the current crisis favors rail the energy intensity of rail is a fraction of -- if you were to compare to either passenger cars or well, even trucking into the freight segment. I think the other element I'd mention is certainly Europe, but other parts of the world, the hybrid work model may also increase demand for intercity trains.  So on one side, infrastructure spending continues to be a positive with governments investing in rail. So, you'll see that in the short term. We could continue to see some delay in project execution due to supply chain disruptions. But largely, the fundamentals of the business remain the same, remain strong, consistent of what you might have heard from auto customers and OEMs in that sector. I think we have largely been holding market share positions. It, of course, varies product line by product line. I think 1 of the things we made a clear upfront was really working towards the quality of the backlog, which has improved over the last couple of years. And that comes down to also making some of those choices and working in that direction. So, we're continuing to improve those numbers. Yes. So Allison, two things. I think we've made some decisions last year in terms of while trying anticipate some of this, but the lack of computer chips have had a significant impact for the business in the year. We still expect that business to grow. I think some of the good signs are tied to the double-digit order growth you saw last year.  Some were really multiyear agreements we saw again a strong book-to-bill in the first quarter, which was above two for the business. I think, again, a focus area for our teams to make sure that we continue to drive convertibility into 2022 with additional orders. And I think the other comment, I would make is North America continues to be slow, despite of some of the announcements here with May. But we're continuing to gain momentum internationally. I think there's some significant opportunities tied to PTC adoption internationally and some of the other technologies that we have. Yes. Let me start with what we're saying, and this is broad, and it's more than the North American market. If you think about freight internationally, I think across our key geographies, we see demand are really tied to commodities flow. So think about volume dynamics are positive. If you look at some of the data that we shared in both Kazakhstan and India. I think we have inquiries for new equipment to be delivered in Africa. We have a number of projects under discussion in Australia, in Asia as well as a function of that. Even despite of the volume drop you saw in Brazil, I'd say trends are positive tied to the mid, long term and new concessions.  You mentioned North America. I think we see sequential improvement of unparking of both freight cars and locomotives I think the expectation there is that the investment will continue in terms of customers needing reliable and efficient power to solve through some of the things that we described. And we certainly expect Carlyle to continue to improve throughout the year. So that's maybe just with regards to that part. I think I've made some of the comments on transit. But this is broader than I think North America and I think that goes into some of the comments I made around really the momentum that we saw in the quarter, again, with regards to the growing backlog. Yes. So I'll start with the FLXdrive, which I think as being a new product really provides data opportunities for us to bring the full integration of the suite of products we have and translate that to ultimately value for the customer. So, we have a very significant opportunity of expanding that number there. When you think about, I'll call our -- I'm going to use the word legacy products. We have the opportunity to grow that as well. We've been doing that in the international markets.  Some of that is going to be dependent on sizes of fleets customers are looking at and really making sure that as you introduce some of these components, it comes with scale, it comes with, I'll call the right support from a service capability behind it. And - but you'll see that ultimately reflected on digital opportunities, which will continue to grow here, and you've seen some of the numbers we've highlighted in terms of the momentum in orders for that business? I'd say we're continuing to explore acquisitions. We're going to be opportunistic here. It's got to come with the right returns on investments. So. this is not about the number of acquisitions that we do. This is about really value creation and really very consistent with the capital allocation framework that we shared with you guys during Investor Day. I think the priority is to find good quality, accretive deals that we can grow beyond what the previous owner was able to do to drive overall value for the company."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Wabtec's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, John Olin; and Senior Vice President of Finance, John Mastalerz. Today's slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures, were posted to our website earlier today and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Some statements we are making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements, please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. I will now turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter, our progress against our long-term value creation framework, and then John will cover the financials. We delivered a strong year with another solid quarter as evidenced by robust sales growth, margin expansion, and increased earnings and cash flow. We achieved this despite continued uncertainty in the broader economy and in the North America rail industry. Sales were $2.5 billion, which was up 9.5% versus prior year. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance from both the Freight and Transit segments. And adjusted EPS was up 18.5% from the year-ago quarter, driven by margin expansion across both segments. Total cash flow from operations for the quarter was $686 million, and total year cash flow was $1.2 billion. The 12-month backlog was $7.5 billion, up 10%, signifying continued momentum and visibility across the business into 2024, and total multi-year backlog was $22 billion. Overall, the Wabtec team delivered a strong year. Looking forward, I am encouraged by both the underlying momentum across the business, and the team's unrelenting focus on delivering for our customers. I believe Wabtec is well-positioned to drive profitable growth ahead. Our financial position remains strong. We continue to execute against our capital allocation framework to maximize shareholder value by investing for future growth and returning cash to shareholders. And as a result of our performance in 2023 and our confidence in the future of the company, our Board of Directors approved an 18% increase in the quarterly dividend and a $1 billion share buyback authorization that replaces our existing program. Shifting our focus to Slide 5, let's talk about 2024 and market expectations in more details. While key metrics across our Freight business remain mixed, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of the business, international markets, and our robust pipeline of opportunities across geographies. North American carloads were up 2.8% in the quarter, while the active locomotive fleet was down slightly when compared to where the industry exited last year. Yet, we continue to see significant opportunities across the globe and demand for new locomotives, modernizations, and digital technologies, as our customers invest in solutions that continues to drive reliability, productivity, safety, and fuel efficiency. Looking at the North America railcar build, demand for new railcar showed growth in 2023 at approximately 45,000 cars. The industry outlook for 2024 is for about 38,000 cars to be delivered. Internationally, activity is strong across core markets such as Latin America, Australia, Africa, and Kazakhstan. Significant investments to expand and upgrade infrastructure are continuing to support our robust international orders pipeline. In mining, commodity prices and an aging fleet are supporting activity to refresh and upgrade the truck fleet. Finally, moving to the Transit sector, the megatrends of urbanization and decarbonization remain in place, driving the need for clean, safe, and efficient transportation solutions around the globe. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few recent business highlights. In North America, we won a multi-year order for over 200 modernizations from CSX, demonstrating customer demand for a best-in-class solution to improve productivity, while driving down fuel usage and emissions. Looking at our mining business, we are seeing continued momentum and visibility. The team signed orders totaling over $300 million in the quarter, which is up double digits versus last year. In Transit, we won a major order worth over $150 million to supply high-performance brake systems in India. These brake systems will provide improved operating performance, efficiency, and safety for a new line of 1,200 electric locomotives. Also, during the quarter, we announced our entrance into the railcar telematics market. Our innovative telematics platform will improve shipment visibility, it will increase on-time performance, and expand asset utilization to make shipping freight by rail more competitive. Finally, during December, we acquired the remaining 50% of our JV in Kazakhstan. This strategic acquisition enhances our manufacturing capability, both globally and in the region poised for continued long-term growth. All of this demonstrates the continued momentum across the business, the team's relentless focus on delivering for our customer, and strong pipeline of opportunities we're executing on. Wabtec is well-positioned to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers' most pressing needs. Moving to Slide 7. Before turning it over to John, I want to briefly discuss our ability to deliver strong results through the economic cycle. Over the last four years, Wabtec has demonstrated a solid track record of managing through challenging markets and significant disruptions. We believe our favorable end markets, combined with our leading technologies and solutions, will enable us to remain resilient and more predictable. Our 12-month backlog of $7.5 billion provide significant visibility and support for growth. The 12-month backlog has consistently grown over the past four years, despite a challenging North America rail market and a volatile macroeconomy. And finally, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to execute our strategies, generate strong cash flow, deliver growth, and create value through disciplined capital allocation. Our track record of strong operating margin expansion across the business is evidence of our ability to deliver productivity, manage costs, and price for inflation. Our execution, combined with the strength of our business, leading products, and technologies, which result in Wabtec being resilient through economic cycles, delivering predictable earnings and superior shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results, and our overall financial performance. John?\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Rafael, and hello, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I will review our fourth quarter results in more detail. We finished the year with another solid quarter of operational and financial performance. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.53 billion, which reflects a 9.5% increase versus the prior year. Sales were driven by strong growth across both the Freight and Transit segments. For the quarter, GAAP operating income was $308 million, driven by higher sales, improved gross margin, and focused cost management. Adjusted operating margin in Q4 was 17.0%, up 1.7 percentage points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by a higher gross margin of 1.2 percentage points, and 0.5 percentage points of lower SG&A and engineering expenses as a percent of sales. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.20, which was up 39.5% versus the fourth quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pre-tax charges of $47 million, of which $19 million was for restructuring, which was primarily related to our Integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec's operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. In addition, we are exiting some small non-strategic product lines and related assets, which generated a Q4 charge of $28 million. Finally, in the quarter, our acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in our LKZ assembly joint venture generated a gain of $35 million on our existing ownership interest. I will talk more about our progress on Integration 2.0 and portfolio optimization in more detail in a few minutes. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.54, up 18.5% versus prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another solid quarter, demonstrating the underlying strength of the business. Turning to Slide 9, let's review our product lines in more detail. Fourth quarter consolidated sales were up 9.5%. Equipment sales were down 19.3% from last year as higher mining sales were more than offset by lower locomotive deliveries during the quarter. Recall that second half locomotive deliveries, as planned, were significantly skewed to the third quarter. Total equipment sales for the year were up a very strong 15.8%. Component sales were up 17.4% versus last year, largely driven by the higher demand for railcar products, along with increased sales from industrial products. Sales also benefited from the acquisition of L&M earlier in the year by $32 million. Digital intelligence sales were down 6.7% from last year, which was driven by lower revenues in our North American market, partially offset by higher demand for international PTC, next-gen on-board locomotive products, and digital mining. Our services sales grew 23.9%. Sales growth was driven by significantly higher modernization deliveries. In contrast to new locomotive sales, our planned second half mods deliveries were significantly skewed to the fourth quarter. Additionally, parts sales continued to show strength as our customers continue to recognize the superior performance, reliability, efficiency, and availability across their Wabtec locomotive fleets. Across our Transit segment, OE and aftermarket sales increased versus last year. Segment sales were up 14.3% to $728 million, behind execution of our growing backlog. The momentum in this segment is strong across our core markets as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonization accelerate the need for global investments in sustainable infrastructure. Moving to Slide 10. GAAP gross margin was 30.3%, which was up 2.0 percentage points from Q4 last year. Adjusted gross profit margin was up 1.2 percentage points, driven by higher sales, favorable price/mix, and foreign currency exchange, as well as improved productivity. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of continued cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lean initiatives. Now, turning to Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, GAAP operating margin was 12.2%, which was up 1.5 percentage points versus last year, while adjusted operating margin improved 1.7 percentage points to 17.0%. GAAP and adjusted SG&A expenses were down as a percentage of revenue as we leveraged higher sales with a strong focus on managing costs. Engineering expense was $61 million, about flat with Q4 last year. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization, and safety. Now let's take a look at segment results on Slide 12, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales were up 7.7% during the quarter. GAAP segment operating income was $246 million for an operating margin of 13.7%, up 1.2 percentage points versus last year. GAAP operating income includes $28 million of portfolio optimization costs. Adjusted operating income for the Freight segment was $347 million, up 22.2% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the Freight segment was up 2.3 percentage points from the prior year at 19.3%. The increase was driven by significantly higher gross margin, which benefited from higher sales, favorable price/mix, and improved productivity and absorption. At the same time, SG&A and engineering expenses were lower as a percentage of revenue. Finally, segment 12-month backlog was $5.45 billion, up 11.2% from the same period a year ago. The multi-year backlog was $17.83 billion, down 4.3% from the prior year. Both our 12-month and multi-year backlogs demonstrate good visibility into 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 13, Transit segment sales were up 14.3% to $728 million. When adjusting for foreign currency, Transit sales were up 9.9%. GAAP operating income was $86 million, up 36.5%. Restructuring costs related to Integration 2.0 activities were $17 million in Q4. Adjusted segment operating income was $108 million, which was up 13.7%. Adjusted operating margin of 14.9% was up 0.1 percentage points from last year, driven by the benefits of volume growth and Integration 2.0 savings. Finally, Transit segment 12-month backlog for the quarter was $2.01 billion, up 8.0% versus a year ago. The multi-year backlog was also up 9.7% to $4.17 billion. Moving to Slide 14, over the next two slides, I would like to touch on both our progress against our Integration 2.0 initiative, as well as provide details on our portfolio optimization. The efforts of both these programs in 2024 will unlock greater profitability and margin expansion across the portfolio. With regards to Integration 2.0, recall that during our Investor Day in 2022, we announced a restructuring program comprised of estimated one-time expenses between $135 million and $165 million, that would yield an incremental $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. These savings are to be achieved through a combination of actions which simplify, streamline, and consolidate parts of our operations. With program-to-date restructuring expenses of $118 million, we achieved $22 million of run rate savings as we exited 2023. We expect savings to ramp more meaningfully in 2024, and we remain on track to meet our 2025 goals. Now turning to Slide 15. As you are aware, we are very focused on driving improved shareholder value through the addition of strategic bolt-on acquisitions with accretive earnings, margins, and return on invested capital. In the second quarter of 2023, we acquired L&M, a business that is very complementary to our heat transfer portfolio and enhances our mining installed base. In the short time that we've owned this business, we are pleased with its performance, and more importantly, we are excited about its future potential for driving long-term profitable growth for Wabtec. Also, as Rafael stated, late in the fourth quarter, we acquired the remaining 50% stake of our unconsolidated LKZ assembly joint venture in Kazakhstan for $81 million net of cash received. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a $35 million non-cash gain in the quarter, which is excluded from adjusted earnings. Going forward, this business will be 100% owned by Wabtec and consolidated in our financial results. We would expect virtually no impact to sales and limited benefit to earnings in 2024. We're also announcing today the exit of some non-strategic product lines in 2024. Pruning of these product lines will improve focus in profitability, while reducing manufacturing complexity. Sales from these product lines totaled about $110 million of sales in 2023, and represented a lower-than-average margin profile. The expected net exit charges of roughly $85 million are largely non-cash, of which we recognized $28 million of non-cash charges in our Q4 GAAP results. Both our progress against our Integration 2.0 initiative and the announced portfolio moves will help position Wabtec to drive multi-year margin expansion. Now, let's turn to our financial position on Slide 16. Fourth quarter cash generation was strong at $686 million, resulting in total cash from operations of $1.2 billion versus $1.04 billion in the prior year, an increase of 15.7%. Cash flow benefited from higher earnings and improved working capital. Our balance sheet and financial position continue to be strong. We ended the quarter with liquidity of $2.12 billion. And our net debt leverage ratio was 1.9 times at the end of the fourth quarter, which was favorable versus the prior year's 2.2 times debt leverage. During 2023, we invested $308 million on the strategic acquisitions of L&M and the LKZ joint venture, and returned $532 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Finally, we improved ROIC during the year by 1.2 percentage points. We continue to allocate capital in a disciplined and balanced way to maximize returns for our shareholders. Moving to Slide 17, quickly recapping the year. Overall, the team delivered a strong year for all our stakeholders. Despite macro challenges, we drove strong revenue growth, expanded our operating margins, and generated robust cash flows. The resiliency of the business and strong execution provides us with a solid foundation for profitable growth as we enter 2024. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael to provide our 2024 financial guidance.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, John. Now, let's turn to Slide 18 to discuss our 2024 outlook and guidance. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and solutions continues across our business. This is the strongest order pipeline we've had since 2019. Our 12-month and multi-year backlogs, as well as our orders pipeline, continue to be strong, providing solid visibility for profitable growth ahead. The team is committed to driving top-line growth and margin expansion in 2024, despite an uncertain macroenvironment. With these factors in mind, we expect 2024 sales of $10.2 billion at the midpoint, over 5% growth versus last year, and adjusted EPS midpoint of $6.70 per share, up about 13% from last year. We also expect cash flow conversion to be greater than 90%. Looking ahead, I'm confident that Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable growth in 2024, which is aligned to our long-term financial framework. Now, let's wrap up on Slide 19. As you've heard today, our team delivered a solid quarter to finish out a very strong year, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world-class team, innovative technologies, and our continued focus on our customers. These results were in line with our long-term value creation framework. I'd like to take a moment to thank all the employees of Wabtec, whose dedication and focus on execution make these strong results possible. With solid underlying demand across the portfolio, increased visibility through our backlog, and intense focus on continuous improvement, Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable long-term growth and maximize shareholder returns. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning. I'll turn the call over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine?\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions. But before we do and out of consideration for others on the call, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJustin Long: Thanks, and good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Justin.\nJustin Long: So, maybe to start with a question on Freight margins, if you look at the fourth quarter, we saw a decline relative to the third quarter, despite mix looking like it got better. Equipment sales were down a lot sequentially, services revenue was up a lot sequentially. So, can you talk about what drove that pressure kind of quarter-to-quarter in Freight margins, and what you're anticipating for the progression of Freight margins as we look at the 2024 guide?\nJohn Olin: Yes. Justin, this is John. I probably wouldn't characterize it as pressure between the third and the fourth quarter. A lot of that is just seasonality of our overall margin structure. We've talked about the back-half margins versus year ago being the strongest in the back half and even stronger in the fourth quarter, and that's exactly what we saw with the fourth quarter, company margins being up 1.7%, but when we dig down a little bit deeper into that and we look at the Freight segment, they were up 2.3 percentage points. So, again, we feel real good about those margins that we did deliver in the fourth quarter in the Freight segment. When we look forward, we've talked about on the overall guidance, you've seen the guidance, and we would expect both our Freight and Transit segments to grow revenue as well as margin in 2024.\nJustin Long: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And I guess as a follow-up, I know we can see some lumpiness in the business on a quarterly basis because of mix and the timing of deliveries, similar to what we saw here in the fourth quarter. So, as we think about the 2024 guidance, is there anything you can share on the expected quarterly cadence of revenue and earnings?\nJohn Olin: Yeah, let's keep that -- talking about it in half to half, again, Justin, any given quarter can be moved pretty much by a handful or two of locomotives. So, the most important part is that we expect '24 revenue and operating margins to be up versus 2023, and generally in line with our long-term growth framework. But more specifically, in '24, we expect to see higher revenue growth in the first half versus the second half, and we also expect to see modestly higher margin growth in the first half than the second half. So, when we look at the drivers of the cadence, one continues to be on the volume side, hinges on the timing of our loco and mods deliveries and comping against higher 2023 margins in the second half.\nJustin Long: Okay. Great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.\nRafael Santana: Thanks.\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Justin.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Matt Elkott with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Pardon me, Mr. Elkott, your line is open. Are you perhaps muted?\nMatt Elkott: Sorry about that. Good morning, everyone. Can you guys give us some more insight on the 5% revenue growth at the midpoint, price versus volume? Are there any acquisitions baked in? I also ask because your backlog is 10% higher, and your revenue growth is 5%. Last year you did 16% revenue growth. Is it just a function of comps being more difficult for revenue this year?\nRafael Santana: Matt, a couple of things. First, the fundamentals for the business are strong. We have the coverage. We have the orders to execute here. The portfolio is well-positioned to provide customers with fairly a significant payback. Fleets are old. And we're still coming out of a trough in terms of customers' investments, India fleets. There's also significant drivers globally. International, as you've heard, is very strong, which drives demand not just on the locomotive front, but if you think about mining, transit, digital and the overall freight. Emissions, as you know, emission regulation is a tailwind for us. We have continued to expand our visibility with really improved backlog coverage, which goes beyond '24, and that really positions us well to deliver ahead of our long-term guidance. With that being said, our guidance takes into consideration a number of factors. If you think about '24, you still have North America carloads continues to be on the low end. We expect parkings to continue to go up, and freight car build is actually down. With that, our approach has consistently ensured really a strong say/do ratio with results ahead of our commitments, and we continue to be committed to overdeliver.\nMatt Elkott: That's helpful, Rafael. As my follow-up question, some of the kind of headwinds you mentioned, is that the reason why the Freight organic -- the organic Freight revenue contribution to growth in the fourth quarter was lower than 3Q, and basically, the lowest in the last couple of years, if I'm doing my numbers correctly? And do you expect that to continue to trend downward in '24?\nJohn Olin: I'm sorry, Matt. I'm not sure I completely understand the question. Can you repeat the driver of...\nMatt Elkott: Yeah, John. Like the $92 million organic Freight revenue contribution in the fourth quarter, if I look back over the last two years, it's the lowest number we've seen from organic Freight revenue. Is that a function of the headwinds in the North American rail market? And do you expect it to continue to trend downwards?\nRafael Santana: So, let me just be clear here. Our backlog is strong. We feel good about it. The pipeline of opportunities show it, as I said, the strongest pipeline we've looked at in the last five years. And despite of some of the dynamics here, we just described to you in North America with carloads, and so forth, we're continuing to see really customers investing for cost, investing for reliability, and we continue to see both an element of growth both for us in North America and international. You're going to have variation here, as John described, quarter-to-quarter, but we're continuing to look at profitable growth as we go in '24, and most importantly, I think we've got a stronger element of international here that really provides us visibility now into '25, '26, and '27.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. Thanks, Rafael. Thanks, John.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nRafael Santana: Hi, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Rafael -- hi. Rafael, I'm wondering can you just provide an update on how your customers are thinking about the discussions with California on sub-Tier 4 locomotives in the fleet? And how do you folks see the regulatory process and timeline unfolding? And is that driving customer preference for new versus mods that wouldn't fit the new CARB-proposed standards? Can you just talk about how the ebbs and flows are going and the timeline that you expect could drive from a clarity standpoint for the industry?\nRafael Santana: Yes. So, Jerry, last November, CARB petitioned the EPA for a waiver and supports for regulation for in-use locomotives. EPA has not responded to California's waiver request, and the ruling became effective beginning of this year. In one hand, I'd say the outcome of the rule remains fluid, but we are technically very well-positioned to support our customers here for all outcomes. We have the best-in-class products, lowest fuel consumption, lowest emission, best reliability, best availability, and regardless of further regulation what I'll tell you the good news is, our entire installed base will be able to burn bio and renewable fuels. But what's more exciting to me is, our newer fleets, they will ultimately go beyond bio and renewable fuel. We firmly believe we can bridge customers here to their ultimate near-zero emission goals. We are aggressively testing alternative fuels, hydrogen being part of that mix in our newer internal combustion engines, and with really an eye towards enabling customer sustainability journey, and in parallel, we're integrating batteries, and ultimately hybrid systems into our fleet. So, we have not incorporated regulatory change into our guidance. So, that would be a tailwind for us.\nJerry Revich: Super. And then, can I just ask, you've been very clear on the cash flow from operations conversion rate at over 90%. The CapEx that we're seeing at 2% of sales, is that the run rate that we should be thinking about, John? Are there any ebbs and flows as we think about what total net income to free cash flow conversion should be like over the next couple of years depending on your CapEx plan?\nJohn Olin: So, when we look off over the rest of our investment horizon that we came out with a couple of years ago, we would expect 2% range of CapEx over that entire period of time.\nJerry Revich: That's clear. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you. And I guess a little bit similar to Jerry's question, but I think you had a healthy order for mods from CSX that just came through. I'm wondering if you can give us any sense of where your total number of mods was in '23, just your perspective on what that order kind of means in context. And then, more general, even if we leave aside California, there's also the climate goals that the rails have, and there's a fairly old fleet that they're running, and maybe record old fleet that they're running. So, in your conversations with your customers in North America, how much are they actually thinking about new locomotives right now with or without California? How is that balance looking? [Does anybody] (ph) think they can get to their climate goals with just mods? Maybe just any color around that level of mods, and then how to think about new? Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Hey, Rob. Our customers invest for returns at the end of the day. So, it's just really comes down to making sure as they look into their fleets, they've got really the opportunity here to continue to drive costs down, to drive reliability up, and improve service levels, and I think that continues. When I look at that investment, of course, we're coming from trough levels here in the past. We have growth coming into '23. We have still significant growth in '24, and the recent order that you just referred to, it just gives us greater visibility into really continue to grow market. I think we still have, I think, an opportunity to grow here as we get closer here to what I'll call average replacement rates with really the older fleets we've had. I think some of the elements on what customers decide to invest in could be shaped here certainly by regulation, but most importantly, I think, it's going to get shaped by some of the elements of technology that we're introducing, that allows faster payback, a greater payback, and greater flexibility to really, I'll call, ultimately bridge customers here into a lower emissions environment, and that's how we look at it.\nOperator: All right. Thank you. And our next question today comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, within the...\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Group: Good morning. Within the revenue guidance, just directionally, are you guys expecting better Freight or Transit growth? And when you just think about all the moving pieces with your growth, how should we think about mix as a tailwind or not this year?\nJohn Olin: Great question, Scott. When we look at across our five business groups and look into 2024, we expect equipment to be the fastest growing, again, for the reasons that Rafael just mentioned on the last question. And with that, I mean, actually, in looking at mods as well, we expect both mods and locos combined to be growing at a faster rate than our average -- the midpoint of the revenue growth, and that will put a little bit of mix headwind in 2024. And again I've said before, in this world, Scott, there's two kinds of mix, there's good mix and bad mix, and this is a case of really good mix. As we mix down a little bit, because we're putting out assets in the marketplace, that will be generating revenues for us for decades to come. So, we feel really good, but there will be a little bit of mix headwinds going forward.\nScott Group: Okay. Helpful. And then, I just want to clarify just on the mod side, are you seeing -- I think you've been talking about pretty consistent double-digit growth in mods the last bunch of years. Do we have that again this year? And then, any update on the battery loco and timing of first delivery and all that? Thank you.\nJohn Olin: With regards to the mods, we tend to look at one or the other, mods and new. If we look at combined mods and new in the year, we said they'd be up double digit, and they were in 2023. As we look forward as I had just mentioned, we do expect them to grow faster than the average, those combined, to grow faster than the average.\nRafael Santana: So, strong growth here going to '24, and, Scott, with greater visibility ahead. On your question on battery electric, we're continuing to make progress here. In the fourth quarter, as you know, we unveiled the first heavy-haul battery electric locomotive with over 7 megawatts of power. These units will start running this year in Australia. And on that, I think fuel continues to be a one of the biggest cost for customers. There's a continued focus here on driving efficiency. We've got a number of pilots and demo projects, and while we do not expect broad adoption of these, there's going to be some really key opportunities here that we're ready to work on and support customers on.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak: Just wondering if you could expand on the digital intelligence piece of your business, particularly in North America. It seems like that's been a bit slower. Just -- any color there? Are folks pushing off some of these investments from a cyclical standpoint? Understanding the long-term drivers are still there? Just any color on that near term. Thanks.\nRafael Santana: Yes. So number one, I think during the quarter, I think in one side, while we saw higher demand from international, when you think about PTC, on-board locomotive, digital mine, we saw really a softer demand here, which is continuing with US, driven by really discretionary OpEx and the commuter signaling business. What I'd say is the pipeline of opportunities remains strong, driven primarily by international and also by digital mining solutions. I'd say recurring revenues in short-term convertibility continues to be a focus area for the group. But I think what's more exciting here, something we announced in the fourth quarter, which is really tied to us entering the railcar telematics market. We are creating a platform here with proven technology, and this is a market of 1.6 million freight cars. It is a multi-billion dollar opportunity for us, one that we will be providing real-time data to railcar, and tank car owners. And we're -- opportunities like this will keep propelling growth and profitable growth for this business.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then, on the cost optimization, could you maybe give us any color on how we should think about run rate exiting 2024? And then, was that portfolio pruning part of that? Is that incremental? Just any color there. Thanks.\nJohn Olin: Yeah, Allison. This is John. So, they're separate. Integration 2.0, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of that. And, to-date, most of the investment is behind us, and most of the savings are in front of us. So, as we exited 2023, we had a run rate of $22 million. And as we exit 2025, the run rate that we will exit at will be $75 million to $90 million. So, over the next two years, we would expect a significant ramp in moving from $22 million to the $75 million to $90 million, and it will probably be somewhat equal as we ramp from here to on the exit period.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. So, Rafael and John, can you talk a bit about the -- you've kind of gone over the mix of product type, but how about international versus domestic, and kind of maybe talk us through to understand margin differentials, or mix issues as one is growing versus the other, within your 5% growth outlook?\nRafael Santana: Yeah. When you think of revenue side, I think you heard me describing stronger international pipeline, which I think, ultimately, wants to reflect stronger growth internationally as we look especially beyond '24 in that regard. So, we see a strong pipeline of deals, some of them signed last year. We'll see a part of those converting into backlog this year, which will continue to signal really the strength that we've got longer term in the business. I think with regards to specific margins, I mean, this is really project-by-project driven, as John described. I think there is an element of still headwinds just associated with pace in which we grow both the new locomotive business, but also the mods business at a rate -- at a growth rate faster than the overall company.\nKen Hoexter: So, maybe we can delve into that for a quick one from my follow-up, just the backlog conversion. It looks like the backlog is building up maybe double-digit rates, right? Freight is up 11%, Transit up 8%. Just wondering, is that a good signal, a read-through for that revenue growth? I mean, you're targeting 5%. The backlog is growing there double digit. How do we reconcile the two? Where's there a loss, I guess, in the conversion?\nRafael Santana: So, a couple of things. I mean, we will have variation here to quarter-to-quarter. Just reflecting last four quarters, I mean, we have quarters on low-single digits, we have quarters on double digits. And I think you're going to see some of that variation. How we run the business is making sure that we've got that convertibility built out 12 months out, 18 months out, and we got to really think about the lead times we've got associated with our products. So, it's making sure that we have that coverage. If you think in specific about '24, I think, there's some elements of coverage, especially for the flow products that really need to -- really be executed through the year. And if you keep in mind, you've got things like the freight car build, which is down. So, you do have some elements here that play out through the year. But bottom line is, we feel strong about both the coverage, and about the ability here to continue to drive profitable growth with the pipeline we have.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks, Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAngel Castillo: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe kind of expanding on that and a little bit longer term, as you think about your book-to-bill for 2024, focused in particularly on locomotives -- new locomotives, how are you thinking about that kind of evolving? It sounds like deliveries will be ramping up during the year. But just based on what you're hearing from your conversations with your customers, how do you kind of see that throughout the year in terms of above 1, below 1? Just any more color there would be helpful.\nJohn Olin: Angel, on average, we expect our book-to-bill to be over 1 because we expect to continue to grow in the mid-single digits over the sustainable future, right? But, again, going back to -- some of these orders can be lumpy from time to time, and a lot of them are multi-year, so we're not -- we don't provide a guidance in terms of what we expect forward-looking book-to-bill be, but over time, we would certainly expect it to be over 1.\nAngel Castillo: Got it. And then, maybe just on the portfolio divestitures or pruning that you talked about, could you quantify that from an EPS perspective, how much of that is kind of -- what was kind of the impact embedded in the guidance? And any kind of incremental pruning that you see as kind of opportunities here?\nJohn Olin: Yeah. So, when we look at portfolio optimization, again, we're looking very focused on overall company profitability and certainly Integration 2.0 is helping to drive that. But in addition to that, we're looking at -- taking a hard look at the portfolio, and looking at the product lines that are not carrying the weight or not delivering the profitability that we expect, or the value that we expect. And with that, we're going out and removing about $110 million of revenue. So, when you look at our overall guidance, you've got to realize too that this revenue isn't going to be there in 2024. So, that's putting a little bit of headwind on the overall midpoint that we've given. But to answer your question, this is very low margin or no margin, Angel. So, it's not having an impact on our profitability going forward, but it is bringing our revenue down, and therefore, we would expect a little bit upward pressure on -- or upward momentum on margin percent.\nAngel Castillo: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks for fitting me in. So, you announced the $1 billion in share buyback authorization. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about using the cash flow this year between repurchases and M&A, the expected timeline for completing this authorization, and if any of this baked into your EPS guidance for the year?\nJohn Olin: So, Saree, number one is in terms of capital allocation, we are on track to do what we've done in 2023. Again, we couldn't be more pleased with the balance that we had in 2023 when you look at the free cash of about $900 million, operating cash of $1.2 billion, it would sound pretty split between M&A and share repurchases. When we look forward, as you know, we will prioritize M&A over share repurchases as long as we have good strategic bolt-on M&A. And if not, we will return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In relationship to the authorization, it replaced the old authorization that we had. So, we've got the ability to spend up to a $1 billion in share repurchases. And again, that will be determined throughout the year as far as what we have in M&A opportunities.\nSaree Boroditsky: But is it fair to say that any of that -- any additional share buybacks this year is not included in your EPS guidance?\nJohn Olin: Our guidance includes all of our business aspects as well as the use of cash in 2024.\nSaree Boroditsky: Okay. So, it does include share buybacks?\nJohn Olin: Share buybacks, M&A, or the use of that cash, yes.\nSaree Boroditsky: Okay. And then, for next question, I know you're hesitant to kind of put a number on Freight margin performance for this year, but maybe comment on incremental margins in Freight, because I think you should have easier comps with the absence of the strike, you have higher volumes, and you're exiting lower-margin products. So, what can we think about for incremental Freight margins this year?\nJohn Olin: Well, overall, you can figure out where we're -- what we're looking at for incremental margins on a company in total. Freight will certainly be a driver of that, but we also expect margin growth in the Transit side. When you look at, we are lapping some impact to the strike that we had, and that's been incorporated in our overall guidance, right? So, when we look at the margins in general, we're looking at favorable productivity and absorption, and certainly, the benefits of Integration 2.0 as well as portfolio optimization that you mentioned. Now, again, there's going to be some headwinds to that on unfavorable mix.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nJohn Olin: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. This is Rob on for Chris. If I could dig a little bit further into Integration 2.0, it looks like on a run-rate basis, exiting 2024, more than double the savings. Can you give us a sense of the cadence you're expecting to realize that run rate throughout '24?\nJohn Olin: Yeah. We wouldn't expect any unusual aspect of that. There's numerous projects that make up Integration 2.0, and most of them have all been executed. And now it is just different levels as the savings start to drive forward. So, for purposes of modeling, probably more straight line is more accurate than any other way to look at them, that build.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's really helpful. And then just to kind of circle back on Justin's question about the cadence of earnings and revenue growth, can you give us any -- can you fine-tune kind of the percentage of revenue you are expecting in the first half versus the second half? Clearly, it's going to be more weighted to the first half, but...\nJohn Olin: Yeah, we would just expect revenue growth to be higher in the first half than in the second half, again, largely how we have some of our delivery of the high-ticket items planned. But, again, whenever you move a few locomotives from one period to the other, or deliveries a little bit ahead or behind, it's hard to get too fine-tuned on that. So, suffice to say that the first-half revenue growth will be a little bit higher than the second half.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: You talked about a roughly neutral volume environment for North American rail. How much would that have to deteriorate to start to meaningfully impact your service revenue on the locomotive contracts?\nRafael Santana: So, what we described was carloads being, I'll call it, to some extent muted for the year. That has, of course, been included into our guidance. What I think you have that more than offsets this is the continued opportunity here for customers to really invest for returns, it's really by driving productivity, lowering costs, replacing, in some cases, three units for two units, and I think those dynamics remain in place and remain in place not just for '24 as you see reflected here by the orders that we just got. We think, at least from a fleet perspective and parkings, service levels have really -- the focus on service levels has really kept the active fleets relatively stable, and we would expect us to continue to be -- have a favorable market dynamics for North America included.\nBascome Majors: And moving to international, on the buyout in Kazakhstan, you talked about not much 2024 impact from that. As you look out longer term, is the deal structured in a way where all of the benefits from any of this $2 billion-plus of MOUs converting to orders would accrue to Wabtec? And just longer term, when could that become a meaningful contributor to your overall profit profile? Thank you.\nJohn Olin: Bascome, I would think about the LKZ venture that we have as an assembly joint venture. So, it doesn't have any impact on our overall revenue growth or growth into the CIS region. What it does is it improves our supply chain, right? A lot of the things that we were driving through the joint venture were kits that we would make and lot of the parts were made in other parts of the world and shipped in there, and the JV was for the assembly side of it. So now, this just gives us a great operational -- complete control over the operational supply chain in an area of the world that we believe is going to show significant growth going forward.\nRafael Santana: We have significant growth in '24, we have significant growth in '25, and we have an opportunity here to utilize that installed -- that manufacturing footprint to export outside of Kazakhstan, and I think that's a significant element here. On the top of this, just had some really strong returns for us.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSteve Barger: Hey. Thanks. John, you said equipment will be the fastest growing group, but if I'm remembering right, that category is pretty evenly split between locomotive and mining, marine, and drilling. Are you thinking locomotive outgrows the industrial products, or do you expect more equal growth from those kind of two categories?\nJohn Olin: Yeah. We don't break it out specifically, Steve, but when we look at 2024, our equipment group, we expect good growth out of both locomotives as well as mining equipment.\nSteve Barger: Got it. Thanks. So, similar growth rates, no big variance between the two?\nRafael Santana: Steve, it's, I think, a challenge here. Might have, again, variation as we go through it, but they're strong. They're strong, both strong, and a lot of it really internationally driven and beyond '24.\nSteve Barger: Got it. And for Transit, you're coming off a tough comp, but really the best growth in years. And with equipment and services on the Freight side outgrowing consolidated guidance, does that mean Freight is more like high-single digit for the year and Transit low-single digit?\nRafael Santana: We won't get into the specifics or guiding for Transit or for Freight. What I'll tell you, on Transit, the fundamentals for the business continue to be strong, book-to-bill ratio closed over 1 for the year. While we are pleased with the progress, we continue to do significant work here to simplify the footprint. This business will deliver on margin expansion in '24. Integration 2.0 is a significant contributor to that. But we will continue to have variation quarter-to-quarter, driven by really mix and timing of project.\nSteve Barger: Understood. Thanks.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Kristine Kubacki for any closing remarks.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Rocco, and thank you, everyone, for your participation today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "John Olin",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael, and hello, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I will review our fourth quarter results in more detail. We finished the year with another solid quarter of operational and financial performance. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.53 billion, which reflects a 9.5% increase versus the prior year. Sales were driven by strong growth across both the Freight and Transit segments. For the quarter, GAAP operating income was $308 million, driven by higher sales, improved gross margin, and focused cost management. Adjusted operating margin in Q4 was 17.0%, up 1.7 percentage points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by a higher gross margin of 1.2 percentage points, and 0.5 percentage points of lower SG&A and engineering expenses as a percent of sales. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.20, which was up 39.5% versus the fourth quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pre-tax charges of $47 million, of which $19 million was for restructuring, which was primarily related to our Integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec's operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. In addition, we are exiting some small non-strategic product lines and related assets, which generated a Q4 charge of $28 million. Finally, in the quarter, our acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in our LKZ assembly joint venture generated a gain of $35 million on our existing ownership interest. I will talk more about our progress on Integration 2.0 and portfolio optimization in more detail in a few minutes. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.54, up 18.5% versus prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another solid quarter, demonstrating the underlying strength of the business. Turning to Slide 9, let's review our product lines in more detail. Fourth quarter consolidated sales were up 9.5%. Equipment sales were down 19.3% from last year as higher mining sales were more than offset by lower locomotive deliveries during the quarter. Recall that second half locomotive deliveries, as planned, were significantly skewed to the third quarter. Total equipment sales for the year were up a very strong 15.8%. Component sales were up 17.4% versus last year, largely driven by the higher demand for railcar products, along with increased sales from industrial products. Sales also benefited from the acquisition of L&M earlier in the year by $32 million. Digital intelligence sales were down 6.7% from last year, which was driven by lower revenues in our North American market, partially offset by higher demand for international PTC, next-gen on-board locomotive products, and digital mining. Our services sales grew 23.9%. Sales growth was driven by significantly higher modernization deliveries. In contrast to new locomotive sales, our planned second half mods deliveries were significantly skewed to the fourth quarter. Additionally, parts sales continued to show strength as our customers continue to recognize the superior performance, reliability, efficiency, and availability across their Wabtec locomotive fleets. Across our Transit segment, OE and aftermarket sales increased versus last year. Segment sales were up 14.3% to $728 million, behind execution of our growing backlog. The momentum in this segment is strong across our core markets as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonization accelerate the need for global investments in sustainable infrastructure. Moving to Slide 10. GAAP gross margin was 30.3%, which was up 2.0 percentage points from Q4 last year. Adjusted gross profit margin was up 1.2 percentage points, driven by higher sales, favorable price/mix, and foreign currency exchange, as well as improved productivity. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of continued cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lean initiatives. Now, turning to Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, GAAP operating margin was 12.2%, which was up 1.5 percentage points versus last year, while adjusted operating margin improved 1.7 percentage points to 17.0%. GAAP and adjusted SG&A expenses were down as a percentage of revenue as we leveraged higher sales with a strong focus on managing costs. Engineering expense was $61 million, about flat with Q4 last year. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization, and safety. Now let's take a look at segment results on Slide 12, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales were up 7.7% during the quarter. GAAP segment operating income was $246 million for an operating margin of 13.7%, up 1.2 percentage points versus last year. GAAP operating income includes $28 million of portfolio optimization costs. Adjusted operating income for the Freight segment was $347 million, up 22.2% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the Freight segment was up 2.3 percentage points from the prior year at 19.3%. The increase was driven by significantly higher gross margin, which benefited from higher sales, favorable price/mix, and improved productivity and absorption. At the same time, SG&A and engineering expenses were lower as a percentage of revenue. Finally, segment 12-month backlog was $5.45 billion, up 11.2% from the same period a year ago. The multi-year backlog was $17.83 billion, down 4.3% from the prior year. Both our 12-month and multi-year backlogs demonstrate good visibility into 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 13, Transit segment sales were up 14.3% to $728 million. When adjusting for foreign currency, Transit sales were up 9.9%. GAAP operating income was $86 million, up 36.5%. Restructuring costs related to Integration 2.0 activities were $17 million in Q4. Adjusted segment operating income was $108 million, which was up 13.7%. Adjusted operating margin of 14.9% was up 0.1 percentage points from last year, driven by the benefits of volume growth and Integration 2.0 savings. Finally, Transit segment 12-month backlog for the quarter was $2.01 billion, up 8.0% versus a year ago. The multi-year backlog was also up 9.7% to $4.17 billion. Moving to Slide 14, over the next two slides, I would like to touch on both our progress against our Integration 2.0 initiative, as well as provide details on our portfolio optimization. The efforts of both these programs in 2024 will unlock greater profitability and margin expansion across the portfolio. With regards to Integration 2.0, recall that during our Investor Day in 2022, we announced a restructuring program comprised of estimated one-time expenses between $135 million and $165 million, that would yield an incremental $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. These savings are to be achieved through a combination of actions which simplify, streamline, and consolidate parts of our operations. With program-to-date restructuring expenses of $118 million, we achieved $22 million of run rate savings as we exited 2023. We expect savings to ramp more meaningfully in 2024, and we remain on track to meet our 2025 goals. Now turning to Slide 15. As you are aware, we are very focused on driving improved shareholder value through the addition of strategic bolt-on acquisitions with accretive earnings, margins, and return on invested capital. In the second quarter of 2023, we acquired L&M, a business that is very complementary to our heat transfer portfolio and enhances our mining installed base. In the short time that we've owned this business, we are pleased with its performance, and more importantly, we are excited about its future potential for driving long-term profitable growth for Wabtec. Also, as Rafael stated, late in the fourth quarter, we acquired the remaining 50% stake of our unconsolidated LKZ assembly joint venture in Kazakhstan for $81 million net of cash received. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a $35 million non-cash gain in the quarter, which is excluded from adjusted earnings. Going forward, this business will be 100% owned by Wabtec and consolidated in our financial results. We would expect virtually no impact to sales and limited benefit to earnings in 2024. We're also announcing today the exit of some non-strategic product lines in 2024. Pruning of these product lines will improve focus in profitability, while reducing manufacturing complexity. Sales from these product lines totaled about $110 million of sales in 2023, and represented a lower-than-average margin profile. The expected net exit charges of roughly $85 million are largely non-cash, of which we recognized $28 million of non-cash charges in our Q4 GAAP results. Both our progress against our Integration 2.0 initiative and the announced portfolio moves will help position Wabtec to drive multi-year margin expansion. Now, let's turn to our financial position on Slide 16. Fourth quarter cash generation was strong at $686 million, resulting in total cash from operations of $1.2 billion versus $1.04 billion in the prior year, an increase of 15.7%. Cash flow benefited from higher earnings and improved working capital. Our balance sheet and financial position continue to be strong. We ended the quarter with liquidity of $2.12 billion. And our net debt leverage ratio was 1.9 times at the end of the fourth quarter, which was favorable versus the prior year's 2.2 times debt leverage. During 2023, we invested $308 million on the strategic acquisitions of L&M and the LKZ joint venture, and returned $532 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Finally, we improved ROIC during the year by 1.2 percentage points. We continue to allocate capital in a disciplined and balanced way to maximize returns for our shareholders. Moving to Slide 17, quickly recapping the year. Overall, the team delivered a strong year for all our stakeholders. Despite macro challenges, we drove strong revenue growth, expanded our operating margins, and generated robust cash flows. The resiliency of the business and strong execution provides us with a solid foundation for profitable growth as we enter 2024. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael to provide our 2024 financial guidance. Yes. Justin, this is John. I probably wouldn't characterize it as pressure between the third and the fourth quarter. A lot of that is just seasonality of our overall margin structure. We've talked about the back-half margins versus year ago being the strongest in the back half and even stronger in the fourth quarter, and that's exactly what we saw with the fourth quarter, company margins being up 1.7%, but when we dig down a little bit deeper into that and we look at the Freight segment, they were up 2.3 percentage points. So, again, we feel real good about those margins that we did deliver in the fourth quarter in the Freight segment. When we look forward, we've talked about on the overall guidance, you've seen the guidance, and we would expect both our Freight and Transit segments to grow revenue as well as margin in 2024. Yeah, let's keep that -- talking about it in half to half, again, Justin, any given quarter can be moved pretty much by a handful or two of locomotives. So, the most important part is that we expect '24 revenue and operating margins to be up versus 2023, and generally in line with our long-term growth framework. But more specifically, in '24, we expect to see higher revenue growth in the first half versus the second half, and we also expect to see modestly higher margin growth in the first half than the second half. So, when we look at the drivers of the cadence, one continues to be on the volume side, hinges on the timing of our loco and mods deliveries and comping against higher 2023 margins in the second half. Thanks, Justin. I'm sorry, Matt. I'm not sure I completely understand the question. Can you repeat the driver of... So, when we look off over the rest of our investment horizon that we came out with a couple of years ago, we would expect 2% range of CapEx over that entire period of time. Great question, Scott. When we look at across our five business groups and look into 2024, we expect equipment to be the fastest growing, again, for the reasons that Rafael just mentioned on the last question. And with that, I mean, actually, in looking at mods as well, we expect both mods and locos combined to be growing at a faster rate than our average -- the midpoint of the revenue growth, and that will put a little bit of mix headwind in 2024. And again I've said before, in this world, Scott, there's two kinds of mix, there's good mix and bad mix, and this is a case of really good mix. As we mix down a little bit, because we're putting out assets in the marketplace, that will be generating revenues for us for decades to come. So, we feel really good, but there will be a little bit of mix headwinds going forward. With regards to the mods, we tend to look at one or the other, mods and new. If we look at combined mods and new in the year, we said they'd be up double digit, and they were in 2023. As we look forward as I had just mentioned, we do expect them to grow faster than the average, those combined, to grow faster than the average. Yeah, Allison. This is John. So, they're separate. Integration 2.0, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of that. And, to-date, most of the investment is behind us, and most of the savings are in front of us. So, as we exited 2023, we had a run rate of $22 million. And as we exit 2025, the run rate that we will exit at will be $75 million to $90 million. So, over the next two years, we would expect a significant ramp in moving from $22 million to the $75 million to $90 million, and it will probably be somewhat equal as we ramp from here to on the exit period. Angel, on average, we expect our book-to-bill to be over 1 because we expect to continue to grow in the mid-single digits over the sustainable future, right? But, again, going back to -- some of these orders can be lumpy from time to time, and a lot of them are multi-year, so we're not -- we don't provide a guidance in terms of what we expect forward-looking book-to-bill be, but over time, we would certainly expect it to be over 1. Yeah. So, when we look at portfolio optimization, again, we're looking very focused on overall company profitability and certainly Integration 2.0 is helping to drive that. But in addition to that, we're looking at -- taking a hard look at the portfolio, and looking at the product lines that are not carrying the weight or not delivering the profitability that we expect, or the value that we expect. And with that, we're going out and removing about $110 million of revenue. So, when you look at our overall guidance, you've got to realize too that this revenue isn't going to be there in 2024. So, that's putting a little bit of headwind on the overall midpoint that we've given. But to answer your question, this is very low margin or no margin, Angel. So, it's not having an impact on our profitability going forward, but it is bringing our revenue down, and therefore, we would expect a little bit upward pressure on -- or upward momentum on margin percent. So, Saree, number one is in terms of capital allocation, we are on track to do what we've done in 2023. Again, we couldn't be more pleased with the balance that we had in 2023 when you look at the free cash of about $900 million, operating cash of $1.2 billion, it would sound pretty split between M&A and share repurchases. When we look forward, as you know, we will prioritize M&A over share repurchases as long as we have good strategic bolt-on M&A. And if not, we will return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In relationship to the authorization, it replaced the old authorization that we had. So, we've got the ability to spend up to a $1 billion in share repurchases. And again, that will be determined throughout the year as far as what we have in M&A opportunities. Our guidance includes all of our business aspects as well as the use of cash in 2024. Share buybacks, M&A, or the use of that cash, yes. Well, overall, you can figure out where we're -- what we're looking at for incremental margins on a company in total. Freight will certainly be a driver of that, but we also expect margin growth in the Transit side. When you look at, we are lapping some impact to the strike that we had, and that's been incorporated in our overall guidance, right? So, when we look at the margins in general, we're looking at favorable productivity and absorption, and certainly, the benefits of Integration 2.0 as well as portfolio optimization that you mentioned. Now, again, there's going to be some headwinds to that on unfavorable mix. Thank you. Yeah. We wouldn't expect any unusual aspect of that. There's numerous projects that make up Integration 2.0, and most of them have all been executed. And now it is just different levels as the savings start to drive forward. So, for purposes of modeling, probably more straight line is more accurate than any other way to look at them, that build. Yeah, we would just expect revenue growth to be higher in the first half than in the second half, again, largely how we have some of our delivery of the high-ticket items planned. But, again, whenever you move a few locomotives from one period to the other, or deliveries a little bit ahead or behind, it's hard to get too fine-tuned on that. So, suffice to say that the first-half revenue growth will be a little bit higher than the second half. Bascome, I would think about the LKZ venture that we have as an assembly joint venture. So, it doesn't have any impact on our overall revenue growth or growth into the CIS region. What it does is it improves our supply chain, right? A lot of the things that we were driving through the joint venture were kits that we would make and lot of the parts were made in other parts of the world and shipped in there, and the JV was for the assembly side of it. So now, this just gives us a great operational -- complete control over the operational supply chain in an area of the world that we believe is going to show significant growth going forward. Yeah. We don't break it out specifically, Steve, but when we look at 2024, our equipment group, we expect good growth out of both locomotives as well as mining equipment."

            "name": "Rafael Santana",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter, our progress against our long-term value creation framework, and then John will cover the financials. We delivered a strong year with another solid quarter as evidenced by robust sales growth, margin expansion, and increased earnings and cash flow. We achieved this despite continued uncertainty in the broader economy and in the North America rail industry. Sales were $2.5 billion, which was up 9.5% versus prior year. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance from both the Freight and Transit segments. And adjusted EPS was up 18.5% from the year-ago quarter, driven by margin expansion across both segments. Total cash flow from operations for the quarter was $686 million, and total year cash flow was $1.2 billion. The 12-month backlog was $7.5 billion, up 10%, signifying continued momentum and visibility across the business into 2024, and total multi-year backlog was $22 billion. Overall, the Wabtec team delivered a strong year. Looking forward, I am encouraged by both the underlying momentum across the business, and the team's unrelenting focus on delivering for our customers. I believe Wabtec is well-positioned to drive profitable growth ahead. Our financial position remains strong. We continue to execute against our capital allocation framework to maximize shareholder value by investing for future growth and returning cash to shareholders. And as a result of our performance in 2023 and our confidence in the future of the company, our Board of Directors approved an 18% increase in the quarterly dividend and a $1 billion share buyback authorization that replaces our existing program. Shifting our focus to Slide 5, let's talk about 2024 and market expectations in more details. While key metrics across our Freight business remain mixed, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of the business, international markets, and our robust pipeline of opportunities across geographies. North American carloads were up 2.8% in the quarter, while the active locomotive fleet was down slightly when compared to where the industry exited last year. Yet, we continue to see significant opportunities across the globe and demand for new locomotives, modernizations, and digital technologies, as our customers invest in solutions that continues to drive reliability, productivity, safety, and fuel efficiency. Looking at the North America railcar build, demand for new railcar showed growth in 2023 at approximately 45,000 cars. The industry outlook for 2024 is for about 38,000 cars to be delivered. Internationally, activity is strong across core markets such as Latin America, Australia, Africa, and Kazakhstan. Significant investments to expand and upgrade infrastructure are continuing to support our robust international orders pipeline. In mining, commodity prices and an aging fleet are supporting activity to refresh and upgrade the truck fleet. Finally, moving to the Transit sector, the megatrends of urbanization and decarbonization remain in place, driving the need for clean, safe, and efficient transportation solutions around the globe. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few recent business highlights. In North America, we won a multi-year order for over 200 modernizations from CSX, demonstrating customer demand for a best-in-class solution to improve productivity, while driving down fuel usage and emissions. Looking at our mining business, we are seeing continued momentum and visibility. The team signed orders totaling over $300 million in the quarter, which is up double digits versus last year. In Transit, we won a major order worth over $150 million to supply high-performance brake systems in India. These brake systems will provide improved operating performance, efficiency, and safety for a new line of 1,200 electric locomotives. Also, during the quarter, we announced our entrance into the railcar telematics market. Our innovative telematics platform will improve shipment visibility, it will increase on-time performance, and expand asset utilization to make shipping freight by rail more competitive. Finally, during December, we acquired the remaining 50% of our JV in Kazakhstan. This strategic acquisition enhances our manufacturing capability, both globally and in the region poised for continued long-term growth. All of this demonstrates the continued momentum across the business, the team's relentless focus on delivering for our customer, and strong pipeline of opportunities we're executing on. Wabtec is well-positioned to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers' most pressing needs. Moving to Slide 7. Before turning it over to John, I want to briefly discuss our ability to deliver strong results through the economic cycle. Over the last four years, Wabtec has demonstrated a solid track record of managing through challenging markets and significant disruptions. We believe our favorable end markets, combined with our leading technologies and solutions, will enable us to remain resilient and more predictable. Our 12-month backlog of $7.5 billion provide significant visibility and support for growth. The 12-month backlog has consistently grown over the past four years, despite a challenging North America rail market and a volatile macroeconomy. And finally, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to execute our strategies, generate strong cash flow, deliver growth, and create value through disciplined capital allocation. Our track record of strong operating margin expansion across the business is evidence of our ability to deliver productivity, manage costs, and price for inflation. Our execution, combined with the strength of our business, leading products, and technologies, which result in Wabtec being resilient through economic cycles, delivering predictable earnings and superior shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results, and our overall financial performance. John? Thanks, John. Now, let's turn to Slide 18 to discuss our 2024 outlook and guidance. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and solutions continues across our business. This is the strongest order pipeline we've had since 2019. Our 12-month and multi-year backlogs, as well as our orders pipeline, continue to be strong, providing solid visibility for profitable growth ahead. The team is committed to driving top-line growth and margin expansion in 2024, despite an uncertain macroenvironment. With these factors in mind, we expect 2024 sales of $10.2 billion at the midpoint, over 5% growth versus last year, and adjusted EPS midpoint of $6.70 per share, up about 13% from last year. We also expect cash flow conversion to be greater than 90%. Looking ahead, I'm confident that Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable growth in 2024, which is aligned to our long-term financial framework. Now, let's wrap up on Slide 19. As you've heard today, our team delivered a solid quarter to finish out a very strong year, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world-class team, innovative technologies, and our continued focus on our customers. These results were in line with our long-term value creation framework. I'd like to take a moment to thank all the employees of Wabtec, whose dedication and focus on execution make these strong results possible. With solid underlying demand across the portfolio, increased visibility through our backlog, and intense focus on continuous improvement, Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable long-term growth and maximize shareholder returns. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning. I'll turn the call over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine? Good morning, Justin. Thanks. Matt, a couple of things. First, the fundamentals for the business are strong. We have the coverage. We have the orders to execute here. The portfolio is well-positioned to provide customers with fairly a significant payback. Fleets are old. And we're still coming out of a trough in terms of customers' investments, India fleets. There's also significant drivers globally. International, as you've heard, is very strong, which drives demand not just on the locomotive front, but if you think about mining, transit, digital and the overall freight. Emissions, as you know, emission regulation is a tailwind for us. We have continued to expand our visibility with really improved backlog coverage, which goes beyond '24, and that really positions us well to deliver ahead of our long-term guidance. With that being said, our guidance takes into consideration a number of factors. If you think about '24, you still have North America carloads continues to be on the low end. We expect parkings to continue to go up, and freight car build is actually down. With that, our approach has consistently ensured really a strong say/do ratio with results ahead of our commitments, and we continue to be committed to overdeliver. So, let me just be clear here. Our backlog is strong. We feel good about it. The pipeline of opportunities show it, as I said, the strongest pipeline we've looked at in the last five years. And despite of some of the dynamics here, we just described to you in North America with carloads, and so forth, we're continuing to see really customers investing for cost, investing for reliability, and we continue to see both an element of growth both for us in North America and international. You're going to have variation here, as John described, quarter-to-quarter, but we're continuing to look at profitable growth as we go in '24, and most importantly, I think we've got a stronger element of international here that really provides us visibility now into '25, '26, and '27. Thank you. Hi, Jerry. Yes. So, Jerry, last November, CARB petitioned the EPA for a waiver and supports for regulation for in-use locomotives. EPA has not responded to California's waiver request, and the ruling became effective beginning of this year. In one hand, I'd say the outcome of the rule remains fluid, but we are technically very well-positioned to support our customers here for all outcomes. We have the best-in-class products, lowest fuel consumption, lowest emission, best reliability, best availability, and regardless of further regulation what I'll tell you the good news is, our entire installed base will be able to burn bio and renewable fuels. But what's more exciting to me is, our newer fleets, they will ultimately go beyond bio and renewable fuel. We firmly believe we can bridge customers here to their ultimate near-zero emission goals. We are aggressively testing alternative fuels, hydrogen being part of that mix in our newer internal combustion engines, and with really an eye towards enabling customer sustainability journey, and in parallel, we're integrating batteries, and ultimately hybrid systems into our fleet. So, we have not incorporated regulatory change into our guidance. So, that would be a tailwind for us. Hey, Rob. Our customers invest for returns at the end of the day. So, it's just really comes down to making sure as they look into their fleets, they've got really the opportunity here to continue to drive costs down, to drive reliability up, and improve service levels, and I think that continues. When I look at that investment, of course, we're coming from trough levels here in the past. We have growth coming into '23. We have still significant growth in '24, and the recent order that you just referred to, it just gives us greater visibility into really continue to grow market. I think we still have, I think, an opportunity to grow here as we get closer here to what I'll call average replacement rates with really the older fleets we've had. I think some of the elements on what customers decide to invest in could be shaped here certainly by regulation, but most importantly, I think, it's going to get shaped by some of the elements of technology that we're introducing, that allows faster payback, a greater payback, and greater flexibility to really, I'll call, ultimately bridge customers here into a lower emissions environment, and that's how we look at it. Good morning, Scott. So, strong growth here going to '24, and, Scott, with greater visibility ahead. On your question on battery electric, we're continuing to make progress here. In the fourth quarter, as you know, we unveiled the first heavy-haul battery electric locomotive with over 7 megawatts of power. These units will start running this year in Australia. And on that, I think fuel continues to be a one of the biggest cost for customers. There's a continued focus here on driving efficiency. We've got a number of pilots and demo projects, and while we do not expect broad adoption of these, there's going to be some really key opportunities here that we're ready to work on and support customers on. Thank you. Good morning, Allison. Yes. So number one, I think during the quarter, I think in one side, while we saw higher demand from international, when you think about PTC, on-board locomotive, digital mine, we saw really a softer demand here, which is continuing with US, driven by really discretionary OpEx and the commuter signaling business. What I'd say is the pipeline of opportunities remains strong, driven primarily by international and also by digital mining solutions. I'd say recurring revenues in short-term convertibility continues to be a focus area for the group. But I think what's more exciting here, something we announced in the fourth quarter, which is really tied to us entering the railcar telematics market. We are creating a platform here with proven technology, and this is a market of 1.6 million freight cars. It is a multi-billion dollar opportunity for us, one that we will be providing real-time data to railcar, and tank car owners. And we're -- opportunities like this will keep propelling growth and profitable growth for this business. Thank you. Yeah. When you think of revenue side, I think you heard me describing stronger international pipeline, which I think, ultimately, wants to reflect stronger growth internationally as we look especially beyond '24 in that regard. So, we see a strong pipeline of deals, some of them signed last year. We'll see a part of those converting into backlog this year, which will continue to signal really the strength that we've got longer term in the business. I think with regards to specific margins, I mean, this is really project-by-project driven, as John described. I think there is an element of still headwinds just associated with pace in which we grow both the new locomotive business, but also the mods business at a rate -- at a growth rate faster than the overall company. So, a couple of things. I mean, we will have variation here to quarter-to-quarter. Just reflecting last four quarters, I mean, we have quarters on low-single digits, we have quarters on double digits. And I think you're going to see some of that variation. How we run the business is making sure that we've got that convertibility built out 12 months out, 18 months out, and we got to really think about the lead times we've got associated with our products. So, it's making sure that we have that coverage. If you think in specific about '24, I think, there's some elements of coverage, especially for the flow products that really need to -- really be executed through the year. And if you keep in mind, you've got things like the freight car build, which is down. So, you do have some elements here that play out through the year. But bottom line is, we feel strong about both the coverage, and about the ability here to continue to drive profitable growth with the pipeline we have. Thank you. So, what we described was carloads being, I'll call it, to some extent muted for the year. That has, of course, been included into our guidance. What I think you have that more than offsets this is the continued opportunity here for customers to really invest for returns, it's really by driving productivity, lowering costs, replacing, in some cases, three units for two units, and I think those dynamics remain in place and remain in place not just for '24 as you see reflected here by the orders that we just got. We think, at least from a fleet perspective and parkings, service levels have really -- the focus on service levels has really kept the active fleets relatively stable, and we would expect us to continue to be -- have a favorable market dynamics for North America included. We have significant growth in '24, we have significant growth in '25, and we have an opportunity here to utilize that installed -- that manufacturing footprint to export outside of Kazakhstan, and I think that's a significant element here. On the top of this, just had some really strong returns for us. Steve, it's, I think, a challenge here. Might have, again, variation as we go through it, but they're strong. They're strong, both strong, and a lot of it really internationally driven and beyond '24. We won't get into the specifics or guiding for Transit or for Freight. What I'll tell you, on Transit, the fundamentals for the business continue to be strong, book-to-bill ratio closed over 1 for the year. While we are pleased with the progress, we continue to do significant work here to simplify the footprint. This business will deliver on margin expansion in '24. Integration 2.0 is a significant contributor to that. But we will continue to have variation quarter-to-quarter, driven by really mix and timing of project. Thank you."

I would like to turn the conference over to Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Wabtec\u2019s Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, John Olin; and Senior Vice President of Finance, John Mastalerz. Today\u2019s slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures were posted to our website earlier today and can be accessed on our Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Some statements we\u2019re making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions related to our forward-looking statements, please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. I will now turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s move to Slide four. I\u2019ll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter, the progress against our long-term value creation framework, and then John will cover the financials. We delivered another strong quarter, evidenced by robust sales growth, margin expansion and increased earnings and cash flow. We achieved these despite increased volatility and uncertainty in the economy. Sales were $2.5 billion, which was up 22.5% versus prior year. Revenue was driven by strong performance from both the Freight and Transit segments. Total cash flow from operations was $425 million. Cash conversion [Ph] was driven by higher earnings and improved inventory management. Overall, our financial position remained strong. We continued to execute against our capital allocation framework to maximize shareholder value by investing for the future growth, and returning cash to shareholders. The 12-month backlog was over $7 billion, up 13%, signifying continued momentum and visibility across the business into 2024. Total multiyear backlog was $21.5 billion. Overall, the Wabtec team delivered a strong quarter, behind solid execution. Looking ahead, I\u2019m encouraged by both the underlying momentum across the business and the team\u2019s unrelenting focus on delivering for our customers and even against the more uncertain and volatile macro environment we believe Wabtec is well-positioned to drive profitable growth ahead. Shifting our focus to Slide five. Let\u2019s talk about our 2023 end market expectations in more detail. While key metrics across our Freight business remain mixed, we continue to be encouraged by our business momentum, activity in international markets and our robust pipeline of opportunities across geographies. North America carloads continue to be down in the quarter which resulted in locomotive parkings up slightly from last quarter\u2019s levels. Yet we continue to see significant opportunities across the globe in demand for new locomotives, modernizations and digital solutions as our customers invest in solutions that continue to drive reliability, productivity, safety and fuel efficiency. Looking at the North American railcar builds demand for railcar continues to show growth. The industry outlook for 2023 is for about 45,000 cars to be delivered. Internationally, activity is strong across core markets, such as Latin America, Australia, South Africa and Kazakhstan, significant investments to expand and upgrade infrastructure are supporting a substantial international order pipeline. In mining, commodity prices are supporting activity to refresh and upgrade the truck fleet. Finally, moving to the Transit sector, the mega trends of modernization [Ph] and decarbonisation remain in place, driving the need for clean, safe and efficient transportation solutions around the globe. Next, let\u2019s turn to Slide six to discuss a few recent business highlights. During the quarter, we signed a strategic MOU with KTZ, the national railway company in Kazakhstan, for over $2 billion. This agreement will support significant freight growth through the state-of-the-art equipment and technologies, driving productivity and lowering operating costs. This framework includes locomotives to be delivered in 2024, a long-term supply agreement, and a collaboration on a number of digital technologies, all of which we expect to drive strong orders and sales growth in 2024. Speaking of our business in Kazakhstan, the team just achieved a significant milestone by delivering its 500th locomotive. Looking at our mining business, the team signed orders totaling over $150 million, which is up double digits versus last year. And early in the fourth quarter, our team in Latin America won an order for 22 additional locomotives to be delivered in 2024. In North America, we won an order in New York City Transit to supply components for an additional 640 subway cars. Also, late last quarter, we closed the L&M acquisition that expanded our heat transfer portfolio in mining. This is off to a great start. The integration is on track. Third quarter revenue is ahead of plan, taking advantage of a strong mining market globally. I\u2019d also highlight Nordco, which we acquired back in 2021. Our maintenance of way business continues to be ahead of plan and is experiencing double-digit growth in 2023. All of this demonstrates the continued momentum across the business, the team\u2019s relentless focus on driving for our customers and the strong pipeline of opportunities we\u2019re executing on. Wabtec\u2019s well-positioned to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that addresses our customers\u2019 most pressing needs. Turning to slide seven, I\u2019d like to discuss in more detail our international markets. While North America provides us a solid foundation to refresh and renew install base, we also have a significant opportunity for growth across international fleets by leveraging our broad portfolio and superior technologies. We have been successful in expanding our international install base over time, which has grown at roughly 4.5% annually for the last six years. Looking ahead, the pipeline of opportunities in our international markets continues to strengthen, and as a result, we expect continued expansion in our install base. Increasing freight volumes from mining, agriculture, and intermodal continue to drive the need for increased investment in clean, efficient, and safe modes of transportation. We expect growth in 2024 from key regions like Latin America, CIS, Australia, and South Africa, driven by our regional footprints and local partnerships. Our technologies are delivering more fuel-efficient, reliable solutions, which will reduce operational costs for our customers around the world. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results, and our overall financial performance. John?\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Rafael, and hello everyone. Turning to slide eight, I will view our third quarter results in more detail. We delivered another good quarter of operational and financial performance from strong underlying momentum across the business, coupled with great execution from the team. Sales for the third quarter were $2.55 billion, which reflects a 22.5% increase from the prior year. Sales were driven by strong growth across both the freight and transit segments. For the quarter, GAAP operating income was $370 million, driven by higher sales and focused cost management. Adjusted operating margin in Q3 was 17.9%, up 1.5 percentage points versus the prior year. The increase during the quarter was driven by significantly higher sales, improved productivity and cost management, partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies driven by the strike at our Erie facility. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.33, which was up 51.1% versus the third quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pre-tax charges of $13 million for restructuring, which was primarily related to our integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec\u2019s operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.70, up 39.3% versus prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another strong quarter. We outperformed our expectations, demonstrating the underlying strength and momentum of the business, and as a result, we are fine tuning our full year outlook by increasing our sales and adjusted earnings guidance. Now, turning to slide nine, let\u2019s review our product line in more detail. Third quarter consolidated sales were very strong, up 22.5%. Equipment sales were up 38.8% from last year due to higher locomotive sales, which, as planned, were significantly skewed to Q3 versus Q4, along with increased demand for mining products this quarter. Component sales were up 32.3% versus last year, largely driven by higher North American OE rail car build and market share gains in freight car product sales, along with increased demand for industrial products. Sales also benefited from the strategic acquisition of L&M late in the second quarter by $42 million. Digital intelligence sales were down 3.2% from last year, which was driven by a softness in our North American signaling business, partially offset by higher demand for international PTC, next-gen on-board locomotive products, and digital mining. Our services sales grew 17.6%. Sales growth was driven by higher modernization deliveries and increased parts sales. Our customers continue to recognize the superior performance, reliability, efficiency, and availability across their Wabtec locomotive fleets. Across our transit segment, OE and aftermarket sales significantly increased versus last year. Segment sales were up 20.0% to $660 million, behind execution of our growing backlog, easing of supply chain disruptions, and comparing against the cyber impact in Q3 2022. The momentum in this segment is strong across our core markets as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonization accelerate the need for investments in sustainable infrastructure. Moving to slide 10, GAAP gross margin was 31.0%, which was down 0.1 percentage points from Q3 last year, while adjusted gross profit margin was up 0.1 percentage points, driven by higher sales and improved productivity, partially offset by inefficiencies related to the strike in Erie. Mix was favorable, driven by a richer mix between and within segments. Raw material costs, while still elevated, were largely flat on a year-over-year basis. Foreign currency exchange was favorable to sales by $32 million, or 1.5 percentage points, and it improved our third quarter gross profits by $7 million. Finally, manufacturing costs were positively impacted by favorable fixed cost absorption and benefits of integration 2.0, more than offset by manufacturing inefficiencies, primarily at our Erie facility. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of continued cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lean initiatives. Turning to slide 11, for the third quarter, GAAP operating margin was 14.5%, which was up 2.0 percentage points versus last year, while adjusted operating margin improved 1.5 percentage points to 17.9%. GAAP and adjusted SG&A were $295 million. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was 11.6%, down 0.7 percentage points versus the prior year, as we leveraged higher sales and strong focus on managing costs. Engineering expense was $53 million, about flat with Q3 last year. We continue to invest engineering resources in current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers\u2019 productivity, capacity utilization, and safety. Now let\u2019s take a look at segment results on slide 12, starting with the freight segment. As I already discussed, freight segment sales were very strong for the quarter, up 23.4%. GAAP segment operating income was $327 million for an operating margin of 17.3%, up 2.1 percentage points versus last year. Adjusted operating income for the freight segment was $399 million, up 30.0% versus prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the freight segment was up 1.3 percentage points from prior year at 21.2%. The increase was driven by significantly higher sales, including fixed cost absorption and lower SG&A as a percentage of revenue, and improved mix, somewhat offset by manufacturing inefficiencies driven by the strike at Erie. Finally, segment multiyear backlog was $17.61 billion, down 8.1% from the end of Q3 last year. We continue to compare against the multiyear modernization and locomotive orders, totaling over 1.5 billion that we received in 2022. The 12-month backlog was $5.28 billion, up 15.7% for the same period, and shows good momentum well into 2024. Turning to slide 13, transit segment sales were up 20.0% to $660 million. When adjusting for foreign currency, transit sales were up 14.5%. GAAP operating income was $68 million, up 28.3%. Restructuring costs related to integration 2.0 activities were $10 million in Q3. Adjusted segment operating income was $83 million, which was up 38.3%. Adjusted operating income increased as a result of higher sales, favorable mix, benefits from our integration 2.0 activities, and the cyber impact in Q3 2022. This resulted in adjusted operating margin of 12.5%, up 1.5 percentage points from last year. Finally, transit segment multiyear backlog for the quarter was $3.87 billion, up 12.6% versus a year ago. Now let\u2019s turn to our financial position on slide 14. Q3 cash from operations was $425 million versus $204 million in the prior year. Cash flow benefited from higher earnings and improved inventory management. Our debt leverage ratio was 2.1 times at the end of the third quarter, which was favorable versus prior year. And finally, we\u2019ve returned $344 million of capital back to shareholders year-to-date through share repurchase and dividends. During the third quarter, we utilized free cash flow to pay down debt and reduce leverage after the $229 million acquisition of L&M in the second quarter of 2023. As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong, and we continue to allocate capital in a balanced strategy to maximize shareholder returns. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, John. Let\u2019s flip to slide 15 to discuss our updated 2023 financial guidance. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and solutions continues. Our orders pipeline and 12-month backlog continue to be strong, providing solid visibility for profitable growth ahead. The team is committed to driving top-line growth and adjusted margin expansion in 2023 despite a challenging macro environment. With these factors in mind, we are increasing our previous guidance. We now expect 2023 sales of $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion, up nearly 15% from last year at the midpoint, and adjusted EPS to be between $5.80 and $6 per share, up about 21.5% at the midpoint. We continue to expect cash flow conversion to be greater than 90%. Looking ahead, while the macro environment has become more uncertain over the last quarter, I\u2019m confident that Wabtec is well-positioned to drive profitable growth in 2024, which is aligned to our long-term financial framework. Now let\u2019s wrap up on slide 16. As you heard today, our team delivered on another strong quarter. Even in a dynamic environment, we are committed to delivering on our value creation framework through the strength of our portfolio, resilient installed base, innovative solutions and a rigorous focus on execution. Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable long-term growth and maximize shareholder returns. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine?\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions. But before we do and out of consideration for others on the call, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Justin Long of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJustin Long: Thanks, good morning and congrats on the quarter.\nJohn Olin: Good morning, Justin.\nJustin Long: So maybe to start, I was wondering if you could quantify the strike impact at Erie in the quarter. And thinking about the guidance the full year outlook was raised, but it implies a sequential step down in earnings as we move into the fourth quarter. So John, can you give a little bit more color on some of the key drivers to that sequential pressure?\nJohn Olin: Sure. So number one, on the Erie, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased that we came to a successful agreement with the union during the quarter. Well, Justin, we don\u2019t provide line item details of our cost of goods sold. It is important to understand that our cost of the strike -- to understand the cost of the strike, it\u2019s important to know that the plant never closed during the strike and hence, some of our strong volume performance in the quarter. But it did operate at less than normal efficiency given the reduced workforce that it was operating under. So overall, it was a little bit of a drag on the quarter in terms of earnings. But certainly, we took it in stride and delivered a great quarter despite that. The second question you have, Justin, with regards to the implied fourth quarter growth, I guess. As first, I\u2019d start by saying that we\u2019re very pleased with how the back half is unfolding. Certainly favorable to our expectations that we had shared with the group and on the Q2 earnings call. And overall, we\u2019ve increased the revenue guidance by 2.5% at the midpoint and 4.5% for EPS. And with that, it kind of pushes out and implied fourth quarter guidance, and that is that we expect revenue to grow roughly at 6% midpoint. And again, this is despite last year\u2019s tough comps of over 11% growth and likewise, expect very strong margin increase in Q4, driven by EPS up roughly 17% at the midpoint. So when we look at the second half and how it\u2019s unfolding, it\u2019s just as we discussed last quarter, Justin, with the third quarter revenue growing considerably faster than the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s driven by the fact that the production plan for the second half is significantly skewed to the third quarter. In fact, Justin, when you look at it, roughly 70% of our second half locomotive deliveries will be delivered in the third quarter, and that\u2019s strictly to meet the customer expectations. So those schedules were built over a year ago. So consequently, our Q4 underlying growth remains very strong and is evidenced by our strengthening -- which is evidenced by the strengthening 12-month backlog, which was up 13% versus prior year. And like Rafael said in the prepared comments, we expect to see profitable growth as we transition into 2024.\nJustin Long: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And secondly, I wanted to ask about the backlog. So we did see a sequential moderation. I know timing, particularly with some of the multiyear orders can move things around. So I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve seen any slowdown in inquiry levels or the pipeline or if you would just chalk this up to timing. And on the Kazakhstan, $2 billion MOU. Could you just confirm that\u2019s not included in the backlog?\nRafael Santana: I\u2019ll take that one, Justin. So first, no, it\u2019s not in the backlog of orders, but talking about backlog, the backlog is healthy. It will be down year-over-year, but you got to look at it in conjunction with the multi-billion orders that we signed last year, which don\u2019t repeat every year. The outer side of it, we have a number of multi-billion dollar opportunities that being worth. And we just signed a large one, which is in the pipeline and will convert into orders. So we see good momentum here. We don\u2019t see slow down. We are progressing. We\u2019re continuing to grow, and our pipeline supports it last quarter, as John said, 12 months last quarter was up 10%, this quarter, third quarter was up 13%. So we\u2019re continuing to drive momentum here with key deals being signed and if you think especially about the long lead items in our portfolio like mods and your locomotives, you need that backlog to be there and as we look into 2024 and beyond.\nJustin Long: Okay, thanks for the time.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi good morning everyone.\nJohn Olin: Jerry good morning.\nJerry Revich: Rafael, John, I wonder if could just piece together a few of the comments that you made, it sounds like a pretty healthy order opportunity backdrop, U.S. railcar orders are constructive as well. So as we think about your 5-year outlook, it sounds like 2024 might be better organic growth revenue opportunity than a 5-year outlook that you provided, just putting the pieces together. And I\u2019m wondering if you can confirm that, that\u2019s how it\u2019s tracking. And if you could touch on the level of margin improvement you can deliver, if it does indeed play out that way relative to the margin improvement CAGR that you\u2019ve laid out on a 5-year basis? Thank you.\nRafael Santana: So Jerry, I mean, as you see, finished the strong quarter, strong pipeline of opportunities which, I\u2019d say, have just strengthened really the visibility that we have to continue to drive revenue and margin expansion. It\u2019s for sure a bit early to get into the specifics of 2024 guidance. But the momentum we\u2019ll continue to see, in my mind, with results being driven by -- first, I\u2019ll start with the strength of the short and mid-term backlog. The 12-month backlog that we spoke about at $7.1 billion, up double digits. Second piece, we continue to see momentum on both new locomotives and mods. Our customers, we\u2019re continuing to invest for improved costs. So this is bringing a modernization in so they can part to order units. They\u2019re investing for reliability. We\u2019re still coming out of the trough there. If you think about the lead times, as I mentioned here before, we need a strong backlog here as some of the lead times here with the mods and new units is longer, and you need the backlog, and we have it for the next 12 and 24 months. The other piece for me is international. We\u2019re very bullish on key international markets. We have the momentum there. You saw in Kazakhstan, but what if I think about Brazil, South Africa and Australia, they\u2019re all driving significant momentum going to 2024. On the margin side, the business will benefit and further benefit from Integration 2.0. So we\u2019ll continue to drive expansion here as well. So all in all, the pipeline of opportunities, we continue to get better visibility. In fact, this is the best, I\u2019ll call, we\u2019ve had stepping into a year, which strengthens our position here to deliver on profitable growth.\nJerry Revich: Super. Really appreciate the comprehensive discussion. And can I ask on Transit. We\u2019ve got a couple of orders of a really good margin performance there. Has that business, in your mind, earned the right to grow off of these levels? I know you\u2019re waiting until you felt really good about the sustainable margin performance? Are we at a point where we can think about that part of the platform top line accelerating given the improved execution over the past year plus?\nRafael Santana: Jerry, we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re seeing there. We\u2019re continuing significant work to simplify the footprint and further improve the business competitiveness. I think you\u2019re going to continue to see some variation quarter-to-quarter, but that team is committed to continue to expand margins and take action here for profitable growth. Despite of the more, I\u2019ll call competitive environment, the fundamentals are good in the business. If you think about our book-to-bill ratio, we\u2019ll close above 1 for the year. 12-month backlog is up. Multiyear backlog is up 16%, the other one, I think 12 -- over 12% and the team is continuing to progress to really drive mid-teen margins. So yes, we expect the business to be more competitive in the marketplace there, and we\u2019re saying no slowdown. In fact, we see the opportunity here to continue to grow with the business. If you think about the record backlog some of our customers had, we\u2019re continuing to see momentum there.\nJerry Revich: Appreciate the discussion, thanks.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hello, Ken your line is open.\nNathan Ho: Hi, sorry. This is Nathan Ho dialing in for Ken Hoexter. Congratulations to the team on the solid results. John, I think you commented earlier that mix was favorable to Freight gross margins. And I\u2019m just looking through some of the segments. It looks like Equipment is up 40%, Components up 30%, yet Services and Digital are a little bit. I mean, Service is up 18% and Digital is down 30%. I understand the team doesn\u2019t usually comment on segment level of margins. But could you maybe just talk a little bit more about the comment there and maybe some of the pricing and mix dynamics at play?\nJohn Olin: Yes, Nathan. So number one, what you pointed out, what we said may be a little bit counterintuitive, right? But if you take it back to the discussion that we\u2019ve been having for the last four quarters, when we really started to step up a lot of the locomotive deliveries internationally, that put a fair amount of overall mix pressure on us, again, starting in the third quarter of 2022 and really going through the last four quarters. So as we move out of the fourth quarter of 2023, we are stepping in from a freight perspective into higher-margin deliveries. And that\u2019s shining through even though given the fact that overall equipment is at a lower margin than digital, we are still seeing, in aggregate, a fair amount of mix favourability. The other piece of it is not only mix within the various groups, but also the mix between groups, right? When you look at the Freight growing at 23.4% and currency adjusted Transit at 14.5% that provides a fair amount of mixed tailwinds as well.\nNathan Ho: Perfect, thank you. And as my follow-up, I just wanted to maybe continue on the prior trend of thought on the backlog. I noticed just on the Freight side, it seems like this is the fifth quarter of sequential declines. I think just comping the multiyear backlog, this quarter versus 2Q were down $722 million. How should we read this? Is this a -- is this any commentary on unit volumes or maybe something regarding pricing or mix? Any thoughts there would be helpful.\nRafael Santana: I think you\u2019ve got to keep in mind, first, the lumpiness of the multiyear orders that we get. And you\u2019re going to see that lumpiness not just playing out through the quarters, that lumpiness will play out in the years as well. As we mentioned, we expect the backlog to be down this year, year-over-year. But the other side of it is the multibillion-dollar orders that we\u2019re working on, which are not in our backlog, and we expect that to convert. So I really look at us in terms of the lumpiness of the orders. The other piece you\u2019ve got to be very focused on is when you think about the lead times on certain of your products, making sure that you have the coverage to work through it, and that\u2019s why I highlighted both modernizations and new locomotives, so if you think about the lead times on those, you need a strong coverage, and we have it. We have it if we think about 2024, we have it beyond 2024.\nNathan Ho: Perfect. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nIvan Yi: Good morning. This is Ivan Yi on for Scott Group. My first question, you\u2019re showing very strong EPS growth this year. What are the puts and takes to another year of double-digit EPS growth next year? Can you kind of walk through the moving parts there? Thank you.\nJohn Olin: I think Ivan, it\u2019s very much similar to what we experienced this year is one, volume growth does wonders for expanding margins, right driving incremental growth. We\u2019ve talked about our incremental growth is about 25% to 30%. So with that incremental volume, which we would expect revenue growth in 2024, we will build EPS growth in addition to that. The other is, as Rafael had mentioned, Integration 2.0. So that was a 3-year investment, and we\u2019re just starting to get to the kind of the ramp on the savings plan. And we\u2019re seeing that ramp up in the first 3 quarters of this year, but expect the largest growth in terms of savings due to that program in 2024. So that, again, will drive margins a little bit faster than revenue. But overall, as we sit today and look forward to 2024, we expect that profitable growth that Rafael spoke to. And with that, we expect to be overall in line with our long-term objectives and our long-term guidance.\nRafael Santana: I\u2019ll reinforce two other points, which is just an element of international markets. I spoke here specifically about Brazil, South Africa, Kazakhstan and Australia, which are very significant, and we have significant momentum walking into 2024 with this market. So we do expect significant growth there from a sales perspective. And the other piece is, again, the coverage as we look into stepping into 2024, which is certainly one of the strongest coverages we\u2019ve had stepping into any given year.\nIvan Yi: Thank you. And then just a follow on, again, on the backlog. The one-year backlog is up nicely year-over-year, but the multiyear backlog, of course, is down. Can you just kind of go through that divergence? Why is that happening? And which one of those metrics is the better one to focus on, the one year or the multi-year? Thank you.\nJohn Olin: I got -- first, go back to the things I\u2019ve highlighted here. You\u2019ve got to make sure you have the coverage, especially on the long lead items. Otherwise, you\u2019re getting an order here a new locomotive at this point and you don\u2019t have the coverage for 2024, there\u2019s not much you can do there. So having the coverage for that long lead items is important, and we have it. The second piece I talked about is the fact our fleets internationally continue to grow out. So we\u2019re seeing good momentum there, not just from a CapEx but from also an OpEx perspective. So that\u2019s very positive. And in North America, discussion continues despite of, I\u2019d say, continued to grow parking levels. Customers are investing for really lower costs for improved efficiency, for improved reliability. So all in all, when we think about the momentum here, looking at North America and internationally, CapEx and OpEx, it continues to look into profitable growth going to 2024, very much aligned to the long-term guidance we\u2019ve provided.\nIvan Yi: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt Elkott of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Elkott: Good morning. Thank you. If we take the guidance raise and the sequential moderation in the 12-month backlog together, is it because you have some deliveries that were scheduled for next year and were pulled forward to this year?\nJohn Olin: No, no. Not at all, Matt. when we look at it, we\u2019ve been talking about the year a lot in first half, second half. And at the beginning of the year, we said that first half would grow a little bit faster than the second half. And I think the way to look at between our third and fourth quarter is to look at them together, and we\u2019re seeing what you would see on the implied growth is 14% growth in the back half versus 16% growth in the first half. And again, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve expected. But it\u2019s really a function of the way the production plan was set up over a year ago in terms of the deliveries that we expected to make in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter on some of our larger equipment, in particular, on locomotives. And as I had mentioned that about 70% of the second half production plan for locomotives is delivered in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter. So overall, when you even those out, we\u2019ve had a year very much in terms of overall cadence expectations, of course, at a higher level of revenue growth, which explains the raise in the second and the third quarter. But the fourth quarter underlying momentum is just as strong as the third quarter. And we feel good as going into the 2024 with the backlog growing as Rafael had mentioned, has actually sequentially grown for the last couple of quarters. And as we exit the third quarter, it\u2019s up 13%.\nMatthew Elkott: No, that\u2019s very helpful to know. And just one -- my follow-up question, John. Can you talk a bit about the -- a bit more about that $2 billion Kazakhstan MOU? How much of it do you think could materialize in orders in 2024? And how much could materialize in deliveries in 2024?\nJohn Olin: We\u2019re not going to break out the timing of it, but we would expect all $2 billion of it to turn into orders. We\u2019ve got a great customer in Kazakhstan and they\u2019ve got a tremendous growth opportunity, given some of the dynamics of the flow of products from China to Europe. And we\u2019re certainly working with them to upgrade their fleet and expand their fleet so that they can manage their future.\nRafael Santana: I would add the following. We expect a large part of that to convert. And as I said, about some international markets, we\u2019re increasing deliveries in Kazakhstan, and it\u2019s strong growth going to 2024.\nMatthew Elkott: Perfect. Thanks Rafael, thanks John. Appreciate it.\nRafael Santana: Thank you Matt.\nOperator: The next question is from Saree Boroditsky of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks, good morning. So kind of building on your comments, I think you mentioned the largest savings from integration 2.0 into next year. Could you just provide an update on the progress you\u2019re seeing there? How is it going versus expectations? And any way to quantify the margin benefit into 2024? Thanks.\nJohn Olin: Yes. Saree. So if you recall that Integration 2.0 was a 3-year program that started at the beginning of 2022. And on any of these type of restructuring programs or opportunities to integrate, we\u2019ll see a higher investment profile in the beginning and a higher savings profile in the back as we get the projects often executed. So to date, we\u2019ve invested about $100 million out of an expected $135 million to $165 million over the next -- or over that 3-year period of time. And Saree, what we\u2019re seeing now is just as those projects start and either the facilities are being consolidated or products being moved or however, we\u2019re looking at optimization, those savings are starting to build. And at the end of 2022, we had about ongoing savings of about $5 million and that continues to escalate, and we look for that to build up to $75 million to $95 million. So we won\u2019t quantify it, but you can start to see the momentum that we need to have to be at a run rate of $75 million to $95 million in 2025.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great. And then maybe this is kind of partially related, but Transit margins came in pretty strong, despite what typically would be a weaker seasonal quarter. So what kind of drove that margin improvement there? And how does this set you up as we look into 2024?\nJohn Olin: Yes, we\u2019re very pleased with the Transit margin. It was up 1.5 percentage points driven by a couple of things, Saree. Number one, is certainly fixed cost absorption was favorable given the volume growth ex currency of 14.5%. The other area is product mix. Product mix was favorable in Transit. And if you look at the aftermarket grew a fair amount faster than OE. And also, when we talk about Integration 2.0, a fair amount of that hits our Transit business, right? So that\u2019s helping driving it. And also we\u2019re lapping some of the inefficiencies that we had in cyber in the year ago quarter. So I feel very good about the transit business, as Rafael had mentioned and certainly a bright future as we continue to move that business forward.\nSaree Boroditsky: Okay, thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey good morning guys. It\u2019s Rob [Ph] on for Chris this morning. Could you give us an update in terms of your delivery timing expectations for next year, like as of right now, the orders more kind of first half or second half loaded? Or do you not yet have line of sight on that one?\nJohn Olin: Yes. Rob, it\u2019s a little bit early for us to start talking about gating. It\u2019s early for us to talk about guidance as well. So a typical cadence would be to provide guidance in the call in February after the year is done. And again, just broadly, we\u2019re looking at certainly profitable growth in 2024, but in another quarter\u2019s time, we\u2019ll have certainly more detail with regards to what that is and what\u2019s driving it.\nUnidentified Analyst: That\u2019s helpful. And this might be a little bit too early as well. If we\u2019re looking at the 12-month backlog, how does that mix compare to the mix today? Do you have a sense -- is it better? Is it worse? We\u2019re just kind of thinking about some of the puts and takes for next year?\nRafael Santana: I think more in terms of the coverage looking ahead, right? And my comments on the strong coverage that it provides a piece of it has really to be connected with long lead parts of our portfolio. And that\u2019s where I think about new locomotives, and I think about mods and I think it in conjunction of both international markets and North America. And that\u2019s probably the strongest -- certainly the strongest we\u2019ve had to walk into any year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Appreciate the color. Thanks Raf.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Wertheimer: Thank you. I just had two quick follow-ups. John, I think you\u2019ve been pretty clear on the gross margin and some of the puts and takes. I wondered though, I mean, can you give any comment on just what normal gross margin leverage should be absent the strike or whatever and whether next year has any incremental labor pressure that would keep gross margin from rising. I mean, a great fixed cost leverage across the enterprise, don\u2019t going to be wrong, but more on the SG&A line. So just any comments on that would be helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Olin: Yes. I think from a gross margin standpoint, what you\u2019re seeing on a year-to-date basis is certainly a drag from the strike in Erie but also that mix that we talked about, right? We had mix headwinds in the first half, and that had an impact on gross margin. So this quarter, gross margin was flat, again affected by the strike at Erie, but a lot of benefits as we move forward. And when we look at Integration 2.0, that directly fits into the gross margin, and we would expect a tailwind on margins because of that. And then also the biggest driver of margin is volume, right, and leveraging the fixed cost structure of the business. And that\u2019s not only fixed manufacturing costs, but also the fixed portion of SG&A. So as we grow, we expect to continue to aggressively manage our cost structure and making sure that we do deliver those incremental volumes, which, again, we would expect to be in the 25% to 30% range.\nRobert Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you. And then one last one to close out mining really strong, I think, particularly for some of your customers. Any sign that that has peaked out? Are we still early in that cycle? Just any commentary there and then I will stop.\nJohn Olin: So we didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think we caught the first part of the question.\nRobert Wertheimer: Beg pardon. Mining is quite strong, especially I think, for some of your customers. I\u2019m just curious if that strength continue or whether you\u2019re seeing any signs that could plateau?\nRafael Santana: It continues. Mining is very strong right now and all the indications we\u2019ve got is of that momentum continuing into next year as well. So that\u2019s certainly are not one of the positive momentum that we see on the business.\nRobert Wertheimer: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Barger of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSteve Barger: Hey, thanks good morning. Rafael. Backlog has been stable at around $22 billion for the 5 years post the GE deal. Do you think of that as a natural run rate, meaning if things go to plan, it will be around the same 5 years from now? Or the way it\u2019s structured does monetization speed up at some point, meaning revenue accelerates but backlog contracts. How do you think about that long-term?\nRafael Santana: Rob, I\u2019m not going to give you like specific numbers you\u2019re thinking 5 years from now. I just think -- I\u2019ll tell you how we\u2019re running the business, right? There is really a strong focus on making sure that we\u2019ve got the coverage as we look ahead, and that coverage supports what I\u2019ll call profitable growth for the business. That\u2019s where a big piece of focus has been. In the past, if you go back, there\u2019s maybe a lot of focus, especially on multiservice agreements that covered fleets for a long period of time. We\u2019ve managed that in mix with long-term parts agreements. In some cases, we might take a different approach depending on what the fleets are with the customers. So all in all, I think those are levers that we got to be managing and really thinking more about the value that we\u2019re delivering, especially as we introduce more opportunities to improve fleets. A lot of the upgrades that we talk about in terms of fuel efficiency and things like that. We want to make sure we\u2019re driving value for both our customers and ourselves through that process. But all in all, I mean, we expect to continue to drive that momentum forward with profitable growth. Does that help?\nSteve Barger: Yes, I think so. If I can just boil that down, it sounds like you do expect when you look at your pipeline and how you try to manage the business that you\u2019ll have 2x the forward years revenue in backlog for the foreseeable future? Is that fair?\nJohn Olin: I don\u2019t think we can -- we would put an index on it. Just looking at the backlog over the last 5 years, we\u2019ve seen it oscillate between 21.5 and 22.5 I think parts of it are the economy that goes into that. And when we have periods of big orders, we see it rise and then that kind of burns off. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing in 2022 to 2023, right? We saw it rise about $1 billion in 2022. And as we work that off, we\u2019re lapping those numbers and backlogs down 4% or 5%. So I think over a long period of time, we would expect it to rise, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a formula you can put on it. We keep coming back to this word lumpy, is that -- it is very lumpy depending on what multi-years. I think the best way to remove the lumpiness is to look at the 12 months, right? So we don\u2019t -- we kind of neutralize for that, and the 12 month has been very steady and growing up on the three quarters this year and has been gaining momentum.\nRafael Santana: This is a business that go before the transactional was done. There was a lot of, I\u2019ll call, ups and downs through the cycle. I think one of the things that the team has been very purposeful on is making sure we are working with customers to drive what I\u2019ll call sustainable investments moving forward, which plays well for the entire ecosystem. It\u2019s an element of making sure that we\u2019re ultimately getting to the right quality, the right value for the products ultimately to better costs as we run some of these programs. And that\u2019s been a huge part of the focus. If you think about the focus on 12-month backlog 18, 24, that\u2019s a significant part of it. And the longer-term agreements will play them to make sure that we\u2019ve got the continuation of a lot of the infrastructure that we\u2019ve got out there that supports the delivery of some of these assets for customers around the world.\nSteve Barger: Yes. That\u2019s good color. And the only comment I\u2019ll make is mid-single-digit percentage variance around a $21 billion 5-year average is not that lumpy. I think a lot of companies would love to have that. As my follow-up, John, I know you don\u2019t want to get into specific line items around the strike, but this was a record quarter for Freight revenue and the best segment margin since 2019. Can you tell us what revenue and margin could have been? And is it fair to say this quarter will not be a high watermark as we think about Freight in 2024?\nJohn Olin: Well, we expect to continue to grow this company in 2024, 2025 and 2026, Steve, and well beyond that. No, I can\u2019t pull out what it would look like without. All I can say is it was a tremendous effort on the part of the overall company to be able to deliver that revenue growth and again, I talked about the locomotive piece, right, and that shift. We delivered all the locomotives in the second quarter that we were intending to deliver with the 10-week strike at our largest plant that makes locomotives. So it\u2019s a tremendous tribute to the team and how the whole company pulled together to continue to work through the strike.\nSteve Barger: Got it. Thank you.\nJohn Olin: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kristine Kubacki for closing remarks.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Kate. And thank you, everyone, for your participation today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Olin",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael, and hello everyone. Turning to slide eight, I will view our third quarter results in more detail. We delivered another good quarter of operational and financial performance from strong underlying momentum across the business, coupled with great execution from the team. Sales for the third quarter were $2.55 billion, which reflects a 22.5% increase from the prior year. Sales were driven by strong growth across both the freight and transit segments. For the quarter, GAAP operating income was $370 million, driven by higher sales and focused cost management. Adjusted operating margin in Q3 was 17.9%, up 1.5 percentage points versus the prior year. The increase during the quarter was driven by significantly higher sales, improved productivity and cost management, partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies driven by the strike at our Erie facility. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.33, which was up 51.1% versus the third quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pre-tax charges of $13 million for restructuring, which was primarily related to our integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec's operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.70, up 39.3% versus prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another strong quarter. We outperformed our expectations, demonstrating the underlying strength and momentum of the business, and as a result, we are fine tuning our full year outlook by increasing our sales and adjusted earnings guidance. Now, turning to slide nine, let's review our product line in more detail. Third quarter consolidated sales were very strong, up 22.5%. Equipment sales were up 38.8% from last year due to higher locomotive sales, which, as planned, were significantly skewed to Q3 versus Q4, along with increased demand for mining products this quarter. Component sales were up 32.3% versus last year, largely driven by higher North American OE rail car build and market share gains in freight car product sales, along with increased demand for industrial products. Sales also benefited from the strategic acquisition of L&M late in the second quarter by $42 million. Digital intelligence sales were down 3.2% from last year, which was driven by a softness in our North American signaling business, partially offset by higher demand for international PTC, next-gen on-board locomotive products, and digital mining. Our services sales grew 17.6%. Sales growth was driven by higher modernization deliveries and increased parts sales. Our customers continue to recognize the superior performance, reliability, efficiency, and availability across their Wabtec locomotive fleets. Across our transit segment, OE and aftermarket sales significantly increased versus last year. Segment sales were up 20.0% to $660 million, behind execution of our growing backlog, easing of supply chain disruptions, and comparing against the cyber impact in Q3 2022. The momentum in this segment is strong across our core markets as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonization accelerate the need for investments in sustainable infrastructure. Moving to slide 10, GAAP gross margin was 31.0%, which was down 0.1 percentage points from Q3 last year, while adjusted gross profit margin was up 0.1 percentage points, driven by higher sales and improved productivity, partially offset by inefficiencies related to the strike in Erie. Mix was favorable, driven by a richer mix between and within segments. Raw material costs, while still elevated, were largely flat on a year-over-year basis. Foreign currency exchange was favorable to sales by $32 million, or 1.5 percentage points, and it improved our third quarter gross profits by $7 million. Finally, manufacturing costs were positively impacted by favorable fixed cost absorption and benefits of integration 2.0, more than offset by manufacturing inefficiencies, primarily at our Erie facility. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of continued cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lean initiatives. Turning to slide 11, for the third quarter, GAAP operating margin was 14.5%, which was up 2.0 percentage points versus last year, while adjusted operating margin improved 1.5 percentage points to 17.9%. GAAP and adjusted SG&A were $295 million. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was 11.6%, down 0.7 percentage points versus the prior year, as we leveraged higher sales and strong focus on managing costs. Engineering expense was $53 million, about flat with Q3 last year. We continue to invest engineering resources in current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization, and safety. Now let's take a look at segment results on slide 12, starting with the freight segment. As I already discussed, freight segment sales were very strong for the quarter, up 23.4%. GAAP segment operating income was $327 million for an operating margin of 17.3%, up 2.1 percentage points versus last year. Adjusted operating income for the freight segment was $399 million, up 30.0% versus prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the freight segment was up 1.3 percentage points from prior year at 21.2%. The increase was driven by significantly higher sales, including fixed cost absorption and lower SG&A as a percentage of revenue, and improved mix, somewhat offset by manufacturing inefficiencies driven by the strike at Erie. Finally, segment multiyear backlog was $17.61 billion, down 8.1% from the end of Q3 last year. We continue to compare against the multiyear modernization and locomotive orders, totaling over 1.5 billion that we received in 2022. The 12-month backlog was $5.28 billion, up 15.7% for the same period, and shows good momentum well into 2024. Turning to slide 13, transit segment sales were up 20.0% to $660 million. When adjusting for foreign currency, transit sales were up 14.5%. GAAP operating income was $68 million, up 28.3%. Restructuring costs related to integration 2.0 activities were $10 million in Q3. Adjusted segment operating income was $83 million, which was up 38.3%. Adjusted operating income increased as a result of higher sales, favorable mix, benefits from our integration 2.0 activities, and the cyber impact in Q3 2022. This resulted in adjusted operating margin of 12.5%, up 1.5 percentage points from last year. Finally, transit segment multiyear backlog for the quarter was $3.87 billion, up 12.6% versus a year ago. Now let's turn to our financial position on slide 14. Q3 cash from operations was $425 million versus $204 million in the prior year. Cash flow benefited from higher earnings and improved inventory management. Our debt leverage ratio was 2.1 times at the end of the third quarter, which was favorable versus prior year. And finally, we've returned $344 million of capital back to shareholders year-to-date through share repurchase and dividends. During the third quarter, we utilized free cash flow to pay down debt and reduce leverage after the $229 million acquisition of L&M in the second quarter of 2023. As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong, and we continue to allocate capital in a balanced strategy to maximize shareholder returns. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael. Good morning, Justin. Sure. So number one, on the Erie, we couldn't be more pleased that we came to a successful agreement with the union during the quarter. Well, Justin, we don't provide line item details of our cost of goods sold. It is important to understand that our cost of the strike -- to understand the cost of the strike, it's important to know that the plant never closed during the strike and hence, some of our strong volume performance in the quarter. But it did operate at less than normal efficiency given the reduced workforce that it was operating under. So overall, it was a little bit of a drag on the quarter in terms of earnings. But certainly, we took it in stride and delivered a great quarter despite that. The second question you have, Justin, with regards to the implied fourth quarter growth, I guess. As first, I'd start by saying that we're very pleased with how the back half is unfolding. Certainly favorable to our expectations that we had shared with the group and on the Q2 earnings call. And overall, we've increased the revenue guidance by 2.5% at the midpoint and 4.5% for EPS. And with that, it kind of pushes out and implied fourth quarter guidance, and that is that we expect revenue to grow roughly at 6% midpoint. And again, this is despite last year's tough comps of over 11% growth and likewise, expect very strong margin increase in Q4, driven by EPS up roughly 17% at the midpoint. So when we look at the second half and how it's unfolding, it's just as we discussed last quarter, Justin, with the third quarter revenue growing considerably faster than the fourth quarter, and that's driven by the fact that the production plan for the second half is significantly skewed to the third quarter. In fact, Justin, when you look at it, roughly 70% of our second half locomotive deliveries will be delivered in the third quarter, and that's strictly to meet the customer expectations. So those schedules were built over a year ago. So consequently, our Q4 underlying growth remains very strong and is evidenced by our strengthening -- which is evidenced by the strengthening 12-month backlog, which was up 13% versus prior year. And like Rafael said in the prepared comments, we expect to see profitable growth as we transition into 2024. Jerry good morning. Yes, Nathan. So number one, what you pointed out, what we said may be a little bit counterintuitive, right? But if you take it back to the discussion that we've been having for the last four quarters, when we really started to step up a lot of the locomotive deliveries internationally, that put a fair amount of overall mix pressure on us, again, starting in the third quarter of 2022 and really going through the last four quarters. So as we move out of the fourth quarter of 2023, we are stepping in from a freight perspective into higher-margin deliveries. And that's shining through even though given the fact that overall equipment is at a lower margin than digital, we are still seeing, in aggregate, a fair amount of mix favourability. The other piece of it is not only mix within the various groups, but also the mix between groups, right? When you look at the Freight growing at 23.4% and currency adjusted Transit at 14.5% that provides a fair amount of mixed tailwinds as well. I think Ivan, it's very much similar to what we experienced this year is one, volume growth does wonders for expanding margins, right driving incremental growth. We've talked about our incremental growth is about 25% to 30%. So with that incremental volume, which we would expect revenue growth in 2024, we will build EPS growth in addition to that. The other is, as Rafael had mentioned, Integration 2.0. So that was a 3-year investment, and we're just starting to get to the kind of the ramp on the savings plan. And we're seeing that ramp up in the first 3 quarters of this year, but expect the largest growth in terms of savings due to that program in 2024. So that, again, will drive margins a little bit faster than revenue. But overall, as we sit today and look forward to 2024, we expect that profitable growth that Rafael spoke to. And with that, we expect to be overall in line with our long-term objectives and our long-term guidance. I got -- first, go back to the things I've highlighted here. You've got to make sure you have the coverage, especially on the long lead items. Otherwise, you're getting an order here a new locomotive at this point and you don't have the coverage for 2024, there's not much you can do there. So having the coverage for that long lead items is important, and we have it. The second piece I talked about is the fact our fleets internationally continue to grow out. So we're seeing good momentum there, not just from a CapEx but from also an OpEx perspective. So that's very positive. And in North America, discussion continues despite of, I'd say, continued to grow parking levels. Customers are investing for really lower costs for improved efficiency, for improved reliability. So all in all, when we think about the momentum here, looking at North America and internationally, CapEx and OpEx, it continues to look into profitable growth going to 2024, very much aligned to the long-term guidance we've provided. No, no. Not at all, Matt. when we look at it, we've been talking about the year a lot in first half, second half. And at the beginning of the year, we said that first half would grow a little bit faster than the second half. And I think the way to look at between our third and fourth quarter is to look at them together, and we're seeing what you would see on the implied growth is 14% growth in the back half versus 16% growth in the first half. And again, that's what we've expected. But it's really a function of the way the production plan was set up over a year ago in terms of the deliveries that we expected to make in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter on some of our larger equipment, in particular, on locomotives. And as I had mentioned that about 70% of the second half production plan for locomotives is delivered in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter. So overall, when you even those out, we've had a year very much in terms of overall cadence expectations, of course, at a higher level of revenue growth, which explains the raise in the second and the third quarter. But the fourth quarter underlying momentum is just as strong as the third quarter. And we feel good as going into the 2024 with the backlog growing as Rafael had mentioned, has actually sequentially grown for the last couple of quarters. And as we exit the third quarter, it's up 13%. We're not going to break out the timing of it, but we would expect all $2 billion of it to turn into orders. We've got a great customer in Kazakhstan and they've got a tremendous growth opportunity, given some of the dynamics of the flow of products from China to Europe. And we're certainly working with them to upgrade their fleet and expand their fleet so that they can manage their future. Yes. Saree. So if you recall that Integration 2.0 was a 3-year program that started at the beginning of 2022. And on any of these type of restructuring programs or opportunities to integrate, we'll see a higher investment profile in the beginning and a higher savings profile in the back as we get the projects often executed. So to date, we've invested about $100 million out of an expected $135 million to $165 million over the next -- or over that 3-year period of time. And Saree, what we're seeing now is just as those projects start and either the facilities are being consolidated or products being moved or however, we're looking at optimization, those savings are starting to build. And at the end of 2022, we had about ongoing savings of about $5 million and that continues to escalate, and we look for that to build up to $75 million to $95 million. So we won't quantify it, but you can start to see the momentum that we need to have to be at a run rate of $75 million to $95 million in 2025. Yes, we're very pleased with the Transit margin. It was up 1.5 percentage points driven by a couple of things, Saree. Number one, is certainly fixed cost absorption was favorable given the volume growth ex currency of 14.5%. The other area is product mix. Product mix was favorable in Transit. And if you look at the aftermarket grew a fair amount faster than OE. And also, when we talk about Integration 2.0, a fair amount of that hits our Transit business, right? So that's helping driving it. And also we're lapping some of the inefficiencies that we had in cyber in the year ago quarter. So I feel very good about the transit business, as Rafael had mentioned and certainly a bright future as we continue to move that business forward. Yes. Rob, it's a little bit early for us to start talking about gating. It's early for us to talk about guidance as well. So a typical cadence would be to provide guidance in the call in February after the year is done. And again, just broadly, we're looking at certainly profitable growth in 2024, but in another quarter's time, we'll have certainly more detail with regards to what that is and what's driving it. Yes. I think from a gross margin standpoint, what you're seeing on a year-to-date basis is certainly a drag from the strike in Erie but also that mix that we talked about, right? We had mix headwinds in the first half, and that had an impact on gross margin. So this quarter, gross margin was flat, again affected by the strike at Erie, but a lot of benefits as we move forward. And when we look at Integration 2.0, that directly fits into the gross margin, and we would expect a tailwind on margins because of that. And then also the biggest driver of margin is volume, right, and leveraging the fixed cost structure of the business. And that's not only fixed manufacturing costs, but also the fixed portion of SG&A. So as we grow, we expect to continue to aggressively manage our cost structure and making sure that we do deliver those incremental volumes, which, again, we would expect to be in the 25% to 30% range. So we didn't -- I don't think we caught the first part of the question. I don't think we can -- we would put an index on it. Just looking at the backlog over the last 5 years, we've seen it oscillate between 21.5 and 22.5 I think parts of it are the economy that goes into that. And when we have periods of big orders, we see it rise and then that kind of burns off. And that's exactly what we're seeing in 2022 to 2023, right? We saw it rise about $1 billion in 2022. And as we work that off, we're lapping those numbers and backlogs down 4% or 5%. So I think over a long period of time, we would expect it to rise, but I don't think there's a formula you can put on it. We keep coming back to this word lumpy, is that -- it is very lumpy depending on what multi-years. I think the best way to remove the lumpiness is to look at the 12 months, right? So we don't -- we kind of neutralize for that, and the 12 month has been very steady and growing up on the three quarters this year and has been gaining momentum. Well, we expect to continue to grow this company in 2024, 2025 and 2026, Steve, and well beyond that. No, I can't pull out what it would look like without. All I can say is it was a tremendous effort on the part of the overall company to be able to deliver that revenue growth and again, I talked about the locomotive piece, right, and that shift. We delivered all the locomotives in the second quarter that we were intending to deliver with the 10-week strike at our largest plant that makes locomotives. So it's a tremendous tribute to the team and how the whole company pulled together to continue to work through the strike. Thank you."

            "name": "Rafael Santana",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide four. I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter, the progress against our long-term value creation framework, and then John will cover the financials. We delivered another strong quarter, evidenced by robust sales growth, margin expansion and increased earnings and cash flow. We achieved these despite increased volatility and uncertainty in the economy. Sales were $2.5 billion, which was up 22.5% versus prior year. Revenue was driven by strong performance from both the Freight and Transit segments. Total cash flow from operations was $425 million. Cash conversion [Ph] was driven by higher earnings and improved inventory management. Overall, our financial position remained strong. We continued to execute against our capital allocation framework to maximize shareholder value by investing for the future growth, and returning cash to shareholders. The 12-month backlog was over $7 billion, up 13%, signifying continued momentum and visibility across the business into 2024. Total multiyear backlog was $21.5 billion. Overall, the Wabtec team delivered a strong quarter, behind solid execution. Looking ahead, I'm encouraged by both the underlying momentum across the business and the team's unrelenting focus on delivering for our customers and even against the more uncertain and volatile macro environment we believe Wabtec is well-positioned to drive profitable growth ahead. Shifting our focus to Slide five. Let's talk about our 2023 end market expectations in more detail. While key metrics across our Freight business remain mixed, we continue to be encouraged by our business momentum, activity in international markets and our robust pipeline of opportunities across geographies. North America carloads continue to be down in the quarter which resulted in locomotive parkings up slightly from last quarter's levels. Yet we continue to see significant opportunities across the globe in demand for new locomotives, modernizations and digital solutions as our customers invest in solutions that continue to drive reliability, productivity, safety and fuel efficiency. Looking at the North American railcar builds demand for railcar continues to show growth. The industry outlook for 2023 is for about 45,000 cars to be delivered. Internationally, activity is strong across core markets, such as Latin America, Australia, South Africa and Kazakhstan, significant investments to expand and upgrade infrastructure are supporting a substantial international order pipeline. In mining, commodity prices are supporting activity to refresh and upgrade the truck fleet. Finally, moving to the Transit sector, the mega trends of modernization [Ph] and decarbonisation remain in place, driving the need for clean, safe and efficient transportation solutions around the globe. Next, let's turn to Slide six to discuss a few recent business highlights. During the quarter, we signed a strategic MOU with KTZ, the national railway company in Kazakhstan, for over $2 billion. This agreement will support significant freight growth through the state-of-the-art equipment and technologies, driving productivity and lowering operating costs. This framework includes locomotives to be delivered in 2024, a long-term supply agreement, and a collaboration on a number of digital technologies, all of which we expect to drive strong orders and sales growth in 2024. Speaking of our business in Kazakhstan, the team just achieved a significant milestone by delivering its 500th locomotive. Looking at our mining business, the team signed orders totaling over $150 million, which is up double digits versus last year. And early in the fourth quarter, our team in Latin America won an order for 22 additional locomotives to be delivered in 2024. In North America, we won an order in New York City Transit to supply components for an additional 640 subway cars. Also, late last quarter, we closed the L&M acquisition that expanded our heat transfer portfolio in mining. This is off to a great start. The integration is on track. Third quarter revenue is ahead of plan, taking advantage of a strong mining market globally. I'd also highlight Nordco, which we acquired back in 2021. Our maintenance of way business continues to be ahead of plan and is experiencing double-digit growth in 2023. All of this demonstrates the continued momentum across the business, the team's relentless focus on driving for our customers and the strong pipeline of opportunities we're executing on. Wabtec's well-positioned to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that addresses our customers' most pressing needs. Turning to slide seven, I'd like to discuss in more detail our international markets. While North America provides us a solid foundation to refresh and renew install base, we also have a significant opportunity for growth across international fleets by leveraging our broad portfolio and superior technologies. We have been successful in expanding our international install base over time, which has grown at roughly 4.5% annually for the last six years. Looking ahead, the pipeline of opportunities in our international markets continues to strengthen, and as a result, we expect continued expansion in our install base. Increasing freight volumes from mining, agriculture, and intermodal continue to drive the need for increased investment in clean, efficient, and safe modes of transportation. We expect growth in 2024 from key regions like Latin America, CIS, Australia, and South Africa, driven by our regional footprints and local partnerships. Our technologies are delivering more fuel-efficient, reliable solutions, which will reduce operational costs for our customers around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results, and our overall financial performance. John? Thanks, John. Let's flip to slide 15 to discuss our updated 2023 financial guidance. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and solutions continues. Our orders pipeline and 12-month backlog continue to be strong, providing solid visibility for profitable growth ahead. The team is committed to driving top-line growth and adjusted margin expansion in 2023 despite a challenging macro environment. With these factors in mind, we are increasing our previous guidance. We now expect 2023 sales of $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion, up nearly 15% from last year at the midpoint, and adjusted EPS to be between $5.80 and $6 per share, up about 21.5% at the midpoint. We continue to expect cash flow conversion to be greater than 90%. Looking ahead, while the macro environment has become more uncertain over the last quarter, I'm confident that Wabtec is well-positioned to drive profitable growth in 2024, which is aligned to our long-term financial framework. Now let's wrap up on slide 16. As you heard today, our team delivered on another strong quarter. Even in a dynamic environment, we are committed to delivering on our value creation framework through the strength of our portfolio, resilient installed base, innovative solutions and a rigorous focus on execution. Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable long-term growth and maximize shareholder returns. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning, and I'll now turn the call over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine? I'll take that one, Justin. So first, no, it's not in the backlog of orders, but talking about backlog, the backlog is healthy. It will be down year-over-year, but you got to look at it in conjunction with the multi-billion orders that we signed last year, which don't repeat every year. The outer side of it, we have a number of multi-billion dollar opportunities that being worth. And we just signed a large one, which is in the pipeline and will convert into orders. So we see good momentum here. We don't see slow down. We are progressing. We're continuing to grow, and our pipeline supports it last quarter, as John said, 12 months last quarter was up 10%, this quarter, third quarter was up 13%. So we're continuing to drive momentum here with key deals being signed and if you think especially about the long lead items in our portfolio like mods and your locomotives, you need that backlog to be there and as we look into 2024 and beyond. Thank you. So Jerry, I mean, as you see, finished the strong quarter, strong pipeline of opportunities which, I'd say, have just strengthened really the visibility that we have to continue to drive revenue and margin expansion. It's for sure a bit early to get into the specifics of 2024 guidance. But the momentum we'll continue to see, in my mind, with results being driven by -- first, I'll start with the strength of the short and mid-term backlog. The 12-month backlog that we spoke about at $7.1 billion, up double digits. Second piece, we continue to see momentum on both new locomotives and mods. Our customers, we're continuing to invest for improved costs. So this is bringing a modernization in so they can part to order units. They're investing for reliability. We're still coming out of the trough there. If you think about the lead times, as I mentioned here before, we need a strong backlog here as some of the lead times here with the mods and new units is longer, and you need the backlog, and we have it for the next 12 and 24 months. The other piece for me is international. We're very bullish on key international markets. We have the momentum there. You saw in Kazakhstan, but what if I think about Brazil, South Africa and Australia, they're all driving significant momentum going to 2024. On the margin side, the business will benefit and further benefit from Integration 2.0. So we'll continue to drive expansion here as well. So all in all, the pipeline of opportunities, we continue to get better visibility. In fact, this is the best, I'll call, we've had stepping into a year, which strengthens our position here to deliver on profitable growth. Jerry, we're pleased with the progress that we're seeing there. We're continuing significant work to simplify the footprint and further improve the business competitiveness. I think you're going to continue to see some variation quarter-to-quarter, but that team is committed to continue to expand margins and take action here for profitable growth. Despite of the more, I'll call competitive environment, the fundamentals are good in the business. If you think about our book-to-bill ratio, we'll close above 1 for the year. 12-month backlog is up. Multiyear backlog is up 16%, the other one, I think 12 -- over 12% and the team is continuing to progress to really drive mid-teen margins. So yes, we expect the business to be more competitive in the marketplace there, and we're saying no slowdown. In fact, we see the opportunity here to continue to grow with the business. If you think about the record backlog some of our customers had, we're continuing to see momentum there. Thank you. I think you've got to keep in mind, first, the lumpiness of the multiyear orders that we get. And you're going to see that lumpiness not just playing out through the quarters, that lumpiness will play out in the years as well. As we mentioned, we expect the backlog to be down this year, year-over-year. But the other side of it is the multibillion-dollar orders that we're working on, which are not in our backlog, and we expect that to convert. So I really look at us in terms of the lumpiness of the orders. The other piece you've got to be very focused on is when you think about the lead times on certain of your products, making sure that you have the coverage to work through it, and that's why I highlighted both modernizations and new locomotives, so if you think about the lead times on those, you need a strong coverage, and we have it. We have it if we think about 2024, we have it beyond 2024. I'll reinforce two other points, which is just an element of international markets. I spoke here specifically about Brazil, South Africa, Kazakhstan and Australia, which are very significant, and we have significant momentum walking into 2024 with this market. So we do expect significant growth there from a sales perspective. And the other piece is, again, the coverage as we look into stepping into 2024, which is certainly one of the strongest coverages we've had stepping into any given year. I would add the following. We expect a large part of that to convert. And as I said, about some international markets, we're increasing deliveries in Kazakhstan, and it's strong growth going to 2024. Thank you Matt. I think more in terms of the coverage looking ahead, right? And my comments on the strong coverage that it provides a piece of it has really to be connected with long lead parts of our portfolio. And that's where I think about new locomotives, and I think about mods and I think it in conjunction of both international markets and North America. And that's probably the strongest -- certainly the strongest we've had to walk into any year. Thank you. It continues. Mining is very strong right now and all the indications we've got is of that momentum continuing into next year as well. So that's certainly are not one of the positive momentum that we see on the business. Rob, I'm not going to give you like specific numbers you're thinking 5 years from now. I just think -- I'll tell you how we're running the business, right? There is really a strong focus on making sure that we've got the coverage as we look ahead, and that coverage supports what I'll call profitable growth for the business. That's where a big piece of focus has been. In the past, if you go back, there's maybe a lot of focus, especially on multiservice agreements that covered fleets for a long period of time. We've managed that in mix with long-term parts agreements. In some cases, we might take a different approach depending on what the fleets are with the customers. So all in all, I think those are levers that we got to be managing and really thinking more about the value that we're delivering, especially as we introduce more opportunities to improve fleets. A lot of the upgrades that we talk about in terms of fuel efficiency and things like that. We want to make sure we're driving value for both our customers and ourselves through that process. But all in all, I mean, we expect to continue to drive that momentum forward with profitable growth. Does that help? This is a business that go before the transactional was done. There was a lot of, I'll call, ups and downs through the cycle. I think one of the things that the team has been very purposeful on is making sure we are working with customers to drive what I'll call sustainable investments moving forward, which plays well for the entire ecosystem. It's an element of making sure that we're ultimately getting to the right quality, the right value for the products ultimately to better costs as we run some of these programs. And that's been a huge part of the focus. If you think about the focus on 12-month backlog 18, 24, that's a significant part of it. And the longer-term agreements will play them to make sure that we've got the continuation of a lot of the infrastructure that we've got out there that supports the delivery of some of these assets for customers around the world."

We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics.  I will now turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4. I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter, and progress against our long-term value creation framework, and then John will cover the financials.  We delivered another strong quarter, evidenced by robust sales and earnings per share growth. We achieved these despite continued volatility and economic challenges. Sales were $2.41 billion, which was up 17.5% versus prior year. Revenue was driven by strong performance from both the Freight and Transit segments. Total cash flow from operations was $115 million. Overall, our financial position remained strong. We continued to execute against our capital allocation framework to maximize shareholder value by investing for the future growth, executing on the strategic M&A like our recent acquisition of L&M, and returning cash to shareholders.  The 12-month backlog was $7.2 billion, up 10%, signifying growing momentum and visibility across the business. The total multiyear backlog was $22.4 billion. Overall, the Wabtec team delivered a strong second quarter, marking a good first half of 2023.  Looking forward, I'm encouraged by the underlying strength and robust momentum across the business. Wabtec is well-positioned to continue driving profitable growth even amidst a challenging economy.  Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about our 2023 end market expectations for -- in more details. As we look at key metrics across our Freight business, we remain encouraged by the underlying business momentum and our robust pipeline of opportunities across geographies. North America carloads continue to be down in the quarter and locomotive parkings moved up slightly as we exited the second quarter, but better than we had anticipated as customers prioritize service and fluidity.  We continue to see significant opportunities across the globe in demand for new locomotives, modernizations and digital solutions as our customers invest in solutions that continue to drive reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency.  Looking at the North American railcar builds demand for railcar continues to show growth. The industry outlook for 2023 is for about 45,000 cars to be delivered. Overall, we believe we have an opportunity to continue building significant long-term momentum with growth in modernizations, new locomotive sales, railcar builds, and digital solutions.  Internationally, activity is strong in core markets, such as Brazil, Australia, India, and the CIS region, significant investments to expand and upgrade infrastructure are supporting a very strong international order pipeline.  Finally, moving to the Transit sector, the mega trends remain in place, driving the need for clean, safe and efficient transportation solutions around the globe.  Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few recent business highlights. In North America, we secured several key wins, including orders for 30 new locomotives and order for 69 locomotives under our certified preowned program and an order for 60 modernizations from Canadian National that closed after the end of the quarter.  In Australia, we recently won a strategic order for 17 locomotives from CBH, which will support the continued growth of agricultural commodities in the region.  And with regards to our zero emissions portfolio, we also recently signed a strategic order with Vale for 3 flex drive locomotives. These locomotives will pull the world's largest iron ore train, and is expected to remove 63,000 tons of carbon, the equivalent of 14,000 passenger cars per year.  In Transit, we won a major order to supply passenger information systems and Pentagraphs for up to 504 stabler cars for Germany and Austria.  And finally, during June, we completed the bolt-on acquisition of L&M. This strategic acquisition will enhance Wabtec's existing heat transfer portfolio, and we will extend our installed base in mining, providing a solid platform for domestic and international profitable growth.  All of this demonstrates the growing momentum across the business, the team's relentless focus on delivering for our customers and a strong pipeline of opportunities we continue to execute on, Wabtec is well-positioned to continue to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers' most pressing needs.  Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to highlight how Wabtec will provide efficient solutions for our customers by driving their productivity, reducing fuel consumption, and improving safety, while leading the decarbonization of rail across the industry. Wabtec is uniquely positioned to shape a more sustainable future for rail by inventing and developing technologies that provide customers with adaptable and efficient solutions to meet their carbon reduction goals, while providing strong investment returns to our customers given improved reliability, haulageability and fuel efficiency.  Ultimately, we will help lead the industry towards a zero-emissions rail network and we have already started laying that path to get there through new locomotives, modernizations with advancements in utilizing renewable and biofuels, leading in battery electric applications, investing in hydrogen technology, and providing a wide range of digital solutions.  With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results and our overall financial performance. John?\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Rafael, and hello, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I will review our second quarter results in more detail. We delivered another strong quarter of operational and financial performance with underlying business momentum strengthening through the first half of the year.  Sales for the second quarter were $2.41 billion, which reflects a 17.5% increase versus the prior year. Sales were driven by strong growth across all major product lines.  For the quarter, GAAP operating income was up $48 million, driven by higher sales. Adjusted operating margin in Q2 was 16.4%, down 0.3 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefits of higher sales were offset by a less rich mix of sales between and within segments.  GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.06, an which was up 16.5% versus the second quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pretax charges of $10 million for restructuring which was primarily related to our Integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec's operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025.  In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.41, up 14.6% versus the prior year.  Overall, Wabtec executed a good quarter and a strong first half of 2023. We outperformed our expectations, demonstrating the underlying strength and momentum of business and as a result, we are raising our full year outlook for sales and adjusted earnings.  Now turning to Slide 9. Let's review our product lines in more detail. Second quarter consolidated sales were very strong, up 17.5%. Equipment sales were up 8.9% due to higher locomotive sales this quarter versus last year's second quarter.  Components sales were up 23.1% versus last year, largely driven by the higher OE railcar build and an increase in our market share due to product availability, along with increased demand for industrial products. We also closed the strategic acquisition of L&M late in the quarter, which did not have an impact on components sales during the quarter.  Digital Intelligence sales were up 18.9%, which was driven by robust demand for onboard locomotive products and international PTC, along with revenue contribution from the acquisitions in Q2 of last year.  Our Services sales grew 13.9% and Sales growth was driven by higher sales from increased modernization deliveries and increased parts sales. Our customers continue to recognize a serial performance, reliability, efficiency, and availability across their Wabtec locomotive fleets.  Across our Transit segment, OE and aftermarket sales significantly increased versus last year. Segment sales were up 25.3% to $699 million. The momentum in this segment is strong across our core markets as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonization accelerate the need for investments in sustainable infrastructure.  Moving to Slide 10. As forecasted, gross profit margin was slightly lower, driven by a less rich mix and higher manufacturing costs. Mix was unfavorable driven by strong sales from the Transit segment and higher sales of new locomotives and modernizations within the Freight segment. Raw material costs, while still elevated, were largely flat on a year-over-year basis. Foreign currency exchange was unfavorable to sales by $7 million or 0.3 percentage point, and it reduced our second quarter gross profits by $2 million.  Finally, manufacturing costs were positively impacted by favorable fixed cost absorption more than offset by manufacturing inefficiencies at our Erie facility in June.  Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of continued cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lean initiatives.  Turning to Slide 11. For the second quarter, GAAP operating margin was 12.9%, which was flat versus last year, while adjusted operating margin declined 0.3 percentage points to 16.4%. SG&A was $285 million, and adjusted SG&A was $283 million, both of which were up versus the prior year, but down significantly as a percent of sales.  Engineering expense increased from last year according to plan, yet was down 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of sales at 2.2%. We continue to invest in engineering resources and current business opportunities but more importantly, we are investing in our future as the leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization and safety.  Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 12, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales were strong for the quarter, up 14.6%. The GAAP segment operating income was $271 million for an operating margin of 15.9%, up 0.2 percentage points versus last year. Adjusted operating income for the Freight segment was $346 million, up 15% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the Freight segment was flat with prior year at 20.3%. The benefits of increased sales, including fixed cost absorption and lower SG&A as a percentage of revenue were offset by unfavorable mix from higher sales of international locos and modernizations as well as nonrecurring expenses from our labor negotiations in Erie.  Finally, segment multiyear backlog was $18.3 billion, down 6.8% from the end of Q2 last year, while the 12-month backlog was $5.3 billion, up 10.3% over the same period. The 12-month backlog continues to show momentum beyond 2023. Conversely, the year-over-year reduction in the backlog was driven by lapping last year's significant multiyear order from Union Pacific for over $1 billion of modernizations.  Now turning to Slide 13. Transit segment sales were up 25.3%, driven by strong OE and aftermarket sales. GAAP operating income was $66 million, up 32.0% and GAAP operating income increased as a result of higher sales and benefits from our Integration 2.0 activities, partially offset by higher restructuring costs. Adjusted segment operating income was $76 million which was up 31.0%. This resulted in adjusted operating margin of 11.1%, up 0.8 percentage point from last year.  Finally, Transit segment multiyear backlog for the quarter was $4.1 billion, up 15.4% versus a year ago.  Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 14. We Q2 cash from operations was $115 million. While cash flow benefited from higher earnings, we are continuing to invest in the businesses growth, which is driving working capital higher, in particular, receivables and inventory. Despite that, we continue to drive toward a greater than 90% cash conversion for the full year.  Our debt leverage ratio was 2.4x at the end of the second quarter, which was flat versus prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of L&M. As we look forward, we have a $250 million senior note at 4.38% coming due in August. We intend to roll that debt into our delayed draw term facility.  I'd like to spend just a moment on providing some additional color on L&M. As Rafael mentioned, during the quarter, we completed the bolt-on acquisition of L&M. This strategic acquisition will extend and complement our portfolio of premium heat transfer solutions in mining. We purchased L&M for $223 million in cash, and the business is expected to have calendar year 2023 sales of about $130 million.  And finally, we returned $105 million of capital back to shareholders in the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong, and we continue to allocate capital in a balanced strategy to maximize shareholder returns.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, John. Let's flip to Slide 15 to discuss our updated 2023 financial guidance. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and solutions is growing across our business. Our order pipeline and 12-month backlog continued to strengthen, providing solid visibility for profitable growth for the rest of 2023 and beyond. . The team is committed to driving strong top line growth while managing costs. We are also committed to driving adjusted margin expansion in 2023 despite a so challenging macro environment. With these factors in mind, we are increasing our previous guidance. We now expect 2023 sales of $9.25 billion to $9.5 billion, up 12% from last year at the midpoint and adjusted EPS to be between $5.50 and $5.80 per share, up 16% at the midpoint.  We also expect cash flow conversions to be greater than 90%. Now let's wrap up on Slide 16. As you heard today, our team delivered another strong quarter to the year despite an uncertain and volatile environment. Thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world-class team, innovative solutions and our relentless focus on our customers.  Our results remain on track for us to deliver on our 5-year outlook that we provided at our Investor Day last year, with strong item across the portfolio, increased visibility through our strengthening order pipeline, and a rigorous focus on execution Wabtec is well-positioned to drive profitable long-term growth and maximize shareholder returns.  With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning. And I'll now turn the call over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine?\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. First question will be from Justin Long from Stephens.\nJustin Long: Based on the updated full year guidance, I was wondering if you could share how you're expecting third quarter and fourth quarter to look on a relative basis. Do you think they'll look similar from a revenue and earnings perspective? I just wanted to better understand the cadence that you're anticipating when you think about the timing of deliveries, mix, or anything else we should be mindful of in the back half? .\nJohn Olin: Great, Justin. This is John. Justin, when we look at the back half cadence, starting with revenue, we would expect the majority of our revenue growth to come in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter. And again, this is due to the way that the orders have come in and production is scheduled as well as we got a little lapping benefit over a slightly easier comp from a revenue standpoint.  When we look at the earnings side or margin side of the equation, we would see the opposite or expect the opposite, Justin. We would expect the majority of our earnings growth our margin growth to come in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And that is simply because we're lapping a much easier comp in the fourth quarter of last year than we have in the third quarter.\nJustin Long: Okay. That's very helpful. Second question I had was on the Freight Services segment. We saw some notable strength there in the second quarter. Is there a way you can help us think about the growth in that segment if you exclude mods? And then going forward, I was wondering if you could share what you're assuming for locomotive utilization. It sounds like parkings were maybe a little bit better than you thought, but we're hearing from some of the rails that locomotives are getting put into storage. So I just wanted to kind of marry those 2 trends.\nRafael Santana: Justin, you're right. So I think we'll see, especially as we go into the second half of the year, and beyond the second half, I think you'll see acceleration of growth in services. Some of that, I mean, you see it with some recent order that we announced here. So mods is a growth case continuing to us moving forward, so that continues to be a positive.  When it comes down to parkings, We're seeing really active fleet staying steady side, any element of really fluctuation within the year, but the focus on services continues, and we feel very good about our fleet stamps out there providing really, I'll call, significant benefits to the customer when compared to our competitors' fleets. And that's both in terms of reliability, availability, fuel efficiency, which is a significant element here. We stand with really feel better than in average more than 5% on every single one of our platforms. So we don't expect no signs of any significant changes on that active fleet eater.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Chris Wetherbee of Citi.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Rob on for Chris. Could you give us a sense in terms of the backlog, obviously, it increased over the 12 months sequentially. How should we think about just that conversion in '23 versus kind of '24?\nRafael Santana: Yes. I'll start just with, I feel very good about our overall backlog. I feel strong about the pipeline of opportunities that the team is working on. I think the overall underlying growth fundamentals of the business is also strong. As you said, the 12 months is up 10%. It's accelerating. Last quarter was 4.4%.  The current total backlog is also healthy. So while it's down 3.5%, I look at it in conjunction with the multiyear $1 billion order that we got from Union Pacific and the auto multibillion-dollar auditor opportunities were being worked right now and with the team. So we see good momentum internationally. We see it in North America. It's positive. We're progressing, and we're continuing to grow and our pipeline supports it.  In terms of the convertibility, the 12 months, already provides you a view into '24, and we continue to see strength in the pipeline.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's helpful. And just piggyback on Justin's question. Your response you said -- I thought I heard you saying that you're expecting acceleration of services growth. So should I think about that stepping up from the roughly 14% you guys did in 2Q in the back half of the year. And maybe if you could provide a little bit more context.\nRafael Santana: First half versus second half of the year. That's where I made the comment.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. And how are you thinking about services growth longer term? .\nRafael Santana: It continues. I mean, as you saw, I think the demand for a lot of the solutions we have there continues to be robust. We have an opportunity to modernize a significant part of the fleet there. I think customers are really looking into it. You see based on the announcement we just made yesterday. When you're looking at 18% fuel savings, 40% improvement on reliability, 55% on pulling power. Those are significant numbers that are really compelling in terms of driving, not the quality of the service you're providing to your customers, but reducing your costs. And I think that these some of the fundamentals will continue to build on growth for the modernization of the fleet and demand for new units as well. .\nOperator: Next question will be from Wertheimer Melius Research.\nRobert Wertheimer: So just to clarify on gross margin, obviously, you mentioned that you had mix headwinds between segments and within. Is mix the entire driver of the down gross margin? Or is there any price/cost or anything else to catch up still? And then was there a mix drag within Transit as a segment? .\nJohn Olin: Okay, Rob, this is John. Looking at the quarter, we came in -- margin came in 16.4%, down 0.3 percentage point. As we talked about in the earlier quarter, we expected the first half to be flat on margin. So margins were down a little bit more than we expected. The key driver of that, Rob, was the inefficiencies we're experiencing at our facility in Erie behind the strike. So that is the biggest driver.  The mix we anticipated, the mix within the groups we anticipated on locomotives and mods in the original guidance. But the difference really is the inefficiencies at our facility at York -- I mean, at Erie.\nRobert Wertheimer: Perfect. Okay. Got it. And then if I can ask a different one, on hybrid electric, the wind, mining, the biggest iron ore train in the world. I don't know what the size of that market is and what your expectation for the pace of testing validation and potential future orders maybe? I wonder if you have any comments you can make.\nRafael Santana: I do. We're continuing to first make progress on battery electric. I think that order is a great example of that. We're developing a supply chain around it to make sure that we make really the overall product reliable first deliveries are happening next year. We're continuing to work actively with customers, both in North America and internationally. . There is demand out there to further expand the use of the technology. We're working with customers to really make sure that we pace as we step into it. Fuel continues to, of course, be a significant element of cost for our customers. I think there is a really significant opportunity for us to continue to grow that, and we're going to pace it as we grow into different geographies. That's I think the exciting piece. It's not a demand around one specific customer or one specific segment. I think we have an opportunity to apply that battery concept also in conjunction with, what we call, not just a hybrid product, but hybrid systems as well. I recently came back from Europe and there's, I'll call it, significant opportunity for us there as well.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is James on for Saree. So I wanted to touch on Integration 2.0. So can you provide an update on how Integration 2.0 is progressing? And how should we think about cost savings into 2024?\nJohn Olin: Great, James. So as we've talked out, when we announced Integration 2.0 a little bit over a year ago that we would invest $155 million to $165 million and expect ongoing savings of $75 million to $90 million. We're off to a great start as we talked about at the end of the '22 investment was a little bit ahead of schedule, which is a good thing.  And as we ended last year, we were at run rate savings of $5 million. In the 6 months that we've had this year, we've over doubled that, and the trajectory will continue through the remainder of 2023, and add to a fair amount of our incremental margin in the back half as well as through 2024 as we head up to that $75 million to $90 million run rate in 2025.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. That's helpful. And just following up on the Erie plant strike. So can you provide like a little bit more detail on the strike and how that is affecting the production schedule like revenue mix given that the facility was more focused on like components like customized locomotive for international and electric locomotives?\nRafael Santana: I'll start with, over the last 2 years, we have successfully reached an agreement with all of our union and nonunion side. So we're working on collaboration. We remain committed to the workforce with that, We remain optimistic that we can reach an agreement here in a timely manner. From a financial perspective, plan to realize for a variety of outcomes and contingencies here and we do not mistake any impact to the full year revenue. .\nOperator: Our next question will be from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: A quick question on the outlook. Your 5% revenue growth at 5% earnings growth. So it really implies sort of lack of leverage on that revenue. Is that just simply a mix situation that's driving that? Just any -- if you could walk us through that.\nRafael Santana: Allison, you're talking about within the quarter?\nAllison Poliniak: No, for the full year, the guidance raised nice revenue guidance raise, but EPS really just in line with that revenue guide, just implies the lower incrementals. I just want to understand if that's just purely mix, if there's something else within that that's driving sort of a lack of incrementals there. .\nJohn Olin: Sure, Allison. So yes, we're thrilled to be able to raise our revenue guidance from the midpoint of up 6% to up 12%. And driven by the underlying momentum that we've experienced, right? And that's continued from the back half of last year into the -- through the first half of this year.  When we look at the earnings guide, it was up from a midpoint of 5.65% or up 10% to up 16%. So what we're seeing is a couple of things. You're not seeing the increase in revenue coming through in earnings. And Allison, that's for 3 reasons. One is in the first quarter, we had some additional investment in our next-generation technology. for our PDS software that's dispatch software. And so that's a onetime event that kind of will bring the earnings down on a full year basis.  The second driver of that is the strike in Erie. That does have costs. Rafael mentioned, we don't expect any impact on revenue for the year, but it does have a cost. And we had cost in that in the first -- in the second quarter, but we'll also have some costs in the third quarter. So that's included in that as well, again, more on the onetime side.  And the third area is higher interest cost. As you can see in the quarter, interest was up about 25% to $11 million. We would expect interest to be higher in the back half as well. partly behind the L&M acquisition, but also the refinancing of some debt that we've got come and do. So Allison, when you take those 3 things that's the difference between the growth rate of revenue and the growth rate of earnings.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. That's very helpful. And then on the digital side, if I recall, it's always been more, I would say, cyclically sensitive and it doesn't seem to be exhibiting that sort of same trend. Is it sort of a change in how your customers are approaching that product? Is this sort of the investment that you've done that they can gain maybe even more efficiencies than they did in prior cycles so they're pushing through that investment? Just trying to understand sort of how -- why a book that's very cyclical or trend exhibit.\nRafael Santana: So a couple of points here, Allison. First. I mean, as you saw, I mean, we had significant order buildup in the last 2 years has positioned the business really well. from a backlog perspective. A good chunk of that was drilling international orders, somewhere my year agreements. As you go more international, it's a bit more lumpy. So we would expect that to play out over the different quarters. But -- and the auto comment I would make no different than the previous years. we need to really drive convertibility into the shorter-term orders that continue to deliver on the year results.  But backlog coverage is better than we've had before. We like the fundamentals of the business, but would it not to be lumpy.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Scott Group of Wolfe Research.\nIvan Yi: It's Ivan Yi on for Scott. First of all, your revenue guidance updated to $9.4 billion at the midpoint implies a 12% increase in total sales this year. How much of that 12% increase is volume versus how much of that is price?\nJohn Olin: We would look at price on a full year basis to be in the 1% to 2% range.\nIvan Yi: Perfect. And secondly, can you provide some background on the pace of absolute locomotive modernizations, meaning how many mods did you do in '22? What are you're expecting in '23? And can you talk about '24? And then lastly, what is the timing of the 60 mods for CN?\nRafael Santana: So I think we're not get into any specifics of '24. Of course, it's sort of early for that. We expect growing momentum modernization portfolio. And you see that. I think the order you just asked about CN. It's part of that, and we see that growth momentum much as going to '23. We see that momentum going into really '24 and beyond. So just a good backlog. .\nOperator: Our next question will be from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Rafael and John, I'm wondering if you could just talk about in Transit, you've had really strong bookings for 3 quarters now, The top line inflection this quarter. Are we at a point where this business has earned the right to grow, and we could see more substantial pickup in top line now that the margins are where you need them be? In other words, is there more runway based on the bookings and the performance this quarter for the momentum to continue in Transit?\nRafael Santana: Jerry, first, the fundamentals for the business remain strong. I think despite of a more competitive environment, I look at our book-to-bill ratios over 1, The 12-month backlog is up 9%. The multiyear is up double digits. But I'll tell you, while we are pleased with the progress, there's significant work ahead of us to simplify the footprint to further improve and sustain margins. We're going to have variation quarter-to-quarter but the mandates there, and the team is executing on expanding margins.  And we feel we're building competitiveness in the business. So we ultimately drive profitable growth. So it feels good from that perspective. And we're going to continue to drive that there. We continue to have opportunities.\nJerry Revich: So the point where we're putting up north of 20% top line growth. It sounds like, based on the backlog, that should continue into the back half?\nRafael Santana: So the backlog is strong, but we're also overlapping what all easy comps from last year. if you think about just the top line, if you remember, some of the disruptions we had associated with not just supply chain, but we also had, at that point, a cyber incident. .\nJerry Revich: And in Freight, really impressive performance in service in an environment where freight volumes have obviously not been very good. Can you just talk about for your Service business ex mods, what are some factors that are contributing to the performance because if all of the year-over-year sales growth was driven by mods? That would be a pretty dramatic ramp. So it feels like the core business is doing pretty well ex mods given the gap versus freight volumes. I'm wondering if you could just comment on that if you don't mind, Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Fleet is active. It's running hard, right? We the different markets we serve, say, Kazakhstan or Australia. I think there's just strong demand out there when you look at the pipeline of opportunities. So I think those things are ultimately connected.  In North America, where you could have expected that change in the active fleet. I think it's holding, holding strong. It's again back to the focus on both services. And I think we stand with a significant advantage in our fleet in terms of fuel savings, in terms of haulage capability, and reliability. And that's really critical to our customers right now.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Steve Barger, KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nRobert Barger: Can you talk about the margin profile for new business you're booking relative to the margin profile in the next 12-month backlog? And then just generally, is new business looking higher margin than old business? .\nJohn Olin: Yes. Steve, this is John. Absolutely. We've watched our margins come up over the last couple of years, and that is a function of bringing in better orders at higher profit. And so as we look forward to the backlog we've talked about, we feel great about it overall, not only from a standpoint of the revenue it will drive in the future, but also from a profitability standpoint. And it is booked at a higher margin than we've seen in the past.\nRobert Barger: Got it. And total backlog has contracted. I know it's not much, but it's been a couple of quarters now. When you think about the size of the new deals you're signing and the pipeline, versus what's scheduled to come out of backlog in the back half. Would you expect it to continue contracting this year? .\nRafael Santana: Steve, I'll tell you use [indiscernible]. Yes, the total backlog is down. It's going to be lumpy as we have those, I'll call multibillion-dollar deals. We've got more than a couple of those being worked right now, so that could drive some lumpiness. I think our focus here is making sure that we've got the convertibility moving forward. And of course, as you look into the convertibility 12 months, 18 months and 24 months. So we track that, and we feel very strong about that. And it's really in the pipeline of the deals that we're working on, and we're continuing to grow that and it's really supported by our pipeline. .\nOperator: Our next question will be from [indiscernible] of Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: [Indiscernible] on for Ken Hoexter. We've covered a lot. Maybe just to touch on the M&A pipeline. Is there anything you can share broadly about verticals or geographies of interest in this space?\nRafael Santana: Of course, I mean, we're not going to go into any of the specifics here. We are continuing to explore bolt-on acquisitions. We're going to be very opportunistic here. They will be strategic, they will drive a higher ROIC, ultimately accelerate profit for Wabtec increase shareholder value. I think L&M is really a great example of that. So we're active, really trying to make sure that we find those opportunities. .\nUnidentified Analyst: And then maybe just going over to Transit. You've mentioned a mid-teens margin target in the past. Just -- maybe give us a sense of how we are trending there versus initial expectations? Any view over the next coming years? Maybe that could be achieved earlier than initially thought.\nRafael Santana: I'll maybe start, and I'll pass it on to John. I think we're continuing the mandate. We feel strong about it. [indiscernible] and the team working on really continued trajectory. It's never study and precise. There's always some bumps along the way, but we feel strong about continuing to drive the simplification on that business improving the competitiveness and a lot of opportunities here. .\nJohn Olin: Yes. And as I mentioned earlier on the question on Integration 2.0, right? We're going to see that continue to ramp. The majority of the benefit will accrue to our Transit group. So we feel great about consolidation and the integration that's happening here and the results that it's starting to spin. And part of the benefit we saw in margin growth in Transit in the quarter was due to Integration 2.0.  And the other one is, the other question with regards to the backlog. We continue to bring in volume in the backlog, we're very focused on making sure that it is coming in at a higher margin. And we are focused on bringing in good, profitable business versus revenue in the Transit Group.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Matt Elkott, TD Cowen.\nMatthew Elkott: On the 69 certified preowned locomotives, do you guys foresee any similar opportunities going forward? And if you can provide some insight maybe on to like the revenue and margin profiles of those locomotives, if not on an absolute basis, at least kind of relative to mods?\nRafael Santana: I'm not going to get into the specifics of that program. But what I'll tell you, that program provides a significant opportunity for us to, number one, as we think about our products, it's how we cascade those products down. So they're not just on core mainline, we often focus a lot of the dialogue here around 16,000 locomotives that we got running out there. There's a number of auto locomotives running in short lines in yards, and we see an opportunity to cascade that fleet down antiquated with a fleet that's more efficient, it causes less emissions, able to pull more.  So a lot of those same fundamentals. And I think that's where we look at building and it provides, again, a significant strength for our Services business as there will be a pull there in terms of providing spare parts and things like that. So really excited about gaining momentum on that front, sure.\nMatthew Elkott: And Rafael, also it sounds like this is not that you guys have done actively to any meaningful extent in the past and it's kind of a fairly new area for you, these certified preowned units.\nRafael Santana: I'd say we've done some of that for the class ones, especially bringing, what I'll call, older Dash nice and modernizing those into AC technology. I think it's the first time we do with like a short line. And I think there is a significant opportunity there. So you're right about that.\nMatthew Elkott: Okay. And then are these -- is the guidance raise partly in part because of this order that you got, I think you got it last month? .\nRafael Santana: I would say that -- I would say not. There'll be a little bit in there, but not to the extent to drive the overall guidance, Matt. It's the underlying momentum we've talked about for the last year continues to come at us and the backlog continues to fill. It'll be more of an impact on the future growth as we look to '24 and beyond.\nJohn Olin: Exactly.\nMatthew Elkott: Got it. And then just one question on the 30 new loco orders in North America. You called them strategic. Can you tell us what that means? And given the fact that it's good to see new orders starting to come back in North America over the past year or so, what does that mean to the new build versus mod mix for next year?\nRafael Santana: I think it just validates what we've been saying, I mean, in some cases, customers will look at modernization as a better solution for some of the fleet dynamics they've got, in some other cases, it's going to come with really new locomotives. And so we see both active, and I think the fact that you continue to see that. I think that's really a positive in terms of the dynamics that we're looking into the North America market.  So there is really a commitment to continue to drive service to invest in the fleets that are really at this stage at the oldest levels in at least a couple of decades. So a good opportunity here.\nJohn Olin: And Matt, from a financial standpoint, we're pretty indifferent whether it's a modernization or a new, right? We talked about new comes with a higher revenue and modernization with a higher margin. And so overall, we're pretty indifferent as long as they're Wabtec locomotives, we're good.\nMatthew Elkott: And if I missed it, did you guys say what the purpose of those? These are just diesel locomotives for replacement? Or is there a technology element?\nRafael Santana: I think there's both. I mean, there's certainly a technology element here, and they're going to be used to really pull freight more efficiently about there.\nOperator: Next question will be from Steve Barger, KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nRobert Barger: Just a quick clarification. I think you said the Erie situation could be a swing factor in the back half, but I also thought I heard you say that it would be onetime. So can you clarify if expected costs from that are included or excluded in the back half EPS range? .\nRafael Santana: They are absolutely included in our revised guidance, Steve?\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Kristine Kubacki for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for your time today. We appreciate it, and we look forward to talking with you next quarter. Goodbye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Olin",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael, and hello, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I will review our second quarter results in more detail. We delivered another strong quarter of operational and financial performance with underlying business momentum strengthening through the first half of the year.  Sales for the second quarter were $2.41 billion, which reflects a 17.5% increase versus the prior year. Sales were driven by strong growth across all major product lines.  For the quarter, GAAP operating income was up $48 million, driven by higher sales. Adjusted operating margin in Q2 was 16.4%, down 0.3 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefits of higher sales were offset by a less rich mix of sales between and within segments.  GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.06, an which was up 16.5% versus the second quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pretax charges of $10 million for restructuring which was primarily related to our Integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec's operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025.  In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.41, up 14.6% versus the prior year.  Overall, Wabtec executed a good quarter and a strong first half of 2023. We outperformed our expectations, demonstrating the underlying strength and momentum of business and as a result, we are raising our full year outlook for sales and adjusted earnings.  Now turning to Slide 9. Let's review our product lines in more detail. Second quarter consolidated sales were very strong, up 17.5%. Equipment sales were up 8.9% due to higher locomotive sales this quarter versus last year's second quarter.  Components sales were up 23.1% versus last year, largely driven by the higher OE railcar build and an increase in our market share due to product availability, along with increased demand for industrial products. We also closed the strategic acquisition of L&M late in the quarter, which did not have an impact on components sales during the quarter.  Digital Intelligence sales were up 18.9%, which was driven by robust demand for onboard locomotive products and international PTC, along with revenue contribution from the acquisitions in Q2 of last year.  Our Services sales grew 13.9% and Sales growth was driven by higher sales from increased modernization deliveries and increased parts sales. Our customers continue to recognize a serial performance, reliability, efficiency, and availability across their Wabtec locomotive fleets.  Across our Transit segment, OE and aftermarket sales significantly increased versus last year. Segment sales were up 25.3% to $699 million. The momentum in this segment is strong across our core markets as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonization accelerate the need for investments in sustainable infrastructure.  Moving to Slide 10. As forecasted, gross profit margin was slightly lower, driven by a less rich mix and higher manufacturing costs. Mix was unfavorable driven by strong sales from the Transit segment and higher sales of new locomotives and modernizations within the Freight segment. Raw material costs, while still elevated, were largely flat on a year-over-year basis. Foreign currency exchange was unfavorable to sales by $7 million or 0.3 percentage point, and it reduced our second quarter gross profits by $2 million.  Finally, manufacturing costs were positively impacted by favorable fixed cost absorption more than offset by manufacturing inefficiencies at our Erie facility in June.  Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of continued cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lean initiatives.  Turning to Slide 11. For the second quarter, GAAP operating margin was 12.9%, which was flat versus last year, while adjusted operating margin declined 0.3 percentage points to 16.4%. SG&A was $285 million, and adjusted SG&A was $283 million, both of which were up versus the prior year, but down significantly as a percent of sales.  Engineering expense increased from last year according to plan, yet was down 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of sales at 2.2%. We continue to invest in engineering resources and current business opportunities but more importantly, we are investing in our future as the leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization and safety.  Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 12, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales were strong for the quarter, up 14.6%. The GAAP segment operating income was $271 million for an operating margin of 15.9%, up 0.2 percentage points versus last year. Adjusted operating income for the Freight segment was $346 million, up 15% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the Freight segment was flat with prior year at 20.3%. The benefits of increased sales, including fixed cost absorption and lower SG&A as a percentage of revenue were offset by unfavorable mix from higher sales of international locos and modernizations as well as nonrecurring expenses from our labor negotiations in Erie.  Finally, segment multiyear backlog was $18.3 billion, down 6.8% from the end of Q2 last year, while the 12-month backlog was $5.3 billion, up 10.3% over the same period. The 12-month backlog continues to show momentum beyond 2023. Conversely, the year-over-year reduction in the backlog was driven by lapping last year's significant multiyear order from Union Pacific for over $1 billion of modernizations.  Now turning to Slide 13. Transit segment sales were up 25.3%, driven by strong OE and aftermarket sales. GAAP operating income was $66 million, up 32.0% and GAAP operating income increased as a result of higher sales and benefits from our Integration 2.0 activities, partially offset by higher restructuring costs. Adjusted segment operating income was $76 million which was up 31.0%. This resulted in adjusted operating margin of 11.1%, up 0.8 percentage point from last year.  Finally, Transit segment multiyear backlog for the quarter was $4.1 billion, up 15.4% versus a year ago.  Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 14. We Q2 cash from operations was $115 million. While cash flow benefited from higher earnings, we are continuing to invest in the businesses growth, which is driving working capital higher, in particular, receivables and inventory. Despite that, we continue to drive toward a greater than 90% cash conversion for the full year.  Our debt leverage ratio was 2.4x at the end of the second quarter, which was flat versus prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of L&M. As we look forward, we have a $250 million senior note at 4.38% coming due in August. We intend to roll that debt into our delayed draw term facility.  I'd like to spend just a moment on providing some additional color on L&M. As Rafael mentioned, during the quarter, we completed the bolt-on acquisition of L&M. This strategic acquisition will extend and complement our portfolio of premium heat transfer solutions in mining. We purchased L&M for $223 million in cash, and the business is expected to have calendar year 2023 sales of about $130 million.  And finally, we returned $105 million of capital back to shareholders in the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong, and we continue to allocate capital in a balanced strategy to maximize shareholder returns.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael. Great, Justin. This is John. Justin, when we look at the back half cadence, starting with revenue, we would expect the majority of our revenue growth to come in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter. And again, this is due to the way that the orders have come in and production is scheduled as well as we got a little lapping benefit over a slightly easier comp from a revenue standpoint.  When we look at the earnings side or margin side of the equation, we would see the opposite or expect the opposite, Justin. We would expect the majority of our earnings growth our margin growth to come in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And that is simply because we're lapping a much easier comp in the fourth quarter of last year than we have in the third quarter. Okay, Rob, this is John. Looking at the quarter, we came in -- margin came in 16.4%, down 0.3 percentage point. As we talked about in the earlier quarter, we expected the first half to be flat on margin. So margins were down a little bit more than we expected. The key driver of that, Rob, was the inefficiencies we're experiencing at our facility in Erie behind the strike. So that is the biggest driver.  The mix we anticipated, the mix within the groups we anticipated on locomotives and mods in the original guidance. But the difference really is the inefficiencies at our facility at York -- I mean, at Erie. Great, James. So as we've talked out, when we announced Integration 2.0 a little bit over a year ago that we would invest $155 million to $165 million and expect ongoing savings of $75 million to $90 million. We're off to a great start as we talked about at the end of the '22 investment was a little bit ahead of schedule, which is a good thing.  And as we ended last year, we were at run rate savings of $5 million. In the 6 months that we've had this year, we've over doubled that, and the trajectory will continue through the remainder of 2023, and add to a fair amount of our incremental margin in the back half as well as through 2024 as we head up to that $75 million to $90 million run rate in 2025. Sure, Allison. So yes, we're thrilled to be able to raise our revenue guidance from the midpoint of up 6% to up 12%. And driven by the underlying momentum that we've experienced, right? And that's continued from the back half of last year into the -- through the first half of this year.  When we look at the earnings guide, it was up from a midpoint of 5.65% or up 10% to up 16%. So what we're seeing is a couple of things. You're not seeing the increase in revenue coming through in earnings. And Allison, that's for 3 reasons. One is in the first quarter, we had some additional investment in our next-generation technology. for our PDS software that's dispatch software. And so that's a onetime event that kind of will bring the earnings down on a full year basis.  The second driver of that is the strike in Erie. That does have costs. Rafael mentioned, we don't expect any impact on revenue for the year, but it does have a cost. And we had cost in that in the first -- in the second quarter, but we'll also have some costs in the third quarter. So that's included in that as well, again, more on the onetime side.  And the third area is higher interest cost. As you can see in the quarter, interest was up about 25% to $11 million. We would expect interest to be higher in the back half as well. partly behind the L&M acquisition, but also the refinancing of some debt that we've got come and do. So Allison, when you take those 3 things that's the difference between the growth rate of revenue and the growth rate of earnings. We would look at price on a full year basis to be in the 1% to 2% range. Yes. Steve, this is John. Absolutely. We've watched our margins come up over the last couple of years, and that is a function of bringing in better orders at higher profit. And so as we look forward to the backlog we've talked about, we feel great about it overall, not only from a standpoint of the revenue it will drive in the future, but also from a profitability standpoint. And it is booked at a higher margin than we've seen in the past. Yes. And as I mentioned earlier on the question on Integration 2.0, right? We're going to see that continue to ramp. The majority of the benefit will accrue to our Transit group. So we feel great about consolidation and the integration that's happening here and the results that it's starting to spin. And part of the benefit we saw in margin growth in Transit in the quarter was due to Integration 2.0.  And the other one is, the other question with regards to the backlog. We continue to bring in volume in the backlog, we're very focused on making sure that it is coming in at a higher margin. And we are focused on bringing in good, profitable business versus revenue in the Transit Group. Exactly. And Matt, from a financial standpoint, we're pretty indifferent whether it's a modernization or a new, right? We talked about new comes with a higher revenue and modernization with a higher margin. And so overall, we're pretty indifferent as long as they're Wabtec locomotives, we're good."

            "content": "Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4. I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter, and progress against our long-term value creation framework, and then John will cover the financials.  We delivered another strong quarter, evidenced by robust sales and earnings per share growth. We achieved these despite continued volatility and economic challenges. Sales were $2.41 billion, which was up 17.5% versus prior year. Revenue was driven by strong performance from both the Freight and Transit segments. Total cash flow from operations was $115 million. Overall, our financial position remained strong. We continued to execute against our capital allocation framework to maximize shareholder value by investing for the future growth, executing on the strategic M&A like our recent acquisition of L&M, and returning cash to shareholders.  The 12-month backlog was $7.2 billion, up 10%, signifying growing momentum and visibility across the business. The total multiyear backlog was $22.4 billion. Overall, the Wabtec team delivered a strong second quarter, marking a good first half of 2023.  Looking forward, I'm encouraged by the underlying strength and robust momentum across the business. Wabtec is well-positioned to continue driving profitable growth even amidst a challenging economy.  Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about our 2023 end market expectations for -- in more details. As we look at key metrics across our Freight business, we remain encouraged by the underlying business momentum and our robust pipeline of opportunities across geographies. North America carloads continue to be down in the quarter and locomotive parkings moved up slightly as we exited the second quarter, but better than we had anticipated as customers prioritize service and fluidity.  We continue to see significant opportunities across the globe in demand for new locomotives, modernizations and digital solutions as our customers invest in solutions that continue to drive reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency.  Looking at the North American railcar builds demand for railcar continues to show growth. The industry outlook for 2023 is for about 45,000 cars to be delivered. Overall, we believe we have an opportunity to continue building significant long-term momentum with growth in modernizations, new locomotive sales, railcar builds, and digital solutions.  Internationally, activity is strong in core markets, such as Brazil, Australia, India, and the CIS region, significant investments to expand and upgrade infrastructure are supporting a very strong international order pipeline.  Finally, moving to the Transit sector, the mega trends remain in place, driving the need for clean, safe and efficient transportation solutions around the globe.  Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few recent business highlights. In North America, we secured several key wins, including orders for 30 new locomotives and order for 69 locomotives under our certified preowned program and an order for 60 modernizations from Canadian National that closed after the end of the quarter.  In Australia, we recently won a strategic order for 17 locomotives from CBH, which will support the continued growth of agricultural commodities in the region.  And with regards to our zero emissions portfolio, we also recently signed a strategic order with Vale for 3 flex drive locomotives. These locomotives will pull the world's largest iron ore train, and is expected to remove 63,000 tons of carbon, the equivalent of 14,000 passenger cars per year.  In Transit, we won a major order to supply passenger information systems and Pentagraphs for up to 504 stabler cars for Germany and Austria.  And finally, during June, we completed the bolt-on acquisition of L&M. This strategic acquisition will enhance Wabtec's existing heat transfer portfolio, and we will extend our installed base in mining, providing a solid platform for domestic and international profitable growth.  All of this demonstrates the growing momentum across the business, the team's relentless focus on delivering for our customers and a strong pipeline of opportunities we continue to execute on, Wabtec is well-positioned to continue to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers' most pressing needs.  Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to highlight how Wabtec will provide efficient solutions for our customers by driving their productivity, reducing fuel consumption, and improving safety, while leading the decarbonization of rail across the industry. Wabtec is uniquely positioned to shape a more sustainable future for rail by inventing and developing technologies that provide customers with adaptable and efficient solutions to meet their carbon reduction goals, while providing strong investment returns to our customers given improved reliability, haulageability and fuel efficiency.  Ultimately, we will help lead the industry towards a zero-emissions rail network and we have already started laying that path to get there through new locomotives, modernizations with advancements in utilizing renewable and biofuels, leading in battery electric applications, investing in hydrogen technology, and providing a wide range of digital solutions.  With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results and our overall financial performance. John? Thanks, John. Let's flip to Slide 15 to discuss our updated 2023 financial guidance. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and solutions is growing across our business. Our order pipeline and 12-month backlog continued to strengthen, providing solid visibility for profitable growth for the rest of 2023 and beyond. . The team is committed to driving strong top line growth while managing costs. We are also committed to driving adjusted margin expansion in 2023 despite a so challenging macro environment. With these factors in mind, we are increasing our previous guidance. We now expect 2023 sales of $9.25 billion to $9.5 billion, up 12% from last year at the midpoint and adjusted EPS to be between $5.50 and $5.80 per share, up 16% at the midpoint.  We also expect cash flow conversions to be greater than 90%. Now let's wrap up on Slide 16. As you heard today, our team delivered another strong quarter to the year despite an uncertain and volatile environment. Thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world-class team, innovative solutions and our relentless focus on our customers.  Our results remain on track for us to deliver on our 5-year outlook that we provided at our Investor Day last year, with strong item across the portfolio, increased visibility through our strengthening order pipeline, and a rigorous focus on execution Wabtec is well-positioned to drive profitable long-term growth and maximize shareholder returns.  With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning. And I'll now turn the call over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine? Justin, you're right. So I think we'll see, especially as we go into the second half of the year, and beyond the second half, I think you'll see acceleration of growth in services. Some of that, I mean, you see it with some recent order that we announced here. So mods is a growth case continuing to us moving forward, so that continues to be a positive.  When it comes down to parkings, We're seeing really active fleet staying steady side, any element of really fluctuation within the year, but the focus on services continues, and we feel very good about our fleet stamps out there providing really, I'll call, significant benefits to the customer when compared to our competitors' fleets. And that's both in terms of reliability, availability, fuel efficiency, which is a significant element here. We stand with really feel better than in average more than 5% on every single one of our platforms. So we don't expect no signs of any significant changes on that active fleet eater. Yes. I'll start just with, I feel very good about our overall backlog. I feel strong about the pipeline of opportunities that the team is working on. I think the overall underlying growth fundamentals of the business is also strong. As you said, the 12 months is up 10%. It's accelerating. Last quarter was 4.4%.  The current total backlog is also healthy. So while it's down 3.5%, I look at it in conjunction with the multiyear $1 billion order that we got from Union Pacific and the auto multibillion-dollar auditor opportunities were being worked right now and with the team. So we see good momentum internationally. We see it in North America. It's positive. We're progressing, and we're continuing to grow and our pipeline supports it.  In terms of the convertibility, the 12 months, already provides you a view into '24, and we continue to see strength in the pipeline. First half versus second half of the year. That's where I made the comment. It continues. I mean, as you saw, I think the demand for a lot of the solutions we have there continues to be robust. We have an opportunity to modernize a significant part of the fleet there. I think customers are really looking into it. You see based on the announcement we just made yesterday. When you're looking at 18% fuel savings, 40% improvement on reliability, 55% on pulling power. Those are significant numbers that are really compelling in terms of driving, not the quality of the service you're providing to your customers, but reducing your costs. And I think that these some of the fundamentals will continue to build on growth for the modernization of the fleet and demand for new units as well. . I do. We're continuing to first make progress on battery electric. I think that order is a great example of that. We're developing a supply chain around it to make sure that we make really the overall product reliable first deliveries are happening next year. We're continuing to work actively with customers, both in North America and internationally. . There is demand out there to further expand the use of the technology. We're working with customers to really make sure that we pace as we step into it. Fuel continues to, of course, be a significant element of cost for our customers. I think there is a really significant opportunity for us to continue to grow that, and we're going to pace it as we grow into different geographies. That's I think the exciting piece. It's not a demand around one specific customer or one specific segment. I think we have an opportunity to apply that battery concept also in conjunction with, what we call, not just a hybrid product, but hybrid systems as well. I recently came back from Europe and there's, I'll call it, significant opportunity for us there as well. I'll start with, over the last 2 years, we have successfully reached an agreement with all of our union and nonunion side. So we're working on collaboration. We remain committed to the workforce with that, We remain optimistic that we can reach an agreement here in a timely manner. From a financial perspective, plan to realize for a variety of outcomes and contingencies here and we do not mistake any impact to the full year revenue. . Allison, you're talking about within the quarter? So a couple of points here, Allison. First. I mean, as you saw, I mean, we had significant order buildup in the last 2 years has positioned the business really well. from a backlog perspective. A good chunk of that was drilling international orders, somewhere my year agreements. As you go more international, it's a bit more lumpy. So we would expect that to play out over the different quarters. But -- and the auto comment I would make no different than the previous years. we need to really drive convertibility into the shorter-term orders that continue to deliver on the year results.  But backlog coverage is better than we've had before. We like the fundamentals of the business, but would it not to be lumpy. So I think we're not get into any specifics of '24. Of course, it's sort of early for that. We expect growing momentum modernization portfolio. And you see that. I think the order you just asked about CN. It's part of that, and we see that growth momentum much as going to '23. We see that momentum going into really '24 and beyond. So just a good backlog. . Jerry, first, the fundamentals for the business remain strong. I think despite of a more competitive environment, I look at our book-to-bill ratios over 1, The 12-month backlog is up 9%. The multiyear is up double digits. But I'll tell you, while we are pleased with the progress, there's significant work ahead of us to simplify the footprint to further improve and sustain margins. We're going to have variation quarter-to-quarter but the mandates there, and the team is executing on expanding margins.  And we feel we're building competitiveness in the business. So we ultimately drive profitable growth. So it feels good from that perspective. And we're going to continue to drive that there. We continue to have opportunities. So the backlog is strong, but we're also overlapping what all easy comps from last year. if you think about just the top line, if you remember, some of the disruptions we had associated with not just supply chain, but we also had, at that point, a cyber incident. . Fleet is active. It's running hard, right? We the different markets we serve, say, Kazakhstan or Australia. I think there's just strong demand out there when you look at the pipeline of opportunities. So I think those things are ultimately connected.  In North America, where you could have expected that change in the active fleet. I think it's holding, holding strong. It's again back to the focus on both services. And I think we stand with a significant advantage in our fleet in terms of fuel savings, in terms of haulage capability, and reliability. And that's really critical to our customers right now. Steve, I'll tell you use [indiscernible]. Yes, the total backlog is down. It's going to be lumpy as we have those, I'll call multibillion-dollar deals. We've got more than a couple of those being worked right now, so that could drive some lumpiness. I think our focus here is making sure that we've got the convertibility moving forward. And of course, as you look into the convertibility 12 months, 18 months and 24 months. So we track that, and we feel very strong about that. And it's really in the pipeline of the deals that we're working on, and we're continuing to grow that and it's really supported by our pipeline. . Of course, I mean, we're not going to go into any of the specifics here. We are continuing to explore bolt-on acquisitions. We're going to be very opportunistic here. They will be strategic, they will drive a higher ROIC, ultimately accelerate profit for Wabtec increase shareholder value. I think L&M is really a great example of that. So we're active, really trying to make sure that we find those opportunities. . I'll maybe start, and I'll pass it on to John. I think we're continuing the mandate. We feel strong about it. [indiscernible] and the team working on really continued trajectory. It's never study and precise. There's always some bumps along the way, but we feel strong about continuing to drive the simplification on that business improving the competitiveness and a lot of opportunities here. . I'm not going to get into the specifics of that program. But what I'll tell you, that program provides a significant opportunity for us to, number one, as we think about our products, it's how we cascade those products down. So they're not just on core mainline, we often focus a lot of the dialogue here around 16,000 locomotives that we got running out there. There's a number of auto locomotives running in short lines in yards, and we see an opportunity to cascade that fleet down antiquated with a fleet that's more efficient, it causes less emissions, able to pull more.  So a lot of those same fundamentals. And I think that's where we look at building and it provides, again, a significant strength for our Services business as there will be a pull there in terms of providing spare parts and things like that. So really excited about gaining momentum on that front, sure. I'd say we've done some of that for the class ones, especially bringing, what I'll call, older Dash nice and modernizing those into AC technology. I think it's the first time we do with like a short line. And I think there is a significant opportunity there. So you're right about that. I would say that -- I would say not. There'll be a little bit in there, but not to the extent to drive the overall guidance, Matt. It's the underlying momentum we've talked about for the last year continues to come at us and the backlog continues to fill. It'll be more of an impact on the future growth as we look to '24 and beyond. I think it just validates what we've been saying, I mean, in some cases, customers will look at modernization as a better solution for some of the fleet dynamics they've got, in some other cases, it's going to come with really new locomotives. And so we see both active, and I think the fact that you continue to see that. I think that's really a positive in terms of the dynamics that we're looking into the North America market.  So there is really a commitment to continue to drive service to invest in the fleets that are really at this stage at the oldest levels in at least a couple of decades. So a good opportunity here. I think there's both. I mean, there's certainly a technology element here, and they're going to be used to really pull freight more efficiently about there. They are absolutely included in our revised guidance, Steve?"

We delivered a strong start to the year, which is evidenced by robust sales and earnings per share growth. We achieved this despite a volatile and uncertain macro environment. Sales were roughly $2.2 billion, which was up 14% versus prior year. Revenue was driven by strong performance across the freight and transit segments, but partially offset by unfavorable effects. Total cash flow used for operations was $25 million. Overall, our financial position remains strong. We continue to allocate capital to maximize shareholder returns by investing from future growth, executing on a strategic M&A and returning cash to shareholders. Total multi-year backlog was $22.3 billion down 2% year-over-year, and excluding the headwinds from FX, backlog was down four tenths of a percent from last year. The 12-month backlog again grew to a new high of $6.9 billion. Overall, we have a strong start to the year. The underlying strength and momentum of the business is evidence. And we\u2019re well positioned to continue to drive profitable growth, even with uncertainty and volatility in the global economy. We remain confident in our ability to execute on our rigorous operating principles as we continue to deliver for our customers and make progress against our long-term growth strategies. Shifting our focus to Slide 5, let\u2019s talk about our 2023 end market expectations in more details. As we look at key metrics across our freight businesses, we remain encouraged by the underlying business momentum in our robust pipeline of opportunities. North America carloads were down in the quarter, but locomotive parkings are slightly lower than the same time last year, despite lower freight traffic. We continue to see significant opportunities in demand for modernizations and new locomotives as our customers invest in solutions that continue to drive reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency. Looking at the North America railcar build, demand for rail cars continued to show strength. As a result, the industry outlook for 2023 is for 40 to 45,000 cars to be delivered. Overall, we believe we have an opportunity to continue building significant long-term momentum, with growth in modernisations in locomotive sales, in railcar belts, and in digital solutions. Internationally activity also continues to show positive signs, and we continue to grow our install base of locomotives around the world. Finally, transitioning through the transit sector the secular drivers remaining place as the need for clean, safe and efficient transportation solutions continue to increase across the world. Next, let\u2019s turn to slide 6, to discuss a few recent business highlights. We recently signed a strategic order for new locomotives in Brazil with VLI, which results from the growing investments in Brazil\u2019s infrastructure to support growing rail volumes. We also secured a key order for our new Ultra class mining drive system, specifically targeted for high altitude applications. Reflecting on the resilience of the business, the strength of our balance sheet, and our ability to generate strong cash flow, Moody\u2019s recently upgraded while Wabtec\u2019s credit rating. And finally, our team in India achieved a significant milestone by delivering 500 locomotives in a 1000 unit order to Indian railways. As one of the region\u2019s largest rail equipment suppliers the team has positioned Wabtec and our customers for growth for years to come. All of this demonstrates the underlying momentum in the business, the team\u2019s relentless focus on execution and the strong pipeline of opportunities we continue to deliver on. Wabtec\u2019s well positioned to continue to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customer\u2019s most pressing needs. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results and our overall financial performance, John?\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Raphael and good morning. Turning to slide 7, I\u2019ll review our first quarter results in more detail. We started the year with another good quarter of operational and financial performance, despite continued challenges in foreign currency exchange, and still elevated input costs. Sales for the first quarter were $2.19 billion, which reflects a 13.9% increase versus the prior year. Sales were driven by very strong trade segments sales, which were up 18.5% from last year. Q1 sales were once again negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, which reduced our revenue growth in the quarter by 2.9 percentage points. For the quarter, GAAP operating income was up $37 million driven by higher sales. Adjusted operating margin in Q1 was 16.4%, down 0.1 percentage points versus the prior year as we had expected. The benefits of higher sales were offset by a less rich mix of sales between business groups and higher next generation product development costs. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.93, which was up 16.3% versus the first quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pretax charges of $9 million for restructuring, which was related to our integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec\u2019s operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. In the quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share, were $1.28 up 13.3% versus the prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another solid quarter of results demonstrating the underlying strength and momentum of the business and our ability to navigate through volatile macroeconomic conditions. Turning to slide 8, let\u2019s review our product lines in more detail. First quarter consolidated sales were very strong up 13.9%. Excluding foreign currency exchange, sales were up 16.8%. Equipment sales were up 43.4% from last year, due to higher locomotive sales this quarter versus last year. Component sales were up 21.8% versus last year, largely driven by higher OE railcar build and an increase in our market share due to product availability, along with increased demand for industrial products. Digital Intelligence sales were up 22.2% which was driven by robust demand for onboard locomotive products and international PTC along with revenue contribution from the strategic bolt-on acquisitions of Beena Vision and ARINC last year. Our services sales grew 6.2% versus last year. The increase was driven by higher sales from a larger active fleet partially offset by the timing of mags deliveries in the year. The superior performance reliability and availability of our fleet continues to drive increased customer demand for our services and solutions. Across our transit segment, sales increased 3.8% versus prior year to $628 million. Absent the impacts of foreign currency exchange, transit sales would have been up 9.6%. The momentum in this segment remains positive as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonisation accelerate the need for investments in green infrastructure. Now moving to slide 9, as forecasted, gross profit margin was slightly lower driven by a less rich mix, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and higher manufacturing costs. Mix was unfavorable, driven by strong sales of locomotives and our equipment business. Raw material costs, while still elevated are largely flat on a year-over-year basis. Foreign Currency Exchange adversely impacted revenues by 2.9 percentage points, and adversely impacted first quarter gross profits by $14 million. Finally, manufacturing costs were positively impacted by productivity gains and higher absorption offset by higher digital development costs. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lean initiatives. Turning to slide 10, for the first quarter GAAP operating margin improved 0.2 percentage points to 12.6% while adjusted operating margin declined slightly to 16.4%. GAAP SG&A was $263 million and adjusted SG&A was $258 million, both of which were up versus prior year, but down as a percentage of sales. Engineering expense increased from last year according to plan and was flat as a percentage of sales at 2.3%. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities. But more importantly, we are investing in our future as a industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers productivity, capacity, utilization, and safety. Now let\u2019s take a look at the segment results on slide 11. Starting with the freight segment, as I already discussed freight segments sales were strong for the quarter up 18.5%. GAAP segment operating income was $227 million for an operating margin of 14.5% up 0.2 percentage points versus last year. Segment adjusted operating income was $297 million up 14.7% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the freight segment was 19.0%. Adjusted operating margin was down six tenths of a percentage point on a year-over-year basis. The benefits of increased sales, including fixed absorption and lower SG&A as a percentage of revenue were more than offset by unfavorable mix and higher next generation product development costs in our digital group. Finally, segment backlog was $18.4 billion down 3.5% from the end of Q1 last year. On a constant currency basis, segment backlog was down 2.3%. The year-over-year reduction in backlog was driven by lapping last year\u2019s multi-year order for modernizations. Now turning to slide 12, transit segment sales were up 3.8% driven by higher aftermarket sales, partially offset by negative effects of foreign currency exchange. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange adversely impacted segments sales by 5.8 percentage points. GAAP operating income was $69 million up 6.2%. GAAP operating income increased as a result of higher sales, improved mix from aftermarket sales and benefits from our integration 2.0 activities partially offset by higher restructuring costs. Adjusted segment operating income was $83 million, which was up 12.2%. This resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 13.1% up 0.8 percentage points from last year. Finally, transit segment backlog for the quarter was $4.0 billion up 6.3% versus a year ago, on a constant currency basis backlog would have been up 9.3%. Now let\u2019s turn to our financial position on slide 13. Q1 cash used for operations was $25 million. While cash flow benefited from higher earnings, we are continuing to invest in the business\u2019s growth, which is driving working capital higher in particular, receivables and inventory. Despite that we continue to expect greater than 90% cash conversion for the full year. Our debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter declined to 2.3 times versus the prior year. And our liquidity was robust at $2 billion. As Raphael mentioned, during the quarter, Moody\u2019s upgraded our credit rating, which reflects the strength of the balance sheet and the outlook for continued strong cash flow. With the Moody\u2019s upgrade. Wabtec is rated investment grade across all three rating agencies. And finally, we returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders in the quarter with $209 million returned through share repurchases and dividends. As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong and we continue to allocate capital and a balanced strategy to maximize shareholder returns. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, John. Let\u2019s flip to slide 14 to discuss our 2023 financial guidance. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and solutions remain strong across our product lines and our backlog continues to provide good visibility into 2023 and beyond. The team is committed to driving strong top line growth while managing costs. We\u2019re also committed to driving adjusted margin expansion in 2023 despite FX volatility our still challenging cost environment and continued supply chain disruptions. With this factors in mind, we are reiterating our previous guidance, we continue to expect 2023 sales of $8.7 billion to $9 billion and adjusted EPS, to be between $5.15 and $5.55 per share. We also expect cash flow conversion to be greater than 90%. Now, let\u2019s wrap up on slide 15. As you heard today, our team delivered a strong start to the year despite a challenging and volatile environment, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world class team, innovative solutions and our relentless focus on our customers. Our results remain on track for us to deliver on our five year outlook, that we provided our investor day last year, with strong momentum across the portfolio, increased visibility through our multiyear backlog and rigorous focus on execution, Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable long-term growth and maximize shareholder returns. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion, Kristine?\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you Raphael. We will now move on to questions. But before we do and out of consideration for others on the call, I ask you that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up question. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Justin Long of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJustin Long: Thanks. And good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning, Justin.\nJustin Long: I was wondering if you could help us think through the assumption in your guidance for North American locomotive utilization over the rest of the year. What percentage of the locomotive fleet are you assuming gets parked by the end of 2023? And as we think about your sensitivity to that, is there any way you could speak to the percentage of your freight services revenue that\u2019s transaction based that would be impacted by that trend.\nRafael Santana: So Justin, I\u2019ll start with a strong quarter. We finished with a strong pipeline of opportunities. And I think we continue to add on some really important options here for multiyear orders. As you look into the quarter specifically, I would say revenues were a bit higher. Piece of that was the alleviation of the supply chain. But the other one was really a piece of, I\u2019ll call, locomotive parkings being actually a positive. So there were lower parking than we had for last year. That\u2019s not what we have planned for the year. The plan for the year was to locomotive parkings to be up. So with that, we do expect that to be more amplified in the second half of the year. For the first half, I think we will continue to be a positive. I think ultimately, a lot of that\u2019s going to depend on the improvement of both velocity and well times. And that\u2019s, I think, ultimately going to be determinant. So I wanted to speculate, I think we feel very strong about the dynamics of the year based on the backlog that we have. The convertibility really is high for the year. At this point, we moved into a new high from the 12-month backlog. So we feel confident about our ability to deliver on the guidance that we provided at this point.\nJustin Long: Okay. Great. And on the percentage of your freight services business that\u2019s tied \u2013 it\u2019s more transaction-based. John, is there any color on that you could provide?\nJohn Olin: Well, out of the $2.5 billion, a good $2 billion of it is tied to the service contracts, right? And if the locomotives are running, we\u2019re earning and if they\u2019re parked, we don\u2019t. So we don\u2019t provide, Justin, the amount in our forecast. But as Rafael had mentioned, on a full year basis, we expected the parkings to grow, be up, which would be a headwind to revenue. What we saw in the first quarter was a slight reduction. So again, a little bit of a benefit. And that drove a little bit more revenue than what we expected in the quarter. But on a full year basis, Justin, we would expect to get to that target or even a little bit higher. And the reason I say a little bit higher is that, if you remember last quarter, we talked about our assumption on carloads, and that was for flat. And coming out of the first quarter, flat doesn\u2019t feel is likely now given the fact that carloads were down to 3.6%. So that could amplify a little bit of the parking. But Justin, to answer your question specifically, we don\u2019t provide that number. But we\u2019ve got 16,000 of them running in North America and the fewer that run a little bit less that we get in revenue.\nJustin Long: Understood. And as a follow-up, John, you were helpful last quarter and helping us think through the quarterly cadence that\u2019s baked into the guidance in terms of both revenue and operating margins. Just curious if you have any updated thoughts as we look out the rest of the year based on what\u2019s coming in the backlog mix, etcetera?\nJohn Olin: Yes. Great question, Justin. So we talked about last time, it was around margin as well as revenue. And starting with margin, we had said that we expect the margin to grow on a full year basis in line with our long-term plans. And that growth would all come in the back half. So we expect the first half on margin to be flat, and that\u2019s really where we\u2019re at. On a year-over-year basis, actually, we\u2019re down about 0.1% so kind of check on that one. We feel good about where we\u2019re at versus our plan, and that leads us to revenue. And last time we talked about revenue, growing faster in the first half than the second half. And again, we had strong revenue growth in the first quarter. As Rafael had mentioned that revenue growth did exceed our expectations. And when we looked at putting the plan together, Justin, we look from launching from the fourth quarter, right? And when you take out currency, the fourth quarter was up 15.7%. And we expected a little bit of tempering from the fourth quarter. And what we got is a little bit of an acceleration, and we ended up ex currency at 16.8%. And so that difference of revenue, some of that\u2019s being pulled from the back half. So that was driven by three things. One is our assumption on supply disruption. It was a little bit more front-loaded than we had planned. So that drove a little bit more. The second area we talked about parkings. We had forecasted it to be up. It was down and that added a little bit to that revenue over our expectations. And then the third one is in our Components group. Components was able to take market share. We still feel very good about our carload build of 40 to 45. But because of the availability and the investment that we\u2019ve made in working capital and inventory, in particular, we were able to take a little bit of share due to availability. So most of those will reverse themselves out in the back half. And so largely from a revenue standpoint, we\u2019re on track with where we expected to be. Again, a little bit more in the first quarter, and that will come out -- most of that will come out a little bit in the next 3 quarters.\nQ - Justin Long: Okay. Got it. Congrats on the quarter.\nJohn Olin: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to go back to the services piece. John, I think you made a comment that there was some impact timing of mod deliveries this quarter. Could you give a little color there on how we should think about through the balance of the year?\nJohn Olin: Yes. So when we looked at the full year, and we talked about the last couple of quarters that we expect our mods to be up double digit on the year. But when we look at the quarter, Allison, actually mods were down a fair amount in the first quarter. And that\u2019s nothing to get excited about. That\u2019s the way it was planned. And we\u2019ll have still that double-digit growth by the end of the year. So that\u2019s the cadence that we\u2019re referring to. I think where it comes in to be important, Allison, is when you look at the fourth quarter, mix was a big driver of that unfavorability. And at that time, we had talked about both locomotives and mods being up quite significantly driving that. In the first quarter, mix is unfavorable, but not to the same extent that we saw in the fourth quarter, because we had a little bit of offset and the mods being down in the quarter. And we also saw a very strong growth, as you saw in our equipment group, with regards to the locomotives.\nAllison Poliniak: Perfect. And then just on the digital side, really strong growth there. Is there -- I know it\u2019s what, 10% on an organic basis. Is part of that growth sort of the catch up now that some of the supply chain is starting to ease, I think, on the electronic component side? Or is this sort of kind of on trend to where you thought. And this should be the number that we should be thinking through the balance of the year for Digital?\nJohn Olin: There was a little bit of catch up in the computer chips. I wouldn\u2019t say a lot. And again, the first time we started to see the computer chip market ease was in the fourth quarter. And so we saw a little bit more easing. But not a huge portion of it, Allison, but a bit of it.\nRafael Santana: Allison, I\u2019ll just add that -- I mean the good of you saw in the last 2 years, I think has positioned the business well from a backlog perspective. Some of these were multiyear agreements. So the backlog coverage is actually better than it was a year ago. So the team with that continues to be really very much focused on making sure that we drive convertibility into 2023 still got to work through that.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nIvan Yi: This is Ivan Yi on for Scott Group. First, following the Norfolk derailment in East Palestine, what potential regulatory initiatives could Wab benefit from? And I know Wab does not manufacture the hot bearing detectors. But are you seeing any uptick in orders for other detection systems? Can you get into the hot box market? Thank you.\nRafael Santana: A couple of comments there. First, I mean, we\u2019re not going to comment on the accident per se. But if you think about rail safety, I think this is a top priority for both us and for our customers. I think similarly to what we do in efficiency or carbon emissions, I mean we continue to partner with customer share to further improve rail safety, rail productivity, emissions. We are working with a number of customers on technologies that help really further detect and anticipate any failure of systems or subsystems, and that\u2019s continued to be a part of opportunities we have to continue to always drive continuous improvement in the space.\nIvan Yi: Thank you. And just on a follow-up, can you discuss the M&A market? In what areas or regions are you most actively looking right now for any potential acquisitions? Thank you.\nA - Rafael Santana: Well, when we think of inorganic, I mean, we\u2019re continuing to explore bolt-on acquisitions. To some extent, we will continue to be opportunistic here. This needs to really ultimately drive higher ROIC and faster profitable growth for the business. With that being said, I think our focus continues to be very much on driving organic growth for a lot of the investments that we\u2019re doing on technology. We believe that will continue to drive momentum in terms of the opportunities we have here in the combination of modernizations and new locomotive sales. And with that, we continue to see opportunities to return value to shareholders. Our Board recently renewed the authorization for $750 million buybacks. And with that, we continue to be committed to pay down that.\nIvan Yi: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Wertheimer: Thank you. Good morning everybody. I had two questions on international freight. And one was just on locomotives. Is there any shift in trend there? Or is strength just normal variability in production and delivery? And then second, I wonder, kind of a bigger picture question, if you could just give us a state of the market PTC and digital, in general, across international freight? And what the runway looks like there?\nRafael Santana: Okay. So first, we continue to see a strong pipeline of deals here. We see good momentum, both internationally and in North America. Our team continues to be really focused on order conversion. If you think about internationally, whether it\u2019s Brazil, Kazakhstan, Africa, Australia, we\u2019ve had really a number of projects that are being discussed at this point. And in North America as well, I think there continues to be an opportunity here to really drive productivity and efficiency, really renewing a fleet that\u2019s quite aged and there\u2019s significant opportunities there. So with that in mind, I think this is probably the best visibility we\u2019ve had over the last years -- in the next 3 years. And we see the opportunity here to continue to drive really momentum towards delivering the 5-year guidance we provided last year. You asked specifically some elements of PTC and internationally. We\u2019re continuing to expand, and we will be deploying PTC in another market internationally. So I think that\u2019s a big part of the opportunity, and we\u2019re having the opportunity here to upgrade those systems. So the momentum there continues on driving innovation, driving really the next general products that will drive both efficiency and productivity for customers. So a positive from that perspective. And on Transit, I mean, I think the trends continue to be positive there as well. And we see the fundamentals of the business is quite good.\nRobert Wertheimer: Thank you. And one follow-up, if I may. I mean that\u2019s a fairly bullish statement. The North American locomotive kind of pipeline of potential orders, etcetera, do you have any characterization of what\u2019s driving that? You mentioned the old fleet we all definitely know that\u2019s there. You guys have done a ton with efficiency, and I think your Tier 4 is more efficient. So maybe that makes the economics easier. Just any color commentary from the conversations you\u2019re having, and I\u2019ll stop there. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: I think a lot of that is, again, back to driving efficiency. I mean if you think about it, trains that are being pulled down by three locomotives or four locomotives, how do you replace those with last locomotives? So instead of three, you have two. Or four, you have three locomotives pulling a train. And with that, I mean these locomotives -- the locomotives were delivering now today are burning last fuel. So there\u2019s the benefits that come from that. They\u2019re more reliable in that context. So that helps drive efficiency to the next level. And with that, that\u2019s where I think momentum comes in, in terms of the opportunities to continue to drive adapt efficiency across their operations. And we\u2019re continuing to invest in technologies that will help further accelerate that, and that\u2019s something that we continue to see opportunities on.\nJohn Olin: Rob, we typically see -- or our customers typically see a mid-double-digit return, or IRR, on their purchase of either a new or a modernized unit. Typically a little bit higher on a new, but both in the mid double-digit returns. So they\u2019ve got a very good strong economic incentive.\nRobert Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Saree Boroditsky of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks for taking my question. Just first, a follow-up on the derailment question. There\u2019s been some talk about shorter train lanes in response to this. Have you heard anything from a legislative perspective? And how do you think about that impacting your business?\nRafael Santana: We\u2019re continuing to work with our customers and other stakeholders share in the industry to continue to call support improvement. And there\u2019s always a sense of continuous improvement, despite rail being the most sustainable way of moving things over land. I mentioned here some other technologies that we\u2019ve been working with customers that could anticipate, once again, a failure at various equipments, including not just thermal, but also vibration and other technologies here that allow us to be more predictive on rail. So we see an opportunity here to continue to drive, I\u2019ll call innovation in the space. And with that, I think we have a set of solutions that can continue to help customers drive efficiency, productivity, emissions and rail safety.\nSaree Boroditsky: And then maybe just a follow-up. Maybe could you provide an update on how integration 2.0 is progressing? And maybe any segment level benefits for this year?\nJohn Olin: Sure, Saree. Integration 2.0, as we exited 2022, the spending was a little bit higher than what we had anticipated. So that is very good. It means we\u2019ll get to the savings quicker. But looking at that launching spot, Saree, after 1 year, we spent $46 million. A lot of that noncash, but took a $46 million charge. And with that, we returned $5 million of savings. And as we move into the next couple of years, we would expect that $5 million of savings to grow to $75 million to $90 million on a run rate basis in 2025. So we expect a fair ramp as we go forward with that. And we saw some of that certainly in the first quarter. When we look about the segments, most of the spending and you said a majority of the spending as well as the savings are going to accrue to the transit group. There is a fair amount in the freight side, but a little bit over shared in terms of our investment and opportunity for consolidation in transit. And again, when you look at the margins in the first quarter, we were up 0.8 points year-over-year. Some of that was certainly driven by those savings on the investments that we made in 2021 beginning to turn and pay off.\nSaree Boroditsky: Appreciate the color. Would it be possible to provide any numbers around what you would expect for savings for this year and maybe for 2024?\nJohn Olin: No. In terms of the spending, we would expect it to be a little bit north of what we spent last year of the $46 million. In terms of savings, again, Saree, we\u2019ve got 3 years to ramp up from $5 million to, call it, $80 million to $85 million at the midpoint. So it\u2019s pretty significant, And it will continue to build over that period of time. So a little bit more in 2024 than 2023.\nSaree Boroditsky: Okay, appreciate the color. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi good morning everyone. I\u2019m wondering if we could just talk about the Wabtec products that could potentially improve the safety around and not only the incident that we spoke about on this call, but a range of other less severe accidents. What the addressable market look like, Rafael, if we were to say, let\u2019s leverage Wabtec\u2019s products to improve safety and outcomes across the industry. Obviously, different paths to get there, but what is that addressable market if we were to move in that direction that\u2019s favorable to Wabtec\u2019s product portfolio?\nRafael Santana: Jerry, I think it\u2019s, number one, it\u2019s a significant opportunity that we have. A lot of it resides into a lot of the elements that we described as automation, which comes down to really driving what I call a more seamless operation that will improve both the elements of efficiency, but that will also drive opportunities here to continue to capitalize on safety and other elements of that. And some of it comes down to potential introduction of new projects and new products and technologies, such as products that allow the detection in anticipation of failure, whether that\u2019s at the locomotive level, whether that\u2019s at train level, that\u2019s a piece of it. The other one is the integration of some of these systems. You\u2019re well aware of our Trip Optimizer, which is a product that we have largely deployed not just in North America, but internationally as well. The combination of that with PTC and some other elements really allow you to fundamentally operate a train largely with what we would call an autopilot. So those are some of the things that we have an opportunity here to continue to drive with customers. And we\u2019re at different stages on that, depending on the complexity of networks around various parts of the world. And we\u2019re seeing really an opportunity here to drive larger adoption. I mentioned here, PTC internationally. I mean we\u2019ve gone with PTC now not just into Brazil, but we did it in Africa. We\u2019re expanding into Asia, and that\u2019s another area where we expect that to go into. We\u2019ve got opportunities to share with wayside monitoring as well. And those are some of the things that we\u2019re currently either in the process of installing or discussing it with customers in North America. It\u2019s a significant opportunity.\nJerry Revich: And Rafael, really interesting comment around the combination of locomotive and broader system technologies. Maybe just to put a finer point on that. The 16,000 locomotive installed base what proportion would you estimate of that installed base that you folks have, has that combination of Trip Optimizer plus is on network with PTC to drive that level of automation? How significant on a good chunk is that out of the existing installed base?\nRafael Santana: Jerry, it\u2019s very high, right? I mean if you think about PTC, it\u2019s really deployed across the entire installed base, whether it\u2019s Wabtec locomotives or any other compatible locomotive that\u2019s running out there. When this -- when it comes to Trip Optimizer, that\u2019s more, I\u2019ll call, really been largely deployed at the Wabtec locomotives. So that\u2019s an area of an opportunity that we would have here to continue to expand on that. And with that, I mean, there is the evolution of some of the products that we\u2019ve talked to you guys before, such as 0 to 0, which really amplifies a lot of the element of automating the entire trip. And with that, the continued automation of some of these systems. The Shamoda [Ph] systems, that really operate at a network level. So helping the railroads both dispatch trains, but really ultimately manage the network. Things like Movement Planner, which allow you to really, in a very fast mode, be able to redefine the operations and dispatches you\u2019re going to be doing along the day.\nJerry Revich: Super. And John, can I just ask a really interesting material cost performance for you folks? In the quarter, can you expand on what drove your ability to drive flat material cost? And essentially as we think about the comps over the balance of the year, considering costs moved up over the course of 2022 for most industrial companies, is it fair to say that we could actually be looking at year-over-year cost tailwinds for you folks in coming quarters?\nJohn Olin: Yes. Sure, Jerry. So yes, this is the first quarter after 6 very rapidly rising quarters of our cost of goods sold that we saw, even with a year ago. So costs were flat on a year-ago basis. I don\u2019t want anyone to walk away that think that costs are fine. They are very elevated. They are very high, but this is the first quarter and 6 that we didn\u2019t see them rise, right? And -- so with regards to that, Jerry, it\u2019s tough to say what next quarter will be. We\u2019ve certainly got our forecasts, but there\u2019s more elements of the costs that are all moving some in different directions. And you got metal costs and they\u2019re falling, right? They skyrocketed from the second quarter of 2021 through the invasion, into the second quarter of 2022. Since then, they\u2019ve been coming down. And so we feel very good about that. And then also the transportation costs, very similar, both from a fuel standpoint and a container cost. Those are on the positive side. And remember, that takes time for that to flow through our inventory. The other pieces of it are not so good, right? Labor is more of a latent cost that certainly continues to rise. And then we can\u2019t forget about general inflation, right? Everything else is inflating. Certainly, CPI was up 5% in March. So all of those things are acting within our cost structure. And then, Jerry, as you know, we got about 60% of our revenue under long-term contracts. And a lot of those have cost escalators in them. And if things start to go down, it will be a cost the escalator. So we monitor it all very closely. I think the important piece or the most important piece is it has been our aim since it all started 7 quarters ago, is to make sure that we\u2019re driving a price cost equilibrium, which we started or hit in the second quarter of last year and have maintained for the last 4 quarters. And we expect to continue to maintain that throughout 2023.\nJerry Revich: Super. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nJohn Olin: Thank you Jerry.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks operator. This is Nathan [Ph] dialing in for Ken. Congratulations on the solid quarter. Just want to quickly follow up first on Justin\u2019s first question on the quarterly cadence. I see that there is a pretty positive impact from international orders in the first quarter. And per your guidance from last from 4Q, I think that was supposed to be a little bit more first half weighted. Would you mind just giving the split between 1Q and 2Q on the magnitude of impact to equipment? And just secondly, on the backlog, I noticed that despite the 12-month backlog being up, this is roughly the third quarter of sequential decreases in the total backlog. Is that just a function of the commodity escalators being assumed? What\u2019s -- maybe talk a little bit about your outlook on demand and selling into the pipeline? Thank you so much.\nRafael Santana: Let me start with the second half of the question, and then I\u2019ll pass it on to John to address the first one. On the second one, if you look at it, in the first half of last year, we had some very significant multiyear orders. So orders that really supported not just 2023, 2024 and 2025, and those were modernizations that we signed with Class 1s in the U.S. You don\u2019t have the repeat of that this year. But this is, as I said before, the best visibility with ads when I look at the last several years in terms of really our ability to drive your momentum towards 2023, 2024 and 2025. And I think the 12-month backlog is just a realization of the solid backlog here we have to drive 2023 and now stepping into 2024 as well as part of that. With regards to the first part, John?\nJohn Olin: Yes, in terms of quarterly cadence, Nathan, obviously, all of our equipment is under longer-term contracts. And we had a contract that came through that was going to be heavy in the back half of 2022 and heavy in the first half of this year. And with that is tied to the mix. We saw unfavorable mix in the back half of last year, and we\u2019re seeing unfavorable mix in the first quarter. And we would expect the mix in that level of elevated growth out of the equipment group to move into the second quarter. We don\u2019t specifically provide what that growth would be from equipment. But suffice to say that, that level of delivery was for 4 quarters, and we would start to see from a revenue standpoint to step down in the back half just as we saw it step up in the first half -- second half of last year. And again, the mix will also mitigate and drive some of that improved margin in the back half of next year -- I\u2019m sorry, back half of this year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Great, that\u2019s very clear. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Elkott of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Elkott: Good morning. The increase in the 12-month backlog, how much of it is due to delivery dates for some existing orders maybe being moved up, maybe because manufacturing disruptions are easing? If that\u2019s a factor at all versus actual new order additions?\nJohn Olin: Matt, when we look at it, there can be orders that move this quarter to that quarter just like our overall volumes. Over time, it\u2019s nothing significant in the numbers. We saw a 4.4% increase in the 12 months, and ex currency was about 5.5% up. But any driver of the supply disruptions, a lot of that would have been baked in over the last 7 quarters, right? And we\u2019re seeing a little bit of release of that, but nothing of great significance on a number of that magnitude.\nMatthew Elkott: Okay. Good. That\u2019s good to know. And then, John, you talked quite a bit about the margin dynamics for freight. If -- it\u2019s nice to see that freight margin held up very well against huge equipment growth basically. If we assume the mix comparable to last year, the first quarter of last year, and we didn\u2019t have the technology cost that you mentioned, what would the margin have been instead of 19%?\nRafael Santana: Well, let me start here because I think the first thing is we will have significant variation, as John mentioned here, in terms of quarter-to-quarter. And some of it, it\u2019s mix. I mean, John, just told you here how we saw very significant growth on delivering of new locomotives, But mods was significantly down in the quarter. We\u2019ve got project specifics. We\u2019ve got investments when it comes down to specialty R&D, which we continue to drive. And those will have variation quarter-to-quarter. And we\u2019ve got still some of the elements of cost dynamics playing in. So I\u2019d just be careful with some of those assumptions on how they play quarter-to-quarter as it will be bumpy from that perspective, but we feel very well about making sure that we deliver on the guidance we\u2019ve provided.\nJohn Olin: And all that, I would add, Matt, is that that\u2019s why we\u2019re providing it by half. Things move around a little bit between quarters. And -- it\u2019s in line with what we guided. It\u2019s in line with what we expected. And so there\u2019s always puts and takes in any given quarter, but it\u2019s right in line with where we thought. And we feel kind of -- again, going back to my first comment, kind of check in terms of margin out of the gate here in the first quarter.\nMatthew Elkott: Got it. And John, you mentioned you haven\u2019t taken market share in components. Is there any way you can update us on your average content now in railcars, both freight and transit and locomotives? And I guess, have you guys been realizing the revenue synergies one would expect now that you\u2019ve worked through the locomotive backlog you inherited from GE, and are now taking orders as both the equipment manufacturer and the component supplier?\nJohn Olin: Yes. We don\u2019t provide that number. Actually, Matt, I don\u2019t know the number. But we don\u2019t provide it as well. So the other one is, yes, we are seeing the opportunities. And as time goes on, in terms of the group\u2019s working better and as equipment is selling products, we\u2019re pulling as many things that we make across the board on to these things. So yes, we\u2019re seeing strong revenue synergies in terms of, again, all of our products working in unison with one another to deliver the best locomotive we can to our customers.\nRafael Santana: Matt, if you go back to some of the comments we made earlier on, those who are around, I\u2019ll call it, to translate to today, about $7,000 of content in a freight car that we would see on average. We have had the opportunity here to, as John described, win share. And that was largely due to some of the investments we did in inventory and the ability to ultimately be able to serve customers in that context. We do see an opportunity here, and we\u2019ll continue to drive, I\u2019ll call, really entitlement and share into the products that we sell, especially as we go here into this battery electric locomotives, the opportunity to have a lot more content as we drive the integration of the system. And that speaks not just to the brakes that speaks to various other parts, including heat exchangers and things like that into the system. So I think we\u2019re going to continue to see us driving share up. It\u2019s a slow play game as you got to really work with customers that have fleets with auto systems deployed. And we got to make sure that we\u2019re putting up also the services to be able to support them on through that process. But it\u2019s not an opportunity for growth for us and how we\u2019ve been executing on it.\nMatthew Elkott: That\u2019s a helpful number, Rafael, the 7,000 average. The maximum opportunity, my understanding is it\u2019s closer to like 25,000 or 30,000. Is that true?\nRafael Santana: It will depend again by freight car type. And -- so that\u2019s why we give that average number. But -- and again, that\u2019s related to freight car. That\u2019s a different number if you think about locomotives.\nMatthew Elkott: Right. And transit is way, way higher, right?\nRafael Santana: It is higher. Again, it speaks to the various, I\u2019ll call, critical systems that we have that\u2019s sell-out to doors, HVAC systems, call platters, brake systems and so forth.\nMatthew Elkott: Okay. And just one final thing, Rafael. I think that -- I think maybe I\u2019m reading too much into this, but you said underlying business fundamentals strengthened in the quarter. That was just in reference to the strong results you had in the Q or something else?\nRafael Santana: When I talk about I thought in the context of transit and specifically, when I made those comments. But overall, we see that across the business. I think in transit, if you think about the underlying fundamentals, the book-to-bill over 1- to 12-month backlog being really up over 5% and even the multiyear backlog on a constant current basis, up over 9%. And we\u2019re continuing to see, I mean, really a lot of strength in the pipeline of opportunities there. But we -- as I said, on the Freight segment, see it very much the same. So the order question that we got before, it was largely an element of, I\u2019ll call, multi-billion dollar orders that we signed in the first half of the year, the combination of the modernization with both Union Pacific and NS.\nMatthew Elkott: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Barger of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSteve Barger: Rafael, I\u2019m going to follow up on that order comment you just made. I know they can be lumpy. You got very tough comps from last year. But with freight orders having been down 3 quarters in a row, is this kind of low $1 billion range for orders? What we should expect in periods when you\u2019re not booking new equipment, or mods, or multiyear service contracts?\nRafael Santana: Here, shall I look at it. It comes down to the pipeline of opportunities that we\u2019re driving. And the convertibility is going to be lumpy. I mean as I signed a 3-year agreement, that\u2019s over $1 billion, that\u2019s not going to repeat again every year. So that\u2019s a little bit of that lumpiness that we\u2019re talking about. We are working with our customers and making sure that we\u2019re driving to really have those multiyear orders. I think it\u2019s in the best interest in terms of both the quality of the product, but the cost of the product that we get. And the visibility is good in terms of those pipeline of opportunities. And the opportunity to continue to drive, I\u2019ll call, both revenue growth here on the combination of both modernizations and new equipment. So good visibility out there and good visibility with the 12-month backlog, which provides us really the confidence on the convertibility into 2023 and now starting to look into the first part of 2024 as well.\nSteve Barger: Yes. And backlog has been pretty stable at $22 billion over the past 4 years. Do you have periods coming up beyond 12 months where you have significantly higher or lower deliveries scheduled from backlog? And just given macro concerns, have you given more thought to expanding backlog visibility for investors so they can better think about the stability that provides beyond 4 quarters?\nRafael Santana: That\u2019s a key area of focus for us. It\u2019s really looking at the convertibility of the backlog. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve highlighted the elements of this -- about our visibility that we have right now, and then with over really had in the business, which comes down to visibility on 2023, 2024 and 2025. And that\u2019s what those multiyear orders ultimately provide us. We have had discussions. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to evaluate here in terms of making sure that there is that visibility in terms of how the business will behave. But I go back to very much the guidance we provided last year in terms of the 5-year outlook, which provides both, I\u2019ll call revenue expansion and margin expansion for the business. We\u2019re committed to deliver on that.\nJohn Olin: And Steve, the backlog has grown in the last 3 years ever since the merger. Each and every year, the multiyear backlog has grown.\nSteve Barger: Understood. Well, I mean, when I go back to look at 1Q 2019, it was $23 billion. It\u2019s $22 billion right now. I look at it as fairly stable over that period, which is a great outcome. But I would say just anything you can do to improve the visibility of that in terms of deliverability beyond 4 quarters would be really helpful for investors just given the increasing macro concerns that are out there and people\u2019s concerns about order growth rates and things like that.\nRafael Santana: We\u2019ll go see the dot.\nSteve Barger: Thanks very much.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey good morning guys. It\u2019s Rob [Ph] on for Chris. I guess following on the backlog. You could you give us a sense -- or are you seeing any of the orders being pushed out a little bit within the multiyear period? Obviously, the 12-month kind of stepped up here. But curious what, if any, impact kind of the weak carloads that we\u2019re seeing in North America as well as just softer macro, if that\u2019s having any sort of impact in terms of the timing and cadence of the backlog?\nRafael Santana: Well, we\u2019re not seeing pushouts, number one. And so again, back to the comments I made earlier on. A lot of what\u2019s driving the demand is associated with really gains in productivity and efficiency, tied to a fleet that aged quite a bit. That\u2019s some of the elements of North America, but we see also some positive signs here in terms of the pipeline of opportunities internationally. Some of that is tied to new projects, like in countries like Brazil, as we described. In some other ones, you\u2019ve got an element of a combination of both replacement of older units, driving efficiency and productivity with also good in terms of volume in that context. And so in that framework, no, we have not seen any delays or push outs in terms of orders.\nUnidentified Analyst: Helpful color. And then just in terms of the 2023 outlook, it sounds like the material cost absorption, that benefit just given comps should increase as the year progresses. How are you thinking about the productivity impact to the business over the next couple of quarters? Should that be also kind of improving? Or will we see that kind of work as a little bit of an offset to the absorption?\nJohn Olin: Well, that was all part of the initial guidance that we put in there, Rob, is we are looking for the year overall to be up in terms of margin and that driven by productivity, absorption, partially offset by unfavorable mix on a full year basis. And then we would also expect SG&A to be positive as a percent of revenue throughout the year and our R&D spending to be in line with that. So again, when we look at the first quarter, we\u2019re right on track in terms of margin. And we don\u2019t see any change in the margin as the guidance that we gave that margin will grow largely in the back half of the year.\nRafael Santana: Rob, costs remain high. And I think as an organization, we really remain very diligent on both cost management and pricing through that process, despite the fact you see some costs coming down in the spot market. Like transportation order is still very volatile, when if you think about copper or energy. So the team continues to be very diligent on those.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I was just trying to get a sense of if the benefit should step up as the year progresses, which kind of feels like what\u2019s baked in the guidance. But I just wanted a little bit of additional clarification there.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dillon Cumming of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDillon Cumming: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Rafael, I want to go back to your kind of comments on the Transit segment. You mentioned kind of feeling better incrementally exiting the quarter. It has been a bit of a market. It\u2019s been more opaque in the near term. But I just kind of want to get a sense of what actually is driving the more positive backdrop nearer term? Is it governments just investing more? Is it better utilization on the actual metro cars? I\u2019m just be curious as driving some of the more near-term optimism there.\nRafael Santana: Well, so a little bit of welcome with just the first quarter results, which organic growth over 9%. I think to some extent, we\u2019ve benefited from catch up in the quarter due to supply chain disruptions. So I think that\u2019s a piece. I did mention about the fundamentals of the business being strong. But it, you look to the book-to-bill above 1 to 12 months and multiyear backlog. I think we\u2019re pleased to see the progress, but we still have significant work ahead here to simplify the footprint further improve and sustain margins. I think you\u2019re going to continue to see some variation quarter-to-quarter. But we\u2019re working to drive margin expansion in the year, both for transit and for our freight business as well. I think the fundamentals on transit; we continue to see really authorities committed to continue to invest some infrastructure. Spending continues to be a positive there with government spending in rail. And our customer OEMs also have very strong backlogs in that context, which continue to drive opportunities for us.\nDillon Cumming: Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then if I could just come back to the Brazil order for a second. Obviously, nice to see that materialized. But you also made a comment is talking about how there might be a bit more of a structural opportunity there with regards to the infrastructure build-out, right, higher rail volumes over time. I think GE used to kind of quantify that market as about a 50 to 100-unit market per year. Any chances in that thinking longer term in terms of what you\u2019ve been seeing more recently that could actually drive a higher market opportunity longer term?\nRafael Santana: We see a growing opportunity there. And you\u2019re right, we see this as a very strategic quarter. This customer that ultimately, I\u2019ll call adopted Wabtec largely in terms of the solutions, and we see that as a very significant step in that direction. There\u2019s a number of new concessions taking place. I think we have really built a very solid story on partnering customers over time to drive efficiency, to drive productivity and we\u2019ve been, I think, really benefiting from that starting with customers, and we\u2019ve got growth opportunity here ahead of us. In terms of the numbers for the market, I\u2019d say you can probably think about 50-plus unit market for us in that context.\nDillon Cumming: Great. Thanks Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kristine Kubacki for any closing remarks.\nKristine Kubacki: Thank you, Andrea. Thank you, everyone, for your participation today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Olin",
            "content": "Thanks, Raphael and good morning. Turning to slide 7, I'll review our first quarter results in more detail. We started the year with another good quarter of operational and financial performance, despite continued challenges in foreign currency exchange, and still elevated input costs. Sales for the first quarter were $2.19 billion, which reflects a 13.9% increase versus the prior year. Sales were driven by very strong trade segments sales, which were up 18.5% from last year. Q1 sales were once again negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, which reduced our revenue growth in the quarter by 2.9 percentage points. For the quarter, GAAP operating income was up $37 million driven by higher sales. Adjusted operating margin in Q1 was 16.4%, down 0.1 percentage points versus the prior year as we had expected. The benefits of higher sales were offset by a less rich mix of sales between business groups and higher next generation product development costs. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.93, which was up 16.3% versus the first quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pretax charges of $9 million for restructuring, which was related to our integration 2.0 initiative to further integrate Wabtec's operations and to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025. In the quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share, were $1.28 up 13.3% versus the prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another solid quarter of results demonstrating the underlying strength and momentum of the business and our ability to navigate through volatile macroeconomic conditions. Turning to slide 8, let's review our product lines in more detail. First quarter consolidated sales were very strong up 13.9%. Excluding foreign currency exchange, sales were up 16.8%. Equipment sales were up 43.4% from last year, due to higher locomotive sales this quarter versus last year. Component sales were up 21.8% versus last year, largely driven by higher OE railcar build and an increase in our market share due to product availability, along with increased demand for industrial products. Digital Intelligence sales were up 22.2% which was driven by robust demand for onboard locomotive products and international PTC along with revenue contribution from the strategic bolt-on acquisitions of Beena Vision and ARINC last year. Our services sales grew 6.2% versus last year. The increase was driven by higher sales from a larger active fleet partially offset by the timing of mags deliveries in the year. The superior performance reliability and availability of our fleet continues to drive increased customer demand for our services and solutions. Across our transit segment, sales increased 3.8% versus prior year to $628 million. Absent the impacts of foreign currency exchange, transit sales would have been up 9.6%. The momentum in this segment remains positive as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonisation accelerate the need for investments in green infrastructure. Now moving to slide 9, as forecasted, gross profit margin was slightly lower driven by a less rich mix, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and higher manufacturing costs. Mix was unfavorable, driven by strong sales of locomotives and our equipment business. Raw material costs, while still elevated are largely flat on a year-over-year basis. Foreign Currency Exchange adversely impacted revenues by 2.9 percentage points, and adversely impacted first quarter gross profits by $14 million. Finally, manufacturing costs were positively impacted by productivity gains and higher absorption offset by higher digital development costs. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lean initiatives. Turning to slide 10, for the first quarter GAAP operating margin improved 0.2 percentage points to 12.6% while adjusted operating margin declined slightly to 16.4%. GAAP SG&A was $263 million and adjusted SG&A was $258 million, both of which were up versus prior year, but down as a percentage of sales. Engineering expense increased from last year according to plan and was flat as a percentage of sales at 2.3%. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities. But more importantly, we are investing in our future as a industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers productivity, capacity, utilization, and safety. Now let's take a look at the segment results on slide 11. Starting with the freight segment, as I already discussed freight segments sales were strong for the quarter up 18.5%. GAAP segment operating income was $227 million for an operating margin of 14.5% up 0.2 percentage points versus last year. Segment adjusted operating income was $297 million up 14.7% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the freight segment was 19.0%. Adjusted operating margin was down six tenths of a percentage point on a year-over-year basis. The benefits of increased sales, including fixed absorption and lower SG&A as a percentage of revenue were more than offset by unfavorable mix and higher next generation product development costs in our digital group. Finally, segment backlog was $18.4 billion down 3.5% from the end of Q1 last year. On a constant currency basis, segment backlog was down 2.3%. The year-over-year reduction in backlog was driven by lapping last year's multi-year order for modernizations. Now turning to slide 12, transit segment sales were up 3.8% driven by higher aftermarket sales, partially offset by negative effects of foreign currency exchange. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange adversely impacted segments sales by 5.8 percentage points. GAAP operating income was $69 million up 6.2%. GAAP operating income increased as a result of higher sales, improved mix from aftermarket sales and benefits from our integration 2.0 activities partially offset by higher restructuring costs. Adjusted segment operating income was $83 million, which was up 12.2%. This resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 13.1% up 0.8 percentage points from last year. Finally, transit segment backlog for the quarter was $4.0 billion up 6.3% versus a year ago, on a constant currency basis backlog would have been up 9.3%. Now let's turn to our financial position on slide 13. Q1 cash used for operations was $25 million. While cash flow benefited from higher earnings, we are continuing to invest in the business's growth, which is driving working capital higher in particular, receivables and inventory. Despite that we continue to expect greater than 90% cash conversion for the full year. Our debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter declined to 2.3 times versus the prior year. And our liquidity was robust at $2 billion. As Raphael mentioned, during the quarter, Moody's upgraded our credit rating, which reflects the strength of the balance sheet and the outlook for continued strong cash flow. With the Moody's upgrade. Wabtec is rated investment grade across all three rating agencies. And finally, we returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders in the quarter with $209 million returned through share repurchases and dividends. As you can see in these results, our financial position is strong and we continue to allocate capital and a balanced strategy to maximize shareholder returns. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael. Well, out of the $2.5 billion, a good $2 billion of it is tied to the service contracts, right? And if the locomotives are running, we're earning and if they're parked, we don't. So we don't provide, Justin, the amount in our forecast. But as Rafael had mentioned, on a full year basis, we expected the parkings to grow, be up, which would be a headwind to revenue. What we saw in the first quarter was a slight reduction. So again, a little bit of a benefit. And that drove a little bit more revenue than what we expected in the quarter. But on a full year basis, Justin, we would expect to get to that target or even a little bit higher. And the reason I say a little bit higher is that, if you remember last quarter, we talked about our assumption on carloads, and that was for flat. And coming out of the first quarter, flat doesn't feel is likely now given the fact that carloads were down to 3.6%. So that could amplify a little bit of the parking. But Justin, to answer your question specifically, we don't provide that number. But we've got 16,000 of them running in North America and the fewer that run a little bit less that we get in revenue. Yes. Great question, Justin. So we talked about last time, it was around margin as well as revenue. And starting with margin, we had said that we expect the margin to grow on a full year basis in line with our long-term plans. And that growth would all come in the back half. So we expect the first half on margin to be flat, and that's really where we're at. On a year-over-year basis, actually, we're down about 0.1% so kind of check on that one. We feel good about where we're at versus our plan, and that leads us to revenue. And last time we talked about revenue, growing faster in the first half than the second half. And again, we had strong revenue growth in the first quarter. As Rafael had mentioned that revenue growth did exceed our expectations. And when we looked at putting the plan together, Justin, we look from launching from the fourth quarter, right? And when you take out currency, the fourth quarter was up 15.7%. And we expected a little bit of tempering from the fourth quarter. And what we got is a little bit of an acceleration, and we ended up ex currency at 16.8%. And so that difference of revenue, some of that's being pulled from the back half. So that was driven by three things. One is our assumption on supply disruption. It was a little bit more front-loaded than we had planned. So that drove a little bit more. The second area we talked about parkings. We had forecasted it to be up. It was down and that added a little bit to that revenue over our expectations. And then the third one is in our Components group. Components was able to take market share. We still feel very good about our carload build of 40 to 45. But because of the availability and the investment that we've made in working capital and inventory, in particular, we were able to take a little bit of share due to availability. So most of those will reverse themselves out in the back half. And so largely from a revenue standpoint, we're on track with where we expected to be. Again, a little bit more in the first quarter, and that will come out -- most of that will come out a little bit in the next 3 quarters. Thank you. Yes. So when we looked at the full year, and we talked about the last couple of quarters that we expect our mods to be up double digit on the year. But when we look at the quarter, Allison, actually mods were down a fair amount in the first quarter. And that's nothing to get excited about. That's the way it was planned. And we'll have still that double-digit growth by the end of the year. So that's the cadence that we're referring to. I think where it comes in to be important, Allison, is when you look at the fourth quarter, mix was a big driver of that unfavorability. And at that time, we had talked about both locomotives and mods being up quite significantly driving that. In the first quarter, mix is unfavorable, but not to the same extent that we saw in the fourth quarter, because we had a little bit of offset and the mods being down in the quarter. And we also saw a very strong growth, as you saw in our equipment group, with regards to the locomotives. There was a little bit of catch up in the computer chips. I wouldn't say a lot. And again, the first time we started to see the computer chip market ease was in the fourth quarter. And so we saw a little bit more easing. But not a huge portion of it, Allison, but a bit of it. Rob, we typically see -- or our customers typically see a mid-double-digit return, or IRR, on their purchase of either a new or a modernized unit. Typically a little bit higher on a new, but both in the mid double-digit returns. So they've got a very good strong economic incentive. Sure, Saree. Integration 2.0, as we exited 2022, the spending was a little bit higher than what we had anticipated. So that is very good. It means we'll get to the savings quicker. But looking at that launching spot, Saree, after 1 year, we spent $46 million. A lot of that noncash, but took a $46 million charge. And with that, we returned $5 million of savings. And as we move into the next couple of years, we would expect that $5 million of savings to grow to $75 million to $90 million on a run rate basis in 2025. So we expect a fair ramp as we go forward with that. And we saw some of that certainly in the first quarter. When we look about the segments, most of the spending and you said a majority of the spending as well as the savings are going to accrue to the transit group. There is a fair amount in the freight side, but a little bit over shared in terms of our investment and opportunity for consolidation in transit. And again, when you look at the margins in the first quarter, we were up 0.8 points year-over-year. Some of that was certainly driven by those savings on the investments that we made in 2021 beginning to turn and pay off. No. In terms of the spending, we would expect it to be a little bit north of what we spent last year of the $46 million. In terms of savings, again, Saree, we've got 3 years to ramp up from $5 million to, call it, $80 million to $85 million at the midpoint. So it's pretty significant, And it will continue to build over that period of time. So a little bit more in 2024 than 2023. Yes. Sure, Jerry. So yes, this is the first quarter after 6 very rapidly rising quarters of our cost of goods sold that we saw, even with a year ago. So costs were flat on a year-ago basis. I don't want anyone to walk away that think that costs are fine. They are very elevated. They are very high, but this is the first quarter and 6 that we didn't see them rise, right? And -- so with regards to that, Jerry, it's tough to say what next quarter will be. We've certainly got our forecasts, but there's more elements of the costs that are all moving some in different directions. And you got metal costs and they're falling, right? They skyrocketed from the second quarter of 2021 through the invasion, into the second quarter of 2022. Since then, they've been coming down. And so we feel very good about that. And then also the transportation costs, very similar, both from a fuel standpoint and a container cost. Those are on the positive side. And remember, that takes time for that to flow through our inventory. The other pieces of it are not so good, right? Labor is more of a latent cost that certainly continues to rise. And then we can't forget about general inflation, right? Everything else is inflating. Certainly, CPI was up 5% in March. So all of those things are acting within our cost structure. And then, Jerry, as you know, we got about 60% of our revenue under long-term contracts. And a lot of those have cost escalators in them. And if things start to go down, it will be a cost the escalator. So we monitor it all very closely. I think the important piece or the most important piece is it has been our aim since it all started 7 quarters ago, is to make sure that we're driving a price cost equilibrium, which we started or hit in the second quarter of last year and have maintained for the last 4 quarters. And we expect to continue to maintain that throughout 2023. Thank you Jerry. Yes, in terms of quarterly cadence, Nathan, obviously, all of our equipment is under longer-term contracts. And we had a contract that came through that was going to be heavy in the back half of 2022 and heavy in the first half of this year. And with that is tied to the mix. We saw unfavorable mix in the back half of last year, and we're seeing unfavorable mix in the first quarter. And we would expect the mix in that level of elevated growth out of the equipment group to move into the second quarter. We don't specifically provide what that growth would be from equipment. But suffice to say that, that level of delivery was for 4 quarters, and we would start to see from a revenue standpoint to step down in the back half just as we saw it step up in the first half -- second half of last year. And again, the mix will also mitigate and drive some of that improved margin in the back half of next year -- I'm sorry, back half of this year. Matt, when we look at it, there can be orders that move this quarter to that quarter just like our overall volumes. Over time, it's nothing significant in the numbers. We saw a 4.4% increase in the 12 months, and ex currency was about 5.5% up. But any driver of the supply disruptions, a lot of that would have been baked in over the last 7 quarters, right? And we're seeing a little bit of release of that, but nothing of great significance on a number of that magnitude. And all that, I would add, Matt, is that that's why we're providing it by half. Things move around a little bit between quarters. And -- it's in line with what we guided. It's in line with what we expected. And so there's always puts and takes in any given quarter, but it's right in line with where we thought. And we feel kind of -- again, going back to my first comment, kind of check in terms of margin out of the gate here in the first quarter. Yes. We don't provide that number. Actually, Matt, I don't know the number. But we don't provide it as well. So the other one is, yes, we are seeing the opportunities. And as time goes on, in terms of the group's working better and as equipment is selling products, we're pulling as many things that we make across the board on to these things. So yes, we're seeing strong revenue synergies in terms of, again, all of our products working in unison with one another to deliver the best locomotive we can to our customers. And Steve, the backlog has grown in the last 3 years ever since the merger. Each and every year, the multiyear backlog has grown. Well, that was all part of the initial guidance that we put in there, Rob, is we are looking for the year overall to be up in terms of margin and that driven by productivity, absorption, partially offset by unfavorable mix on a full year basis. And then we would also expect SG&A to be positive as a percent of revenue throughout the year and our R&D spending to be in line with that. So again, when we look at the first quarter, we're right on track in terms of margin. And we don't see any change in the margin as the guidance that we gave that margin will grow largely in the back half of the year."

This needs to really ultimately drive higher ROIC and faster profitable growth for the business. With that being said, I think our focus continues to be very much on driving organic growth for a lot of the investments that we're doing on technology. We believe that will continue to drive momentum in terms of the opportunities we have here in the combination of modernizations and new locomotive sales. And with that, we continue to see opportunities to return value to shareholders. Our Board recently renewed the authorization for $750 million buybacks. And with that, we continue to be committed to pay down that."

            "name": "Rafael Santana",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristine. And good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4. I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter and progress against our long-term value creation framework. And then John will cover the financials. We delivered a strong start to the year, which is evidenced by robust sales and earnings per share growth. We achieved this despite a volatile and uncertain macro environment. Sales were roughly $2.2 billion, which was up 14% versus prior year. Revenue was driven by strong performance across the freight and transit segments, but partially offset by unfavorable effects. Total cash flow used for operations was $25 million. Overall, our financial position remains strong. We continue to allocate capital to maximize shareholder returns by investing from future growth, executing on a strategic M&A and returning cash to shareholders. Total multi-year backlog was $22.3 billion down 2% year-over-year, and excluding the headwinds from FX, backlog was down four tenths of a percent from last year. The 12-month backlog again grew to a new high of $6.9 billion. Overall, we have a strong start to the year. The underlying strength and momentum of the business is evidence. And we're well positioned to continue to drive profitable growth, even with uncertainty and volatility in the global economy. We remain confident in our ability to execute on our rigorous operating principles as we continue to deliver for our customers and make progress against our long-term growth strategies. Shifting our focus to Slide 5, let's talk about our 2023 end market expectations in more details. As we look at key metrics across our freight businesses, we remain encouraged by the underlying business momentum in our robust pipeline of opportunities. North America carloads were down in the quarter, but locomotive parkings are slightly lower than the same time last year, despite lower freight traffic. We continue to see significant opportunities in demand for modernizations and new locomotives as our customers invest in solutions that continue to drive reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency. Looking at the North America railcar build, demand for rail cars continued to show strength. As a result, the industry outlook for 2023 is for 40 to 45,000 cars to be delivered. Overall, we believe we have an opportunity to continue building significant long-term momentum, with growth in modernisations in locomotive sales, in railcar belts, and in digital solutions. Internationally activity also continues to show positive signs, and we continue to grow our install base of locomotives around the world. Finally, transitioning through the transit sector the secular drivers remaining place as the need for clean, safe and efficient transportation solutions continue to increase across the world. Next, let's turn to slide 6, to discuss a few recent business highlights. We recently signed a strategic order for new locomotives in Brazil with VLI, which results from the growing investments in Brazil's infrastructure to support growing rail volumes. We also secured a key order for our new Ultra class mining drive system, specifically targeted for high altitude applications. Reflecting on the resilience of the business, the strength of our balance sheet, and our ability to generate strong cash flow, Moody's recently upgraded while Wabtec's credit rating. And finally, our team in India achieved a significant milestone by delivering 500 locomotives in a 1000 unit order to Indian railways. As one of the region's largest rail equipment suppliers the team has positioned Wabtec and our customers for growth for years to come. All of this demonstrates the underlying momentum in the business, the team's relentless focus on execution and the strong pipeline of opportunities we continue to deliver on. Wabtec's well positioned to continue to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customer's most pressing needs. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results and our overall financial performance, John? Thanks, John. Let's flip to slide 14 to discuss our 2023 financial guidance. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and solutions remain strong across our product lines and our backlog continues to provide good visibility into 2023 and beyond. The team is committed to driving strong top line growth while managing costs. We're also committed to driving adjusted margin expansion in 2023 despite FX volatility our still challenging cost environment and continued supply chain disruptions. With this factors in mind, we are reiterating our previous guidance, we continue to expect 2023 sales of $8.7 billion to $9 billion and adjusted EPS, to be between $5.15 and $5.55 per share. We also expect cash flow conversion to be greater than 90%. Now, let's wrap up on slide 15. As you heard today, our team delivered a strong start to the year despite a challenging and volatile environment, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world class team, innovative solutions and our relentless focus on our customers. Our results remain on track for us to deliver on our five year outlook, that we provided our investor day last year, with strong momentum across the portfolio, increased visibility through our multiyear backlog and rigorous focus on execution, Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable long-term growth and maximize shareholder returns. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning. I'll turn the call over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion, Kristine? Good morning, Justin. So Justin, I'll start with a strong quarter. We finished with a strong pipeline of opportunities. And I think we continue to add on some really important options here for multiyear orders. As you look into the quarter specifically, I would say revenues were a bit higher. Piece of that was the alleviation of the supply chain. But the other one was really a piece of, I'll call, locomotive parkings being actually a positive. So there were lower parking than we had for last year. That's not what we have planned for the year. The plan for the year was to locomotive parkings to be up. So with that, we do expect that to be more amplified in the second half of the year. For the first half, I think we will continue to be a positive. I think ultimately, a lot of that's going to depend on the improvement of both velocity and well times. And that's, I think, ultimately going to be determinant. So I wanted to speculate, I think we feel very strong about the dynamics of the year based on the backlog that we have. The convertibility really is high for the year. At this point, we moved into a new high from the 12-month backlog. So we feel confident about our ability to deliver on the guidance that we provided at this point. Allison, I'll just add that -- I mean the good of you saw in the last 2 years, I think has positioned the business well from a backlog perspective. Some of these were multiyear agreements. So the backlog coverage is actually better than it was a year ago. So the team with that continues to be really very much focused on making sure that we drive convertibility into 2023 still got to work through that. A couple of comments there. First, I mean, we're not going to comment on the accident per se. But if you think about rail safety, I think this is a top priority for both us and for our customers. I think similarly to what we do in efficiency or carbon emissions, I mean we continue to partner with customer share to further improve rail safety, rail productivity, emissions. We are working with a number of customers on technologies that help really further detect and anticipate any failure of systems or subsystems, and that's continued to be a part of opportunities we have to continue to always drive continuous improvement in the space. Okay. So first, we continue to see a strong pipeline of deals here. We see good momentum, both internationally and in North America. Our team continues to be really focused on order conversion. If you think about internationally, whether it's Brazil, Kazakhstan, Africa, Australia, we've had really a number of projects that are being discussed at this point. And in North America as well, I think there continues to be an opportunity here to really drive productivity and efficiency, really renewing a fleet that's quite aged and there's significant opportunities there. So with that in mind, I think this is probably the best visibility we've had over the last years -- in the next 3 years. And we see the opportunity here to continue to drive really momentum towards delivering the 5-year guidance we provided last year. You asked specifically some elements of PTC and internationally. We're continuing to expand, and we will be deploying PTC in another market internationally. So I think that's a big part of the opportunity, and we're having the opportunity here to upgrade those systems. So the momentum there continues on driving innovation, driving really the next general products that will drive both efficiency and productivity for customers. So a positive from that perspective. And on Transit, I mean, I think the trends continue to be positive there as well. And we see the fundamentals of the business is quite good. I think a lot of that is, again, back to driving efficiency. I mean if you think about it, trains that are being pulled down by three locomotives or four locomotives, how do you replace those with last locomotives? So instead of three, you have two. Or four, you have three locomotives pulling a train. And with that, I mean these locomotives -- the locomotives were delivering now today are burning last fuel. So there's the benefits that come from that. They're more reliable in that context. So that helps drive efficiency to the next level. And with that, that's where I think momentum comes in, in terms of the opportunities to continue to drive adapt efficiency across their operations. And we're continuing to invest in technologies that will help further accelerate that, and that's something that we continue to see opportunities on. We're continuing to work with our customers and other stakeholders share in the industry to continue to call support improvement. And there's always a sense of continuous improvement, despite rail being the most sustainable way of moving things over land. I mentioned here some other technologies that we've been working with customers that could anticipate, once again, a failure at various equipments, including not just thermal, but also vibration and other technologies here that allow us to be more predictive on rail. So we see an opportunity here to continue to drive, I'll call innovation in the space. And with that, I think we have a set of solutions that can continue to help customers drive efficiency, productivity, emissions and rail safety. Jerry, I think it's, number one, it's a significant opportunity that we have. A lot of it resides into a lot of the elements that we described as automation, which comes down to really driving what I call a more seamless operation that will improve both the elements of efficiency, but that will also drive opportunities here to continue to capitalize on safety and other elements of that. And some of it comes down to potential introduction of new projects and new products and technologies, such as products that allow the detection in anticipation of failure, whether that's at the locomotive level, whether that's at train level, that's a piece of it. The other one is the integration of some of these systems. You're well aware of our Trip Optimizer, which is a product that we have largely deployed not just in North America, but internationally as well. The combination of that with PTC and some other elements really allow you to fundamentally operate a train largely with what we would call an autopilot. So those are some of the things that we have an opportunity here to continue to drive with customers. And we're at different stages on that, depending on the complexity of networks around various parts of the world. And we're seeing really an opportunity here to drive larger adoption. I mentioned here, PTC internationally. I mean we've gone with PTC now not just into Brazil, but we did it in Africa. We're expanding into Asia, and that's another area where we expect that to go into. We've got opportunities to share with wayside monitoring as well. And those are some of the things that we're currently either in the process of installing or discussing it with customers in North America. It's a significant opportunity. Jerry, it's very high, right? I mean if you think about PTC, it's really deployed across the entire installed base, whether it's Wabtec locomotives or any other compatible locomotive that's running out there. When this -- when it comes to Trip Optimizer, that's more, I'll call, really been largely deployed at the Wabtec locomotives. So that's an area of an opportunity that we would have here to continue to expand on that. And with that, I mean, there is the evolution of some of the products that we've talked to you guys before, such as 0 to 0, which really amplifies a lot of the element of automating the entire trip. And with that, the continued automation of some of these systems. The Shamoda [Ph] systems, that really operate at a network level. So helping the railroads both dispatch trains, but really ultimately manage the network. Things like Movement Planner, which allow you to really, in a very fast mode, be able to redefine the operations and dispatches you're going to be doing along the day. Let me start with the second half of the question, and then I'll pass it on to John to address the first one. On the second one, if you look at it, in the first half of last year, we had some very significant multiyear orders. So orders that really supported not just 2023, 2024 and 2025, and those were modernizations that we signed with Class 1s in the U.S. You don't have the repeat of that this year. But this is, as I said before, the best visibility with ads when I look at the last several years in terms of really our ability to drive your momentum towards 2023, 2024 and 2025. And I think the 12-month backlog is just a realization of the solid backlog here we have to drive 2023 and now stepping into 2024 as well as part of that. With regards to the first part, John? Well, let me start here because I think the first thing is we will have significant variation, as John mentioned here, in terms of quarter-to-quarter. And some of it, it's mix. I mean, John, just told you here how we saw very significant growth on delivering of new locomotives, But mods was significantly down in the quarter. We've got project specifics. We've got investments when it comes down to specialty R&D, which we continue to drive. And those will have variation quarter-to-quarter. And we've got still some of the elements of cost dynamics playing in. So I'd just be careful with some of those assumptions on how they play quarter-to-quarter as it will be bumpy from that perspective, but we feel very well about making sure that we deliver on the guidance we've provided. Matt, if you go back to some of the comments we made earlier on, those who are around, I'll call it, to translate to today, about $7,000 of content in a freight car that we would see on average. We have had the opportunity here to, as John described, win share. And that was largely due to some of the investments we did in inventory and the ability to ultimately be able to serve customers in that context. We do see an opportunity here, and we'll continue to drive, I'll call, really entitlement and share into the products that we sell, especially as we go here into this battery electric locomotives, the opportunity to have a lot more content as we drive the integration of the system. And that speaks not just to the brakes that speaks to various other parts, including heat exchangers and things like that into the system. So I think we're going to continue to see us driving share up. It's a slow play game as you got to really work with customers that have fleets with auto systems deployed. And we got to make sure that we're putting up also the services to be able to support them on through that process. But it's not an opportunity for growth for us and how we've been executing on it. It will depend again by freight car type. And -- so that's why we give that average number. But -- and again, that's related to freight car. That's a different number if you think about locomotives. It is higher. Again, it speaks to the various, I'll call, critical systems that we have that's sell-out to doors, HVAC systems, call platters, brake systems and so forth. When I talk about I thought in the context of transit and specifically, when I made those comments. But overall, we see that across the business. I think in transit, if you think about the underlying fundamentals, the book-to-bill over 1- to 12-month backlog being really up over 5% and even the multiyear backlog on a constant current basis, up over 9%. And we're continuing to see, I mean, really a lot of strength in the pipeline of opportunities there. But we -- as I said, on the Freight segment, see it very much the same. So the order question that we got before, it was largely an element of, I'll call, multi-billion dollar orders that we signed in the first half of the year, the combination of the modernization with both Union Pacific and NS. Here, shall I look at it. It comes down to the pipeline of opportunities that we're driving. And the convertibility is going to be lumpy. I mean as I signed a 3-year agreement, that's over $1 billion, that's not going to repeat again every year. So that's a little bit of that lumpiness that we're talking about. We are working with our customers and making sure that we're driving to really have those multiyear orders. I think it's in the best interest in terms of both the quality of the product, but the cost of the product that we get. And the visibility is good in terms of those pipeline of opportunities. And the opportunity to continue to drive, I'll call, both revenue growth here on the combination of both modernizations and new equipment. So good visibility out there and good visibility with the 12-month backlog, which provides us really the confidence on the convertibility into 2023 and now starting to look into the first part of 2024 as well. That's a key area of focus for us. It's really looking at the convertibility of the backlog. And that's why I've highlighted the elements of this -- about our visibility that we have right now, and then with over really had in the business, which comes down to visibility on 2023, 2024 and 2025. And that's what those multiyear orders ultimately provide us. We have had discussions. It's something that we'll continue to evaluate here in terms of making sure that there is that visibility in terms of how the business will behave. But I go back to very much the guidance we provided last year in terms of the 5-year outlook, which provides both, I'll call revenue expansion and margin expansion for the business. We're committed to deliver on that. We'll go see the dot. Thank you. Well, we're not seeing pushouts, number one. And so again, back to the comments I made earlier on. A lot of what's driving the demand is associated with really gains in productivity and efficiency, tied to a fleet that aged quite a bit. That's some of the elements of North America, but we see also some positive signs here in terms of the pipeline of opportunities internationally. Some of that is tied to new projects, like in countries like Brazil, as we described. In some other ones, you've got an element of a combination of both replacement of older units, driving efficiency and productivity with also good in terms of volume in that context. And so in that framework, no, we have not seen any delays or push outs in terms of orders. Rob, costs remain high. And I think as an organization, we really remain very diligent on both cost management and pricing through that process, despite the fact you see some costs coming down in the spot market. Like transportation order is still very volatile, when if you think about copper or energy. So the team continues to be very diligent on those. Thank you. Well, so a little bit of welcome with just the first quarter results, which organic growth over 9%. I think to some extent, we've benefited from catch up in the quarter due to supply chain disruptions. So I think that's a piece. I did mention about the fundamentals of the business being strong. But it, you look to the book-to-bill above 1 to 12 months and multiyear backlog. I think we're pleased to see the progress, but we still have significant work ahead here to simplify the footprint further improve and sustain margins. I think you're going to continue to see some variation quarter-to-quarter. But we're working to drive margin expansion in the year, both for transit and for our freight business as well. I think the fundamentals on transit; we continue to see really authorities committed to continue to invest some infrastructure. Spending continues to be a positive there with government spending in rail. And our customer OEMs also have very strong backlogs in that context, which continue to drive opportunities for us. We see a growing opportunity there. And you're right, we see this as a very strategic quarter. This customer that ultimately, I'll call adopted Wabtec largely in terms of the solutions, and we see that as a very significant step in that direction. There's a number of new concessions taking place. I think we have really built a very solid story on partnering customers over time to drive efficiency, to drive productivity and we've been, I think, really benefiting from that starting with customers, and we've got growth opportunity here ahead of us. In terms of the numbers for the market, I'd say you can probably think about 50-plus unit market for us in that context. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone and welcome to Wabtec\u2019s third quarter 2024 earnings call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, John Olin; and Senior Vice President of Finance, John Mastelers. Today\u2019s slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures were posted to our website earlier today and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab. Some statements we are making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. I will now turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kyra and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s move to Slide 4. I will start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter and progress against our long-term value creation framework and then John will cover the financials. We delivered another solid quarter, evidenced by sales growth, margin expansion, increased earnings and strong cash flow. Sales were $2.7 billion, which was up nearly 4.5% versus the prior year. Revenue growth was driven by both the Freight and Transit segments. Adjusted EPS was up nearly 18% from the year ago quarter driven by increased sales and margin expansion. Total cash flow from operations for the quarter was $542 million. We continue to execute against our capital allocation framework to maximize shareholder value by investing for future growth and returning cash to our shareholders. The 12-month backlog was $7.6 billion, up 7.5%, signifying continued momentum and visibility across the business. And the total multiyear backlog was $22 billion. Overall, the Wabtec team delivered a solid third quarter behind an intense focus on execution. Looking ahead, I am encouraged by the underlying strength and momentum across the business and believe Wabtec is positioned for continued profitable growth ahead. Shifting our focus to Slide 5, let\u2019s talk about 2024 end market expectations in more details. While key metrics across our Freight business remain mixed, we are encouraged by the underlying momentum of our business, the continued strength of our international markets and the robust pipeline of opportunities across geographies. North American carloads continued to be up in the quarter despite this carload growth. The industries and Wabtec\u2019s active locomotive fleet was largely flat when compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. Looking at the North American railcar build, last quarter, the industry outlook for 2024 was 38,000 cars to be delivered, which has now been raised by the industry sources to 41,000 cars, down from last year\u2019s build of 45,000 cars. Internationally, we are seeing significant investments to expand and upgrade infrastructure, which are supporting a robust international locomotive borders pipeline. This is the strongest it has been over the last 5 years. In mining, commodity prices and an aging fleet continue to support activity to refresh and upgrade the truck fleet. Finally, moving to the Transit sector, we continue to see underlying indicators for growth. Ridership levels are increasing in key geographies, along with the fleet expansion and renewals. There also continues to be a strong push with regulation and customer initiatives on decarbonization and sustainable transportation solutions. Next, let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few business highlights. Last year, in the third quarter, we announced the signing of a strategic MOU with KTZ, the National Railway Company in Kazakhstan, for over $2 billion. Since that time, we have worked to finalize orders associated with that MOU, a multiyear new locomotive order with KTZ for $405 million. These locomotives will provide the efficiency, reliability and operational savings to effectively support the growing demand on the Trans-Caspian international route that connects China to Europe. Moving to North America, we secured the long-term parts agreement with a Class 1 railroad for over $300 million. In Transit, we signed a contract for $70 million with Siemens Mobility to supply passenger information systems for 90 Munich S-Bahn trains. And earlier in the quarter, we expanded our service contract with Indian Railways for another $30 million. This agreement expands Wabtec\u2019s locomotive service capabilities into the southern part of the country. All of this demonstrates the underlying strength across our businesses, the team\u2019s relentless focus on execution and the strong pipeline of opportunities, which we continue to execute on. With that, I will turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results and our overall financial performance. John?\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Rafael and hello everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I will review our third quarter results in more detail. Our third quarter results played out largely as we planned with revenue and better than expected with our operating margins. As we discussed in the last quarter call, we expected both revenue and margin growth to be higher in the first half than in the second half, with the second half growth to be at a much more tempered pace than we experienced in the first half. We also noted during the last call that within the second half of this year, we expected the third quarter\u2019s growth to be greater than the fourth quarter\u2019s growth. This is still the case. Sequentially, we expect margins in Q4 to come down from Q3, driven by the reverse of what we saw in Q3 regarding business group revenue mix. In Q3, we saw robust services growth, which comes at a higher margin while the equipment business, which comes at a lower margin, was down versus prior year. This was largely a result of the timing of our production between new locomotives, modernizations and engine overhauls. In Q4, we expect a significant mix headwind, which will temper Q4 adjusted operating margins to be modestly higher than year ago levels. We expect double-digit sales growth in our Equipment Group due to increased locomotive deliveries, while services sales are expected to be down double-digit on a year-over-year basis, basically the reverse of our production timing in Q3. Sales for the third quarter were $2.66 billion, which reflects a 4.4% increase versus the prior year. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by both the Freight and Transit segments. For the quarter, GAAP operating income was $433 million. The increase was driven by higher sales, improved gross margin and an unrelenting focus on continuous improvement and productivity. Adjusted operating margin in Q3 was 19.7%, up 1.8 percentage points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by improved gross margin of 1.8 percentage points. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.63, which was up 22.6% versus the year ago quarter. During the quarter, we had net pre-tax charges of $18 million for restructuring, which were primarily related to our Integration 2.0 and our portfolio optimization initiative to further integrate and streamline Wabtec\u2019s operations. As you may recall, Integration 2.0 is expected to drive $75 million to $90 million of run-rate savings by 2025. And our portfolio optimization initiative will eliminate roughly $110 million of low margin, non-strategic revenue while reducing manufacturing complexity. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share, was $2, up 17.6% versus the prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another solid quarter, demonstrating the underlying strength of the business. Turning to Slide 8. Let\u2019s review our product lines in more detail. Third quarter consolidated sales were up 4.4%. Our quarter results were driven by growth in our services, digital intelligence and transit businesses, partially offset by our equipment business. Equipment sales were down 17.3% from last year\u2019s third quarter. This decline was planned and driven by the timing of new locomotive deliveries. As mentioned earlier, we expect this to reverse in Q4, with equipment sales expected to be up double-digit. Component sales were up 1.0% versus last year due to higher international freight car sales and industrial product growth, which was offset by lower North American freight car build. The industry is forecasting the 2024 Freight car build to be down 9% from last year. Digital intelligence sales were up 12.7% from last year. This was driven by growth in our international sales of PTC, next-generation onboard products and digital mining products. Our services sales grew 16.5%. Sales growth was driven primarily by higher year-over-year modernizations and overhauls. As mentioned earlier, we expect the timing of our mods and overhaul production and deliveries to reverse in Q4 resulting in our year-over-year service revenue to be down double-digits. In our Transit segment, sales were up 9.6%. During the quarter, we saw our OE revenue grow 13.3%. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 8.4%. The momentum in the Transit segment continues to remain positive as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonization accelerate the need for investments in sustainable infrastructure. Moving to Slide 9. GAAP gross margin was 33.0%, which was up 2.0 percentage points from the third quarter last year. Adjusted gross margin was also up 1.8 percentage points during the quarter. In addition to the higher sales, gross margin benefited from favorable mix between business groups. Mix within the Freight segment was better than expected due to growth in our services business behind the timing of mods and overhauls in the quarter, partially offset by a planned decline in locomotive production and deliveries. Foreign currency exchange was a slight headwind to revenue as well as gross profit and operating margin in the quarter. During the quarter, we also benefited from increased productivity and the benefits of our Integration 2.0 and portfolio optimization efforts as well as lapping last year\u2019s Erie strike that ran through a portion of the third quarter of 2023. Our team continues to execute well by driving operational productivity and lean benefits. Now turning to Slide 10. For the third quarter, GAAP operating margin was 16.3%, which was up 1.8 percentage points versus last year. Adjusted operating margin improved 1.8 percentage points to 19.7%. GAAP and adjusted SG&A and engineering expenses were up versus prior year, but largely flat as a percentage of revenues. Engineering expense was $50 million, slightly lower than Q3 last year. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities. But more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers\u2019 productivity, capacity utilization and safety. Now, let\u2019s take a look at the segment results on Slide 11, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales were up 2.6% during the quarter. GAAP segment operating income was $390 million for an operating margin of 20.2%, up 2.9 percentage points versus last year. GAAP operating income included $10 million of restructuring costs primarily related to Integration 2.0 and portfolio optimization. Adjusted operating income for the Freight segment was $467 million, up 17.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the Freight segment was 24.1%, up 2.9 percentage points from the prior year. The increase was driven by improved gross margin behind favorable business mix, strong operational execution, Integration 2.0 savings and as we lap last year\u2019s manufacturing inefficiencies caused by the strike in Erie. At the same time, SG&A and engineering expense were slightly lower as a percentage of revenue. Finally, segment 12-month backlog was $5.59 billion, up 6.4% from the same period a year ago. The multiyear backlog was $17.76 billion, up 1.1% from prior year. Turning to Slide 12. Transit segment sales were up 9.6% at $733 million. When adjusting for foreign currency, Transit sales were up 8.4%. GAAP operating income was $79 million. Restructuring costs related to Integration 2.0 were $8 million in Q3. Adjusted segment operating income was $93 million. Adjusted operating income as a percent of revenue was 12.8%, up 0.3 percentage points. During the quarter, adjusted gross margin was down modestly behind unfavorable mix, partially offset by Integration 2.0 savings. Margins also benefited from SG&A and engineering expenses being lower as a percent of revenue. Finally, Transit segment 12-month backlog for the quarter was $2.04 billion, up 10.8% versus a year ago. Now, let\u2019s turn to our financial position on Slide 13. Third quarter cash flow was another highlight for the quarter, with operating cash coming in at $542 million. During the quarter, cash flow benefited from higher earnings and $95 million of higher securitization borrowings. We continue to expect greater than 90% cash conversion for the full year. Our balance sheet and financial position continue to be very strong as evidenced by: first, our liquidity position, which ended the quarter at $1.9 billion; and our net debt leverage ratio, which ended the third quarter at 1.7x, which was lower versus the same quarter a year ago at 2.1x debt leverage. We continue to allocate capital to maximize returns for our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $599 million of our shares and paid $35 million in dividends. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Rafael to talk about our 2024 financial guidance.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, John. Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 14 to discuss our 2024 full year guidance. As you heard today, our team delivered a solid third quarter, which was ahead of our expectations. Consequently, we are increasing our previous adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.45 to $7.65, at the midpoint, up 27.5%. Our revenue and cash flow conversion guidance remain unchanged. Looking ahead, I am confident that Wabtec is well-positioned to drive profitable growth into 2024 and beyond. Now, let\u2019s wrap up on Slide 15. As you heard today, our team continues to deliver on our value creation framework, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world class team, innovative technologies and our continued focus on our customers with solid underlying demand for our products and technologies and rigorous focus on continuous improvement in cost management, consistent with our previous guidance, we continue to expect to drive mid single-digit organic growth while driving double-digit EPS growth through our planning horizon, thereby maximizing our shareholders\u2019 returns. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning. And I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kyra to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kyra?\nKyra Yates: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator: Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today\u2019s first question comes from Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley.\nAngel Castillo: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nAngel Castillo: I wanted to maybe start on maybe preliminary thoughts. I know you won\u2019t necessarily provide guidance for \u201825. But just curious, as you see your backlog continuing to grow and you are getting these contract wins are turning MOUs to orders. What does that tell you in terms of preliminary thoughts on \u201825 in terms of price, volume kind of margins, at least directionally, any sense that you could provide based on your backlog?\nRafael Santana: Well, first, it\u2019s certainly early to be providing guidance into \u201825. But the fundamentals for the business are strong. We are finishing \u201824 with really every single one of our businesses are growing. Year-to-date, orders are up double-digit. Profitability is up across the board as well. And I\u2019ll finish with consistent with what we have given on previous guidance we continue to expect to drive mid-single-digit organic growth while delivering double-digit EPS growth through our planning horizon.\nAngel Castillo: Understood. And maybe switching over to Integration 2.0, I just wanted to maybe get a little bit more color on maybe what\u2019s the run-rate thus far versus that $75 million to $90 million target and just kind of how that\u2019s shaping out?\nRafael Santana: Great. As you know, Integration 2.0, I mean, as we came out of last year, savings were $22 million and we were looking to get to a midpoint of $82.5 million. So that leaves a ramp of $60 million over \u201824 and \u201825. And what I\u2019ll tell you, Angel, is that we are on track and actually exceeding our expectations a bit. Not only are we getting a little bit more than we anticipated, but it\u2019s coming a little bit earlier. And we are really seeing that inflection in the third quarter. And as you see, we are raising our guidance. Part of that is driven by the over-delivery on Integration 2.0 in the third quarter and we expect that to kind of compound into the fourth quarter. So we feel real good about where we\u2019re at today. Most of the spending is behind us. We finished the quarter program to-date with $140 million of spending. That\u2019s on the low end of our range. We will have a little bit more spending to go, but tracking well on the expense side and I am a little bit ahead on the savings side.\nAngel Castillo: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. Maybe just kind of talking a little bit more about freight margins, obviously, very strong again at 24% better than your expectations. So maybe just walk through what drove the upside surprise? How much did mix contribute to this? And then just maybe a little bit on the sustainability at Freight margins at this level and how that sets you up for 2025?\nJohn Olin: Saree, this is John. When we look at the margins up being up 1.8 percentage points, it was higher than our expectations and it was driven in two areas, Saree. Number one is on mix and the other is on cost. First, on mix, while we knew there was going to be favorable mix, because of the services production coming in at a higher margin at the expense of some of the locals produced in the equipment group that we planned on. What we didn\u2019t \u2013 was there was additional mix favorability in our overhauls, which come at a pretty good margin as well as in our mining business, we lean more towards the aftermarket in our sales in the third quarter than OE. And we were expecting a little bit more on the OE side. So, that\u2019s on the mix side. And we don\u2019t expect that to transcend from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. The second piece of it is on the cost side and there is two elements to that. One is productivity. Everyday, continuous improvement productivity was very strong during the quarter and we certainly got a nod to the manufacturing and the supply chain folks. They are running the system extremely well. And for that, we are getting rewarded on additional productivity. The second area on the cost side is what I just spoke to Angel about is the Integration 2.0 is coming in better and faster than expected. That \u2013 both of those cost items benefited the third quarter and will benefit the fourth quarter. And those two combined are \u2013 I am sorry, the mix and the cost combined is what got us the increase in EPS at the midpoint of $0.20. When we look now to the fourth quarter, we are going to see a reverse of what we saw in the third quarter between the production of mods, locals and overhauls. And with that, we expect in the fourth quarter that equipment will be up in the double-digits and services at a higher margin will be down in the double-digit. So, we are going to have a significant amount of mix pressure. And this is nothing new that we\u2019ve talked about. The second half would be unfavorable in mix and this is what\u2019s going to drive it as the fourth quarter. And with that, we would expect overall margins to be higher on a year-over-year basis, but slightly and \u2013 but down sequentially by a fair amount as we move into the fourth quarter. Again, this has nothing to do with the underlying demand. It\u2019s really all about how we produce the year so that we could more level load our factories.\nSaree Boroditsky: I appreciate the color. And then just one more, the Transit backlog grew in the quarter despite you focusing on some higher margin products projects there. Can you just update us on the margins in Transit that are coming into the backlog versus the current margins that are in the P&L and how that translates to Transit margin expansion?\nRafael Santana: I\u2019ll take this one. And I\u2019ll start with we continue to be pleased with the overall progress in the business. Our teams are continuing to really drive significant simplification on the footprint. They are further improving and sustaining margins. I think you\u2019re going to see variation quarter-to-quarter. Some will be driven by mix and timing of projects. But I expect Transit to continue to deliver on profitable growth. You asked about selectivity on projects, I think the best way for us to look at it is when we look at the profitability of the backlog, and that\u2019s up. So that business is on track to continue to expand on margins. And they are not starting as mid-teens and continue to improve from there. So we feel strong about the plan they have ahead.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thank you. Congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning. And I\u2019ll echo that great job building the backlog back and intra-quarter contract announcements. Can you maybe talk about the kind of \u2013 a lot of international announcements on some locomotives recently? Can you talk about the \u2013 how we should think about gross margins on international versus North American margins? I know you don\u2019t break it out by contract, but maybe just in general to understand the splits. And then just to clarify, John, when you mentioned service revenue down double-digit, is that balancing out the mods production? Is that why we are seeing that down so much?\nJohn Olin: Yes. Starting with the first question, Ken, is we get the question often is international margins, whether international versus North America, it is really specific to the country and the contracts that we are working off of. And we have some international that are higher than North America, some that are lower, some areas that we are investing in, others that were not. So it\u2019s not as simple as saying that international is this when we get revenue, it\u2019s going to come at that margin. It really is with regards to the various contracts that we have. I think suffice to say that we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the growth that we are having from our international business from a revenue perspective as well as a margin perspective. And our view across everything is how do we continue to deliver more value to our customers and get that built into our backlog as we go forward. The second question, Ken, is on the service revenue in the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s take the third quarter and the fourth quarter together. We \u2013 as you know, and you have been down to the facility down there, we do mods and locos on the same production line. So, we have level loaded those, but there is still \u2013 because these fall into different groups, mods falls into the service group and new locos falls into the equipment group, we are going to have some variation as to how we run the product. We typically like to run a customer order as much as we can together or consistently for the productivity and quality aspect of it. And it just happened in the third quarter that given the orders that we had, we produced more mods on a year-over-year basis and less new locos, and that\u2019s simply going to reverse in the fourth quarter. But with that, we are going to see that shift from more favorable mix in the third quarter to less favorable in the fourth quarter. But there is nothing more than just how we plan the production. There is nothing different with the demand for the products, just how we are fulfilling that demand.\nKen Hoexter: Okay. And just to understand the \u2013 what\u2019s left to shutdown on the portfolio optimization?\nJohn Olin: So, we talked about this in February that we were going to do $110 million. A good portion of that is \u2013 well, it\u2019s mostly all executed. We got a little bit more to execute in the fourth quarter and we will see the lower revenues, both in this year, \u201824, and some lower revenues into \u201825 as a result of it, but that\u2019s all tracking very well.\nKen Hoexter: Thank you. Thanks for the time.\nJohn Olin: Thank you, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc.\nDaniel Imbro: Hey. Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking our questions.\nJohn Olin: Hi Daniel.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nDaniel Imbro: Rafael, maybe want to dig into international markets more specifically. It does feel like these contract wins are becoming more and more frequent. And the backlog you mentioned is growing. I am curious how we should think about why this is accelerating. Is it something you guys are doing differently? Is it just a maturation of those markets? And then understanding your answer to the last question that all countries are different, but is it fair to say that as you add density in these countries, incremental margins should improve as you add more scale and lever your cost there, or how should we think about that as you keep accelerating this international growth?\nRafael Santana: So, we \u2013 when we think about just the dynamics of the business, internationally growth really continues. So, I think we are bullish on key international markets. We have got some elements of projects taking place in Africa. I think you are going to continue to see some wins from us there. So, that\u2019s a positive. We are continuing to expand on the Caspian routes and demand continues there in Kazakhstan as well. And the good news on some of these projects, and I speak here to South America and Australia. I mean some of the discussions here go well into \u201826, \u201827. We are discussing locomotive deliveries into \u201828. So that\u2019s, I think a positive in that regard, and it comes down to the experience customers are having with our fleets driving both productivity, availability and reliability. So, we see that really continuing. Some of the investments we have done in technology, I think you are going to continue to see a significant opportunity here for us to actually accelerate some of the modernization, we will talk more about this early next year, but there is certainly an element of innovation on how we continue to drive that. We mentioned Kazakhstan. We talked about locomotive order what we often sometimes don\u2019t give the same emphasis is on the opportunity we have with digital here. And we are expanding on not just the Trip Optimizer, some of our kinetics products are being brought as well into this mix. We often talk about PTC that\u2019s, an area that we will continue to expand. So, we see it as a positive. And I think we will continue to see profitable growth there, some of those markets I mentioned. Our markets were more mature. So, we have got a lot of products that are really best-in-class to compete.\nDaniel Imbro: Helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, just on the balance sheet side. So, cash conversion this year has driven accelerated buybacks year-to-date in \u201824. But as we bounce low in the bottom of the freight market, has that brought any more sellers to market? And just curious how you are seeing the M&A markets evolve in terms of the targets that you are looking at and what you would like to maybe spend some of that cash on the M&A side. Thanks.\nRafael Santana: I think the best way to answer this is when we look at our capital allocation strategy, that hasn\u2019t changed, right. We continue to focus to be on making sure we are driving profitable organic growth for the business. We are certainly very much focused on M&A as well. When I think about the inorganic, this is the strongest pipeline we have had on M&A, and we will continue to look at us. We will be opportunistic here. And just a question of returns, the returns are there. We are going vast on it. If they are not, we won\u2019t be shy about doing share buybacks.\nJohn Olin: And then, Ken, within the quarter, the $600 million that we repurchased is really a function of that cash flow you mentioned. We have had year-to-date cash of $1.1 billion and that\u2019s up over 100% versus a year ago. So, in the absence of M&A, which we would prefer, we returned the value to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases, and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased to do that.\nDaniel Imbro: Thanks so much guys. Best of luck.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: Good morning. Yesterday, one of your Class 1 modification customers suggested, they were interested in either stretching out or reducing some of their locomotive CapEx near term. I wonder if you could comment maybe not specifically on that. But more broadly, are we at the point in the North American locomotive replacement cycle where that\u2019s kind of starting to plateau in the short-term and international is going to drive the bulk of the growth over the next 2 years, just any thoughts on that market? Thank you.\nRafael Santana: North America, we continue to see mixed. I mean you have got to be looking at specifics on customers here. But we continue to see demand. That\u2019s for both new locomotives and for mods. I think our customers overall are continuing to invest if you think about customers investing. It\u2019s most of the time for improved costs, it\u2019s for reliability, it\u2019s for efficiency. It\u2019s not for car loan growth. It\u2019s not for necessarily revenue growth. So, that\u2019s where I think we are excited about. And coming back to some earlier comments I made is the opportunity we have here to continue to innovate and make sure that they are investing for a return at the end of the day, getting more efficient product that will help, improve their OR and improve the service levels in the railroad. That\u2019s how we look at it at the end of the day, but you have got to really look at customer specifics here.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning everyone.\nJohn Olin: Hi Jerry.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nJerry Revich: Hi. I am wondering if we just talk about your receivables for a moment. So, really interesting, your total receivables, including securitizations are down mid-single digit year-over-year. Your top line on an LTM basis is up nearly 10%, that\u2019s a really significant improvement in DSOs. Can you just talk about what\u2019s driven that improvement? And how much more opportunity do you folks have to continue to drive DSOs lower?\nJohn Olin: Actually, receivables on a year-to-date basis are up about 6.5%. I don\u2019t think you are picking up all the receivables there, but they are up 6.5%. But to your point, we have got \u2013 overall, revenue on a year-to-date basis, up 9.1%. And if you adjust for some of that the securitization, you would see the receivables more nearly matching the rate of the growth of the company.\nJerry Revich: Okay. I guess, John, maybe you securitize more than I thought in the quarter because a year ago, you were at $1.9 billion in receivables, including securitization, so you are saying you are up over that third quarter number because obviously, there is seasonality 4Q versus 3Q?\nJohn Olin: Yes. So, for the securitization, we ended the quarter at $95 million securitized. And the reason we do that, Jerry, is it\u2019s a lower cost of funds for us, and we would prefer to borrow with that, but we ended the quarter at $95 million. We started the quarter at zero. So that was a headwind \u2013 I am sorry, that was a benefit to our cash flow in the quarter of the $542 million. Now on a year-over-year basis, the receivables of the securitization borrowings are down quite a bit. They are down $140 million from where we were at the end of the third quarter last year. But within the quarter, it did provide some benefit to that cash flow number and the cash conversion ex the securitization would have been 106%.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Yes. Let\u2019s follow-up offline, because I am looking at it on a year-over-year basis. And separately, as we look back at your long-term plans, Rafael, you folks are well ahead of plan in terms of the margin performance for the organization. And I think you had spoken about a steady 50 basis points, 60 basis points per year margin improvement. I am wondering since we have already achieved the Analyst Day targets a couple of years early here. How are you thinking about the opportunity to continue to drive margin expansion at that same clip off of these levels as we think about the next 12 months to 24 months?\nRafael Santana: I think we have significant momentum here still. Our teams continue to simplify the business. They are driving continuous improvement actions across the business. And with that, I think we have the opportunity here to continue to drive margin expansion. So, margin rates in our overall business, I think we will continue to benefit from not just as lean efforts with productivity integration to that all. John mentioned portfolio optimization. So, I think we have significant opportunities here to continue to drive momentum and we are committed here to drive profitable growth as we go into \u201825 and beyond.\nJerry Revich: Thank you.\nJohn Olin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRobert Wertheimer: Hi there. Good morning guys. So, questions on backlog and pipeline. In the backlog, just to clarify, is the Kazakhstan order in the backlog number that you reported kind of on the slide for the quarter. And I don\u2019t know if you have the ability or willingness to say whether the big order you had in North American rail in July. It came into backlog at all this quarter much. I think it\u2019s for \u201825 and \u201826 delivery setups in the 12-month backlog. And then Rafael, not to make you repeat your prepared remarks, but your thoughts on kind of pipeline preorders and where you stand after having had a bunch. I mean is that activity still as good as ever, or how would you characterize it? Thank you.\nJohn Olin: Let me start with the backlog question. So, the $405 million, which is the first order we have received against a $200-plus million MOU that is in backlog for the third quarter. So, all the backlog numbers that we read to you is inclusive of that $405 million. We will continue to work on the rest of those orders and that will come over time.\nRafael Santana: With regards to, I guess the fundamentals of the business, I mean we are finishing \u201824 with, again, every single one of our businesses are growing. Orders are up double digits. The pipeline is strong. We feel especially strong about the international growth, some of the markets I mentioned here, and that all translates into momentum, not just it goes into \u201825 to \u201827. So, that\u2019s really a positive there for us. So, the pipeline is strong. And even in North America, as I have said, the demand is there, but customers are investing for return. And what makes me really feel positive about the momentum is that innovation. As we will talk to you in more detail and start of the year is the ability to drive that next level of efficiency into the existing fleets and making sure that customers are accelerating and improving their operating ratios through that process, improving productivity, availability and reliability of the fleet. So, all-in-all, as I have said, we continue to expect to drive mid-single digit organic growth while delivering double-digit EPS growth through the planning horizon.\nRobert Wertheimer: Thank you, Rafael. Excellent.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning guys.\nJohn Olin: Good morning Scott.\nScott Group: So, I totally get there is quarterly volatility in mix, and it\u2019s helping Q3 and hurt in Q4. When we think about \u2013 and again, I know it\u2019s early, so it may be hard to answer. But like do you think \u2013 is there a reason to think 2025 in aggregate has either a mix tailwind or headwind, or is it more, hey, there is going to be some quarters it help, some quarters it hurts, but net-net, it\u2019s not a big swing next year?\nJohn Olin: Yes, Scott, it is a little bit early to talk about the components of 2025. We probably had more shifting \u2013 not probably, we have had more shifting in \u201824. We wouldn\u2019t expect as much activity from a production standpoint in 2025. I think the way to think about the overall margins are really where we are expecting or where we were guiding to, and that\u2019s how we will take into 2025 and work to improve against.\nScott Group: And then the $400 million were KTZ, the $300 million parts, any color on duration of those two contracts? And then just separately, I don\u2019t know if there is any update or anything you are hearing on car BPA worth highlighting. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Okay. The backlog of the $405 million KTZ order will be largely delivered over \u201825 and \u201826 timeframe. And the service agreement is a longer term. That will be over a longer term. I am not sure exactly how many years, but. On the EPA, Scott, we haven\u2019t really had, I am going to call substantial change since we last talked. But I guess what we are saying is if you look at the heavy truck fleet, which is now really expected to have to drive 25% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA is also defined liquid hydrogen for internal combustion engines would be classified as a near zero or zero emissions. And we see that as a validation of the strategy we have pursued with really making sure our engines are ultimately agnostic, and we are able to run alternative gases like hydrogen, with biofuels, renewable fuels and we see that as a validation for really making sure we are the best-in-class product to help our customers achieve their goals on decarbonization in various parts of the world. So, the fuels that might be available in Brazil might be different than in California and other parts of North America. So, we see that as really a validation and we feel very strong about having the best-in-class products here to play given any regulation changes and things like that. So, that\u2019s a positive for us.\nScott Group: Helpful guys. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSteve Barger: Hey. Good morning. Thanks. John, you said M&A was a preferred use of capital. As you look at the portfolio today, are you primarily focused on freight additions, or do you want to build out the transit portfolio, just \u2013 or is the overall strategy more opportunistic in returns based? Can you just talk about how you are approaching it?\nJohn Olin: I think there is a couple of areas, Steve, that we are focused on. One is the digital area and others are near-in adjacencies. Of course, we are always interested in bolt-ons to our existing business. But other than that, it would be near-in adjacencies. And when I say near-in adjacencies think about things such as mining, right. We have got a good foothold in that market. L&M was a great example of a near-in adjacency that we did a year ago. And we had four key elements or vital organs to a mining truck, and now we added a fifth with the L&M acquisition. And then again, on digital, we have done a couple of digital acquisitions over the last couple of years. We would expect to see more.\nRafael Santana: Our focus here ultimately is maximizing returns, and we will be opportunistic, but just to add additional color here right recurring, high recurring revenue streams, bolt-ons, digital service related. Those are certainly, I am going to call the bulk of the preference that we have. And with that, I think we have a strong pipeline. It\u2019s making sure that ultimately, the best returns reside on those. And if not, making sure we are not only shy about returning to your share buybacks.\nSteve Barger: Yes. And I think everyone would like to see more digital in the portfolio. And you had said that, that was stronger in international this quarter. Was that a one-off, or do you see the beginnings of a more consistent trend in digital internationally?\nRafael Santana: I think there is two elements there. I think we continue to see a softer North America market. Internationally, we continue to see gaining momentum there. PTC is certainly one of those products and the kinetics also portfolio is very strong there. But there is also an element within digital of making sure we move from what I will call one-time sales to more recurring revenues. So, that\u2019s the element of transformation about the business. I think we are happy to see the business has moved into growth since second quarter, but it\u2019s an element of transforming that business and we are committed to it. We see it as a big element of driving efficiency, productivity. And we are seeing, to some extent, North \u2013 international markets as you think about the opportunity to automate and drive that, potentially gaining momentum ahead of North America given regulation and given some other things. So, it\u2019s all-in-all, a positive, and we are highly committed to continue to grow that business.\nSteve Barger: Great. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to Kyra Yates for any closing comments.\nKyra Yates: Thank you, Keith and thank you everyone for your participation today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you and goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "John Olin",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael and hello everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I will review our third quarter results in more detail. Our third quarter results played out largely as we planned with revenue and better than expected with our operating margins. As we discussed in the last quarter call, we expected both revenue and margin growth to be higher in the first half than in the second half, with the second half growth to be at a much more tempered pace than we experienced in the first half. We also noted during the last call that within the second half of this year, we expected the third quarter's growth to be greater than the fourth quarter's growth. This is still the case. Sequentially, we expect margins in Q4 to come down from Q3, driven by the reverse of what we saw in Q3 regarding business group revenue mix. In Q3, we saw robust services growth, which comes at a higher margin while the equipment business, which comes at a lower margin, was down versus prior year. This was largely a result of the timing of our production between new locomotives, modernizations and engine overhauls. In Q4, we expect a significant mix headwind, which will temper Q4 adjusted operating margins to be modestly higher than year ago levels. We expect double-digit sales growth in our Equipment Group due to increased locomotive deliveries, while services sales are expected to be down double-digit on a year-over-year basis, basically the reverse of our production timing in Q3. Sales for the third quarter were $2.66 billion, which reflects a 4.4% increase versus the prior year. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by both the Freight and Transit segments. For the quarter, GAAP operating income was $433 million. The increase was driven by higher sales, improved gross margin and an unrelenting focus on continuous improvement and productivity. Adjusted operating margin in Q3 was 19.7%, up 1.8 percentage points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by improved gross margin of 1.8 percentage points. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.63, which was up 22.6% versus the year ago quarter. During the quarter, we had net pre-tax charges of $18 million for restructuring, which were primarily related to our Integration 2.0 and our portfolio optimization initiative to further integrate and streamline Wabtec's operations. As you may recall, Integration 2.0 is expected to drive $75 million to $90 million of run-rate savings by 2025. And our portfolio optimization initiative will eliminate roughly $110 million of low margin, non-strategic revenue while reducing manufacturing complexity. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share, was $2, up 17.6% versus the prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another solid quarter, demonstrating the underlying strength of the business. Turning to Slide 8. Let's review our product lines in more detail. Third quarter consolidated sales were up 4.4%. Our quarter results were driven by growth in our services, digital intelligence and transit businesses, partially offset by our equipment business. Equipment sales were down 17.3% from last year's third quarter. This decline was planned and driven by the timing of new locomotive deliveries. As mentioned earlier, we expect this to reverse in Q4, with equipment sales expected to be up double-digit. Component sales were up 1.0% versus last year due to higher international freight car sales and industrial product growth, which was offset by lower North American freight car build. The industry is forecasting the 2024 Freight car build to be down 9% from last year. Digital intelligence sales were up 12.7% from last year. This was driven by growth in our international sales of PTC, next-generation onboard products and digital mining products. Our services sales grew 16.5%. Sales growth was driven primarily by higher year-over-year modernizations and overhauls. As mentioned earlier, we expect the timing of our mods and overhaul production and deliveries to reverse in Q4 resulting in our year-over-year service revenue to be down double-digits. In our Transit segment, sales were up 9.6%. During the quarter, we saw our OE revenue grow 13.3%. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 8.4%. The momentum in the Transit segment continues to remain positive as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonization accelerate the need for investments in sustainable infrastructure. Moving to Slide 9. GAAP gross margin was 33.0%, which was up 2.0 percentage points from the third quarter last year. Adjusted gross margin was also up 1.8 percentage points during the quarter. In addition to the higher sales, gross margin benefited from favorable mix between business groups. Mix within the Freight segment was better than expected due to growth in our services business behind the timing of mods and overhauls in the quarter, partially offset by a planned decline in locomotive production and deliveries. Foreign currency exchange was a slight headwind to revenue as well as gross profit and operating margin in the quarter. During the quarter, we also benefited from increased productivity and the benefits of our Integration 2.0 and portfolio optimization efforts as well as lapping last year's Erie strike that ran through a portion of the third quarter of 2023. Our team continues to execute well by driving operational productivity and lean benefits. Now turning to Slide 10. For the third quarter, GAAP operating margin was 16.3%, which was up 1.8 percentage points versus last year. Adjusted operating margin improved 1.8 percentage points to 19.7%. GAAP and adjusted SG&A and engineering expenses were up versus prior year, but largely flat as a percentage of revenues. Engineering expense was $50 million, slightly lower than Q3 last year. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities. But more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization and safety. Now, let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 11, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales were up 2.6% during the quarter. GAAP segment operating income was $390 million for an operating margin of 20.2%, up 2.9 percentage points versus last year. GAAP operating income included $10 million of restructuring costs primarily related to Integration 2.0 and portfolio optimization. Adjusted operating income for the Freight segment was $467 million, up 17.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the Freight segment was 24.1%, up 2.9 percentage points from the prior year. The increase was driven by improved gross margin behind favorable business mix, strong operational execution, Integration 2.0 savings and as we lap last year's manufacturing inefficiencies caused by the strike in Erie. At the same time, SG&A and engineering expense were slightly lower as a percentage of revenue. Finally, segment 12-month backlog was $5.59 billion, up 6.4% from the same period a year ago. The multiyear backlog was $17.76 billion, up 1.1% from prior year. Turning to Slide 12. Transit segment sales were up 9.6% at $733 million. When adjusting for foreign currency, Transit sales were up 8.4%. GAAP operating income was $79 million. Restructuring costs related to Integration 2.0 were $8 million in Q3. Adjusted segment operating income was $93 million. Adjusted operating income as a percent of revenue was 12.8%, up 0.3 percentage points. During the quarter, adjusted gross margin was down modestly behind unfavorable mix, partially offset by Integration 2.0 savings. Margins also benefited from SG&A and engineering expenses being lower as a percent of revenue. Finally, Transit segment 12-month backlog for the quarter was $2.04 billion, up 10.8% versus a year ago. Now, let's turn to our financial position on Slide 13. Third quarter cash flow was another highlight for the quarter, with operating cash coming in at $542 million. During the quarter, cash flow benefited from higher earnings and $95 million of higher securitization borrowings. We continue to expect greater than 90% cash conversion for the full year. Our balance sheet and financial position continue to be very strong as evidenced by: first, our liquidity position, which ended the quarter at $1.9 billion; and our net debt leverage ratio, which ended the third quarter at 1.7x, which was lower versus the same quarter a year ago at 2.1x debt leverage. We continue to allocate capital to maximize returns for our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $599 million of our shares and paid $35 million in dividends. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael to talk about our 2024 financial guidance. Saree, this is John. When we look at the margins up being up 1.8 percentage points, it was higher than our expectations and it was driven in two areas, Saree. Number one is on mix and the other is on cost. First, on mix, while we knew there was going to be favorable mix, because of the services production coming in at a higher margin at the expense of some of the locals produced in the equipment group that we planned on. What we didn't \u2013 was there was additional mix favorability in our overhauls, which come at a pretty good margin as well as in our mining business, we lean more towards the aftermarket in our sales in the third quarter than OE. And we were expecting a little bit more on the OE side. So, that's on the mix side. And we don't expect that to transcend from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. The second piece of it is on the cost side and there is two elements to that. One is productivity. Everyday, continuous improvement productivity was very strong during the quarter and we certainly got a nod to the manufacturing and the supply chain folks. They are running the system extremely well. And for that, we are getting rewarded on additional productivity. The second area on the cost side is what I just spoke to Angel about is the Integration 2.0 is coming in better and faster than expected. That \u2013 both of those cost items benefited the third quarter and will benefit the fourth quarter. And those two combined are \u2013 I am sorry, the mix and the cost combined is what got us the increase in EPS at the midpoint of $0.20. When we look now to the fourth quarter, we are going to see a reverse of what we saw in the third quarter between the production of mods, locals and overhauls. And with that, we expect in the fourth quarter that equipment will be up in the double-digits and services at a higher margin will be down in the double-digit. So, we are going to have a significant amount of mix pressure. And this is nothing new that we've talked about. The second half would be unfavorable in mix and this is what's going to drive it as the fourth quarter. And with that, we would expect overall margins to be higher on a year-over-year basis, but slightly and \u2013 but down sequentially by a fair amount as we move into the fourth quarter. Again, this has nothing to do with the underlying demand. It's really all about how we produce the year so that we could more level load our factories. Yes. Starting with the first question, Ken, is we get the question often is international margins, whether international versus North America, it is really specific to the country and the contracts that we are working off of. And we have some international that are higher than North America, some that are lower, some areas that we are investing in, others that were not. So it's not as simple as saying that international is this when we get revenue, it's going to come at that margin. It really is with regards to the various contracts that we have. I think suffice to say that we couldn't be more pleased with the growth that we are having from our international business from a revenue perspective as well as a margin perspective. And our view across everything is how do we continue to deliver more value to our customers and get that built into our backlog as we go forward. The second question, Ken, is on the service revenue in the fourth quarter. Let's take the third quarter and the fourth quarter together. We \u2013 as you know, and you have been down to the facility down there, we do mods and locos on the same production line. So, we have level loaded those, but there is still \u2013 because these fall into different groups, mods falls into the service group and new locos falls into the equipment group, we are going to have some variation as to how we run the product. We typically like to run a customer order as much as we can together or consistently for the productivity and quality aspect of it. And it just happened in the third quarter that given the orders that we had, we produced more mods on a year-over-year basis and less new locos, and that's simply going to reverse in the fourth quarter. But with that, we are going to see that shift from more favorable mix in the third quarter to less favorable in the fourth quarter. But there is nothing more than just how we plan the production. There is nothing different with the demand for the products, just how we are fulfilling that demand. So, we talked about this in February that we were going to do $110 million. A good portion of that is \u2013 well, it's mostly all executed. We got a little bit more to execute in the fourth quarter and we will see the lower revenues, both in this year, \u201824, and some lower revenues into \u201825 as a result of it, but that's all tracking very well. Thank you, Ken. Hi Daniel. And then, Ken, within the quarter, the $600 million that we repurchased is really a function of that cash flow you mentioned. We have had year-to-date cash of $1.1 billion and that's up over 100% versus a year ago. So, in the absence of M&A, which we would prefer, we returned the value to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases, and we couldn't be more pleased to do that. Hi Jerry. Actually, receivables on a year-to-date basis are up about 6.5%. I don't think you are picking up all the receivables there, but they are up 6.5%. But to your point, we have got \u2013 overall, revenue on a year-to-date basis, up 9.1%. And if you adjust for some of that the securitization, you would see the receivables more nearly matching the rate of the growth of the company. Yes. So, for the securitization, we ended the quarter at $95 million securitized. And the reason we do that, Jerry, is it's a lower cost of funds for us, and we would prefer to borrow with that, but we ended the quarter at $95 million. We started the quarter at zero. So that was a headwind \u2013 I am sorry, that was a benefit to our cash flow in the quarter of the $542 million. Now on a year-over-year basis, the receivables of the securitization borrowings are down quite a bit. They are down $140 million from where we were at the end of the third quarter last year. But within the quarter, it did provide some benefit to that cash flow number and the cash conversion ex the securitization would have been 106%. Thank you. Let me start with the backlog question. So, the $405 million, which is the first order we have received against a $200-plus million MOU that is in backlog for the third quarter. So, all the backlog numbers that we read to you is inclusive of that $405 million. We will continue to work on the rest of those orders and that will come over time. Good morning Scott. Yes, Scott, it is a little bit early to talk about the components of 2025. We probably had more shifting \u2013 not probably, we have had more shifting in \u201824. We wouldn't expect as much activity from a production standpoint in 2025. I think the way to think about the overall margins are really where we are expecting or where we were guiding to, and that's how we will take into 2025 and work to improve against. I think there is a couple of areas, Steve, that we are focused on. One is the digital area and others are near-in adjacencies. Of course, we are always interested in bolt-ons to our existing business. But other than that, it would be near-in adjacencies. And when I say near-in adjacencies think about things such as mining, right. We have got a good foothold in that market. L&M was a great example of a near-in adjacency that we did a year ago. And we had four key elements or vital organs to a mining truck, and now we added a fifth with the L&M acquisition. And then again, on digital, we have done a couple of digital acquisitions over the last couple of years. We would expect to see more."

            "name": "Rafael Santana",
            "content": "Thanks, Kyra and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4. I will start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter and progress against our long-term value creation framework and then John will cover the financials. We delivered another solid quarter, evidenced by sales growth, margin expansion, increased earnings and strong cash flow. Sales were $2.7 billion, which was up nearly 4.5% versus the prior year. Revenue growth was driven by both the Freight and Transit segments. Adjusted EPS was up nearly 18% from the year ago quarter driven by increased sales and margin expansion. Total cash flow from operations for the quarter was $542 million. We continue to execute against our capital allocation framework to maximize shareholder value by investing for future growth and returning cash to our shareholders. The 12-month backlog was $7.6 billion, up 7.5%, signifying continued momentum and visibility across the business. And the total multiyear backlog was $22 billion. Overall, the Wabtec team delivered a solid third quarter behind an intense focus on execution. Looking ahead, I am encouraged by the underlying strength and momentum across the business and believe Wabtec is positioned for continued profitable growth ahead. Shifting our focus to Slide 5, let's talk about 2024 end market expectations in more details. While key metrics across our Freight business remain mixed, we are encouraged by the underlying momentum of our business, the continued strength of our international markets and the robust pipeline of opportunities across geographies. North American carloads continued to be up in the quarter despite this carload growth. The industries and Wabtec's active locomotive fleet was largely flat when compared to last year's third quarter. Looking at the North American railcar build, last quarter, the industry outlook for 2024 was 38,000 cars to be delivered, which has now been raised by the industry sources to 41,000 cars, down from last year's build of 45,000 cars. Internationally, we are seeing significant investments to expand and upgrade infrastructure, which are supporting a robust international locomotive borders pipeline. This is the strongest it has been over the last 5 years. In mining, commodity prices and an aging fleet continue to support activity to refresh and upgrade the truck fleet. Finally, moving to the Transit sector, we continue to see underlying indicators for growth. Ridership levels are increasing in key geographies, along with the fleet expansion and renewals. There also continues to be a strong push with regulation and customer initiatives on decarbonization and sustainable transportation solutions. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few business highlights. Last year, in the third quarter, we announced the signing of a strategic MOU with KTZ, the National Railway Company in Kazakhstan, for over $2 billion. Since that time, we have worked to finalize orders associated with that MOU, a multiyear new locomotive order with KTZ for $405 million. These locomotives will provide the efficiency, reliability and operational savings to effectively support the growing demand on the Trans-Caspian international route that connects China to Europe. Moving to North America, we secured the long-term parts agreement with a Class 1 railroad for over $300 million. In Transit, we signed a contract for $70 million with Siemens Mobility to supply passenger information systems for 90 Munich S-Bahn trains. And earlier in the quarter, we expanded our service contract with Indian Railways for another $30 million. This agreement expands Wabtec's locomotive service capabilities into the southern part of the country. All of this demonstrates the underlying strength across our businesses, the team's relentless focus on execution and the strong pipeline of opportunities, which we continue to execute on. With that, I will turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results and our overall financial performance. John? Thanks, John. Now, let's turn to Slide 14 to discuss our 2024 full year guidance. As you heard today, our team delivered a solid third quarter, which was ahead of our expectations. Consequently, we are increasing our previous adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.45 to $7.65, at the midpoint, up 27.5%. Our revenue and cash flow conversion guidance remain unchanged. Looking ahead, I am confident that Wabtec is well-positioned to drive profitable growth into 2024 and beyond. Now, let's wrap up on Slide 15. As you heard today, our team continues to deliver on our value creation framework, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world class team, innovative technologies and our continued focus on our customers with solid underlying demand for our products and technologies and rigorous focus on continuous improvement in cost management, consistent with our previous guidance, we continue to expect to drive mid single-digit organic growth while driving double-digit EPS growth through our planning horizon, thereby maximizing our shareholders' returns. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning. And I'll turn the call over to Kyra to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kyra? Good morning. Well, first, it's certainly early to be providing guidance into \u201825. But the fundamentals for the business are strong. We are finishing \u201824 with really every single one of our businesses are growing. Year-to-date, orders are up double-digit. Profitability is up across the board as well. And I'll finish with consistent with what we have given on previous guidance we continue to expect to drive mid-single-digit organic growth while delivering double-digit EPS growth through our planning horizon. Great. As you know, Integration 2.0, I mean, as we came out of last year, savings were $22 million and we were looking to get to a midpoint of $82.5 million. So that leaves a ramp of $60 million over \u201824 and \u201825. And what I'll tell you, Angel, is that we are on track and actually exceeding our expectations a bit. Not only are we getting a little bit more than we anticipated, but it's coming a little bit earlier. And we are really seeing that inflection in the third quarter. And as you see, we are raising our guidance. Part of that is driven by the over-delivery on Integration 2.0 in the third quarter and we expect that to kind of compound into the fourth quarter. So we feel real good about where we're at today. Most of the spending is behind us. We finished the quarter program to-date with $140 million of spending. That's on the low end of our range. We will have a little bit more spending to go, but tracking well on the expense side and I am a little bit ahead on the savings side. I'll take this one. And I'll start with we continue to be pleased with the overall progress in the business. Our teams are continuing to really drive significant simplification on the footprint. They are further improving and sustaining margins. I think you're going to see variation quarter-to-quarter. Some will be driven by mix and timing of projects. But I expect Transit to continue to deliver on profitable growth. You asked about selectivity on projects, I think the best way for us to look at it is when we look at the profitability of the backlog, and that's up. So that business is on track to continue to expand on margins. And they are not starting as mid-teens and continue to improve from there. So we feel strong about the plan they have ahead. Good morning. So, we \u2013 when we think about just the dynamics of the business, internationally growth really continues. So, I think we are bullish on key international markets. We have got some elements of projects taking place in Africa. I think you are going to continue to see some wins from us there. So, that's a positive. We are continuing to expand on the Caspian routes and demand continues there in Kazakhstan as well. And the good news on some of these projects, and I speak here to South America and Australia. I mean some of the discussions here go well into \u201826, \u201827. We are discussing locomotive deliveries into \u201828. So that's, I think a positive in that regard, and it comes down to the experience customers are having with our fleets driving both productivity, availability and reliability. So, we see that really continuing. Some of the investments we have done in technology, I think you are going to continue to see a significant opportunity here for us to actually accelerate some of the modernization, we will talk more about this early next year, but there is certainly an element of innovation on how we continue to drive that. We mentioned Kazakhstan. We talked about locomotive order what we often sometimes don't give the same emphasis is on the opportunity we have with digital here. And we are expanding on not just the Trip Optimizer, some of our kinetics products are being brought as well into this mix. We often talk about PTC that's, an area that we will continue to expand. So, we see it as a positive. And I think we will continue to see profitable growth there, some of those markets I mentioned. Our markets were more mature. So, we have got a lot of products that are really best-in-class to compete. I think the best way to answer this is when we look at our capital allocation strategy, that hasn't changed, right. We continue to focus to be on making sure we are driving profitable organic growth for the business. We are certainly very much focused on M&A as well. When I think about the inorganic, this is the strongest pipeline we have had on M&A, and we will continue to look at us. We will be opportunistic here. And just a question of returns, the returns are there. We are going vast on it. If they are not, we won't be shy about doing share buybacks. Thank you. North America, we continue to see mixed. I mean you have got to be looking at specifics on customers here. But we continue to see demand. That's for both new locomotives and for mods. I think our customers overall are continuing to invest if you think about customers investing. It's most of the time for improved costs, it's for reliability, it's for efficiency. It's not for car loan growth. It's not for necessarily revenue growth. So, that's where I think we are excited about. And coming back to some earlier comments I made is the opportunity we have here to continue to innovate and make sure that they are investing for a return at the end of the day, getting more efficient product that will help, improve their OR and improve the service levels in the railroad. That's how we look at it at the end of the day, but you have got to really look at customer specifics here. Good morning. I think we have significant momentum here still. Our teams continue to simplify the business. They are driving continuous improvement actions across the business. And with that, I think we have the opportunity here to continue to drive margin expansion. So, margin rates in our overall business, I think we will continue to benefit from not just as lean efforts with productivity integration to that all. John mentioned portfolio optimization. So, I think we have significant opportunities here to continue to drive momentum and we are committed here to drive profitable growth as we go into \u201825 and beyond. With regards to, I guess the fundamentals of the business, I mean we are finishing \u201824 with, again, every single one of our businesses are growing. Orders are up double digits. The pipeline is strong. We feel especially strong about the international growth, some of the markets I mentioned here, and that all translates into momentum, not just it goes into \u201825 to \u201827. So, that's really a positive there for us. So, the pipeline is strong. And even in North America, as I have said, the demand is there, but customers are investing for return. And what makes me really feel positive about the momentum is that innovation. As we will talk to you in more detail and start of the year is the ability to drive that next level of efficiency into the existing fleets and making sure that customers are accelerating and improving their operating ratios through that process, improving productivity, availability and reliability of the fleet. So, all-in-all, as I have said, we continue to expect to drive mid-single digit organic growth while delivering double-digit EPS growth through the planning horizon. Okay. The backlog of the $405 million KTZ order will be largely delivered over \u201825 and \u201826 timeframe. And the service agreement is a longer term. That will be over a longer term. I am not sure exactly how many years, but. On the EPA, Scott, we haven't really had, I am going to call substantial change since we last talked. But I guess what we are saying is if you look at the heavy truck fleet, which is now really expected to have to drive 25% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA is also defined liquid hydrogen for internal combustion engines would be classified as a near zero or zero emissions. And we see that as a validation of the strategy we have pursued with really making sure our engines are ultimately agnostic, and we are able to run alternative gases like hydrogen, with biofuels, renewable fuels and we see that as a validation for really making sure we are the best-in-class product to help our customers achieve their goals on decarbonization in various parts of the world. So, the fuels that might be available in Brazil might be different than in California and other parts of North America. So, we see that as really a validation and we feel very strong about having the best-in-class products here to play given any regulation changes and things like that. So, that's a positive for us. Thank you. Our focus here ultimately is maximizing returns, and we will be opportunistic, but just to add additional color here right recurring, high recurring revenue streams, bolt-ons, digital service related. Those are certainly, I am going to call the bulk of the preference that we have. And with that, I think we have a strong pipeline. It's making sure that ultimately, the best returns reside on those. And if not, making sure we are not only shy about returning to your share buybacks. I think there is two elements there. I think we continue to see a softer North America market. Internationally, we continue to see gaining momentum there. PTC is certainly one of those products and the kinetics also portfolio is very strong there. But there is also an element within digital of making sure we move from what I will call one-time sales to more recurring revenues. So, that's the element of transformation about the business. I think we are happy to see the business has moved into growth since second quarter, but it's an element of transforming that business and we are committed to it. We see it as a big element of driving efficiency, productivity. And we are seeing, to some extent, North \u2013 international markets as you think about the opportunity to automate and drive that, potentially gaining momentum ahead of North America given regulation and given some other things. So, it's all-in-all, a positive, and we are highly committed to continue to grow that business. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note that this event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Kyra Yates, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.\nKyra Yates: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Wabtec second quarter 2024 earnings call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, John Olin; and Senior Vice President of Finance, John Mastalerz. Today's slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures were posted to our website earlier today and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab. Some statements we are making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements, please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics, and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. I will now turn the call over to Rafael.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kyra. And good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4. I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter and progress against our long-term value-creation framework. And then, John will cover the financials. We delivered another strong quarter, evidenced by robust sales and earnings per share growth. Sales were $2.6 billion, which was up nearly 10% versus prior year. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance from the Freight segment. And adjusted EPS was up 39% from the year-ago quarter, driven by increased sales and margin expansion. Total cash flow from operations for the quarter was $235 million. The 12-month backlog was $7.3 billion, and the multi-year backlog was $22 billion. Overall, the Wabtec team delivered a strong second quarter. With the first half behind us, we are focused on executing against our second half deliverables. Looking forward, I'm encouraged by the underlying strength and momentum across the business. Shifting our focus to Slide 5, let's talk about 2024 and market expectations in more details. While key metrics across our Freight business remain mixed, we are encouraged by the strength of our business, the strength of our international markets and our robust pipeline of opportunities across geographies. North American car loads were up 2.1% in the quarter. Despite this car load growth, the industry's active locomotive fleet was down when compared to last year's second quarter, while Wabtec's active fleet was higher. Looking at the North American railcar builds. Last quarter we discussed the industry outlook for 2024 to be about 36,000 cars to be delivered, which has now been raised by industry sources back to the original forecast of 38,000 cars. This is still down, however, from the 45,000 in the previous year. Internationally, we continue to see that significant investments to expand and upgrade infrastructure are supporting a robust international orders pipeline. In mining, commodity prices and an aging fleet are continuing to support activity to refresh and upgrade the truck fleet. Finally, moving to the Transit sector, the megatrends of urbanization and decarbonization remain in place, driving the need for clean, safe and efficient transportation solutions around the globe. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few business highlights. In North America, we secured a multiyear order for greater than $600 million. This is one of our largest orders for new Tier 4 locomotives ever. It demonstrates customer demand for a best-in-class solution to improve productivity, reduce fuel usage, improve reliability and to significantly reduce emissions. I would also like to share with you a key international services order, a 10-year agreement in Brazil for which Wabtec will manage the servicing of Vale's locomotives fleet to increase availability, reliability and safety. In Pakistan, we recently won a strategic order for 15 modernizations for Pakistan Railway. This is a great example of the opportunities that we have to modernize locomotives in our international markets. And finally, our Transit segment announced that our Green Friction braking solution is ready to begin commercial fleet operations in the Greater Paris metropolitan area. This innovative solution will improve air quality in the transit's authority tunnels and underground network by reducing particle emissions from braking by up to 90%. All of this demonstrates the underlying strength across our business, the team's relentless focus on execution and the strong pipeline of opportunities we continue to deliver on. Wabtec is well-positioned to continue to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers' needs. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results and our overall financial performance.\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Rafael. And hello, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I will review our second quarter results in more detail. Our second quarter results played out largely as we expected. We expected both revenue and earnings growth to be overshared versus our full-year growth expectations, but slightly tempered from our first quarter results. The primary driver of our first half results growing faster than our expected second half results is due to a shift in the combined production of our new locomotives and mods to the first half of this year from the second half, in an effort to more evenly load our manufacturing production across the four quarters. It is also important to note that we expect our second half revenue and margin to grow, but at a more tempered pace than we experienced in the first half. Within the second half, we do expect to grow revenue and earnings year-over-year in each quarter. However, we expect the third quarter's growth to be greater than the fourth quarter's growth. Sales for the second quarter were $2.64 billion, which reflects a 9.8% increase versus the prior year. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by the Freight segment, especially by equipment and components. For the quarter, GAAP operating income was $430 million, driven by higher sales, improved gross margin and an unrelenting focus on continuous improvement in productivity. Adjusted operating margin in Q2 was 19.3%, up 2.9 percentage points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by improved gross margin of 2.9 percentage points. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.64, which was up 54.7% versus the second quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had net pre-tax charges of $6 million for restructuring, which were primarily related to our Integration 2.0 and our portfolio optimization initiative to further integrate and streamline Wabtec's operations. As you may recall, Integration 2.0 is expected to drive $75 million to $90 million of run-rate savings by 2025. And our portfolio optimization initiative will eliminate roughly $110 million of low-margin non-strategic revenue while reducing manufacturing complexity. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.96, up 39.0% versus prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another strong quarter, demonstrating the underlying strength of the business. Turning to Slide 8, let's review our product lines in more detail. Second quarter consolidated sales were up 9.8% as we expected. Our quarter results were driven by solid growth across all our business groups and further aided by a year-over-year increase in the combined new loco and mods as we have shifted our production and deliveries more to the first half versus the second half in order to more appropriately balance or level load our factories, thereby allowing us to be more consistent with our labor staffing, improve our quality and to gain manufacturing efficiencies. Equipment sales were up 36.4% from last year's second quarter, driven by robust deliveries of new locomotives and increased sales of mining equipment. Component sales were up 17.5% versus last year, largely driven by increased sales of industrial products, higher international sales and the acquisition of L&M in late Q2 of 2023, partially offset by lower North American railcar build. Digital Intelligence sales were up 2.1% from last year, where we continue to experience growth in international sales aided by higher PTC revenues, partially offset by lower revenues in our North American market. Our Services sales grew 2.3%. Sales growth was driven primarily by higher year-over-year overhauls and parts sales. Our customers continue to recognize the superior performance, reliability and availability of our fleet. In our Transit segment, sales were up 2.0%. During the quarter, we saw our aftermarket revenue grow 10%. On a constant-currency basis, sales grew 3.4%. The momentum in the Transit segment remains positive as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonization accelerate the need for investments in sustainable infrastructure. Moving to Slide 9. GAAP gross margin was 33.0%, which was up 2.9 percentage points from last year. Adjusted gross margin was also up 2.9 percentage points during the quarter. In addition to the higher sales, gross margin benefited from favorable mix between segments. Mix within the Freight segment was also favorable despite higher combined new locomotives and modernizations in the quarter. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind to revenue as well as gross profit and operating margin in the quarter. During the quarter, we also benefited from favorable fixed-cost absorption, increased productivity and benefits from Integration 2.0, as well as lapping last year's start of the Erie Strike in late Q2 of 2023. Our team continues to execute well by driving operational productivity and lean benefits. Now turning to Slide 10. For the second quarter, GAAP operating margin was 16.3%, which was up 3.4 percentage points versus last year. Adjusted operating margin improved 2.9 percentage points to 19.3%. GAAP and adjusted SG&A expenses were up versus prior year, but largely flat as a percentage of revenues. Engineering expense was $57 million, moderately higher than Q2 last year. We continue to invest engineering resources in current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization and safety. Now, let's take a look at segment results on Slide 11, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales were up 13.1% during the quarter. GAAP segment operating income was $391 million for an operating margin of 20.4%, up 4.5 percentage points versus last year. GAAP operating income included $5 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to Integration 2.0 and portfolio optimization. Adjusted operating income for the Freight segment was $462 million, up 34.3% versus prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the Freight segment was 24.1%, up 3.8 percentage points from the prior year. The increase was driven by improved gross margin behind strong operational execution, favorable mix, Integration 2.0 savings, and as we lap last year's manufacturing inefficiencies caused by the strike in Erie. At the same time, SG&A and engineering expenses were lower as a percentage of revenue. Finally, segment 12-month backlog was $5.50 billion, up 4.0% from the same period a year ago. The multiyear backlog was $17.93 billion, down 2.0% from the prior year. Turning to Slide 12, Transit segment sales were 2.0% at $724 million. When adjusting for foreign currency, Transit sales were up 3.4%. GAAP operating income was $82 million. Restructuring costs related to Integration 2.0 were $5 million in Q2. Adjusted segment operating income was $91 million. Adjusted operating income as a percent of revenue was 12.7%, up 1.6 percentage points from last year, driven by Integration 2.0 savings and favorable mix. Finally, Transit segment 12-month backlog for the quarter was $1.83 billion, down 5.0% versus a year ago. The decrease on a year-over-year basis was expected due to our focus on being more selective on the orders that we add to backlog, thereby expecting to drive improved long-term profitability. Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 13. Second quarter cash flow was another highlight for the quarter, with operating cash coming in at $235 million. During the quarter, cash flow benefited from higher earnings and improved working capital, partially offset by a reduction of $230 million of securitization borrowings. We continue to expect greater than 90% cash conversion for the full year. Our balance sheet and financial position continue to be very strong as evidenced by, first, our liquidity position, which ended the quarter at $2.09 billion. And our net-debt leverage ratio was 1.6 times at the end of the second quarter, which was lower versus the same quarter a year ago at 2.4 times debt leverage. We continue to allocate capital in a disciplined and balanced way to maximize returns for our shareholders. During the quarter, we purchased $200 million of our shares and paid $35 million in dividends. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael to talk about our 2024 financial guidance.\nRafael Santana: Thanks, John. Now let's turn to Slide 14 to discuss our 2024 full year guidance. As you heard today, our team delivered a very strong second quarter, which was slightly ahead of our expectations. Consequently, we are increasing our previous adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.20 to $7.50 at the midpoint, up 24.2%. Our revenue and cash flow conversion guidance remain unchanged. Looking ahead, I'm confident that Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable growth into 2024 and beyond. Now let's wrap up on Slide 15. As you heard today, our team continues to deliver value for our stakeholders, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world-class team, innovative technologies and our continued focus on our customers. Overall, we believe we have an opportunity to continue building significant long-term momentum with growth in equipment, services, components, digital solutions and transit systems. With solid underlying demand for our products and technologies and intense focus on continuous improvement in cost management, consistent with our previous guidance, we continue to expect to drive mid-single-digit organic growth while delivering double-digit earnings per share growth through our planning horizon, thereby maximizing our shareholder returns. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning, and I'll now turn the call over to Kyra to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kyra?\nKyra Yates: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions. But before we do, and out of consideration for others on the call, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator: And our first question today comes from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.\nDaniel Imbro: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nDaniel Imbro: Rafael, maybe I'll start on the new locomotive side. I think you mentioned in your remarks that the $600-plus-million order, one of the bigger Tier 4 orders you've had in a while. It's coming over multiple years from the slides. Any color you can provide just on how many years that contract is, when it should start up as we think about modeling it? And then to clarify, was that included in the 2Q backlog or was that assigned July quarter-to-date?\nRafael Santana: No, that was not included in the previous backlog, so it's in the second Q backlog. The second piece is this is an order that will largely be executed between '25 and '26. And the other piece is I think it just speaks to the strength of our pipeline of opportunities. We continue to see good momentum there internationally and that expands really across different geographies. We continue to see it mixed in North America, but with opportunities here. We have a number of sizable opportunities that are being worked in the current pipeline. The current total backlog is healthy and overall it's a positive. We're progressing. We're continuing to grow and our pipeline supports it.\nDaniel Imbro: Great. Really encouraging. And for my follow-up, John, maybe just something on the guide, if we can dig into it a little bit. I think you're expecting, you said, revenue and earnings growth in the back half. I think the previous assumptions had been that margins would moderate through the year, but it looks like sequentially revenue is relatively flat. So can you talk about maybe what's changing on the cost side? Are costs increasing to drive that sequential deleverage on the margin piece on the operating margin? Is there some conservatism in that? How are you thinking about the operating margin outlook for the back half of the year after a strong first half?\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Daniel. And certainly, the last couple of quarters, we've talked about kind of our -- how our halves are going to unfold, and they're certainly unfolding the way we expected. And Daniel, that is with the first half having significantly higher year-over-year growth as well, I'm sorry, for both revenue and margin growth. Revenue was up 11.7% and margin up 2. -- or 3.2 percentage points. With that, we've also talked about the back half being up and growing in both those measures, but at a more significantly level -- tempered level. And the reason for that, Daniel, is what is driving some of the first half growth is not going to be there in the second half. So let's talk about a couple of those things. One is mix, and we talked about this on the last call. Our first half mix is a good tailwind for us and we expect that to turn into a slight headwind in the second half. So that's one of the reasons. The other is really around absorption, right, fixed-cost absorption. With the growth that we have in the first half, again, up being -- being up almost 12%, we are getting much more absorption on a year-over-year basis in the first half versus the second half. So again, that won't be there. Now there's some common things in there, right? Integration 2.0 is benefiting both halves at a similar rate. And we've got some one-time benefit both in the first half and the second half. But the answer is, is really on mix and absorption in the second half.\nDaniel Imbro: Great. Appreciate all the color. Best of luck.\nRafael Santana: Thank you, Daniel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Angel Castillo from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nAngel Castillo: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on the kind of revenue. You've kind of touched on it, but you didn't change that guidance and it sounds like there's some kind of mixed factors, some getting better. You talked about car loads and railcar deliveries, but just if you could unpack that a little bit more and maybe the thinking around keeping that unchanged versus the EPS guide?\nRafael Santana: Angel, we are tracking right on our revenue plan. We adjusted that in the first quarter, brought it up a bit largely for some of the things that we're seeing in the parking arena. That's right on track. Everything is tracking well. And I would kind of look at what we did in terms of EPS as fine-tuning the quarter. We brought it up $0.15 at the midpoint. Again, revenue is on track, but we did see a little bit of favorability in mix in the first half and the tax rate came in a little bit favorable. And I would say, Angel, that about, half that $0.15 is in the actuals in the second quarter and a little bit of favorability that we're expecting in the back half, and that is due to the same two reasons. Mix is going to be a little bit more favorable than we expected. However, still a headwind to the half. And then the tax rate is favorable. And we've also re-guided on the tax rate, bringing it down from 25 -- 25% to 24.5%. But, we're seven months into this thing and we feel very good about our overall guidance and how the back half is going to unfold and really in line with what we've talked about the last couple of quarters.\nAngel Castillo: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just given the level of conviction and optimism on how things are unfolding, your first half cash flow has been very robust and you have guided to continued expectation for greater than 90%. And I think second half typically is -- sees better kind of cash generation. So could you talk about just your thought process? You talked about kind of disciplined balanced capital allocation, but it seems like your cash flow generation should be quite robust and allow for perhaps a little bit more aggressive deployment of capital. So, if you could just kind of touch on that and your expectations for cash flow in the second half.\nJohn Olin: Well, Angel, thanks for pointing out the very strong first half, much appreciated. Yeah, the first half was up $469 million on a year-over-year basis. And what we're seeing there and why we're seeing that is if you recall a year ago, our working capital was still rising as most industrial companies were because of the supply disruptions. And we had a little bit of added in there with regards to the inventory we were building on with regard to a potential strike at the time. So in the back half of last year, we brought that inventory down quite a bit. The team did a fantastic job on managing it back down after the supply disruptions. And so what we're seeing in the first half is really lapping that higher working capital, so we're seeing significant strength there. Overall, we are expecting the guidance that we've had of over 90% cash conversion and we're looking to continue to deploy that, Angel, as we've talked about in the past. We're going to favor M&A. And with the excess cash, we'll buy back shares.\nAngel Castillo: Could you maybe expand a little bit on the M&A front in the pipeline and what you're seeing?\nRafael Santana: Let me take on that. I mean, we're continuing to be really looking at M&A. The pipeline is as robust as it's ever been. We're going to be opportunistic here. What's going to drive decision-making is really making sure that we drive higher ROIC for the business and faster profitable growth. But we're going to be opportunistic here. And as we continue to see opportunities to return value to shareholders through share buybacks, we'll do so. And we feel we're very well-positioned here to drive long-term profitable growth.\nAngel Castillo: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.\nBascome Majors: Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to start internationally. Can you expand some on the 15 mod orders you talked about from Pakistan Railway? What's the scale of that business? Where are you doing those modifications? And is there an opportunity to see either the installed base or breadth of geography that you can cover from those facilities to expand to something more like you see in North America over time? Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Yes. So, we see a strong pipeline of opportunity internationally. When we talked about Pakistan, I think one of the things that we've talked about is the opportunity to continue to modernize the fleets that are out there. We often emphasize the age of the fleet, and we have continued to invest on significant innovation that allows customers here to significantly reduce fuel by upgrading those engines. They can improve both reliability and availability of those units through those. When you think about modernizations, we largely -- we have a kit that\u2019s shipped and we ultimately work with the customers on doing some of that internationally. But as you know, we have some of our locations around the world that we're very much equipped to do so, whether if it's in Brazil, whether if it's in Australia, whether if it's in Kazakhstan. And we'll leverage those as we work through. But I think what's exciting about the international opportunities, they're not concentrated in one single location. We're seeing our business be very competitive. If customers are looking for reliable, efficient power, if they're looking for value, we are seeing the business winning. I think we highlighted in the first half of this year, a significant order for us in West Africa. That's the kind of orders that's going to be executed in '26 and '27. So it's good to see the strength of international, especially I'm going to call -- bringing broader and broader visibility into conversion going out into '26 and into '27. So overall, I think good dynamics internationally, and we've seen that business grow between 4% and 5% -- our fleets grow 4% to 5% over the last five years and we continue to see good dynamics there.\nBascome Majors: Thank you for that. And to follow-up domestically, can you talk a little bit about the inquiry levels and discussions with your North American rail customers and specifically, how they're operating within regulatory uncertainty, both with who's going to be in the leadership in Washington and who's going to be in the leadership at the EPA come next year, and if it's just realistic for us to expect to not see extensions of some of the large multiyear orders that you've got in both the mod and new locomotive backlog until after we get into 2025 with a bit more certainty there? Thank you.\nRafael Santana: So I think we continue to see it mixed in North America. It's very customer-specific. So it really varies different levels of, I'm going to call fleet redundancy some customers might have or not. And I think you see that reflected on the significant order here we got in the second quarter. So it's customer specifics. I don't think -- when I think about what will make our customers invest, it's ultimately the value, the returns they obtain on really modernizing their fleets. What I'm happy to see is the innovation we're driving the business. A lot of the growth you saw here over the last few years, which was tied to the modernizations, largely connected to in a lot of ways what I'll call the 7FDL fleet, which is an older engine we have. We're doing the same thing now for the EVO engine. So in fact, we're going at the end of this year into really commercializing the EVO product, which will drive another five-plus-percent fuel efficiency and improvements for that fleet, and we're doing the same thing on Tier 4. So it's that continued innovation that's going to make customers come, modernize their fleets before they get to 25, 30 years of age. And that will drive both an element of a reduction in cost, which will improve OR on how they operate the fleets, but will also improve services with availability and reliability of those fleets. So all in all, I think we see strong coverage here as we progress forward for the business with the backlog we have.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is James on for Saree. Thanks for taking the questions.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: So I just wanted to follow-up on the Tier 4 locomotive orders in North America. What was the driver behind the customer ordering new locos versus modernization? And I believe Class 1s are generally fine with the number of locos they have, so I just wanted to understand like the conversation that you had with the customer and why they decided to go with the new locos. Thanks.\nRafael Santana: I think it's very much tied to, again, value. It's how customers see an opportunity here to improve both cost of operations, how they see the improved reliability and availability. So think about just the speed in their network, just think about the services levels that they're able to sustain. And with this specific fleet of Tier 4s, also the capability of taking what I'll call alternative fuels. That's a fleet that we have very much talked about the opportunity to take on not just biofuels, but also that's fleet ready to take on what I'll call a mix that could come with things like hydrogen and so forth. So those are some of the elements. In addition to that, I got to highlight to you the fact that -- I mean, you've got very much obsolescence taking on on older fleets, especially if you think from an electronics perspective and the challenge on maintaining some of those fleets over time. So I think very much aligned with the dynamics of customers investing to lower their cost, to improve serviceability. And in some cases, you'll also see customers with an opportunity to grow here. So those, I think, are some of the elements that will continue to drive demand from our customers in North America and everywhere else.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for the color. And as a follow-up, I want to touch on the digital, like North America kind of remained weak for a while, while international kind of continued to show strength. Can you talk about when you expect North America to recover and the driver behind the weakness here?\nRafael Santana: Yeah. I think some of what you saw in the quarter, which is really, I think, ultimately connected to higher demand for what I'll call onboard locomotive products, we also saw a good demand on the digital mining technologies. I think ultimately those were and continue to be offset by lower sales in the North American market. I think in the second quarter, you saw that tick to a positive, so the business grew 2.1%. But moving forward, I think we're continuing to see here through the second half a pipeline, higher demand from international. That calls for things like PTC, the same onboard products that I discussed in mining technologies as well, but it continues a softer demand in the US driven by fundamentally what I'll call discretionary OpEx in that regard. With that, our businesses are -- or our teams are very much focused on making sure that we continue to drive order convertibility with recurring revenues. And I feel we continue to progress here to ultimately drive a growth here in '24 for this business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. One -- just one more on the guidance. So I totally get the first half, second half comps. I just want to sort of look a little bit more on just like on an absolute basis. So op margins were 19.5% in the first half. If we're looking at the model right and guidance right, it sort of suggests that margins go a little bit below 18% in the second half. And I thought the message was more, hey, we're smoothing out mods and deliveries. And so I think we're seeing the revenue smoother. I guess, why aren't the margins smoother? And ultimately, I'm trying to figure out, right, is there sort of upside to the -- to sort of the implied margin in the back half of the year?\nJohn Olin: Yes, Scott, it's the same -- the same thing we talked about. It's mix, right? Mix is lifting it in the first half and is going to pull it down a little bit in the second half. And also the first half on that 19.3% is aided by a fair amount of absorption that we don't expect in the back half.\nScott Group: And so ultimately, when we start thinking about '25 margins, maybe it's just too early to go there, but like should we -- is there -- is the first half or the second half you think more representative of like what the business should be as on a go-forward?\nJohn Olin: Well, I -- it's too early to get into what 2025 looks like. We'll certainly be looking at it from where we're launching in terms of the margin that we have at the end of the year. And, we have 27,000 people waking up every morning to improve upon that. And so, you know, we'll be in a position in a couple of quarters to provide guidance on that. But we -- you know, are -- believe we are in line with our long-term guidance as we move out of this year and I feel good about what's in front of us.\nRafael Santana: Scott, the only thing I'd add there is I think we have good momentum coming from lean initiatives with productivity, cost actions driven by Integration 2.0. I think you're going to see more on portfolio optimization. And while I think you're going to continue to see variation, whether if it's quarter-to-quarter, half-to-half, we are kind of continue to expand margins ahead.\nScott Group: Yeah, no, that makes sense. And then maybe just one follow-up, like, is price a bigger factor now than maybe it's been in the past, right? Obviously, really good Freight margins. Is price-cost a bigger tailwind than historically, and is that sort of a sustainable driver of further margin improvement?\nRafael Santana: Scott, we look at price very much connected to the level of differentiation and innovation that we bring into the business, which ultimately leads into value for our customers. And by driving value to our customers, we drive value for ourselves. And on those lines, we continue to expect to drive value for our customer share, which means, yes, we should be able to drive profitable growth ahead along those lines.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nJohn Olin: Thanks, Scott.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. I'm wondering\u2026\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nJerry Revich: Hi. I'm wondering if you could just comment on the conversations that you've had with your customers since the Chevron case and any impact on how they're thinking about potential changes at the EPA and CARB. Can you just talk about what the flows have been since that ruling, if you don't mind?\nRafael Santana: Yeah. So based on that ruling, I mean we can expect here, I think, that federal agencies will receive less deference to their regulations when, of course, our considerate agencies are acting within the authority here granted by Congress, Jerry. But as courts take a more prominent role here, I think they'll certainly have an impact to regulations pertaining to rail. I think the way I would think about it, there's a -- it could go in different ways, but if you think about like the two-person crew mandate, I mean that's certainly one area here. And the other one is really associated with the CARB emissions through that. So I think those are things that are going to play out over time, but I can't say we have seen necessarily a change in customer behavior associated with those. I think those are fairly fluid and still playing out.\nJerry Revich: Got it. And then, you know, really outstanding margin performance, particularly in Freight. I'm wondering, can you just expand on the mix benefits that you alluded to? Because, to see that margin performance with service as a percent of total declining year-over-year really stood out, so I'm wondering what parts of that business drove favorable mix? And then from an efficiency standpoint, are you folks back at pre-COVID levels of labor hours per unit or however you measure it?\nJohn Olin: With regards to the mix, Jerry, there's really three big drivers. And it's not only the second quarter, it's for the first half. And a lot of the favorability we're going to see in the first half is not going to be there or be a little bit of a headwind in the second half. The first area is in our equipment group, right? While the equipment group is a little bit lower than the average in terms of overall margin, we've had significant favorability. And that -- I'm going to take you back, Jerry, to an order that we had, an international order that wound up in the back half -- I'm sorry, the first half of 2023 that was very low-margin. And so in the first quarter, we're comparing against that and driving significant mix favorability. Again, that won't be there in the second half. The second area is with regards to our mining business. Our mining has been a good strong business for us and expected across the year. However, when we look at the production schedule, we are producing more OE in the first half and more aftermarket in the -- I'm sorry, more aftermarket in the first half and expect to do more OE in the back half. So that's going to turn from a tailwind to a headwind. And then the third area of mix favorability has been in our components group, driven by a couple of things. One is the international growth is greater in the first half. And within this product line, it's a higher margin. And then the second one is the cars that are being built for the railcar build, the orders that we got in the first half for specific cars are higher margin than in the back half. So the same thing there, we've got a benefit and then we're not going to have in the back half.\nJerry Revich: Got it. Thank you, John. And I apologize. The efficiency part of the question, are you folks back at the pre-COVID levels of efficiency at this point?\nJohn Olin: The answer would be overall, yes. And I guess I wouldn't be thinking so much as pre-COVID, but some of the strike ramifications all behind us, all the efficiencies are back where we would expect within our plants. As a matter of fact, John -- Jerry, when we look at the first half of this year, the operation on -- the operations have run extremely well. The operations team has done an admirable job of kind of post-supply disruptions and the strike at Erie of really driving great productivity. And you're seeing that in some of that 3.2 percentage points of lift in the first half due to productivity.\nJerry Revich: Well done. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning. Rafael, John, I guess just a real quick one, clarify that North American order, did you mention that was a Class 1 railroad? Just to clarify that. And then looking at the margin expectation slide, you've got North American locomotive still down, railcar deliveries below historical average, Wabtec's share going up. Thoughts on sustainability of that share gain? I know there was lawsuits a while ago to kind of target that. I guess just how that's proceeded as new orders have come in? And then is there anything post the Chevron doctrine in terms of discussions on shifting from new-builds to mods or any discussions on that at this point yet?\nRafael Santana: Let me start, and I'll pass it on to John here. But the only thing we mentioned about that order, that was a North American order. That's the only data we've provided. John?\nJohn Olin: Yeah. And with regards to the -- I think the question, Ken, was the railcar and market share. So going -- taking you back to the first half of last year, the supply disruptions were still in full swing, and we took an inventory position on that and it paid off very well. We gained a fair amount of market share because of availability. And we've seen a lot of that share -- it's tempered a bit, but we've seen a lot of that share stick. And again, I think it goes to the value of our products and the kind of the full service and the way we look at things in supporting and supplying our customers. So again, we're seeing that benefit this year in terms of holding on to a fair amount of that share.\nRafael Santana: You're other question on the Chevron precedent. I think we're very much having robust conversations with customers about their fleet needs for the future. I can't say we have seen any major shift in the conversations either as a result of CARB regulatory process or the two crew -- two-man crew mandate.\nKen Hoexter: All right. And then just a follow-up on the backlog was up 4% in the 12 months, but down 2% long term. Anything -- is the thought here that we're at past peak in terms of building that backlog, or is that -- you're going to tell me it's kind of lumpy and it comes in different things like the $600 million order? Any thoughts on the scale and size of backlog as we look into next year and beyond?\nRafael Santana: So first, I'll start with the way we run the business is really looking at what I call coverage, whether if it's 12 months out, 18 months out. And our coverage at this point, when I think about the next 12 months is -- it's strong and it's really continued work from the business groups to make sure that we drive in that direction. All in all, I think the pipeline of opportunities is strong. We continue to expand visibility into future years, which once again reinforces, I think, our position to drive profitable growth ahead. Yes, there's going to be variation quarter-to-quarter, as you pointed out. We've seen that in previous quarters before. And it really comes down to the coverage we have.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks, Rafael. Thanks, John.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Please go ahead with your questions.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks, and good morning, everybody. My question is on -- just a minor one on the front half, back half. John, you mentioned a couple of differences in mix between front and back half, which were helpful. Are you doing -- with the level loading, are you doing fewer mods in the back half than the front half? And is there any room for -- I think you mentioned 3Q a little stronger than 4Q. I don't know if that was absolute or year-over-year, but is there any room for fill-in in revenue still in 4Q?\nJohn Olin: So number one, I think the question on mods, I would broaden that question, Rob, to looking at the combined production of loco and mods. So in the first half, that would be up well into the double-digits. And in the back half, it would be flat to down slightly. So again, that's that shift that's driving the revenue and all the absorption and all those types of things. But right now, more in the back half for both mods and locos combined, we\u2019re looking at flat to slightly negative. [indiscernible]\nRob Wertheimer: Well, is that flat to slightly negative one half versus two half or year-over-year? That's what I'm trying to sort of figure out on. I understand the mining thing you said was down, but -- yeah, sorry, go ahead.\nJohn Olin: That's half-to-half, right? We're going to have variations within the half. In the second quarter, we had very strong gain in locos, but modernizations weren't nearly up as much in the second quarter as the first quarter. But I was referring half-to-half. When we look at the back half in terms -- in total, we expect the back half, as we talked about revenue to grow but at a much more moderated rate than the first half, and the same thing with margin percent on a year-over-year basis. And if you look within the quarters within the second half, we would expect the third quarter to be up slightly in terms of growth over the fourth quarter for both revenue and profit growth.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay, perfect. Sorry to be pedantic there. Thank you. And then I guess your Transit guys are getting lonely. You're having great margin progress, a couple of good quarters there as well. Just any commentary on the end markets on, you know, price versus inflation, just margin direction in Transit? And I'll stop there. Thank you.\nRafael Santana: Let me start, and I'll let John complete, but we continue to see the same fundamentals in that business. We expect growth to be on that part of the business, as far as market goes, around 3% to 5%. We expect the teams to continue to apply, I'm going to call strong discipline around order intake, and that should ultimately continue to reflect on improved margins in the backlog, which is what we see today. So good progress, it's never going to be smooth, and you're going to see some variation on the backlog numbers as a result of that.\nJohn Olin: Yeah, commenting on the 12-month backlog. They were down this quarter. They were a little bit tempered in the first quarter. And as you know and we've talked about, it's due on large part of our focus on being more selective on orders that we add to backlog. And Rob, that's in line with our effort to drive improved long-term profitability in the Transit business. We've seen the impact of the selectivity again in the first quarter to some extent, and we would expect to see it over the next few quarters as we build in a higher level of profitability in our backlog over time. But overall, the underlying strength and business of the Transit business is there, but we are going to see some shifts in timing of backlogs as we build in more profitability.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steve Barger from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteve Barger: Thanks. Good morning.\nRafael Santana: Good morning.\nSteve Barger: Going back to digital, can you talk about how you define addressable market size in North America versus international and what the penetration rate is for each? I'm just trying to gauge the relative forward opportunities for those products.\nRafael Santana: We are, of course, much more highly penetrated in North America. If you think about the bulk of our products with -- if you think -- while if you think about internationally, we still have significant opportunities here. And I think some of that is really connected to some of the products. I mean, you think about Trip Optimizer, we still have ways to go into markets like Kazakhstan, for instance. If you think about PTC 2.0, I think you continue to have demand out there and you're going to see us grow into some of these markets. What I think is interesting also is some of the products like Zero-to-Zero, which we continue to work through regulation in North America, we're moving forward with those into our international markets. So to some extent, you could start seeing some degrees of automation potentially moving faster in the international markets given some of the dynamics in North America. So more and more, I think positive growth coming from international, still some of the dynamics I described earlier in North America.\nSteve Barger: So it's listed, for rounding, $800 million business. Is that a multibillion dollar opportunity internationally or I guess, globally, or how do you think about market size?\nRafael Santana: It is a multibillion dollar opportunity, so size is significant here. I think one of the things that I look at internationally is more the timing to get to some of these orders. You're fundamentally describing, in some cases, orders that might take a little bit more time to get those. And those are some really the work started by the group here a couple of years back, but glad to see the progress. I think you've heard from us on some of the orders we've gotten from PTC. You're going to see more of those orders outside of North America as we continue to progress.\nSteve Barger: Got it. And John, for you. In the last few years, Transit margins in the fourth quarter have seen a pretty sizable step-up versus the prior three quarters. Do you expect that same dynamic this year?\nJohn Olin: No, Steve, we don't provide individual quarters in margins. I would just say that overall, a lot of businesses over time develop traits and that ends up being in the margin profiles. And I've always felt that it's more important to look year-over-year than sequentially. But we're not going to provide some specific thoughts on the fourth quarter.\nRafael Santana: Just a clarification there, Steve, to see profitable growth ahead. We see that in the fundamentals of the business. And the team has really taken several steps in terms of heading to mid-teen margins and we expect that to continue.\nSteve Barger: Got it. And just, John, if I look at the last three years, you know, staying away from this year, what causes that -- has caused that margin step-up? Is that budget flush at customers or what -- why did that happen in the past?\nJohn Olin: In some cases, there's more aftermarket sales in the fourth quarter because customers budgets, a lot of government spending within the Transit business. SG&A typically has patterns of spending in the fourth quarter. But probably the biggest would be is the mix, off the top of my head, for Transit.\nSteve Barger: Okay, thanks.\nRafael Santana: Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Kyra Yates for any closing remarks.\nKyra Yates: Thank you, Jamie. And thank you, everyone, for your participation today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Goodbye.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "John Olin",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael. And hello, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I will review our second quarter results in more detail. Our second quarter results played out largely as we expected. We expected both revenue and earnings growth to be overshared versus our full-year growth expectations, but slightly tempered from our first quarter results. The primary driver of our first half results growing faster than our expected second half results is due to a shift in the combined production of our new locomotives and mods to the first half of this year from the second half, in an effort to more evenly load our manufacturing production across the four quarters. It is also important to note that we expect our second half revenue and margin to grow, but at a more tempered pace than we experienced in the first half. Within the second half, we do expect to grow revenue and earnings year-over-year in each quarter. However, we expect the third quarter's growth to be greater than the fourth quarter's growth. Sales for the second quarter were $2.64 billion, which reflects a 9.8% increase versus the prior year. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by the Freight segment, especially by equipment and components. For the quarter, GAAP operating income was $430 million, driven by higher sales, improved gross margin and an unrelenting focus on continuous improvement in productivity. Adjusted operating margin in Q2 was 19.3%, up 2.9 percentage points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by improved gross margin of 2.9 percentage points. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.64, which was up 54.7% versus the second quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had net pre-tax charges of $6 million for restructuring, which were primarily related to our Integration 2.0 and our portfolio optimization initiative to further integrate and streamline Wabtec's operations. As you may recall, Integration 2.0 is expected to drive $75 million to $90 million of run-rate savings by 2025. And our portfolio optimization initiative will eliminate roughly $110 million of low-margin non-strategic revenue while reducing manufacturing complexity. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.96, up 39.0% versus prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another strong quarter, demonstrating the underlying strength of the business. Turning to Slide 8, let's review our product lines in more detail. Second quarter consolidated sales were up 9.8% as we expected. Our quarter results were driven by solid growth across all our business groups and further aided by a year-over-year increase in the combined new loco and mods as we have shifted our production and deliveries more to the first half versus the second half in order to more appropriately balance or level load our factories, thereby allowing us to be more consistent with our labor staffing, improve our quality and to gain manufacturing efficiencies. Equipment sales were up 36.4% from last year's second quarter, driven by robust deliveries of new locomotives and increased sales of mining equipment. Component sales were up 17.5% versus last year, largely driven by increased sales of industrial products, higher international sales and the acquisition of L&M in late Q2 of 2023, partially offset by lower North American railcar build. Digital Intelligence sales were up 2.1% from last year, where we continue to experience growth in international sales aided by higher PTC revenues, partially offset by lower revenues in our North American market. Our Services sales grew 2.3%. Sales growth was driven primarily by higher year-over-year overhauls and parts sales. Our customers continue to recognize the superior performance, reliability and availability of our fleet. In our Transit segment, sales were up 2.0%. During the quarter, we saw our aftermarket revenue grow 10%. On a constant-currency basis, sales grew 3.4%. The momentum in the Transit segment remains positive as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonization accelerate the need for investments in sustainable infrastructure. Moving to Slide 9. GAAP gross margin was 33.0%, which was up 2.9 percentage points from last year. Adjusted gross margin was also up 2.9 percentage points during the quarter. In addition to the higher sales, gross margin benefited from favorable mix between segments. Mix within the Freight segment was also favorable despite higher combined new locomotives and modernizations in the quarter. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind to revenue as well as gross profit and operating margin in the quarter. During the quarter, we also benefited from favorable fixed-cost absorption, increased productivity and benefits from Integration 2.0, as well as lapping last year's start of the Erie Strike in late Q2 of 2023. Our team continues to execute well by driving operational productivity and lean benefits. Now turning to Slide 10. For the second quarter, GAAP operating margin was 16.3%, which was up 3.4 percentage points versus last year. Adjusted operating margin improved 2.9 percentage points to 19.3%. GAAP and adjusted SG&A expenses were up versus prior year, but largely flat as a percentage of revenues. Engineering expense was $57 million, moderately higher than Q2 last year. We continue to invest engineering resources in current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization and safety. Now, let's take a look at segment results on Slide 11, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales were up 13.1% during the quarter. GAAP segment operating income was $391 million for an operating margin of 20.4%, up 4.5 percentage points versus last year. GAAP operating income included $5 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to Integration 2.0 and portfolio optimization. Adjusted operating income for the Freight segment was $462 million, up 34.3% versus prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the Freight segment was 24.1%, up 3.8 percentage points from the prior year. The increase was driven by improved gross margin behind strong operational execution, favorable mix, Integration 2.0 savings, and as we lap last year's manufacturing inefficiencies caused by the strike in Erie. At the same time, SG&A and engineering expenses were lower as a percentage of revenue. Finally, segment 12-month backlog was $5.50 billion, up 4.0% from the same period a year ago. The multiyear backlog was $17.93 billion, down 2.0% from the prior year. Turning to Slide 12, Transit segment sales were 2.0% at $724 million. When adjusting for foreign currency, Transit sales were up 3.4%. GAAP operating income was $82 million. Restructuring costs related to Integration 2.0 were $5 million in Q2. Adjusted segment operating income was $91 million. Adjusted operating income as a percent of revenue was 12.7%, up 1.6 percentage points from last year, driven by Integration 2.0 savings and favorable mix. Finally, Transit segment 12-month backlog for the quarter was $1.83 billion, down 5.0% versus a year ago. The decrease on a year-over-year basis was expected due to our focus on being more selective on the orders that we add to backlog, thereby expecting to drive improved long-term profitability. Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 13. Second quarter cash flow was another highlight for the quarter, with operating cash coming in at $235 million. During the quarter, cash flow benefited from higher earnings and improved working capital, partially offset by a reduction of $230 million of securitization borrowings. We continue to expect greater than 90% cash conversion for the full year. Our balance sheet and financial position continue to be very strong as evidenced by, first, our liquidity position, which ended the quarter at $2.09 billion. And our net-debt leverage ratio was 1.6 times at the end of the second quarter, which was lower versus the same quarter a year ago at 2.4 times debt leverage. We continue to allocate capital in a disciplined and balanced way to maximize returns for our shareholders. During the quarter, we purchased $200 million of our shares and paid $35 million in dividends. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael to talk about our 2024 financial guidance. Thanks, Daniel. And certainly, the last couple of quarters, we've talked about kind of our -- how our halves are going to unfold, and they're certainly unfolding the way we expected. And Daniel, that is with the first half having significantly higher year-over-year growth as well, I'm sorry, for both revenue and margin growth. Revenue was up 11.7% and margin up 2. -- or 3.2 percentage points. With that, we've also talked about the back half being up and growing in both those measures, but at a more significantly level -- tempered level. And the reason for that, Daniel, is what is driving some of the first half growth is not going to be there in the second half. So let's talk about a couple of those things. One is mix, and we talked about this on the last call. Our first half mix is a good tailwind for us and we expect that to turn into a slight headwind in the second half. So that's one of the reasons. The other is really around absorption, right, fixed-cost absorption. With the growth that we have in the first half, again, up being -- being up almost 12%, we are getting much more absorption on a year-over-year basis in the first half versus the second half. So again, that won't be there. Now there's some common things in there, right? Integration 2.0 is benefiting both halves at a similar rate. And we've got some one-time benefit both in the first half and the second half. But the answer is, is really on mix and absorption in the second half. Well, Angel, thanks for pointing out the very strong first half, much appreciated. Yeah, the first half was up $469 million on a year-over-year basis. And what we're seeing there and why we're seeing that is if you recall a year ago, our working capital was still rising as most industrial companies were because of the supply disruptions. And we had a little bit of added in there with regards to the inventory we were building on with regard to a potential strike at the time. So in the back half of last year, we brought that inventory down quite a bit. The team did a fantastic job on managing it back down after the supply disruptions. And so what we're seeing in the first half is really lapping that higher working capital, so we're seeing significant strength there. Overall, we are expecting the guidance that we've had of over 90% cash conversion and we're looking to continue to deploy that, Angel, as we've talked about in the past. We're going to favor M&A. And with the excess cash, we'll buy back shares. Yes, Scott, it's the same -- the same thing we talked about. It's mix, right? Mix is lifting it in the first half and is going to pull it down a little bit in the second half. And also the first half on that 19.3% is aided by a fair amount of absorption that we don't expect in the back half. Well, I -- it's too early to get into what 2025 looks like. We'll certainly be looking at it from where we're launching in terms of the margin that we have at the end of the year. And, we have 27,000 people waking up every morning to improve upon that. And so, you know, we'll be in a position in a couple of quarters to provide guidance on that. But we -- you know, are -- believe we are in line with our long-term guidance as we move out of this year and I feel good about what's in front of us. Thanks, Scott. With regards to the mix, Jerry, there's really three big drivers. And it's not only the second quarter, it's for the first half. And a lot of the favorability we're going to see in the first half is not going to be there or be a little bit of a headwind in the second half. The first area is in our equipment group, right? While the equipment group is a little bit lower than the average in terms of overall margin, we've had significant favorability. And that -- I'm going to take you back, Jerry, to an order that we had, an international order that wound up in the back half -- I'm sorry, the first half of 2023 that was very low-margin. And so in the first quarter, we're comparing against that and driving significant mix favorability. Again, that won't be there in the second half. The second area is with regards to our mining business. Our mining has been a good strong business for us and expected across the year. However, when we look at the production schedule, we are producing more OE in the first half and more aftermarket in the -- I'm sorry, more aftermarket in the first half and expect to do more OE in the back half. So that's going to turn from a tailwind to a headwind. And then the third area of mix favorability has been in our components group, driven by a couple of things. One is the international growth is greater in the first half. And within this product line, it's a higher margin. And then the second one is the cars that are being built for the railcar build, the orders that we got in the first half for specific cars are higher margin than in the back half. So the same thing there, we've got a benefit and then we're not going to have in the back half. The answer would be overall, yes. And I guess I wouldn't be thinking so much as pre-COVID, but some of the strike ramifications all behind us, all the efficiencies are back where we would expect within our plants. As a matter of fact, John -- Jerry, when we look at the first half of this year, the operation on -- the operations have run extremely well. The operations team has done an admirable job of kind of post-supply disruptions and the strike at Erie of really driving great productivity. And you're seeing that in some of that 3.2 percentage points of lift in the first half due to productivity. Yeah. And with regards to the -- I think the question, Ken, was the railcar and market share. So going -- taking you back to the first half of last year, the supply disruptions were still in full swing, and we took an inventory position on that and it paid off very well. We gained a fair amount of market share because of availability. And we've seen a lot of that share -- it's tempered a bit, but we've seen a lot of that share stick. And again, I think it goes to the value of our products and the kind of the full service and the way we look at things in supporting and supplying our customers. So again, we're seeing that benefit this year in terms of holding on to a fair amount of that share. So number one, I think the question on mods, I would broaden that question, Rob, to looking at the combined production of loco and mods. So in the first half, that would be up well into the double-digits. And in the back half, it would be flat to down slightly. So again, that's that shift that's driving the revenue and all the absorption and all those types of things. But right now, more in the back half for both mods and locos combined, we're looking at flat to slightly negative. [indiscernible] That's half-to-half, right? We're going to have variations within the half. In the second quarter, we had very strong gain in locos, but modernizations weren't nearly up as much in the second quarter as the first quarter. But I was referring half-to-half. When we look at the back half in terms -- in total, we expect the back half, as we talked about revenue to grow but at a much more moderated rate than the first half, and the same thing with margin percent on a year-over-year basis. And if you look within the quarters within the second half, we would expect the third quarter to be up slightly in terms of growth over the fourth quarter for both revenue and profit growth. Yeah, commenting on the 12-month backlog. They were down this quarter. They were a little bit tempered in the first quarter. And as you know and we've talked about, it's due on large part of our focus on being more selective on orders that we add to backlog. And Rob, that's in line with our effort to drive improved long-term profitability in the Transit business. We've seen the impact of the selectivity again in the first quarter to some extent, and we would expect to see it over the next few quarters as we build in a higher level of profitability in our backlog over time. But overall, the underlying strength and business of the Transit business is there, but we are going to see some shifts in timing of backlogs as we build in more profitability. No, Steve, we don't provide individual quarters in margins. I would just say that overall, a lot of businesses over time develop traits and that ends up being in the margin profiles. And I've always felt that it's more important to look year-over-year than sequentially. But we're not going to provide some specific thoughts on the fourth quarter. In some cases, there's more aftermarket sales in the fourth quarter because customers budgets, a lot of government spending within the Transit business. SG&A typically has patterns of spending in the fourth quarter. But probably the biggest would be is the mix, off the top of my head, for Transit."

            "content": "Thanks, Kyra. And good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4. I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter and progress against our long-term value-creation framework. And then, John will cover the financials. We delivered another strong quarter, evidenced by robust sales and earnings per share growth. Sales were $2.6 billion, which was up nearly 10% versus prior year. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance from the Freight segment. And adjusted EPS was up 39% from the year-ago quarter, driven by increased sales and margin expansion. Total cash flow from operations for the quarter was $235 million. The 12-month backlog was $7.3 billion, and the multi-year backlog was $22 billion. Overall, the Wabtec team delivered a strong second quarter. With the first half behind us, we are focused on executing against our second half deliverables. Looking forward, I'm encouraged by the underlying strength and momentum across the business. Shifting our focus to Slide 5, let's talk about 2024 and market expectations in more details. While key metrics across our Freight business remain mixed, we are encouraged by the strength of our business, the strength of our international markets and our robust pipeline of opportunities across geographies. North American car loads were up 2.1% in the quarter. Despite this car load growth, the industry's active locomotive fleet was down when compared to last year's second quarter, while Wabtec's active fleet was higher. Looking at the North American railcar builds. Last quarter we discussed the industry outlook for 2024 to be about 36,000 cars to be delivered, which has now been raised by industry sources back to the original forecast of 38,000 cars. This is still down, however, from the 45,000 in the previous year. Internationally, we continue to see that significant investments to expand and upgrade infrastructure are supporting a robust international orders pipeline. In mining, commodity prices and an aging fleet are continuing to support activity to refresh and upgrade the truck fleet. Finally, moving to the Transit sector, the megatrends of urbanization and decarbonization remain in place, driving the need for clean, safe and efficient transportation solutions around the globe. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few business highlights. In North America, we secured a multiyear order for greater than $600 million. This is one of our largest orders for new Tier 4 locomotives ever. It demonstrates customer demand for a best-in-class solution to improve productivity, reduce fuel usage, improve reliability and to significantly reduce emissions. I would also like to share with you a key international services order, a 10-year agreement in Brazil for which Wabtec will manage the servicing of Vale's locomotives fleet to increase availability, reliability and safety. In Pakistan, we recently won a strategic order for 15 modernizations for Pakistan Railway. This is a great example of the opportunities that we have to modernize locomotives in our international markets. And finally, our Transit segment announced that our Green Friction braking solution is ready to begin commercial fleet operations in the Greater Paris metropolitan area. This innovative solution will improve air quality in the transit's authority tunnels and underground network by reducing particle emissions from braking by up to 90%. All of this demonstrates the underlying strength across our business, the team's relentless focus on execution and the strong pipeline of opportunities we continue to deliver on. Wabtec is well-positioned to continue to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers' needs. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter, segment results and our overall financial performance. Thanks, John. Now let's turn to Slide 14 to discuss our 2024 full year guidance. As you heard today, our team delivered a very strong second quarter, which was slightly ahead of our expectations. Consequently, we are increasing our previous adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.20 to $7.50 at the midpoint, up 24.2%. Our revenue and cash flow conversion guidance remain unchanged. Looking ahead, I'm confident that Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable growth into 2024 and beyond. Now let's wrap up on Slide 15. As you heard today, our team continues to deliver value for our stakeholders, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world-class team, innovative technologies and our continued focus on our customers. Overall, we believe we have an opportunity to continue building significant long-term momentum with growth in equipment, services, components, digital solutions and transit systems. With solid underlying demand for our products and technologies and intense focus on continuous improvement in cost management, consistent with our previous guidance, we continue to expect to drive mid-single-digit organic growth while delivering double-digit earnings per share growth through our planning horizon, thereby maximizing our shareholder returns. With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning, and I'll now turn the call over to Kyra to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kyra? Good morning. No, that was not included in the previous backlog, so it's in the second Q backlog. The second piece is this is an order that will largely be executed between '25 and '26. And the other piece is I think it just speaks to the strength of our pipeline of opportunities. We continue to see good momentum there internationally and that expands really across different geographies. We continue to see it mixed in North America, but with opportunities here. We have a number of sizable opportunities that are being worked in the current pipeline. The current total backlog is healthy and overall it's a positive. We're progressing. We're continuing to grow and our pipeline supports it. Thank you, Daniel. Angel, we are tracking right on our revenue plan. We adjusted that in the first quarter, brought it up a bit largely for some of the things that we're seeing in the parking arena. That's right on track. Everything is tracking well. And I would kind of look at what we did in terms of EPS as fine-tuning the quarter. We brought it up $0.15 at the midpoint. Again, revenue is on track, but we did see a little bit of favorability in mix in the first half and the tax rate came in a little bit favorable. And I would say, Angel, that about, half that $0.15 is in the actuals in the second quarter and a little bit of favorability that we're expecting in the back half, and that is due to the same two reasons. Mix is going to be a little bit more favorable than we expected. However, still a headwind to the half. And then the tax rate is favorable. And we've also re-guided on the tax rate, bringing it down from 25 -- 25% to 24.5%. But, we're seven months into this thing and we feel very good about our overall guidance and how the back half is going to unfold and really in line with what we've talked about the last couple of quarters. Let me take on that. I mean, we're continuing to be really looking at M&A. The pipeline is as robust as it's ever been. We're going to be opportunistic here. What's going to drive decision-making is really making sure that we drive higher ROIC for the business and faster profitable growth. But we're going to be opportunistic here. And as we continue to see opportunities to return value to shareholders through share buybacks, we'll do so. And we feel we're very well-positioned here to drive long-term profitable growth. Yes. So, we see a strong pipeline of opportunity internationally. When we talked about Pakistan, I think one of the things that we've talked about is the opportunity to continue to modernize the fleets that are out there. We often emphasize the age of the fleet, and we have continued to invest on significant innovation that allows customers here to significantly reduce fuel by upgrading those engines. They can improve both reliability and availability of those units through those. When you think about modernizations, we largely -- we have a kit that's shipped and we ultimately work with the customers on doing some of that internationally. But as you know, we have some of our locations around the world that we're very much equipped to do so, whether if it's in Brazil, whether if it's in Australia, whether if it's in Kazakhstan. And we'll leverage those as we work through. But I think what's exciting about the international opportunities, they're not concentrated in one single location. We're seeing our business be very competitive. If customers are looking for reliable, efficient power, if they're looking for value, we are seeing the business winning. I think we highlighted in the first half of this year, a significant order for us in West Africa. That's the kind of orders that's going to be executed in '26 and '27. So it's good to see the strength of international, especially I'm going to call -- bringing broader and broader visibility into conversion going out into '26 and into '27. So overall, I think good dynamics internationally, and we've seen that business grow between 4% and 5% -- our fleets grow 4% to 5% over the last five years and we continue to see good dynamics there. So I think we continue to see it mixed in North America. It's very customer-specific. So it really varies different levels of, I'm going to call fleet redundancy some customers might have or not. And I think you see that reflected on the significant order here we got in the second quarter. So it's customer specifics. I don't think -- when I think about what will make our customers invest, it's ultimately the value, the returns they obtain on really modernizing their fleets. What I'm happy to see is the innovation we're driving the business. A lot of the growth you saw here over the last few years, which was tied to the modernizations, largely connected to in a lot of ways what I'll call the 7FDL fleet, which is an older engine we have. We're doing the same thing now for the EVO engine. So in fact, we're going at the end of this year into really commercializing the EVO product, which will drive another five-plus-percent fuel efficiency and improvements for that fleet, and we're doing the same thing on Tier 4. So it's that continued innovation that's going to make customers come, modernize their fleets before they get to 25, 30 years of age. And that will drive both an element of a reduction in cost, which will improve OR on how they operate the fleets, but will also improve services with availability and reliability of those fleets. So all in all, I think we see strong coverage here as we progress forward for the business with the backlog we have. Thank you. Good morning. I think it's very much tied to, again, value. It's how customers see an opportunity here to improve both cost of operations, how they see the improved reliability and availability. So think about just the speed in their network, just think about the services levels that they're able to sustain. And with this specific fleet of Tier 4s, also the capability of taking what I'll call alternative fuels. That's a fleet that we have very much talked about the opportunity to take on not just biofuels, but also that's fleet ready to take on what I'll call a mix that could come with things like hydrogen and so forth. So those are some of the elements. In addition to that, I got to highlight to you the fact that -- I mean, you've got very much obsolescence taking on on older fleets, especially if you think from an electronics perspective and the challenge on maintaining some of those fleets over time. So I think very much aligned with the dynamics of customers investing to lower their cost, to improve serviceability. And in some cases, you'll also see customers with an opportunity to grow here. So those, I think, are some of the elements that will continue to drive demand from our customers in North America and everywhere else. Yeah. I think some of what you saw in the quarter, which is really, I think, ultimately connected to higher demand for what I'll call onboard locomotive products, we also saw a good demand on the digital mining technologies. I think ultimately those were and continue to be offset by lower sales in the North American market. I think in the second quarter, you saw that tick to a positive, so the business grew 2.1%. But moving forward, I think we're continuing to see here through the second half a pipeline, higher demand from international. That calls for things like PTC, the same onboard products that I discussed in mining technologies as well, but it continues a softer demand in the US driven by fundamentally what I'll call discretionary OpEx in that regard. With that, our businesses are -- or our teams are very much focused on making sure that we continue to drive order convertibility with recurring revenues. And I feel we continue to progress here to ultimately drive a growth here in '24 for this business. Scott, the only thing I'd add there is I think we have good momentum coming from lean initiatives with productivity, cost actions driven by Integration 2.0. I think you're going to see more on portfolio optimization. And while I think you're going to continue to see variation, whether if it's quarter-to-quarter, half-to-half, we are kind of continue to expand margins ahead. Scott, we look at price very much connected to the level of differentiation and innovation that we bring into the business, which ultimately leads into value for our customers. And by driving value to our customers, we drive value for ourselves. And on those lines, we continue to expect to drive value for our customer share, which means, yes, we should be able to drive profitable growth ahead along those lines. Thank you. Good morning. Yeah. So based on that ruling, I mean we can expect here, I think, that federal agencies will receive less deference to their regulations when, of course, our considerate agencies are acting within the authority here granted by Congress, Jerry. But as courts take a more prominent role here, I think they'll certainly have an impact to regulations pertaining to rail. I think the way I would think about it, there's a -- it could go in different ways, but if you think about like the two-person crew mandate, I mean that's certainly one area here. And the other one is really associated with the CARB emissions through that. So I think those are things that are going to play out over time, but I can't say we have seen necessarily a change in customer behavior associated with those. I think those are fairly fluid and still playing out. Thank you. Let me start, and I'll pass it on to John here. But the only thing we mentioned about that order, that was a North American order. That's the only data we've provided. John? You're other question on the Chevron precedent. I think we're very much having robust conversations with customers about their fleet needs for the future. I can't say we have seen any major shift in the conversations either as a result of CARB regulatory process or the two crew -- two-man crew mandate. So first, I'll start with the way we run the business is really looking at what I call coverage, whether if it's 12 months out, 18 months out. And our coverage at this point, when I think about the next 12 months is -- it's strong and it's really continued work from the business groups to make sure that we drive in that direction. All in all, I think the pipeline of opportunities is strong. We continue to expand visibility into future years, which once again reinforces, I think, our position to drive profitable growth ahead. Yes, there's going to be variation quarter-to-quarter, as you pointed out. We've seen that in previous quarters before. And it really comes down to the coverage we have. Let me start, and I'll let John complete, but we continue to see the same fundamentals in that business. We expect growth to be on that part of the business, as far as market goes, around 3% to 5%. We expect the teams to continue to apply, I'm going to call strong discipline around order intake, and that should ultimately continue to reflect on improved margins in the backlog, which is what we see today. So good progress, it's never going to be smooth, and you're going to see some variation on the backlog numbers as a result of that. Good morning. We are, of course, much more highly penetrated in North America. If you think about the bulk of our products with -- if you think -- while if you think about internationally, we still have significant opportunities here. And I think some of that is really connected to some of the products. I mean, you think about Trip Optimizer, we still have ways to go into markets like Kazakhstan, for instance. If you think about PTC 2.0, I think you continue to have demand out there and you're going to see us grow into some of these markets. What I think is interesting also is some of the products like Zero-to-Zero, which we continue to work through regulation in North America, we're moving forward with those into our international markets. So to some extent, you could start seeing some degrees of automation potentially moving faster in the international markets given some of the dynamics in North America. So more and more, I think positive growth coming from international, still some of the dynamics I described earlier in North America. It is a multibillion dollar opportunity, so size is significant here. I think one of the things that I look at internationally is more the timing to get to some of these orders. You're fundamentally describing, in some cases, orders that might take a little bit more time to get those. And those are some really the work started by the group here a couple of years back, but glad to see the progress. I think you've heard from us on some of the orders we've gotten from PTC. You're going to see more of those orders outside of North America as we continue to progress. Just a clarification there, Steve, to see profitable growth ahead. We see that in the fundamentals of the business. And the team has really taken several steps in terms of heading to mid-teen margins and we expect that to continue. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kyra Yates, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nKyra Yates: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Wabtec's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, John Olin; and Senior Vice President of Finance, John Mastalerz. Today's slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures were posted to our website earlier today and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Some statements we are making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking statements please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics. \n I will now turn the call over to Rafael. \nRafael Santana: Thanks, Kyra and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4. I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter and progress against our long-term value creation framework and then John will cover the financials. Last quarter, when we met, we talked about the strong momentum that we had when we exit 2023. Well, that momentum continues. Sales were $2.5 billion, which was up 13.8% versus prior year. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance, largely from the Freight segment. And adjusted EPS was up 47.7% from the year ago quarter, driven by increased sales and margin expansion.  \n Total cash flow from operations for the quarter was $334 million. The 12-month backlog was $7.7 billion, up 11%, signifying continued momentum and visibility across the business. In total, multiyear backlog was $22 billion. Overall, we had a strong start to the year. The underlying strength and momentum across the business is evident. We remain confident in our ability to execute, to deliver for our customers and to continue to make progress against our long-term growth strategies.  \n Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about 2024 and market expectations in more details. While key metrics across our freight business remain mixed, we are encouraged by the strength of our business, the strength of our international markets and our robust pipeline of opportunities across geographies. North America carloads were up 1.8% in the quarter, despite this carload growth the industry's active locomotive fleet was down when compared to last year's first quarter, while Wabtec's active fleet was higher. As we look forward, we continue to see significant opportunities across the globe in demand for new locomotives, modernizations and digital technologies, as our customers invest in solutions that continue to drive reliability, productivity, safety and fuel efficiency.  \n Looking at the North American railcar builds. Last quarter, we discussed the industry outlook for 2024, to be about 38,000 cars to be delivered, which has now been lowered by the industry sources to reflect an expected 36,000 cars. Internationally, activity is strong across most of our core markets, significant investments to expand and upgrade infrastructure are supporting a robust international orders pipeline. In mining, commodity prices and an aging fleet are supporting activity to refresh and upgrade the truck fleet. Finally, moving to the Transit sector. The megatrends of urbanization and decarbonization remain in place, driving the need for clean, safe and efficient transportation solutions around the globe.  \n Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few business highlights. Late in Q1, we signed a $270 million strategic order for new locomotives with a large mining customer in Africa. This, coupled with a recent service order in the region for $64 million highlights the significant opportunity that we believe exists in Africa. Within mining, we're seeing continued strength in the business, in particular, aftermarket and the team has signed orders totaling over $250 million in the quarter.  \n In Indonesia, we won a long-term parts agreement with PT KAI. And finally, our Maintenance of Way team launched its Shuttlewagon Commander NXT, the next generation of railcar movers. The new model was specifically designed for the needs of the customers, to optimize tractive effort, reduce wheel slipping and extend tire life. All of this demonstrates the continued momentum across the business, the team's relentless focus on execution, the strong pipeline of opportunities we continue to deliver on. Wabtec is well positioned to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers' most pressing needs.  \n Moving to Slide 7. Before turning it over to John, I want to briefly discuss our progress that we're making against one of our company's key strategies, which is to lead the decarbonization of rail. Our highly capable team, our installed base of locomotives and our advanced locomotive technologies puts Wabtec in a unique position to lead the industry on fuel efficiency and to reduce carbon emissions. With this in mind, we're driving progress on 2 fronts. First, is to enable our customers to transition to a near zero emissions using their current installed base of locomotives. Our focus here leverages our customers' existing fleets and wayside infrastructure.  \n Our customers can improve fuel efficiency and carbon emission by up to 18% through replacing the older fleets with our Tier 4 and modernized locomotives along with realizing improved durability, haulage ability, reliability and fuel efficiency. We're also enabling our existing locomotive portfolio to be capable of reductions of up to 60% in carbon through the use of bio and renewable fuels. And when further mixed with hydrogen in the locomotive's internal combustion engine, up to 80% total carbon reduction.  \n In addition, we believe we have a competitive advantage given the fact that our locomotives are more fuel efficient and our 4-stroke engine architecture facilitates the use of hydrogen in our internal combustion engines. And the best part of this approach is that it provides significant optionality for our customers. And this approach is completely reversible back to diesel if supplies of alternative fuels are not available or not economical. On our second path to decarbonization, we're developing zero emissions technology and equipment. As you are aware, we recently introduced the world's first heavy haul battery-electric locomotive to a mining customer in Australia.  \n Given the customers' application, they plan to operate this locomotive relying on regenerative braking to charge the batteries. And later this month, we will ship our first battery hybrid locomotive. Finally, we are investing and partnering with government agencies to develop heavy haul locomotives powered by hydrogen fuel cells. We believe that the commercialization of hydrogen fuel cells for heavy haul locomotives is farther down the road. Consequently, we are pacing our investments with our customers' readiness to adopt the technology. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter segment results and our overall financial performance. John? \nJohn Olin: Thanks, Rafael and hello, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I will review our first quarter results in more detail. In the first quarter, we continued to see the underlying momentum that we experienced as we exited last year. As expected, both revenue growth and operating margin growth were overshared in Q1 versus our expectations for full year growth. As we discussed in the last quarter call, we expected both revenue and margin growth to be higher in the first half versus the second half. While we continue to expect growth in the second half, we expect it to be at a much more tempered pace than the first half. Sales for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, which reflects a 13.8% increase versus the prior year. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by the Freight segment, especially in our equipment and services groups.  \n For the quarter, GAAP operating income was $412 million, driven by higher sales, improved gross margin and focused cost management. Adjusted operating margin in Q1 was 19.8%, up 3.4 percentage points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by improved gross margin of 2.4 percentage points and driven by operating expenses, which grew at a slower rate than revenue, increasing our Q1 margin by an additional 1.0 percentage points. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.53, which was up 64.5% versus the first quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pretax charges of $10 million for restructuring, which were primarily related to our Integration 2.0 and our portfolio optimization initiative to further integrate and streamline Wabtec's operations. As you may recall, Integration 2.0 is expected to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025 and our portfolio optimization initiative will eliminate roughly $110 million of low-margin, nonstrategic revenue while reducing manufacturing complexity.  \n In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.89, up 47.7% versus prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another solid quarter, demonstrating the underlying strength of the business.  Turning to Slide 9. Let's review our product lines in more detail. First quarter consolidated sales were up 13.8%. Equipment sales were up 30.2% from last year's first quarter driven by robust sales of mining equipment and higher deliveries of new locomotives. Component sales were up 13.6% versus last year, driven by increased sales of industrial products, higher international sales and the acquisition of L&M in late Q2 of 2023, partially offset by lower North American railcar build. Digital Intelligence sales were down 5.9% from last year, where we continue to experience lower revenues in our North American market but we do see growth in our next-generation onboard locomotive products and digital mining.  \n Our services sales grew 17.3%. Services growth was driven by significantly higher year-over-year deliveries of mods, increased overhauls and parts sales. Our customers continue to recognize the superior performance, reliability and availability of our fleet. Across our Transit segment, sales increased 5.5%, behind growth in our products and services businesses. The momentum in the Transit segment remains positive as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonization accelerate the need for investments in sustainable infrastructure.  \n Now moving to Slide 10. Both GAAP and adjusted gross margin were up 2.4 percentage points during the quarter. In addition to higher sales, gross margin benefited from improved pricing and favorable mix between segments. Mix within the Freight segment was also favorable despite significantly higher new loco and mod deliveries in the quarter. During the quarter, we also benefited from favorable fixed cost absorption and benefits from Integration 2.0 as well as comparing against higher next-generation digital development costs in the first quarter of 2023. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of continued cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lean initiatives.  \n Turning to Slide 11. For the first quarter, GAAP operating margin was 16.5%, which was up 3.9 percentage points versus last year. Adjusted operating margin improved 3.4 percentage points to 19.8%. GAAP and adjusted SG&A expenses were down as a percentage of revenues as we leveraged higher sales with a strong focus on managing costs. Engineering expense was $48 million, modestly lower than Q1 last year. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization and safety.  \n Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 12, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales were up 17.2% during the quarter. GAAP segment operating income was $368 million for an operating margin of 20.2%, up 5.7 percentage points versus last year. GAAP operating income includes $3 million of restructuring costs primarily related to Integration 2.0 and portfolio optimization costs. Adjusted operating income for the Freight segment was $439 million, up 48.3% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the Freight segment was 24.1%, up 5.1 percentage points from prior year. \n The increase was driven by improved gross margin behind strong operational execution, favorable mix, improved pricing, Integration 2.0 savings and as we lap last year's investment in our next-generation digital development costs. At the same time, SG&A and engineering expenses were lower as a percentage of revenue. Finally, segment 12-month backlog was $5.67 billion, up 14.5% from the same period a year ago. The multiyear backlog was $17.9 billion, down 2.3% from the prior year. Both our 12-month and multiyear backlogs demonstrate good visibility in '24 and beyond.  \n Turning to Slide 13. Transit segment sales were up 5.5% to $673 million. When adjusting for foreign currency, Transit sales were up 4.9%. GAAP operating income was $74 million, restructuring costs related to Integration 2.0 were $7 million in Q1. Adjusted segment operating income was $86 million. Adjusted operating margin as a percent of revenue was 12.7%, down 0.2 percentage points from last year, driven by unfavorable mix and higher input costs, partially offset by Integration 2.0 savings. Finally, Transit segment 12-month backlog for the quarter was $2.04 billion, up 3.3% versus a year ago. The multiyear backlog was also up 4.2% to $4.19 billion.  \n Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 14. First quarter cash flow was $334 million. During the quarter, cash flow benefited from higher earnings, improved working capital and increased securitization funding. We continue to expect greater than 90% cash conversion for the full year. Our balance sheet and financial position continue to be strong. We ended the quarter with liquidity of $2.13 billion. And our net debt leverage ratio was 1.7x at the end of the first quarter, which was favorable versus the same quarter a year ago at 2.3x debt leverage. We continue to allocate capital in a disciplined and balanced way to maximize returns for our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $175 million of our shares and paid $36 million in dividends, which was recently increased by our Board of Directors, up 17.6% per share versus prior year. \n With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael to talk about our 2024 financial guidance. \nRafael Santana: Thanks, John. Now let's turn to Slide 15 to discuss our 2024 updated full year guidance. As you've heard today, our team delivered a very strong start to the year. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and solutions continues across our business. Our orders pipeline and 12-month backlog continue to be strong, providing visibility for the profitable growth ahead. With these factors in mind, we are increasing our previous guidance .We now expect 2024 sales of $10.4 billion at the midpoint, up 7.5% from last year and adjusted EPS to be between $7.00 and $7.40 per share, up about 21.5% at the midpoint. Finally, we continue to expect cash flow conversion to be greater than 90%. Looking ahead, I am confident that Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable growth in 2024 and beyond.\n Now let's wrap up on Slide 16. As you've heard today, our team continues to deliver value for our stakeholders, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world-class team, innovative technologies and our continued focus on our customers. Overall, we believe we have an opportunity to continue building significant long-term momentum with growth in modernizations, in new locomotive sales, in digital solutions and in transit systems. With solid underlying demand across the portfolio, increased visibility through our backlog and intense focus on continuous improvement in cost management, Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable long-term growth and maximize shareholder returns. \n With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning and I'll turn now the call over to Kyra to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kyra? \nKyra Yates: Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions. [Operator Instructions]  Operator, we are now ready for our first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. \nJustin Long: So I think the most surprising part of this quarter was the big sequential improvement in freight margins. And I wanted to ask if there was anything unique to this quarter that drove that improvement? Or does this just speak to the operating leverage in the business as equipment revenue ramps? And John, if there's anything you can share on how freight margins are expected to progress over the rest of the year, what's baked in the guidance versus what we just saw in the fourth quarter, the 24%. \nJohn Olin: Great, Justin. When we look at the freight margins up 5.1 percentage points, we do not expect to end the year up 5.1 percentage points. There are a few things in there that are going to bring it down over the course of the back half. But overall, our margins are building from our guidance -- from the last guidance to this guidance. We feel very good about the way the year is going but specifically, Justin, on freight margin, let's talk about a couple of those pieces. One, there was great operational execution that led the increased productivity, that we would expect would continue. \n When we look at a couple of other things. One, mix was very favorable and we expect mix to be favorable in the first half but we do expect mix to turn unfavorable in the back half. So that will be a drag on freight margins a bit in the back half of the year. The second piece is that there was a fair amount of absorption in the quarter given the 13.8 -- or the 17.2% growth of the Freight segment. We don't expect the back half of the year to have such rich revenue growth and therefore, we would expect that to be more neutral in the back half. \n And then finally, during the quarter, Justin, we lapped a onetime investment that we made in the year ago period, if you remember, for our next-generation digital development of PDS software. And as lapping that in the first quarter of this year, that's adding about 1/3 of the overall margin benefit to the enterprise overall, so a little bit more in the Freight group. So we don't expect that to repeat. But again, as we look to the back half of the year in freight, we expect margins to be up but just not the same extent as you're seeing in the first quarter. \nJustin Long: Okay. Got it. And I guess, secondly, we have the proposed locomotive regulations from CARB. I know the public comments around that were due to the EPA earlier this week. But do you have any color around the timing of a final decision on that front? And if the current proposal does pass, any initial thoughts on how quickly this could impact your business based on some of the recent conversations you've had with customers? \nRafael Santana: So Justin, you're right there. I mean, the public comment period was due last Monday. They had a public hearing. I think the outcome here of the rule remains, I'll say quite fluid. So what I'll tell you is, we're technically very well positioned here to support customers for all outcomes. We've got the best-in-class products. We've got the lowest emissions, the lowest fuel consumption, best reliability, ultimately best availability and value for customers there. One thing that I would want to highlight is, the EPA also recently finalized the new standards for highway vehicles, which requires manufacturers to reduce greenhouse gas by 25% for the heavy truck fleet.\n And the EPA also defined through that, that liquid hydrogen for internal combustion engines would be classified as zero emissions despite of using some oil. And this is important as it allows first for our installed base, the internal combustion engines to use hydrogen which can be transitioned to fuel cells ultimately. But I call this out because this definition of zero emissions, I think, plays well into our plans to help railroads transition to near zero emissions with really a reversible solution here through that period. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. \nBascome Majors: Just to follow up on that, John or Rafael, less about this year but more long term. Can you go a little bit deeper into the favorability of mix given the growth in some of the subsegments, be it equipment or the modification side of services that you've typically talked about as being a little bit lower mix than some of your businesses and how that was able to drive such meaningful gross profit expansion, not just the fixed cost absorption and just how you view that in a longer-term context relative to your long-term incremental margin guidance of the 25% to 30%? \nRafael Santana: Bascome, let me start here because, #1, we're confident on the fundamentals of the business. I mean we've had a strong performance and over the last years and now in this quarter and hopefully comes through here, the team's commitment and the robustness of the strategy. I think we're continuously innovating. I think that's been a key piece, even if you think about mods or new locos. We're continuously adapting to some of these market changes to ensure we remain in a growth trajectory. We've been actively managing our pipeline to really convert some of these opportunities into tangible results. I think we've also continued to take proactive steps when challenges arise in this process. \n I think it's important to highlight that you're going to continue to see variation on quarters, yearly results but we're confident here in our ability to continue to drive profitable growth over time in the business. I'll let John comment on the specifics of the quarter and the half. \nJohn Olin: Yes. Bascome, when we look at locos and mods over the long term, we would expect it to provide a headwind on overall mix. And again, we talked about this. There's good mix and bad mix and this is a really good mix because it puts an asset out there that we're going to make money off of for decades to come. But if we look more nearer in, when we look at -- in the first quarter, as well as the first half, we are actually getting some mix favorability from locos and mods because of what we're comparing to in the year ago period. If you remember in the year ago period, we had talked about an international order that was -- that we delivered over 4 quarters, the back half of '22 and the front half of '23 that was very low margin as we moved into a market. So that's providing some of the mix that you're seeing and that will just be in the first half. \n And again, as I mentioned to Justin, we'll start to reverse in the back half. I think, Bascome, the other thing I'd like to point out, as we look at the overall cadence of the year, we talked about this last quarter but we do expect the significant majority of our revenue growth and our profit growth to be in the first half of the year. And this is really due to the production of those locos and mods. As we came out of last year and the strike, we had the production or deliveries of our locos and mods being significantly lower in the first half of the year versus the back half of the year. And our aim this year is to more level load our quarters in that production. \n So with that, we expect locos and mods to be up about 30% in terms of deliveries in the first half of the year and down slightly in the back half. And what that's going to do is, shift a fair amount of revenue into the first half. And with that, will come that absorption that we talked about. And again, the mix is favorable in the first half and a little bit unfavorable in the back half. When we look at the back half, we expect it to be favorable on a year-over-year basis, both for revenue growth and for margin growth but at a much more tempered level than we see in the first half, overall, leading to the guidance that we delivered, which is an improvement in revenue growth as well as more profit margin growth. \nOperator: The next question comes from Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. \nAngel Castillo Malpica: Congrats on a solid quarter. Just wanted to talk about your decarbonization slide, very strong performance there and just the second half deliveries in terms of your targets for some of the alternative fuels is very impressive. So just curious, as you think about or you have conversations with customers, what are you hearing in terms of the benefits of some of these improvements that you're making in enabling your engines to deliver some of these savings. How is that impacting overall kind of discussions, order patterns and kind of expectations as we think about second half and then flowing into 2025? \nRafael Santana: Yes. So a couple of comments there. #1, this has been really part of a long-term strategy on making sure that we have the most really fuel efficient and fuel is a significant part of the expenses for our customers. So we continue those investments there. I think there is continued opportunity to take advantage of both the Tier 4s and the mods. And I do believe we have some of the best products there in the market. We see that playing not just in North America, we see that playing internationally as well. We really like the opportunity here. And I think customers welcome the ability to transition from known core products and be able to really take advantage of that to significantly reduce carbon emissions. And our engines, I'd say, are well prepared to take on both renewable and biofuels and we're progressing here on really making sure hydrogen is also a part of that solution.\n So with that, I think we're very well positioned to support customers through that transition. But we're also working on, what I call, zero emissions technologies, which start with some of the elements of the hybrid units that we're delivering this quarter to New York and we're also delivering later this year, the first, really the heavy haul battery-electric locomotive that's going to Australia, which we unveiled last year. So I think we're, with that, continuing to pace some of our investments here in the light of adoption. But with that, we're very well positioned in that regard and we really try to make sure we make our engines as agnostics -- as agnostic as we can to make sure that we provide that reversibility for customers through transition. \nAngel Castillo Malpica: Very helpful. And then shifting over to capital allocation, just strong performance in the first quarter, strong performance around the kind of the cost management. But as you think about your -- the strong balance sheet that you have and ability to return cash to shareholders, should we expect that there's potential for bigger buybacks and deploying more capital to shareholders? Or how are you kind of seeing -- you talked about the raise of the dividend but kind of the other outlets of cash? How should we kind of think about that for the full year? \nJohn Olin: Yes. Angel, #1 is, we expect a fair amount of free cash for the year. But we've got the balance sheet where we want it. And when I say that it's in that zone of 2 to 2.5x net debt leverage ratio, right, we're towards the low end of that and we feel comfortable with that at this point as well. Having said that, it's -- the cash that we generate, we will prioritize -- with the free cash, we will prioritize first M&A, if we can -- if we find good accretive strategic M&A. And then if not, we'll return the excess cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and feel good about the start to the year in terms of share repurchases with $175 million purchased. But we're looking to return all of our excess cash to our shareholders throughout the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. \nIvan Yi: This is Ivan Yi on for Scott Group. I wanted to touch on pricing here. I know you guys don't really give out any core pricing numbers but can you directionally talk about the how the pricing trends are kind of going? And what are your expectations for pricing sort of the rest of this year? \nJohn Olin: Ivan, when we look at overall pricing in the quarter, pricing was up slightly and our costs were slightly favorable. And so that helped -- provided a little bit of margin improvement in the quarter. \nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen. \nMatthew Elkott: Rafael, I think you mentioned industry locomotive fleet in North America was down but Wabtec was up. Is this just a matter of what we already know, the railroads are coalescing behind Wabtec locomotives increasingly. How much is Trip Optimizer a factor in that? And any other thoughts on that would be helpful. \nRafael Santana: So I think, first, I mean, I think there's certainly an element of, I'll call it, overall life cycle cost that those units provide and that's how you got to keep that in mind. And those are investments that have been done over time that have really positioned our fleets to #1, be it the most efficient fleets at an engine level. So it starts there. It's continuous. If you think about our ability to provide service and support to those fleets, so our customers ultimately get not just the fuel efficiency but they get the reliability and availability of those units. And that comes with significant investments we've made over time on an engineering team that are able to really drive what I call continuous improvement to those fleets over time and really the service network that we've got and our ability to support customers across the globe on that. \n On the top of that, you include some of the elements of really the digital investments we've made and we continue to make to help customers improve not just fuel efficiency but to improve safety and to improve the various elements that they need. So I think this is really a validation of the investments we continue to make and the differentiation we continue to create in the product. \nMatthew Elkott: Got it. That's very helpful. And just one follow-up question. I think John, back in February at the plant tour, you mentioned $110 million of revenue this year that could be discontinued to optimize margins. Could you provide an update on that? \nJohn Olin: Yes. We're moving forward with the exit of, I'd call low margin revenue from the business, right? So Matt, when we look at that midpoint of our new guidance at 7.5%, it actually is higher than that, given the fact that we're taking out that $110 million. The majority of that will come out this year but some of it will move into next year as we're working through exit strategies for different product lines. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Clay on for Jerry. Quick question on the Transit segment. We've had -- you had steady margin improvement in transit over the last couple of years. Do you view the bulk of the operational improvement in the business is now complete? \nRafael Santana: No, we don't. In fact, I think there's continued opportunity here to drive profitable growth in the business. First, some comments in the quarter. I think they were very much in line with the expectations we had. And those were, some of them tied to the higher OE growth. We had high input costs and some of that was offset by Integration 2.0 savings. But in one end, while we are pleased with the overall progress that the business has had we are continuing significant work there to simplify the footprint, to further improve and sustain margins. So I think you're going to continue to see that variation quarter-to-quarter but the team here is very much committed to continue expanding margins, taking action to drive profitable growth and being more selective too, in terms of the opportunities we tackle, in terms of the differentiation we're able to provide in the products that we have. \nUnknown Analyst: And along the same lines in transit on top line, you've had solid book-to-bill for a while now based on your upcoming bids, what level of sales growth is sustainable for the segment over the next couple of years? \nRafael Santana: We -- as we look at longer term and over time, it's probably a range of 3% to 5%. It's probably a range that we should keep it in mind. But we continue to see favorable book-to-bill there. And I just would emphasize the first comment I made in terms of us being more and more selective about the opportunities that are out there. \nOperator: The next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. \nUnknown Analyst: This is James on for Saree. So I wanted to go back on alternative fuels here. So I think rails are -- I mean, while rails are focused on reducing CO2 emissions, I think fuel cost and efficiency also play a critical role here. So can you kind of talk about the economics of using alternative fuels such as biodiesel and renewable? \nRafael Santana: Uptake vary, really across the globe, depending on both the availability and the elements of, I'll call subsidies, that could play out there. And I think that's really been a key piece of our strategy, which is ultimately making sure that we've got that flexibility to support customers. So you might have renewable diesel available in a certain part of the country, you might not have it in all parts of the country, how you make sure you ultimately have an engine that's agnostic to that. And playing right to it, we're seeing also government support in terms of creating potentially some areas where you might have hydrogen that might play a role. \n And we look at this being again how you help our customers transition, as some of that, I'll call replace, over time with our reversible technology. And I think that's a key piece without -- really making sure you don't lose sight of the development of what I call zero emission technologies, which plays into the battery-electric. It plays ultimately into utilizing higher and higher hydrogen mix, which could lead to fuel cell but some of those are much farther out in terms of the opportunity to adopt, in terms of the maturity of the technology and in terms of the economics that it needs to get to. \nUnknown Analyst: Got it. And as a follow-up, I kind of wanted to go back on the margins again. So back in Investor Day, you kind of talked about expanding margin by 250 to 300 bps in the next 5 years. But given such a strong margin performance in first quarter 2024, despite, like more temporary expectation for the back half, are you kind of thinking differently about the long-term margin target? Or are you still kind of like looking for 250 to 300 bps margin expansion? \nJohn Olin: Yes, James, as we look forward in the business, we believe we see the mid-single digits on the revenue side and double digits on the EPS side. Nothing has changed based on our performance of this year or last year in terms of our longer-term view of the industry and our performance within that industry. \nRafael Santana: I think we continue to see opportunity to drive profitable growth ahead. And I think that's important. And at the same note, you're going to have, again, variation, whether it's quarter-to-quarter, half-over-half but there is strong momentum here in both the pipeline, in both North America and internationally. And I think the auto piece, we sometimes don't talk enough, it's just ongoing lean initiatives, the progress on integration should [indiscernible] the portfolio optimization efforts. I mean those 2 things combined really provide us an opportunity here for both margin and revenue expansion. \nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Roszkowski with Bank of America. \nAdam Roszkowski: It's Adam Roszkowski on for Ken Hoexter. A question for John. Could you provide an update on the $75 million to $90 million run rate cost savings by 2025 and where you are now? \nJohn Olin: Yes, Adam, we are -- when we look at the cost from a cost standpoint, we are about $120 million, $125 million down the runway of what we were expecting of $135 million to $165 million and that's kind of realized in the first 2 years. And from a standpoint of savings, we run a run rate savings base at $22 million a year as we exited 2023. And with that, Adam, we are ramping up to that $75 million to $90 million that you mentioned as we exit 2025. So we would expect an escalation of the $60 million, the midpoint, $60 million, $65 million, whatever the midpoint is over the next couple of years and would expect that to be somewhat linear. But most of the projects have all been approved and are in different phases of execution and some are actually completing as well. And so we would expect those savings to ramp pretty quickly over the next 2 years. \nAdam Roszkowski: Helpful. And then you've given some good kind of 1 half, second half margin and profit commentary. Given the sort of elevated impacts from last year, you called out about 1/3 of the gain was due to that onetime item. Should we expect the same magnitude of freight margin kind of year-over-year expansion to continue into the second quarter? Should that drop off a bit? Any color you could give us there? \nJohn Olin: Yes. When we look at -- from a growth perspective, margin growth perspective, we would expect the preponderance of that growth to be in the first half. We do expect growth, Adam, in the back half but not nearly at the level that we're seeing in the first half. And again, the first half is aided by the fact that revenue is going to be significantly -- the significant majority of revenue will be in the first half. And therefore, the P&L leverage will follow that. And as we've talked about, mix is going to be favorable in the first half and the second half. So we will see a step down in the revenue growth, it will grow and we'll see a step down in the margin growth. \n But on a full year basis, we'll exit at our revised guidance and we feel good about that. When we look at the second quarter, we expect the second quarter to be a strong quarter, again, based on the production shifts that we've made, as well as the mix that we've talked about. I don't think it will be at the same level of revenue growth or margin growth but it will be certainly a good quarter. And then again, back half will be more tempered growth. \nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nSteve Barger: If we do get an accelerated domestic locomotive cycle driven by regulatory changes, would you anticipate change orders and cancellations for mods? Or would you think that would all be additive to the backlog? \nRafael Santana: I -- there's certainly a choice to be made but it's really very customer-specific. So I wouldn't say there would be not necessarily a complete reversal of that and I do not expect cancellations in that regard. But there would certainly be an element of more thoughts towards really moving forward with the newer technology, especially as we include in that technology, the ability to take on those alternative fuels. I think that really provides the customer here, what I'll call the safe net to transition over time with the reversibility they need. \nSteve Barger: Understood. And Rafael, following up on the hydrogen conversation. You said Wab is pacing investment to market adoption rates but it's also come up several times on this call, do you expect to see hydrogen equipment on track within the next, say, 5 years? Or is that mainline hydrogen equipment more 2030 and beyond, just to kind of level set expectations? \nRafael Santana: So 2 comments. I do expect hydrogen to be, I'm going to call both tested and there could be an element here if government potentially steps in to create some corridors where you might be able to introduce that as an alternative fuel into the internal combustion engine. If your question is more around 100% hydrogen utilization, that's later down the road and that goes with fuel cells. That goes with irreversible technology. So that's going to take a bit more time on that. So that's not in the near or midterm. \nSteve Barger: Yes. I wasn't even thinking about 100% adoption. I was just thinking about the idea that you can have a legitimate freight hauling piece of equipment on the track in, say, 5 years? Is the technology there? \nRafael Santana: So we do that similarly. We do that today with LNG. We have a [indiscernible] that's, ultimately you have an engine that's able to mix up to 78% of LNG. So you should think along the same lines. At the same time, if there's any issues as you're running or availability of fuel is not there, you're still able to complete the mission with the current engine that you have on. So I think you could expect to see some experimentation there. There could even be some corridors but I think still going to be a niche application. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kyra Yates for any closing remarks. \nKyra Yates: Thank you, Dave and thank you, everyone, for your participation today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Goodbye. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Olin",
            "content": "Thanks, Rafael and hello, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I will review our first quarter results in more detail. In the first quarter, we continued to see the underlying momentum that we experienced as we exited last year. As expected, both revenue growth and operating margin growth were overshared in Q1 versus our expectations for full year growth. As we discussed in the last quarter call, we expected both revenue and margin growth to be higher in the first half versus the second half. While we continue to expect growth in the second half, we expect it to be at a much more tempered pace than the first half. Sales for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, which reflects a 13.8% increase versus the prior year. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by the Freight segment, especially in our equipment and services groups.  \n For the quarter, GAAP operating income was $412 million, driven by higher sales, improved gross margin and focused cost management. Adjusted operating margin in Q1 was 19.8%, up 3.4 percentage points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by improved gross margin of 2.4 percentage points and driven by operating expenses, which grew at a slower rate than revenue, increasing our Q1 margin by an additional 1.0 percentage points. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.53, which was up 64.5% versus the first quarter a year ago. During the quarter, we had pretax charges of $10 million for restructuring, which were primarily related to our Integration 2.0 and our portfolio optimization initiative to further integrate and streamline Wabtec's operations. As you may recall, Integration 2.0 is expected to drive $75 million to $90 million of run rate savings by 2025 and our portfolio optimization initiative will eliminate roughly $110 million of low-margin, nonstrategic revenue while reducing manufacturing complexity.  \n In the quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.89, up 47.7% versus prior year. Overall, Wabtec delivered another solid quarter, demonstrating the underlying strength of the business.  Turning to Slide 9. Let's review our product lines in more detail. First quarter consolidated sales were up 13.8%. Equipment sales were up 30.2% from last year's first quarter driven by robust sales of mining equipment and higher deliveries of new locomotives. Component sales were up 13.6% versus last year, driven by increased sales of industrial products, higher international sales and the acquisition of L&M in late Q2 of 2023, partially offset by lower North American railcar build. Digital Intelligence sales were down 5.9% from last year, where we continue to experience lower revenues in our North American market but we do see growth in our next-generation onboard locomotive products and digital mining.  \n Our services sales grew 17.3%. Services growth was driven by significantly higher year-over-year deliveries of mods, increased overhauls and parts sales. Our customers continue to recognize the superior performance, reliability and availability of our fleet. Across our Transit segment, sales increased 5.5%, behind growth in our products and services businesses. The momentum in the Transit segment remains positive as secular drivers such as urbanization and decarbonization accelerate the need for investments in sustainable infrastructure.  \n Now moving to Slide 10. Both GAAP and adjusted gross margin were up 2.4 percentage points during the quarter. In addition to higher sales, gross margin benefited from improved pricing and favorable mix between segments. Mix within the Freight segment was also favorable despite significantly higher new loco and mod deliveries in the quarter. During the quarter, we also benefited from favorable fixed cost absorption and benefits from Integration 2.0 as well as comparing against higher next-generation digital development costs in the first quarter of 2023. Our team continues to execute well to mitigate the impact of continued cost pressures by driving operational productivity and lean initiatives.  \n Turning to Slide 11. For the first quarter, GAAP operating margin was 16.5%, which was up 3.9 percentage points versus last year. Adjusted operating margin improved 3.4 percentage points to 19.8%. GAAP and adjusted SG&A expenses were down as a percentage of revenues as we leveraged higher sales with a strong focus on managing costs. Engineering expense was $48 million, modestly lower than Q1 last year. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve our customers' productivity, capacity utilization and safety.  \n Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 12, starting with the Freight segment. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales were up 17.2% during the quarter. GAAP segment operating income was $368 million for an operating margin of 20.2%, up 5.7 percentage points versus last year. GAAP operating income includes $3 million of restructuring costs primarily related to Integration 2.0 and portfolio optimization costs. Adjusted operating income for the Freight segment was $439 million, up 48.3% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the Freight segment was 24.1%, up 5.1 percentage points from prior year. \n The increase was driven by improved gross margin behind strong operational execution, favorable mix, improved pricing, Integration 2.0 savings and as we lap last year's investment in our next-generation digital development costs. At the same time, SG&A and engineering expenses were lower as a percentage of revenue. Finally, segment 12-month backlog was $5.67 billion, up 14.5% from the same period a year ago. The multiyear backlog was $17.9 billion, down 2.3% from the prior year. Both our 12-month and multiyear backlogs demonstrate good visibility in '24 and beyond.  \n Turning to Slide 13. Transit segment sales were up 5.5% to $673 million. When adjusting for foreign currency, Transit sales were up 4.9%. GAAP operating income was $74 million, restructuring costs related to Integration 2.0 were $7 million in Q1. Adjusted segment operating income was $86 million. Adjusted operating margin as a percent of revenue was 12.7%, down 0.2 percentage points from last year, driven by unfavorable mix and higher input costs, partially offset by Integration 2.0 savings. Finally, Transit segment 12-month backlog for the quarter was $2.04 billion, up 3.3% versus a year ago. The multiyear backlog was also up 4.2% to $4.19 billion.  \n Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 14. First quarter cash flow was $334 million. During the quarter, cash flow benefited from higher earnings, improved working capital and increased securitization funding. We continue to expect greater than 90% cash conversion for the full year. Our balance sheet and financial position continue to be strong. We ended the quarter with liquidity of $2.13 billion. And our net debt leverage ratio was 1.7x at the end of the first quarter, which was favorable versus the same quarter a year ago at 2.3x debt leverage. We continue to allocate capital in a disciplined and balanced way to maximize returns for our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $175 million of our shares and paid $36 million in dividends, which was recently increased by our Board of Directors, up 17.6% per share versus prior year. \n With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rafael to talk about our 2024 financial guidance. Great, Justin. When we look at the freight margins up 5.1 percentage points, we do not expect to end the year up 5.1 percentage points. There are a few things in there that are going to bring it down over the course of the back half. But overall, our margins are building from our guidance -- from the last guidance to this guidance. We feel very good about the way the year is going but specifically, Justin, on freight margin, let's talk about a couple of those pieces. One, there was great operational execution that led the increased productivity, that we would expect would continue. \n When we look at a couple of other things. One, mix was very favorable and we expect mix to be favorable in the first half but we do expect mix to turn unfavorable in the back half. So that will be a drag on freight margins a bit in the back half of the year. The second piece is that there was a fair amount of absorption in the quarter given the 13.8 -- or the 17.2% growth of the Freight segment. We don't expect the back half of the year to have such rich revenue growth and therefore, we would expect that to be more neutral in the back half. \n And then finally, during the quarter, Justin, we lapped a onetime investment that we made in the year ago period, if you remember, for our next-generation digital development of PDS software. And as lapping that in the first quarter of this year, that's adding about 1/3 of the overall margin benefit to the enterprise overall, so a little bit more in the Freight group. So we don't expect that to repeat. But again, as we look to the back half of the year in freight, we expect margins to be up but just not the same extent as you're seeing in the first quarter. Yes. Bascome, when we look at locos and mods over the long term, we would expect it to provide a headwind on overall mix. And again, we talked about this. There's good mix and bad mix and this is a really good mix because it puts an asset out there that we're going to make money off of for decades to come. But if we look more nearer in, when we look at -- in the first quarter, as well as the first half, we are actually getting some mix favorability from locos and mods because of what we're comparing to in the year ago period. If you remember in the year ago period, we had talked about an international order that was -- that we delivered over 4 quarters, the back half of '22 and the front half of '23 that was very low margin as we moved into a market. So that's providing some of the mix that you're seeing and that will just be in the first half. \n And again, as I mentioned to Justin, we'll start to reverse in the back half. I think, Bascome, the other thing I'd like to point out, as we look at the overall cadence of the year, we talked about this last quarter but we do expect the significant majority of our revenue growth and our profit growth to be in the first half of the year. And this is really due to the production of those locos and mods. As we came out of last year and the strike, we had the production or deliveries of our locos and mods being significantly lower in the first half of the year versus the back half of the year. And our aim this year is to more level load our quarters in that production. \n So with that, we expect locos and mods to be up about 30% in terms of deliveries in the first half of the year and down slightly in the back half. And what that's going to do is, shift a fair amount of revenue into the first half. And with that, will come that absorption that we talked about. And again, the mix is favorable in the first half and a little bit unfavorable in the back half. When we look at the back half, we expect it to be favorable on a year-over-year basis, both for revenue growth and for margin growth but at a much more tempered level than we see in the first half, overall, leading to the guidance that we delivered, which is an improvement in revenue growth as well as more profit margin growth. Yes. Angel, #1 is, we expect a fair amount of free cash for the year. But we've got the balance sheet where we want it. And when I say that it's in that zone of 2 to 2.5x net debt leverage ratio, right, we're towards the low end of that and we feel comfortable with that at this point as well. Having said that, it's -- the cash that we generate, we will prioritize -- with the free cash, we will prioritize first M&A, if we can -- if we find good accretive strategic M&A. And then if not, we'll return the excess cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and feel good about the start to the year in terms of share repurchases with $175 million purchased. But we're looking to return all of our excess cash to our shareholders throughout the year. Ivan, when we look at overall pricing in the quarter, pricing was up slightly and our costs were slightly favorable. And so that helped -- provided a little bit of margin improvement in the quarter. Yes. We're moving forward with the exit of, I'd call low margin revenue from the business, right? So Matt, when we look at that midpoint of our new guidance at 7.5%, it actually is higher than that, given the fact that we're taking out that $110 million. The majority of that will come out this year but some of it will move into next year as we're working through exit strategies for different product lines. Yes, James, as we look forward in the business, we believe we see the mid-single digits on the revenue side and double digits on the EPS side. Nothing has changed based on our performance of this year or last year in terms of our longer-term view of the industry and our performance within that industry. Yes, Adam, we are -- when we look at the cost from a cost standpoint, we are about $120 million, $125 million down the runway of what we were expecting of $135 million to $165 million and that's kind of realized in the first 2 years. And from a standpoint of savings, we run a run rate savings base at $22 million a year as we exited 2023. And with that, Adam, we are ramping up to that $75 million to $90 million that you mentioned as we exit 2025. So we would expect an escalation of the $60 million, the midpoint, $60 million, $65 million, whatever the midpoint is over the next couple of years and would expect that to be somewhat linear. But most of the projects have all been approved and are in different phases of execution and some are actually completing as well. And so we would expect those savings to ramp pretty quickly over the next 2 years. Yes. When we look at -- from a growth perspective, margin growth perspective, we would expect the preponderance of that growth to be in the first half. We do expect growth, Adam, in the back half but not nearly at the level that we're seeing in the first half. And again, the first half is aided by the fact that revenue is going to be significantly -- the significant majority of revenue will be in the first half. And therefore, the P&L leverage will follow that. And as we've talked about, mix is going to be favorable in the first half and the second half. So we will see a step down in the revenue growth, it will grow and we'll see a step down in the margin growth. \n But on a full year basis, we'll exit at our revised guidance and we feel good about that. When we look at the second quarter, we expect the second quarter to be a strong quarter, again, based on the production shifts that we've made, as well as the mix that we've talked about. I don't think it will be at the same level of revenue growth or margin growth but it will be certainly a good quarter. And then again, back half will be more tempered growth."

            "name": "Rafael Santana",
            "content": "Thanks, Kyra and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 4. I'll start with an update on our business, my perspectives on the quarter and progress against our long-term value creation framework and then John will cover the financials. Last quarter, when we met, we talked about the strong momentum that we had when we exit 2023. Well, that momentum continues. Sales were $2.5 billion, which was up 13.8% versus prior year. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance, largely from the Freight segment. And adjusted EPS was up 47.7% from the year ago quarter, driven by increased sales and margin expansion.  \n Total cash flow from operations for the quarter was $334 million. The 12-month backlog was $7.7 billion, up 11%, signifying continued momentum and visibility across the business. In total, multiyear backlog was $22 billion. Overall, we had a strong start to the year. The underlying strength and momentum across the business is evident. We remain confident in our ability to execute, to deliver for our customers and to continue to make progress against our long-term growth strategies.  \n Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about 2024 and market expectations in more details. While key metrics across our freight business remain mixed, we are encouraged by the strength of our business, the strength of our international markets and our robust pipeline of opportunities across geographies. North America carloads were up 1.8% in the quarter, despite this carload growth the industry's active locomotive fleet was down when compared to last year's first quarter, while Wabtec's active fleet was higher. As we look forward, we continue to see significant opportunities across the globe in demand for new locomotives, modernizations and digital technologies, as our customers invest in solutions that continue to drive reliability, productivity, safety and fuel efficiency.  \n Looking at the North American railcar builds. Last quarter, we discussed the industry outlook for 2024, to be about 38,000 cars to be delivered, which has now been lowered by the industry sources to reflect an expected 36,000 cars. Internationally, activity is strong across most of our core markets, significant investments to expand and upgrade infrastructure are supporting a robust international orders pipeline. In mining, commodity prices and an aging fleet are supporting activity to refresh and upgrade the truck fleet. Finally, moving to the Transit sector. The megatrends of urbanization and decarbonization remain in place, driving the need for clean, safe and efficient transportation solutions around the globe.  \n Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss a few business highlights. Late in Q1, we signed a $270 million strategic order for new locomotives with a large mining customer in Africa. This, coupled with a recent service order in the region for $64 million highlights the significant opportunity that we believe exists in Africa. Within mining, we're seeing continued strength in the business, in particular, aftermarket and the team has signed orders totaling over $250 million in the quarter.  \n In Indonesia, we won a long-term parts agreement with PT KAI. And finally, our Maintenance of Way team launched its Shuttlewagon Commander NXT, the next generation of railcar movers. The new model was specifically designed for the needs of the customers, to optimize tractive effort, reduce wheel slipping and extend tire life. All of this demonstrates the continued momentum across the business, the team's relentless focus on execution, the strong pipeline of opportunities we continue to deliver on. Wabtec is well positioned to capture profitable growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers' most pressing needs.  \n Moving to Slide 7. Before turning it over to John, I want to briefly discuss our progress that we're making against one of our company's key strategies, which is to lead the decarbonization of rail. Our highly capable team, our installed base of locomotives and our advanced locomotive technologies puts Wabtec in a unique position to lead the industry on fuel efficiency and to reduce carbon emissions. With this in mind, we're driving progress on 2 fronts. First, is to enable our customers to transition to a near zero emissions using their current installed base of locomotives. Our focus here leverages our customers' existing fleets and wayside infrastructure.  \n Our customers can improve fuel efficiency and carbon emission by up to 18% through replacing the older fleets with our Tier 4 and modernized locomotives along with realizing improved durability, haulage ability, reliability and fuel efficiency. We're also enabling our existing locomotive portfolio to be capable of reductions of up to 60% in carbon through the use of bio and renewable fuels. And when further mixed with hydrogen in the locomotive's internal combustion engine, up to 80% total carbon reduction.  \n In addition, we believe we have a competitive advantage given the fact that our locomotives are more fuel efficient and our 4-stroke engine architecture facilitates the use of hydrogen in our internal combustion engines. And the best part of this approach is that it provides significant optionality for our customers. And this approach is completely reversible back to diesel if supplies of alternative fuels are not available or not economical. On our second path to decarbonization, we're developing zero emissions technology and equipment. As you are aware, we recently introduced the world's first heavy haul battery-electric locomotive to a mining customer in Australia.  \n Given the customers' application, they plan to operate this locomotive relying on regenerative braking to charge the batteries. And later this month, we will ship our first battery hybrid locomotive. Finally, we are investing and partnering with government agencies to develop heavy haul locomotives powered by hydrogen fuel cells. We believe that the commercialization of hydrogen fuel cells for heavy haul locomotives is farther down the road. Consequently, we are pacing our investments with our customers' readiness to adopt the technology. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review the quarter segment results and our overall financial performance. John? Thanks, John. Now let's turn to Slide 15 to discuss our 2024 updated full year guidance. As you've heard today, our team delivered a very strong start to the year. We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and solutions continues across our business. Our orders pipeline and 12-month backlog continue to be strong, providing visibility for the profitable growth ahead. With these factors in mind, we are increasing our previous guidance .We now expect 2024 sales of $10.4 billion at the midpoint, up 7.5% from last year and adjusted EPS to be between $7.00 and $7.40 per share, up about 21.5% at the midpoint. Finally, we continue to expect cash flow conversion to be greater than 90%. Looking ahead, I am confident that Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable growth in 2024 and beyond.\n Now let's wrap up on Slide 16. As you've heard today, our team continues to deliver value for our stakeholders, thanks in large part to our resilient installed base, world-class team, innovative technologies and our continued focus on our customers. Overall, we believe we have an opportunity to continue building significant long-term momentum with growth in modernizations, in new locomotive sales, in digital solutions and in transit systems. With solid underlying demand across the portfolio, increased visibility through our backlog and intense focus on continuous improvement in cost management, Wabtec is well positioned to drive profitable long-term growth and maximize shareholder returns. \n With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning and I'll turn now the call over to Kyra to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kyra? So Justin, you're right there. I mean, the public comment period was due last Monday. They had a public hearing. I think the outcome here of the rule remains, I'll say quite fluid. So what I'll tell you is, we're technically very well positioned here to support customers for all outcomes. We've got the best-in-class products. We've got the lowest emissions, the lowest fuel consumption, best reliability, ultimately best availability and value for customers there. One thing that I would want to highlight is, the EPA also recently finalized the new standards for highway vehicles, which requires manufacturers to reduce greenhouse gas by 25% for the heavy truck fleet.\n And the EPA also defined through that, that liquid hydrogen for internal combustion engines would be classified as zero emissions despite of using some oil. And this is important as it allows first for our installed base, the internal combustion engines to use hydrogen which can be transitioned to fuel cells ultimately. But I call this out because this definition of zero emissions, I think, plays well into our plans to help railroads transition to near zero emissions with really a reversible solution here through that period. Bascome, let me start here because, #1, we're confident on the fundamentals of the business. I mean we've had a strong performance and over the last years and now in this quarter and hopefully comes through here, the team's commitment and the robustness of the strategy. I think we're continuously innovating. I think that's been a key piece, even if you think about mods or new locos. We're continuously adapting to some of these market changes to ensure we remain in a growth trajectory. We've been actively managing our pipeline to really convert some of these opportunities into tangible results. I think we've also continued to take proactive steps when challenges arise in this process. \n I think it's important to highlight that you're going to continue to see variation on quarters, yearly results but we're confident here in our ability to continue to drive profitable growth over time in the business. I'll let John comment on the specifics of the quarter and the half. Yes. So a couple of comments there. #1, this has been really part of a long-term strategy on making sure that we have the most really fuel efficient and fuel is a significant part of the expenses for our customers. So we continue those investments there. I think there is continued opportunity to take advantage of both the Tier 4s and the mods. And I do believe we have some of the best products there in the market. We see that playing not just in North America, we see that playing internationally as well. We really like the opportunity here. And I think customers welcome the ability to transition from known core products and be able to really take advantage of that to significantly reduce carbon emissions. And our engines, I'd say, are well prepared to take on both renewable and biofuels and we're progressing here on really making sure hydrogen is also a part of that solution.\n So with that, I think we're very well positioned to support customers through that transition. But we're also working on, what I call, zero emissions technologies, which start with some of the elements of the hybrid units that we're delivering this quarter to New York and we're also delivering later this year, the first, really the heavy haul battery-electric locomotive that's going to Australia, which we unveiled last year. So I think we're, with that, continuing to pace some of our investments here in the light of adoption. But with that, we're very well positioned in that regard and we really try to make sure we make our engines as agnostics -- as agnostic as we can to make sure that we provide that reversibility for customers through transition. So I think, first, I mean, I think there's certainly an element of, I'll call it, overall life cycle cost that those units provide and that's how you got to keep that in mind. And those are investments that have been done over time that have really positioned our fleets to #1, be it the most efficient fleets at an engine level. So it starts there. It's continuous. If you think about our ability to provide service and support to those fleets, so our customers ultimately get not just the fuel efficiency but they get the reliability and availability of those units. And that comes with significant investments we've made over time on an engineering team that are able to really drive what I call continuous improvement to those fleets over time and really the service network that we've got and our ability to support customers across the globe on that. \n On the top of that, you include some of the elements of really the digital investments we've made and we continue to make to help customers improve not just fuel efficiency but to improve safety and to improve the various elements that they need. So I think this is really a validation of the investments we continue to make and the differentiation we continue to create in the product. No, we don't. In fact, I think there's continued opportunity here to drive profitable growth in the business. First, some comments in the quarter. I think they were very much in line with the expectations we had. And those were, some of them tied to the higher OE growth. We had high input costs and some of that was offset by Integration 2.0 savings. But in one end, while we are pleased with the overall progress that the business has had we are continuing significant work there to simplify the footprint, to further improve and sustain margins. So I think you're going to continue to see that variation quarter-to-quarter but the team here is very much committed to continue expanding margins, taking action to drive profitable growth and being more selective too, in terms of the opportunities we tackle, in terms of the differentiation we're able to provide in the products that we have. We -- as we look at longer term and over time, it's probably a range of 3% to 5%. It's probably a range that we should keep it in mind. But we continue to see favorable book-to-bill there. And I just would emphasize the first comment I made in terms of us being more and more selective about the opportunities that are out there. Uptake vary, really across the globe, depending on both the availability and the elements of, I'll call subsidies, that could play out there. And I think that's really been a key piece of our strategy, which is ultimately making sure that we've got that flexibility to support customers. So you might have renewable diesel available in a certain part of the country, you might not have it in all parts of the country, how you make sure you ultimately have an engine that's agnostic to that. And playing right to it, we're seeing also government support in terms of creating potentially some areas where you might have hydrogen that might play a role. \n And we look at this being again how you help our customers transition, as some of that, I'll call replace, over time with our reversible technology. And I think that's a key piece without -- really making sure you don't lose sight of the development of what I call zero emission technologies, which plays into the battery-electric. It plays ultimately into utilizing higher and higher hydrogen mix, which could lead to fuel cell but some of those are much farther out in terms of the opportunity to adopt, in terms of the maturity of the technology and in terms of the economics that it needs to get to. I think we continue to see opportunity to drive profitable growth ahead. And I think that's important. And at the same note, you're going to have, again, variation, whether it's quarter-to-quarter, half-over-half but there is strong momentum here in both the pipeline, in both North America and internationally. And I think the auto piece, we sometimes don't talk enough, it's just ongoing lean initiatives, the progress on integration should [indiscernible] the portfolio optimization efforts. I mean those 2 things combined really provide us an opportunity here for both margin and revenue expansion. I -- there's certainly a choice to be made but it's really very customer-specific. So I wouldn't say there would be not necessarily a complete reversal of that and I do not expect cancellations in that regard. But there would certainly be an element of more thoughts towards really moving forward with the newer technology, especially as we include in that technology, the ability to take on those alternative fuels. I think that really provides the customer here, what I'll call the safe net to transition over time with the reversibility they need. So 2 comments. I do expect hydrogen to be, I'm going to call both tested and there could be an element here if government potentially steps in to create some corridors where you might be able to introduce that as an alternative fuel into the internal combustion engine. If your question is more around 100% hydrogen utilization, that's later down the road and that goes with fuel cells. That goes with irreversible technology. So that's going to take a bit more time on that. So that's not in the near or midterm. So we do that similarly. We do that today with LNG. We have a [indiscernible] that's, ultimately you have an engine that's able to mix up to 78% of LNG. So you should think along the same lines. At the same time, if there's any issues as you're running or availability of fuel is not there, you're still able to complete the mission with the current engine that you have on. So I think you could expect to see some experimentation there. There could even be some corridors but I think still going to be a niche application."
