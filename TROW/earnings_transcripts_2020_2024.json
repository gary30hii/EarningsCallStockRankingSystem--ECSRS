All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer period. I'll give you instructions on how to ask questions at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be available for replay on T. Rowe Price's website shortly after the call concludes. I will now turn the call over to Linsley Carruth, T. Rowe Price's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nLinsley Carruth: Hello, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. The press release and the supplemental materials document can be found on our IR website at investors.troweprice.com. Today's call will last approximately 45 minutes. Our CEO and President, Rob Sharps; CFO, Jen Dardis; and Head of Global Investments, Eric Veiel, will discuss the company's results for about 20 minutes, and then we'll open it up to your questions. We ask that you limit it to one question per participant. I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements and reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statement language and the reconciliations to GAAP in the supplemental materials, as well as in our press release. All investment performance references to peer groups on today's call are using Morningstar peer groups. Now, I will turn it over to Rob.\nRobert Sharps: Thank you, Linsley. And thanks to all of you for joining us. Before we get started, I want to share that in late November, Eric was named Head of Global Investments in recognition of his strong leadership, as well as his extensive investment experience. I know he will continue to focus on pursuing superior outcomes for our clients, and both Jen and I congratulate him on his expanded role. Eric will provide today's update on our investment organization, followed by Jen who will cover our financial results. With that, I will turn to 2023 results. While 2023 was a challenging year for us with substantial net outflows, it also brought progress. Investment performance improved, and we advanced important work to ensure our firm is positioned for future growth. We are already seeing a number of early indicators that support our confidence that better days are ahead. We have a long and solid track record of putting clients first and pursuing excellence. As we near our 88th anniversary, I am confident that we will build on this tradition, delivering compelling value for our clients, our associates and our shareholders. As I mentioned, we made meaningful progress against our strategic priorities in 2023. Our active ETF business is gaining traction, with assets under management over $2.7 billion at the end of January. We launched the T. Rowe Price OHA Select Private Credit Fund, or OCREDIT, with over $1.5 billion of investable capital, and are in the early stages of bringing this product to the wealth management channel. We acquired Retiree, Inc. to enhance our ability to expand and retain relationships with pre-retiree and retiree clients by providing tax-aware retirement income and Social Security claiming strategies. This acquisition demonstrates our commitment to broadening and evolving our already strong retirement capabilities and deepens our position as a retirement leader. We partnered with the International Finance Corporation to create the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Blue Economy Bond Strategy, a pioneering blue bond strategy that will focus on private companies operating in emerging markets. We expanded our Capital Appreciation suite with the launch of the T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation and Income Fund for investors seeking an income-oriented fund. We have an industry-leading position in our Target Date franchise, with strong investment performance and net inflows of $13.1 billion last year. Building on this strength, we continue to innovate and add new capabilities, including moving beyond accumulation. The engagement and collaboration among our investment teams got back to what I would characterize as healthy pre-pandemic levels. Our culture thrives on the energy around our teams engaging with corporate management teams, traveling together, and debating risks and opportunities. This is how our investment platform delivers its best for clients. We are evolving as markets and our clients demand more, and we are ready to compete with additional vehicles, new capabilities and new experiences. Leading indicators support our confidence that there will be a slower pace of net outflows this year. We are seeing improved performance in large-cap growth funds and expect that the rebound in 2023 will reduce redemptions in 2024. Key elements of strategic initiatives are delivering. We're seeing improving gross sales in our Individual Investor channel, with Q4 having the highest gross sales of any quarter over the last two years. We saw positive momentum for net flows in our US Wealth Management Platform segment in Q4. And in EMEA, we were recently selected by a large UK wealth management firm to manage a custom multi-asset income fund. Despite a challenging year, our balance sheet remains solid with $2.5 billion of cash and discretionary investments at the end of 2023. We continue to prioritize the dividend, while maintaining ample liquidity to support our seed capital program, opportunistic buybacks and potential M&A. We recently announced a quarterly dividend of $1.24, which increased for the 38th consecutive year. I want to underscore that the progress I've highlighted is a result of our associates commitment to investment excellence, to superb client service and to driving our corporate strategy forward. We are grateful for their hard work, and are confident that together we will return the firm to organic growth. I'll now turn to Eric.\nEric Veiel: Thank you, Rob. After retreating in the third quarter, both equity and fixed-income markets rebounded in the latter part of the fourth quarter, resulting in strong calendar year returns in most indices. Across asset classes, we delivered solid investment performance, with 64% of our funds beating their peer group medians for the year. Strong equity performers included our US Equity Research Fund, Capital Appreciation Fund, and Mid-Cap Value Fund, which are top-quartile performers for the one, three, five, and 10-year time periods. 2023 also marked the 16th year that our Capital Appreciation Fund, managed by David Giroux, beat its Morningstar peer group average, tying the record for the most consecutive calendar years a US equity or multi-asset fund has done so under the same portfolio manager. Our three large-cap growth equity funds all delivered top-quartile one-year performance in 2023, turning around the performance challenges of 2022 that have driven recent outflows. And while over 60% of the return for the Russell 1000 Growth benchmark came from the seven largest names in 2023, our large-cap growth strategies delivered alpha from a much wider set of fundamental investment choices. Strong performance in our Target Date suite continued, with all vintages of both the flagship retirement suite and the newer blend suite beating their peer group medians for the year. Overall, our multi-asset products had a strong year, with just over half of the funds in their top-quartile for the year. Our fixed-income franchise had a solid year, with 60% of the funds beating their peer group medians. Several of our non-investment grade funds, including high-yield, international, low duration and muni funds, were all top-quartile performers for the year. Most notably, Global Multi-Sector Bond Fund was the top performer in its peer group for the year, adding to its five-year and 10-year top-decile performance. Investment performance across our alternatives platform was strong in 2023, with liquid strategies outperforming their benchmarks and private strategies generating attractive absolute performance. I want to share a few highlights about our investment platform. As a fundamental research-driven investment organization, our over 900 investment professionals around the globe adhere to our rigorous investment process and leverage insights generated by our research platform. Over the last 10 years, we've more than doubled the investment professional ranks, including the scale-up for TRPIM and the addition of OHA. We saw very little turnover in the past year, with average portfolio manager tenure at T. Rowe of 17 years. Importantly, as Rob referenced, our team engagement is back to pre-pandemic levels. We conducted over 14,000 due diligence meetings last year. And thanks in large part to our proprietary in-house corporate access capabilities, the majority of these meetings were held in-person. Our analysts and PMs engaged in field research trips, large and small. For example, 48 members of our emerging markets team spent one week traveling across China, digging deep on key topics across the technology, industrial and consumer sectors. The strength of our research platform can be seen in our US equity research strategy, with over 25 TRPA analysts contributing to the portfolio and their focus area of expertise. Their insights delivered for clients. In addition to the top-quartile performance versus peers I mentioned earlier, it has demonstrated its ability to generate alpha over time with less tracking error. We have broadened this approach and now offer a global equity research strategy that leverages the insights of over 75 global analysts. Our investment data insights team, in collaboration with our data science team, is generating ideas and enabling our investment professionals to be more efficient by leveraging capabilities like large language models to improve the delivery of data and insights to our portfolio managers and analysts. Our Research.AI generative AI tool is in beta test with 80 investment professionals, and represents a promising start to what is sure to be a continued investment in this area. We recently established an equity solutions capability that will allow us to deliver customized versions of our fundamental equity investment strategies for large clients, tailored to their specific objectives. This capability builds upon the strong success of our integrated equity team, which combines fundamental and systematic processes and has demonstrated strong results across a wide variety of strategies, including US Small-Cap Growth, US SMID Cap Core, Large-Cap Value, and Global Core. And our ESG teams continue to help our portfolio managers make informed decisions by understanding the risks and opportunities related to ESG and how they may impact the company's performance. We are also responding to client demand and developing new products, like the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Blue Economy Bond Strategy that Rob mentioned. Pursuing excellent investment performance for our clients remains our top priority. The depth and breadth of our investment platform, which is rooted in our three pillars of people, process, and culture, gives us the tools to be able to do so. I'll now turn it over to Jen to cover our financials.\nJen Dardis: Thank you, Eric. I'll review our financial results and then we will open the line for questions. Our adjusted earnings per share for Q4 2023 was $1.72, bringing us to $7.59 for the year. 2023 was down from $8.02 in 2022 from lower average AUM and investment advisory revenue and higher expenses. We had $28.3 billion in net outflows this quarter, bringing full year outflows to $81.8 billion. During the fourth quarter, we had a handful of large redemptions in our sub-advisory and institutional channels that elevated net outflows. From an asset class perspective, US Equity continues to be the main driver of net outflows. In our DC channels, Stable Value posted sizable net outflows in 2023 after delivering strong positive net flows in 2022, a sign that retirement investors may be seeking higher yield or reorienting toward a risk appetite. We are seeing encouraging signs in our smaller ticket retail business, with improving net flows in both our direct and intermediary channels. Our Target Date suite ended the year with $13.1 billion of positive net flows, and Alternatives also posted positive flows for the year. Additional detail on Alternatives' flows can be found on page 20 of the annual version of our supplemental materials. There are also some signs of strength across our individual equity and fixed-income products, with Capital Appreciation, All-Cap Opportunities, International Core, and Global Multi-Sector Bond all delivering over $1 billion in positive net flows in 2023. Looking at our income statement. Q4 adjusted net revenues were $1.7 billion for the quarter, bringing our full year adjusted total revenue to $6.5 billion. Our Q4 investment advisory revenue of about $1.5 billion was higher than Q4 of last year, but the $5.7 billion earned for the full year was lower than 2022 overall based on the trend in average assets. Our effective fee rate of 42.2 basis points in Q4 was up due to a little over $25 million in performance-based fees predominantly on Alternatives products that crystallized in the fourth quarter. Without these performance-based fees, our Q4 effective fee rate would have been more in line with the Q3 2023 fee rate. Turning to expenses. Q4 adjusted operating expenses were $1.2 billion. As I mentioned last quarter, Q4 included higher expenses compared to Q3, related to seasonal advertising and promotion, stock-based compensation and professional fees. As equity markets improved in 2023, we increased the investment in our brands to support future growth. Q3 2023 also included a non-recurring benefit in G&A expenses. Full-year 2023 adjusted operating expenses, excluding the carried interest expense, were $4.19 billion, up 3% over 2022's $4.07 billion, and within the previously provided 2023 guidance range of 2% to 4%. Based on average market conditions over the last quarter, we expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses, excluding carried interest expense, to be up 3% to 5% over 2023's $4.19 billion. This is up slightly from previously provided 2024 guidance due to the increase in equity markets and the impact this is expected to have on our market-driven expenses in 2024. We anticipate the 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 26%, reflecting lower expected valuation allowances related to our UK-based business, and a lower state tax rate associated with income apportionment rules in certain jurisdictions. Despite a challenging year, we remain committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and returning capital to stockholders. We bought back $103 million worth of shares during the fourth quarter, bringing 2023 total buybacks to $254 million. And we've continued to buy back shares during the start of 2024. As Rob mentioned, last week we announced a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share, a $0.02 per share increase. Between the dividend and buybacks, we've returned $1.38 billion to stockholders over the course of 2023, while also increasing our cash position over $300 million from the end of 2022. This strong financial position allows us continued flexibility to support the annual dividend and to pursue opportunistic share buybacks, while also strategically investing in seed capital or M&A as opportunities arise. We remain focused on proactively managing our expenses to allow for the continued investment in our strategic priorities while ensuring our cost structure is appropriate for the size and scale of the firm. This financial discipline, along with our commitment to efficiency and process improvement, positions us to fund our future growth through modest increases in expenses and the reallocation of existing expenditures. With that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Rob, I was hoping you could enhance or expand upon your comments around 2024 improvements. I think you highlighted some gross sales trends in the fourth quarter improving, plus we know investment performance has gotten better. So curious about maybe the sales profile as we start the year, how redemptions maybe are tracking? And just a little more color around the positive outlook.\nRobert Sharps: Dan. Good morning. Thank you for the question. Our base case for 2024 is that we will have outflows, but we do expect improvement from 2023. First, the investment strategies with the most substantial outflows in 2022 and 2023 had much better performance in 2023, that should translate into lower client redemptions and improve sales over time. And in fact, we are seeing evidence of that already. You're beginning to see improvements in gross sales in some of those strategies. And if you look at our notified terminations or if you look at our at risk, as we go into 2024, I feel like we're in a meaningfully better position than we were going into 2023. I'd point out a handful of other things. One, I think we expect the contribution from OHA and new vehicles, ETFs and SMA to build going forward. I feel like we are beginning to see some momentum build there. And when we combine all of that with some early-stage sales momentum from some of our strategic initiatives, I'm confident that this will be a better year. How much better, I'd say, is to be determined. To some extent, I think it is dependent on continued execution from an investment performance perspective, it's contingent on risk appetites in the marketplace and levels of volatility. It's contingent on some -- more -- greater risk appetite and lengthening time horizons as some of the money on the sidelines reengages and extends time horizons. But as I look across our distribution channels and across our strategies, there are a number of areas where I'm encouraged. First and foremost, target date, we had an excellent year in 2023, we expect another strong year in 2024. January retirement date flows were just shy of $3 billion. We had net flows and target dates in Q4, which is unusual seasonally. They were modest, but nonetheless, first Q4 where we've had positive flows since 2019. But beyond that, whether it's in RPS core market or USI wealth or our individual investment, there are pockets where I think we are beginning to see better trends. So in light of that, I think we're pretty confident that we will have a better year in 2024 than we had in 2023, and I think we'll build momentum throughout the course of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Brown with KBW. Your line is now open.\nMichael Brown: Hi. Great. Thank you for taking my question. Wanted to start with on OHA. How would you characterize the next chapter of the story there, right? So where is the investments around OHA currently, where is the incremental investment dollars going in for that business? And then OCredit has $1.5 billion of investable capital. Can you just give us a view into how the monthly flows have been there and any view you have into perhaps where the flows could progress here in 2024.\nRobert Sharps: Sure. Thank you for the question. Specifically with regard to OCredit, OCredit\u2019s raised over $100 million since the end of September, when we went effective with the SEC and we expect a similar amount throughout the course of Q1 and momentum to build throughout the course of the year as we launch on additional adviser and broker-dealer platforms. I'd say it's a very competitive market for private credit in the wealth channel and nontraded BDCs and the benign credit environment made it difficult to differentiate on performance. But we continue to be very confident that the combination of T. Rowe Price and OHA's home office relationships in the wealth channel, and T. Rowe Price field support, combined with OHA's long-term track record in private credit and relationships with issuers will lead to success with both OCredit and follow-on products. We are hearing from the wealth platforms that they're interested in follow-on products as they build their relationship with T. Rowe Price and OHA and private market alternatives and we're evaluating our alternatives there. Again, if you take a step back with regard to OHA, fee-basis AUM in alternatives for us was up 10% in 2023. They have just under $12 billion in capital commitments that are uninvested at this point. You will see a redemption in January when we report monthly for slightly over $1 billion in the alternatives category. But even despite that, we're pretty confident that we'll see OHA building momentum in 2024, and we expect an acceleration in flows this year. I think it's important to remember that some of the capital raised for OHA in 2023 was for distressed and deployment is trigger-based. So that only will go into flows as it's deployed. But if you look at the underlying performance of OHA strategies, it's very strong. If you look at our pipeline, it's healthy and as strong as it's been since we closed the deal in private credit in particular, and OHA is in the market launching Olin, which is a dedicated senior private lending fund, and that's a part of the market where demand has been strong. It's very early days there, but I would say initially, interest has been encouraging from seed and anchor investors. So collectively, when we look at the contribution from OHA in 2024 and beyond, we're confident that it will build and become more substantial over the course of this year and years to come.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, Rob, Eric. Hope everyone is doing well. My question is on the fixed income flows, which inflected negatively in the quarter. So some of that, I think, was seasonal and related to tax loss harvesting, so not reoccurring, but how should we think about the forward trajectory, especially given the potential for industry rebalancings and duration extensions with Fed rate cuts around the quarter and also record money market AUM on the sidelines?\nRobert Sharps: Yes, Craig, thank you for the question. I think we do anticipate that some of that money comes off the sidelines that it will look to fixed income, given higher rates and better potential for absolute return. I think -- look, I think we're underestimated in terms of our fixed income capabilities. We have a strong fixed income team and a global platform with a number of strategies with good results across plus sectors and in the core, including global multi-sector and QM bond. We're also very focused on launching new vehicles and deepening our go-to-market and sales capabilities in fixed income. With higher rates, offering more attractive total returns, we intend to compete aggressively. Specifically as it relates to Q4 flows, much of what you saw was a sizable redemption in a short duration strategy, and I wouldn't consider that to be predictive of flows going forward. We also have a pretty meaningful stable value and floating rate franchise, which really benefited from the rate environment as people wanted to be short duration and rates were rising in 2022, and we saw the other side of that a little bit in 2023. But as I think about our potential in fixed income, it's an area where we are making investments, and we are intent on growing going forward.\nEric Veiel: I would just simply add, I think Rob covered it well. [indiscernible], who is leading our fixed income team is highly motivated. The team is highly motivated to really emphasize to the market broadly, our capabilities, and I think have put together a plan to do that. And as Rob mentioned, the sectors where I think we have a very strong performance. I would just add to that, to the extent that taxes come back into view for folks as the year winds on, our municipal team is also very strong, and we have some interesting product in that area as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kenneth Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nKenneth Worthington: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Investors domiciled outside the U.S. account for, I think, 8.6% of your business today. Where do you expect that to go -- I'm sorry, first, what portion of your resources are focused outside the U.S? Second, you announced some management changes on the non-U.S. side of the business. Can you flesh out the opportunity there and what you hope the new managers will accomplish? And third, what do you expect for growth in the non-U.S. business versus the U.S over the intermediate term.\nRobert Sharps: Okay. Ken, one more time. The last question was relative growth in EMEA and APAC versus U.S. What were the other 2?\nKenneth Worthington: Yes. The first is what portion of your resources are focused on the non-U.S. business. And you announced some management changes to the non-U.S. business, I think, earlier this week or late last week. What are the opportunities you want those new managers to focus on?\nRobert Sharps: Yes -- from -- I'll take the last one first. We expect relative growth outside of the U.S. to be greater than what it is in the U.S. But the arithmetic of that is not that challenging, given that we have a relatively small base from which that we would need to grow off of. We have a number of focused markets outside of the U.S. both in Asia Pacific and EMEA, and those are the areas where we're really concentrating our resources. Japan, Australia, Germany, Italy, the U.K. and Canada. And we would expect each of those markets to meaningfully outgrow the U.S. over the course of the next several years. In fact, I would say, if you were to look at our flow trends before 2023, we had positive contribution reasonably consistently I think in each year over the last many years from APAC, and I think you'd have to go back a couple of years, but we had several years of positive contribution from EMEA before 2021. In terms of the resources outside of the U.S. I think it's important first to realize that some of those are decked against global investment strategies. So not all of them are specific to AUM raised outside of the U.S. But we have roundly 8,000 associates and about 1,300 of those associates are domiciled outside of the U.S. Again, a number of those people are investment professionals that we are leveraging for global and multiregional strategies. So I think if you're thinking about the profitability of those regions that may not be -- the associated account may not be the right way to look at it. What I will say is that, we are profitable, if you look at our EMEA and our APAC businesses and you look at the revenue from clients domiciled there, and you direct expenses and allocate some other meaningful expenses against those. We are profitable in those areas. And I also think that we've built ahead. So those are areas where we can get some very meaningful leverage off of the existing investments that we've made in distribution, as well as the global investment platform that we've developed.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jennifer, I know you said that the fee rate ex the performance fee would be flat quarter-over-quarter. But is it possible to quantify that impact in dollars? And is it right that those performance fees come from SMAs within OHA and should we think about that just happening in the fourth quarter from time to time?\nJen Dardis: So I think the number I've given in the commentary. Thanks, Brennan, for the question, was $25 million was the amount for Q4. And as you know, OHA has a number of performance-based fees. These are the ones specifically that crystallize in year. And yes, that's typically the kind of accounts it would be. And yes, most of those happened during the fourth quarter, but they can happen through the year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. And our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAlexander Blostein: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. I was hoping you could expand on your buyback commentary, seeing a bit of a pickup, I guess, in the fourth quarter, and I think you alluded to remaining active on share repurchases so far in the first quarter. Given T. Rowe's robust balance sheet and obviously strong cash flow generation, can you just kind of help us frame what the buyback opportunity is for 2024? Thanks.\nRobert Sharps: Sure. Our priorities with regard to capital allocation haven't changed. We want to first and foremost, invest in the company; second, protect and raise the regular dividend and put ourselves in a position to have the flexibility to make appropriate acquisitions as the opportunities present themselves. But we also kind of generate a lot of cash flow and historically have been opportunistic with regard to our share repurchase. I'd say what has changed at the margin last year was that the buyback was more muted given lower free cash flow after the dividend. I think if you think about the order of magnitude for potential over the course of 2024 based on our planning, it's not going to go back to the $1 billion a year or the levels that you saw in years before 2023. But I think we will be opportunistic and we'll take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace to repurchase shares. And over time, I have an objective of taking the share count lower. So I think you could think about the levels of 2023 as a base case, but there are a lot of contingencies and Alex, there could be quite a bit of variability around that. And as you know, we do have a strong balance sheet and kind of given the right opportunity, we certainly would have the potential to outspend cash flow, but that's on our base case.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprus with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just wanted to come back to your commentary on the Retiree Inc. acquisition. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate a bit on the strategic rationale? The opportunity set you see there? How you see this helping enhance the growth profile of T. Rowe? And then more broadly, if you could just comment on how you're thinking about M&A at this point where it could be most additive to T. Rowe. Thank you.\nRobert Sharps: Yes. Specifically, as it relates to Retiree, they have a set of proprietary algorithms that help retirement investors make the transition from accumulation to decumulation and look at optimizing social security elections, as well as which assets to liquidate first and when to take withdrawals from your tax deferred retirement investments. We showed a slide in the supplement with regard to the portion of our AUM that are in defined contribution plans as well as retirement-related overall. And if you think about our individual investor business, one of our strategic initiatives is retirement advisory services. So for our advisory capabilities to be able to incorporate differentiated guidance with regard to how to most tax efficiently support your lifestyle and cash flow needs in retirement, that's value add. And that's really where we've rolled it out initially. Longer term, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity to incorporate it into, for instance, our record-keeping offerings to differentiate the offering for plan sponsors and participants. But also, I think we have a meaningful potential to partner with people in the wealth channel with our intermediary partners. So I think it's very early days for us exploring kind of what the potential is. In terms of our approach to M&A, it's still the same. We're looking for things that add capabilities that make us more important to our clients and that fits strategically and culturally and make financial sense.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Sharp for closing remarks.\nRobert Sharps: All right. Very good. Thank you. Well, thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in T. Rowe Price. As I said at the outset, 2023 was a challenging year for us, but we also made a lot of progress, better investment performance, a lot of advancement with regard to our strategic work to position us for future growth, and that's beginning to translate into results that give us some confidence that we do see better days ahead and have the potential to continue to deliver great value for clients, associates and shareholders. So again, thank you, and good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Robert Sharps",
            "content": "Thank you, Linsley. And thanks to all of you for joining us. Before we get started, I want to share that in late November, Eric was named Head of Global Investments in recognition of his strong leadership, as well as his extensive investment experience. I know he will continue to focus on pursuing superior outcomes for our clients, and both Jen and I congratulate him on his expanded role. Eric will provide today's update on our investment organization, followed by Jen who will cover our financial results. With that, I will turn to 2023 results. While 2023 was a challenging year for us with substantial net outflows, it also brought progress. Investment performance improved, and we advanced important work to ensure our firm is positioned for future growth. We are already seeing a number of early indicators that support our confidence that better days are ahead. We have a long and solid track record of putting clients first and pursuing excellence. As we near our 88th anniversary, I am confident that we will build on this tradition, delivering compelling value for our clients, our associates and our shareholders. As I mentioned, we made meaningful progress against our strategic priorities in 2023. Our active ETF business is gaining traction, with assets under management over $2.7 billion at the end of January. We launched the T. Rowe Price OHA Select Private Credit Fund, or OCREDIT, with over $1.5 billion of investable capital, and are in the early stages of bringing this product to the wealth management channel. We acquired Retiree, Inc. to enhance our ability to expand and retain relationships with pre-retiree and retiree clients by providing tax-aware retirement income and Social Security claiming strategies. This acquisition demonstrates our commitment to broadening and evolving our already strong retirement capabilities and deepens our position as a retirement leader. We partnered with the International Finance Corporation to create the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Blue Economy Bond Strategy, a pioneering blue bond strategy that will focus on private companies operating in emerging markets. We expanded our Capital Appreciation suite with the launch of the T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation and Income Fund for investors seeking an income-oriented fund. We have an industry-leading position in our Target Date franchise, with strong investment performance and net inflows of $13.1 billion last year. Building on this strength, we continue to innovate and add new capabilities, including moving beyond accumulation. The engagement and collaboration among our investment teams got back to what I would characterize as healthy pre-pandemic levels. Our culture thrives on the energy around our teams engaging with corporate management teams, traveling together, and debating risks and opportunities. This is how our investment platform delivers its best for clients. We are evolving as markets and our clients demand more, and we are ready to compete with additional vehicles, new capabilities and new experiences. Leading indicators support our confidence that there will be a slower pace of net outflows this year. We are seeing improved performance in large-cap growth funds and expect that the rebound in 2023 will reduce redemptions in 2024. Key elements of strategic initiatives are delivering. We're seeing improving gross sales in our Individual Investor channel, with Q4 having the highest gross sales of any quarter over the last two years. We saw positive momentum for net flows in our US Wealth Management Platform segment in Q4. And in EMEA, we were recently selected by a large UK wealth management firm to manage a custom multi-asset income fund. Despite a challenging year, our balance sheet remains solid with $2.5 billion of cash and discretionary investments at the end of 2023. We continue to prioritize the dividend, while maintaining ample liquidity to support our seed capital program, opportunistic buybacks and potential M&A. We recently announced a quarterly dividend of $1.24, which increased for the 38th consecutive year. I want to underscore that the progress I've highlighted is a result of our associates commitment to investment excellence, to superb client service and to driving our corporate strategy forward. We are grateful for their hard work, and are confident that together we will return the firm to organic growth. I'll now turn to Eric. Dan. Good morning. Thank you for the question. Our base case for 2024 is that we will have outflows, but we do expect improvement from 2023. First, the investment strategies with the most substantial outflows in 2022 and 2023 had much better performance in 2023, that should translate into lower client redemptions and improve sales over time. And in fact, we are seeing evidence of that already. You're beginning to see improvements in gross sales in some of those strategies. And if you look at our notified terminations or if you look at our at risk, as we go into 2024, I feel like we're in a meaningfully better position than we were going into 2023. I'd point out a handful of other things. One, I think we expect the contribution from OHA and new vehicles, ETFs and SMA to build going forward. I feel like we are beginning to see some momentum build there. And when we combine all of that with some early-stage sales momentum from some of our strategic initiatives, I'm confident that this will be a better year. How much better, I'd say, is to be determined. To some extent, I think it is dependent on continued execution from an investment performance perspective, it's contingent on risk appetites in the marketplace and levels of volatility. It's contingent on some -- more -- greater risk appetite and lengthening time horizons as some of the money on the sidelines reengages and extends time horizons. But as I look across our distribution channels and across our strategies, there are a number of areas where I'm encouraged. First and foremost, target date, we had an excellent year in 2023, we expect another strong year in 2024. January retirement date flows were just shy of $3 billion. We had net flows and target dates in Q4, which is unusual seasonally. They were modest, but nonetheless, first Q4 where we've had positive flows since 2019. But beyond that, whether it's in RPS core market or USI wealth or our individual investment, there are pockets where I think we are beginning to see better trends. So in light of that, I think we're pretty confident that we will have a better year in 2024 than we had in 2023, and I think we'll build momentum throughout the course of the year. Sure. Thank you for the question. Specifically with regard to OCredit, OCredit's raised over $100 million since the end of September, when we went effective with the SEC and we expect a similar amount throughout the course of Q1 and momentum to build throughout the course of the year as we launch on additional adviser and broker-dealer platforms. I'd say it's a very competitive market for private credit in the wealth channel and nontraded BDCs and the benign credit environment made it difficult to differentiate on performance. But we continue to be very confident that the combination of T. Rowe Price and OHA's home office relationships in the wealth channel, and T. Rowe Price field support, combined with OHA's long-term track record in private credit and relationships with issuers will lead to success with both OCredit and follow-on products. We are hearing from the wealth platforms that they're interested in follow-on products as they build their relationship with T. Rowe Price and OHA and private market alternatives and we're evaluating our alternatives there. Again, if you take a step back with regard to OHA, fee-basis AUM in alternatives for us was up 10% in 2023. They have just under $12 billion in capital commitments that are uninvested at this point. You will see a redemption in January when we report monthly for slightly over $1 billion in the alternatives category. But even despite that, we're pretty confident that we'll see OHA building momentum in 2024, and we expect an acceleration in flows this year. I think it's important to remember that some of the capital raised for OHA in 2023 was for distressed and deployment is trigger-based. So that only will go into flows as it's deployed. But if you look at the underlying performance of OHA strategies, it's very strong. If you look at our pipeline, it's healthy and as strong as it's been since we closed the deal in private credit in particular, and OHA is in the market launching Olin, which is a dedicated senior private lending fund, and that's a part of the market where demand has been strong. It's very early days there, but I would say initially, interest has been encouraging from seed and anchor investors. So collectively, when we look at the contribution from OHA in 2024 and beyond, we're confident that it will build and become more substantial over the course of this year and years to come. Yes, Craig, thank you for the question. I think we do anticipate that some of that money comes off the sidelines that it will look to fixed income, given higher rates and better potential for absolute return. I think -- look, I think we're underestimated in terms of our fixed income capabilities. We have a strong fixed income team and a global platform with a number of strategies with good results across plus sectors and in the core, including global multi-sector and QM bond. We're also very focused on launching new vehicles and deepening our go-to-market and sales capabilities in fixed income. With higher rates, offering more attractive total returns, we intend to compete aggressively. Specifically as it relates to Q4 flows, much of what you saw was a sizable redemption in a short duration strategy, and I wouldn't consider that to be predictive of flows going forward. We also have a pretty meaningful stable value and floating rate franchise, which really benefited from the rate environment as people wanted to be short duration and rates were rising in 2022, and we saw the other side of that a little bit in 2023. But as I think about our potential in fixed income, it's an area where we are making investments, and we are intent on growing going forward. Okay. Ken, one more time. The last question was relative growth in EMEA and APAC versus U.S. What were the other 2? Yes -- from -- I'll take the last one first. We expect relative growth outside of the U.S. to be greater than what it is in the U.S. But the arithmetic of that is not that challenging, given that we have a relatively small base from which that we would need to grow off of. We have a number of focused markets outside of the U.S. both in Asia Pacific and EMEA, and those are the areas where we're really concentrating our resources. Japan, Australia, Germany, Italy, the U.K. and Canada. And we would expect each of those markets to meaningfully outgrow the U.S. over the course of the next several years. In fact, I would say, if you were to look at our flow trends before 2023, we had positive contribution reasonably consistently I think in each year over the last many years from APAC, and I think you'd have to go back a couple of years, but we had several years of positive contribution from EMEA before 2021. In terms of the resources outside of the U.S. I think it's important first to realize that some of those are decked against global investment strategies. So not all of them are specific to AUM raised outside of the U.S. But we have roundly 8,000 associates and about 1,300 of those associates are domiciled outside of the U.S. Again, a number of those people are investment professionals that we are leveraging for global and multiregional strategies. So I think if you're thinking about the profitability of those regions that may not be -- the associated account may not be the right way to look at it. What I will say is that, we are profitable, if you look at our EMEA and our APAC businesses and you look at the revenue from clients domiciled there, and you direct expenses and allocate some other meaningful expenses against those. We are profitable in those areas. And I also think that we've built ahead. So those are areas where we can get some very meaningful leverage off of the existing investments that we've made in distribution, as well as the global investment platform that we've developed. Sure. Our priorities with regard to capital allocation haven't changed. We want to first and foremost, invest in the company; second, protect and raise the regular dividend and put ourselves in a position to have the flexibility to make appropriate acquisitions as the opportunities present themselves. But we also kind of generate a lot of cash flow and historically have been opportunistic with regard to our share repurchase. I'd say what has changed at the margin last year was that the buyback was more muted given lower free cash flow after the dividend. I think if you think about the order of magnitude for potential over the course of 2024 based on our planning, it's not going to go back to the $1 billion a year or the levels that you saw in years before 2023. But I think we will be opportunistic and we'll take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace to repurchase shares. And over time, I have an objective of taking the share count lower. So I think you could think about the levels of 2023 as a base case, but there are a lot of contingencies and Alex, there could be quite a bit of variability around that. And as you know, we do have a strong balance sheet and kind of given the right opportunity, we certainly would have the potential to outspend cash flow, but that's on our base case. Yes. Specifically, as it relates to Retiree, they have a set of proprietary algorithms that help retirement investors make the transition from accumulation to decumulation and look at optimizing social security elections, as well as which assets to liquidate first and when to take withdrawals from your tax deferred retirement investments. We showed a slide in the supplement with regard to the portion of our AUM that are in defined contribution plans as well as retirement-related overall. And if you think about our individual investor business, one of our strategic initiatives is retirement advisory services. So for our advisory capabilities to be able to incorporate differentiated guidance with regard to how to most tax efficiently support your lifestyle and cash flow needs in retirement, that's value add. And that's really where we've rolled it out initially. Longer term, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity to incorporate it into, for instance, our record-keeping offerings to differentiate the offering for plan sponsors and participants. But also, I think we have a meaningful potential to partner with people in the wealth channel with our intermediary partners. So I think it's very early days for us exploring kind of what the potential is. In terms of our approach to M&A, it's still the same. We're looking for things that add capabilities that make us more important to our clients and that fits strategically and culturally and make financial sense. All right. Very good. Thank you. Well, thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in T. Rowe Price. As I said at the outset, 2023 was a challenging year for us, but we also made a lot of progress, better investment performance, a lot of advancement with regard to our strategic work to position us for future growth, and that's beginning to translate into results that give us some confidence that we do see better days ahead and have the potential to continue to deliver great value for clients, associates and shareholders. So again, thank you, and good day."

            "content": "Thank you, Rob. After retreating in the third quarter, both equity and fixed-income markets rebounded in the latter part of the fourth quarter, resulting in strong calendar year returns in most indices. Across asset classes, we delivered solid investment performance, with 64% of our funds beating their peer group medians for the year. Strong equity performers included our US Equity Research Fund, Capital Appreciation Fund, and Mid-Cap Value Fund, which are top-quartile performers for the one, three, five, and 10-year time periods. 2023 also marked the 16th year that our Capital Appreciation Fund, managed by David Giroux, beat its Morningstar peer group average, tying the record for the most consecutive calendar years a US equity or multi-asset fund has done so under the same portfolio manager. Our three large-cap growth equity funds all delivered top-quartile one-year performance in 2023, turning around the performance challenges of 2022 that have driven recent outflows. And while over 60% of the return for the Russell 1000 Growth benchmark came from the seven largest names in 2023, our large-cap growth strategies delivered alpha from a much wider set of fundamental investment choices. Strong performance in our Target Date suite continued, with all vintages of both the flagship retirement suite and the newer blend suite beating their peer group medians for the year. Overall, our multi-asset products had a strong year, with just over half of the funds in their top-quartile for the year. Our fixed-income franchise had a solid year, with 60% of the funds beating their peer group medians. Several of our non-investment grade funds, including high-yield, international, low duration and muni funds, were all top-quartile performers for the year. Most notably, Global Multi-Sector Bond Fund was the top performer in its peer group for the year, adding to its five-year and 10-year top-decile performance. Investment performance across our alternatives platform was strong in 2023, with liquid strategies outperforming their benchmarks and private strategies generating attractive absolute performance. I want to share a few highlights about our investment platform. As a fundamental research-driven investment organization, our over 900 investment professionals around the globe adhere to our rigorous investment process and leverage insights generated by our research platform. Over the last 10 years, we've more than doubled the investment professional ranks, including the scale-up for TRPIM and the addition of OHA. We saw very little turnover in the past year, with average portfolio manager tenure at T. Rowe of 17 years. Importantly, as Rob referenced, our team engagement is back to pre-pandemic levels. We conducted over 14,000 due diligence meetings last year. And thanks in large part to our proprietary in-house corporate access capabilities, the majority of these meetings were held in-person. Our analysts and PMs engaged in field research trips, large and small. For example, 48 members of our emerging markets team spent one week traveling across China, digging deep on key topics across the technology, industrial and consumer sectors. The strength of our research platform can be seen in our US equity research strategy, with over 25 TRPA analysts contributing to the portfolio and their focus area of expertise. Their insights delivered for clients. In addition to the top-quartile performance versus peers I mentioned earlier, it has demonstrated its ability to generate alpha over time with less tracking error. We have broadened this approach and now offer a global equity research strategy that leverages the insights of over 75 global analysts. Our investment data insights team, in collaboration with our data science team, is generating ideas and enabling our investment professionals to be more efficient by leveraging capabilities like large language models to improve the delivery of data and insights to our portfolio managers and analysts. Our Research.AI generative AI tool is in beta test with 80 investment professionals, and represents a promising start to what is sure to be a continued investment in this area. We recently established an equity solutions capability that will allow us to deliver customized versions of our fundamental equity investment strategies for large clients, tailored to their specific objectives. This capability builds upon the strong success of our integrated equity team, which combines fundamental and systematic processes and has demonstrated strong results across a wide variety of strategies, including US Small-Cap Growth, US SMID Cap Core, Large-Cap Value, and Global Core. And our ESG teams continue to help our portfolio managers make informed decisions by understanding the risks and opportunities related to ESG and how they may impact the company's performance. We are also responding to client demand and developing new products, like the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Blue Economy Bond Strategy that Rob mentioned. Pursuing excellent investment performance for our clients remains our top priority. The depth and breadth of our investment platform, which is rooted in our three pillars of people, process, and culture, gives us the tools to be able to do so. I'll now turn it over to Jen to cover our financials. I would just simply add, I think Rob covered it well. [indiscernible], who is leading our fixed income team is highly motivated. The team is highly motivated to really emphasize to the market broadly, our capabilities, and I think have put together a plan to do that. And as Rob mentioned, the sectors where I think we have a very strong performance. I would just add to that, to the extent that taxes come back into view for folks as the year winds on, our municipal team is also very strong, and we have some interesting product in that area as well."

            "name": "Jen Dardis",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. I'll review our financial results and then we will open the line for questions. Our adjusted earnings per share for Q4 2023 was $1.72, bringing us to $7.59 for the year. 2023 was down from $8.02 in 2022 from lower average AUM and investment advisory revenue and higher expenses. We had $28.3 billion in net outflows this quarter, bringing full year outflows to $81.8 billion. During the fourth quarter, we had a handful of large redemptions in our sub-advisory and institutional channels that elevated net outflows. From an asset class perspective, US Equity continues to be the main driver of net outflows. In our DC channels, Stable Value posted sizable net outflows in 2023 after delivering strong positive net flows in 2022, a sign that retirement investors may be seeking higher yield or reorienting toward a risk appetite. We are seeing encouraging signs in our smaller ticket retail business, with improving net flows in both our direct and intermediary channels. Our Target Date suite ended the year with $13.1 billion of positive net flows, and Alternatives also posted positive flows for the year. Additional detail on Alternatives' flows can be found on page 20 of the annual version of our supplemental materials. There are also some signs of strength across our individual equity and fixed-income products, with Capital Appreciation, All-Cap Opportunities, International Core, and Global Multi-Sector Bond all delivering over $1 billion in positive net flows in 2023. Looking at our income statement. Q4 adjusted net revenues were $1.7 billion for the quarter, bringing our full year adjusted total revenue to $6.5 billion. Our Q4 investment advisory revenue of about $1.5 billion was higher than Q4 of last year, but the $5.7 billion earned for the full year was lower than 2022 overall based on the trend in average assets. Our effective fee rate of 42.2 basis points in Q4 was up due to a little over $25 million in performance-based fees predominantly on Alternatives products that crystallized in the fourth quarter. Without these performance-based fees, our Q4 effective fee rate would have been more in line with the Q3 2023 fee rate. Turning to expenses. Q4 adjusted operating expenses were $1.2 billion. As I mentioned last quarter, Q4 included higher expenses compared to Q3, related to seasonal advertising and promotion, stock-based compensation and professional fees. As equity markets improved in 2023, we increased the investment in our brands to support future growth. Q3 2023 also included a non-recurring benefit in G&A expenses. Full-year 2023 adjusted operating expenses, excluding the carried interest expense, were $4.19 billion, up 3% over 2022's $4.07 billion, and within the previously provided 2023 guidance range of 2% to 4%. Based on average market conditions over the last quarter, we expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses, excluding carried interest expense, to be up 3% to 5% over 2023's $4.19 billion. This is up slightly from previously provided 2024 guidance due to the increase in equity markets and the impact this is expected to have on our market-driven expenses in 2024. We anticipate the 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 26%, reflecting lower expected valuation allowances related to our UK-based business, and a lower state tax rate associated with income apportionment rules in certain jurisdictions. Despite a challenging year, we remain committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and returning capital to stockholders. We bought back $103 million worth of shares during the fourth quarter, bringing 2023 total buybacks to $254 million. And we've continued to buy back shares during the start of 2024. As Rob mentioned, last week we announced a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share, a $0.02 per share increase. Between the dividend and buybacks, we've returned $1.38 billion to stockholders over the course of 2023, while also increasing our cash position over $300 million from the end of 2022. This strong financial position allows us continued flexibility to support the annual dividend and to pursue opportunistic share buybacks, while also strategically investing in seed capital or M&A as opportunities arise. We remain focused on proactively managing our expenses to allow for the continued investment in our strategic priorities while ensuring our cost structure is appropriate for the size and scale of the firm. This financial discipline, along with our commitment to efficiency and process improvement, positions us to fund our future growth through modest increases in expenses and the reallocation of existing expenditures. With that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions. So I think the number I've given in the commentary. Thanks, Brennan, for the question, was $25 million was the amount for Q4. And as you know, OHA has a number of performance-based fees. These are the ones specifically that crystallize in year. And yes, that's typically the kind of accounts it would be. And yes, most of those happened during the fourth quarter, but they can happen through the year."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer period. I will give you instructions on how to ask questions at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded, and will be available for replay on T. Rowe Price's website shortly after the call concludes.

Now, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRobert Sharps: Thank you, Linsley, and thank you all for joining us today. Third quarter trends were largely similar to what we experienced earlier in the year. Relative investment performance was solid and particularly strong in our largest franchises. We made progress on our strategic initiatives and we executed on planned cost savings efforts. At the same time, we haven't seen any improvement in net flows and don't expect to for the balance of the year. That said, we do expect flow trends to recover somewhat in 2024 as improved performance takes the pressure off of redemptions from US large cap equity products. Investors come off the sidelines, and we realize the impact of our strategic investments. Turning now to investment performance. As you know, most equity and fixed income markets fell in the third quarter as investors grew increasingly concerned about a prolonged period of higher interest rates. During these choppy markets, we posted another quarter of solid investment performance relative to peers, particularly in many of our US equity and multi-asset strategies.  Our US equity products were resilient with more than 70% of the mutual funds outperforming their peer group medians. All three of our large cap growth products were above the median and beat their benchmarks in the quarter and each have top quartile performance for the year-to-date time period. Other strong performers in our US equity range included all cap opportunities, US large cap core and science and technology, which all had top quartile performance versus peers for the quarter, adding to their solid multi-year track records. International equity products continued to have solid long-term relative peer results, despite losing some ground during the quarter. We launched five new active ETFs in June, and our four active US equity ETFs got off to a strong start with all beating their benchmarks in the first full quarter since launching. Our capital appreciation fund continues to deliver consistent outperformance relative to peers and is in the top decile versus peers in the 1, 3, 5, and 10-year time periods. Our target date products added another strong quarter, largely driven by our active security selection and differentiated portfolio construction. All vintages of the flagship retirement funds were in the top quartile versus peers, adding to their strong long-term track record. Fixed income performance was solid with over 60% of our mutual funds outperforming their peer group medians. Topping the list were our Dynamic Credit Bond Fund, which was recently added to our target date building blocks and the Global High Income Bond Fund, both of which were top decile performers in the quarter. Alternative strategies generated solid absolute and relative performance during the quarter with strong results in private market strategies. OHA liquid credit strategies outperformed their benchmarks as well. While I'm encouraged by improvements in our investment performance, as I mentioned at the outset, we continue to see net outflows. Third quarter flows and negative $17.4 billion were largely consistent with recent levels. The asset class trends remain the same, with US large cap equity accounting for a majority of the net outflows. Looking ahead, we expect fourth quarter flows to be worse than recent trends with further weakness concentrated in November and December. Our forecast considers that December has been particularly weak over the last few years, and reflects notified terminations and redemptions, including those related to a handful of large sub-advisory mandates. We continue to proactively manage expenses to create a cost structure appropriate for the size and scale of the firm today and to allow for continued investment in our strategic priorities. Jen will talk more about these expense efforts in a moment. But first, I'd like to highlight a few of our accomplishments during the quarter. We launched our first joint investment offering with OHA, the T. Rowe Price OHA select Private Credit Fund, offered as a non-traded perpetual life business development company or BDC structure. We are focused on building a durable and repeatable process to deliver alternative investments to the wealth management channel. OCredit launched with $1.5 billion of investable capital, making it one of the industry's largest non-traded BDC launches. This includes over $600 million raised in equity commitments from T. Rowe Price in a group of global institutional investors in addition to $875 million in credit facility commitments. Our ETF franchise is expanding with AUM totaling $1.7 billion as of September 30. Our new capital appreciation equity ETF, or TCAP, has attracted strong interest since launching in June with over $190 million in net flows and placement with 12 broker/dealer clients. In the third quarter, associates in London moved to our new office in Warwick Court on Pattern Oster Square, and we marked the end of exterior construction of our new global headquarters at Harbor Point in Baltimore, Maryland, with a ceremonial beam signing. Both offices are an investment in the associate experience and have been designed to foster collaboration, a cornerstone of our culture. It's our culture and the dedication and hard work of our associates that are driving our progress on our path to return the firm to organic growth. We have some of the best talent in the industry, and we're squarely focused on delivering consistently strong long-term investment performance and world-class service for our clients, sustaining our culture of excellence and collaboration and carefully managing our financial results through this environment. I'm grateful to our teams for keeping our clients at the center of all we do. I'll now turn to Jen to cover our financial results for the quarter.\nJen Dardis: Thank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. I'll review our financial results, and then we will open the line for questions. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 for Q3 2023 was up from $2.02 in Q2 2023, driven by higher investment advisory revenues and higher carried interest-related income. A decline in markets following a peak at the end of July, led to Q3 end-of-period AUM of $1.35 trillion, down 3.8% from Q2. But our Q3 average AUM of $1.4 trillion was 2.7% higher than Q2 and 3.4% higher than Q3 2022, driving the higher investment advisory revenues this quarter. As Rob mentioned, we had $17.4 billion in net outflows for the quarter, including a previously disclosed sub-advisory mandate termination in August. Consistent with last quarter, our three US large cap growth equity strategies drove the majority of the net outflows. Outflows from equity products were partially offset with inflows in our multi-asset fixed income and alternative asset classes, and our Asia-Pacific business posted positive flows for the quarter as well. Within multi-asset, target date net inflows were $2.9 billion for the quarter, bringing year-to-date inflows to $12.8 billion. When thinking about the rest of the year, keep in mind, we historically have seen some plan-driven seasonality in the DC channel with some plans departing in December and new ones onboarding in January. Other highlights from the quarter included net inflows into capital appreciation, all cap opportunities equity, international core equity and blended emerging market bond. In September, we reopened our international small-cap equity and our high-yield bond strategies to new clients, which we expect will support future sales. Both strategies have solid long-term performance track records. Turning to the income statement, Q3 adjusted net revenues were nearly $1.7 billion, including over $1.4 billion in investment advisory revenue. Our annualized effective fee rate was 41.7 basis points in Q3 2023, down from 42.3% in Q2. The effective fee rate decrease is primarily driven by the timing of performance based fee earnings on certain equity and alternative products that were realized in Q2, along with mix shift towards lower fee asset classes and vehicles. Q3 adjusted net revenues also included over $90 million in accrued carried interest related revenue, reflecting strong absolute and relative performance in those alternative products with carried interest paying structures. This was a higher level of carried interest related revenue than previous quarters, and this will likely continue to vary widely quarter-to-quarter, in line with absolute and relative returns in the products. Our adjusted operating expenses were nearly $1.1 billion, up a little over 3% from both Q2 2023 and Q3 2022. The Q3 included severance costs related to our July reduction in force and higher carried interest related expense, partially offset by a non-recurring benefit in G&A. For full year 2023, we are narrowing our guidance range for adjusted operating expense, excluding the carried interest related compensation to be 2% to 4% over the comparable full year 2022 amount of nearly $4.1 billion. With adjusted operating expense growth, excluding carried interest compensation of just under 1% year-to-date, we do expect higher expenses in a few categories in Q4, several of which are seasonal or timing related so will not fully carry forward into 2024. Specifically, we expect G&A to be higher than typical run rate as we have higher professional fee spend in Q4 that spilled over from Q3. Stock-based compensation is typically higher in Q4 as our annual grant date falls in December. Advertising and promotion is also typically highest in Q4 to support seasonal campaigns. And finally, we will realize a full quarter of higher technology, occupancy and facilities costs related to our new London location. As we mentioned last quarter, we have been focused on managing our expense growth and driving efficiency to allow us to continue to invest in the strategic initiatives that we believe will result in future growth. As part of this effort and in light of our hybrid working environment, we have been reviewing our real estate usage with the dual goals of enhancing in-person collaboration and reducing real estate costs. As a result of this review, we made the decision to consolidate associates at our Owings Mills, Maryland campus into four buildings down from six and to reduce the amount of space occupied in our Colorado Springs buildings by year-end. This is a change in office configuration, not a change in location or workforce strategy. We have also been focused on enhancing our business, data and technology architecture to ensure we have the foundational support to underpin our strategic initiatives and drive efficiency going forward. As we shared last quarter, our cost savings efforts over the last 12 months have removed or reallocated over $200 million in operating expenses versus the run rate for 2024. We continue to expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses, excluding carried interest compensation will grow in the low single digit range. This growth rate will depend on final 2023 adjusted operating expense levels. And as always, this estimated growth rate is based on current market levels, and we may choose to adjust it if markets rise or fall significantly. Spending a moment on capital management. We repurchased over 977,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of about $108 for a total of $106 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased a little under 1.4 million shares for just over $150 million. As of September 30, we had 223.5 million shares outstanding. Our recurring dividend remains a top priority. Through buybacks and dividends year-to-date, we have returned about $992 million to stockholders while maintaining ample liquidity to support our seed capital program, opportunistic share buybacks and potential M&A. As we complete the year and plan for 2024, we will continue to invest in our strategic priorities to pursue excellent investment performance and client service and to drive growth over time. We are also executing on our plans to reduce costs to fund these initiatives and maintain a low single digit expense growth into 2024. While flows will remain challenged through the fourth quarter, we are confident that we will start to see the benefits of these efforts in 2024. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. So maybe starting on the last point, Jen, just made and Rob, you alluded to that as well earlier around confidence and improvement flows into 2024. Can you spend a minute on maybe some of the key strategies and initiatives you expect to contribute to flows in 2024 that will start to move the needle? I'm not sure if it's ETFs or the private credit strategy. So anything you can help us to better frame the opportunities that you see for next year? Thanks.\nRobert Sharps: Yeah. Alex, good morning. And thank you for the question. Look, I did note in the prepared remarks that we expect November and December to have elevated outflows. And November, in particular, is impacted by a single large mandate. December should be consistent with what we've seen in December for the last couple of years. So I do think it's logical to ask given that weakness, why are we confident that outflows should be lower next year. And the first thing I would say is that we're already seeing some year-over-year improvement in flows in certain channels. In particular, channels that tend to respond a little more quickly to changes in performance. And that's despite what I would characterize as a pretty challenging industry backdrop. That is specific -- that improvement -- I'd say you can point to a number of areas. If you just look at trends in Q3, we had just under $3 billion of inflows in the retirement date funds and gross sales up 10% year-over-year. We have positive flows in fixed income, multi-asset broadly and alternatives. You mentioned ETFs. We had our best quarter for ETF sales. It's still small in building. I think it can be a contributor in 2024, but I don't think it will be the most meaningful driver of performance or improvement in flows. I think the most meaningful driver will be one, I think if some of the money on the sidelines from an industry perspective extends their time horizon or risk appetite, and you have more flows in equities broadly. Two, I think a broadening of performance in the US equity market would be helpful for active relative to passive. Three, ultimately, the longer term performance numbers as they flow through will really begin to impact flows. And four, we've highlighted a number of different strategic initiatives that we're working on. Alternatives being one of them. So we do think that OCredit will contribute next year. But in the overall scale of our organization, I wouldn't necessarily say that I think either OCredit or ETF will be a predominant driver of improved flows. I think they'll be additive. But we're going to have to see improvement in the core asset classes and in the core channels to really have 2024 kind of be a better picture with regard to flows than 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is now open. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, Rob, Eric. Hope everyone is doing well. We have a question on another flow question, but focusing more on the redemption side of the equation. Most of your key equity flagship funds, and we're looking at blue-chip gross stock and mid-cap growth, they generated very strong performance over the last 12 months. And you're actually seeing this translate into month-over-month improvement in the flows from June to September. So my question is, how is this impacting client discussions, the better 12-month numbers? And if you strip out the large institutional sub-advisory redemptions that you're expecting at year-end, why can't this lead to continued monthly net flow improvement in 2024?\nRobertSharps: Sure, Craig. Nice to hear your voice, and good morning. I would say a couple of things as it relates to these strategies. First of all, we're definitely encouraged by the improved performance over the year-to-date period. And we're encouraged because it's come broadly and it's come with the support of really strong performance from our underlying research platform. Our analyst managed portfolio had a really strong year and continues to support our overall performance, which is key to what we do. A client conversations vary -- a lot depending upon the type of clients. As you know, we're in basically every channel, every geography around the world with these strategies. What we're seeing as it relates to flows, as you discussed, those channels that tend to respond more quickly to performance, we are starting to see some better numbers. But we have to continue to deliver the performance that we delivered year-to-date, over continued time periods because we will see eventually the one, the three and the five get better as we do that and more and more channels are focused on those three and those five. So we're encouraged in the short-term, but we are far from complacent about it and recognize that we still have many more quarters and years of strong performance to deliver to get those three and five-year numbers where we want them to be.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for your next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, everyone. You mentioned kind of a few chunky sub-advisory losses that have been announced over the last couple of months. So could you frame the AUM base specifically exposed to that particular issue and more broadly frame the risk that this is becoming a more regular trend?\nRobertSharps: I'll start and then Jen or Eric can add any perspective. Look, our sub-advisory business is broad. We have sub-advisory opportunities in the wealth channel, and we have a meaningful variable annuity sub-advisory business. The variable annuity sub-advisory business over time is likely to be under more pressure. In terms of sizing it, it is meaningful, but kind of well less than 10% of our overall book. Overall, sub-advisory is a very, very good business for us and a business that we are committed to. We think it's a channel that values our brand. We think it's a channel that values performance. We do see some additional opportunity over the long-term in sub-advisory, particularly in the wealth channel, but we don't anticipate that there'll be much opportunity for growth outside of perhaps consolidating some market share, which is really dependent on very good service, as well as excellent performance in that VA channel.\nOperator: Thank you.\nRobert Sharps: Yeah. I would note quickly with regard to the VA channel, the challenges in the VA channel, something that we've navigated for a very long period of time. So that's not something that's new or specific to the elevated outflows this year. It may be in a particular month or a particular quarter. But it's a part of the book that we've navigated some pressure over a relatively long period of time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one on the investment process, good to see the improved performance. But if you can comment on -- have there been any major changes to how you incorporate ESG risks? I know that's something that's been -- you've been working on for several years, particularly this year, and given the political backlash against ESG, is that changing how you incorporate that into the investment process?  And then similarly, what are you hearing from distribution partners in terms of demand for either ESG products or the inclusion within the investment process. Particularly, I know in Europe, it was -- it has always been table stakes there. Are you seeing any change in the institutional demand in Europe?\nRobert Sharps: Yeah. Hi, Brian. Very good question. Look, we incorporate ESG into our investment decision-making process consistently and we don't let near-term or long-term political issues affect it. Our process is very much based on using insights generated by our fundamental analysts are using our fixed income team, using our responsible investing team. And what the RI team specifically does it helps our portfolio managers and analysts identify risks and opportunities understand the parts of the company's long-term strategy that could be materially affected by changes across ESoG and then incorporating that into our investment decision-making process. So it is not affected by short-term political wins, and it leads us to better outcomes for our clients in all environments. In terms of demand, the ESG set broadly defined still grew in 2023. And across the channels geographically. If you look at EMEA, APAC and even North America, if you exclude one very large reallocation that was done by a competitor firm within their retirement set. So we still think that there's commercial opportunity here and we work with clients to meet them where they want to be. We have the capabilities to do that across fixed income and equities. And we feel really good about that -- the capability that we've built over many years.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. You seem to have critical mass in your active ETF offering with the recent launches. A couple of questions here. One, can you talk about how you're marketing the ETFs and what resources you're dedicating here? Maybe second, where is distribution today versus your goals? And then the bigger picture question is certain active managers like a JPMorgan have been particularly successful in taking in pretty significant assets into relatively new active equity ETF offerings. Do you see a path forward for similar success at T. Rowe or is there something fundamentally different with your approach and others that you're seeing in the industry?\nEric Veiel: Yeah. Hey, Ken. This is Eric. I'll start, and then Rob or Jen may want to come in as well. The way we've approached this market has been, I think, a very thoughtful one. As you know, we started first with five semitransparent active ETFs, which were clones of existing strategies that we're well known for. We then added five fixed income fully transparent ETFs and then this year launched five fully transparent active equity ETFs. Our approach to marketing these is to target the channels where we think that there's the most uptake for the improved structure that the ETF offers, especially for taxable accounts. So that would be ideally the US wealth channel. And within that, the RIA channels as well as now we're starting to gain some traction on the larger broker/dealers as we get to our 12-month track records across this different suite. In the case of TCAF, because the capital appreciation strategy and the portfolio manager, David Drew, are quite well known. We've been able to accelerate some of the placements with that specific strategy. We've also backed this with targeted marketing campaigns and some dedicated sales function as well. So we feel good about the approach that we're taking. And I think long-term, over the next, call it, three to five-plus years, there's no reason why this can't be a very large and important business for us, and I think we'll grow meaningfully. I'm not going to comment about how we'll do versus other specific competitors. I'm very comfortable with the approach that we're taking, and I'm bullish on our long-term prospects here.\nRobert Sharps: I would just add quickly, we do think there's a big opportunity for active ETFs in the wealth channel. We do have some ETF specialists that support our regional investment consultants and home office teams that engage with our broker/dealer and advisory clients. We think there's a big opportunity given our multi-asset capabilities in models over time to use our ETFs as components of those underlying models. And I do think longer term, given the of the traits of the ETF vehicle that there will be more for us to do with regard to evaluating opportunities where we can deliver our unique investment capabilities and address needs that clients have. So I think I'm encouraged that we're making some progress, but I do think we've got much more to do here.\nJenDardis: I'd also add. I think thematically, as Eric talked about ESG and being able to be a point we can talk with clients about their needs and meeting where they are, ETFs are similar in the sense it's another capability where we can have conversations with clients about where they have gaps in their lineups and how we can meet those with the capabilities that we can develop, given the suite of products we already have.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you spoke to a 4Q uplift in some expenses. So it would be helpful if you can maybe size that versus the 1% year-to-date expense growth next to the carry, you also said that it's seasonal and shouldn't carry it in 2024. So just hoping to clarify, are you saying that you don't expect a seasonal uplift in 4Q 2024 from similar items because of your expense efforts? Or were you just saying that it won't carry into the first quarter? Thanks.\nJen Dardis: Sure. So from an overall perspective, that's what we tried to give the 2% to 4% range for the full year to give you a sense for what the fourth quarter would be to fill in against the actuals through the first three quarters. And then with regard to the seasonal items, some are seasonal and would be similar in fourth quarter this year and fourth quarter next year, some are more one-time in nature. But the comment that you made about carrying over into Q1, certainly things that are seasonal in Q4, we would expect it wouldn't go into the Q1 number. Just to dimensionalize it, first of all, we mentioned a one-time item. This was an operating item that we mentioned was a recovery of prior period costs. That's about $20 million, so you would expect that would not recur and then that benefit would not recur. And then the other items are a little bit more evenly split in terms of an increase in professional fees the long-term incentive plans. This is the stock-based compensation, and we have retirement vesting that are recognized in December when we do those grants. So that creates a pop every quarter, every fourth quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just a question on retail SMAs. I was hoping you could update us on the traction that you're seeing in your approach to the marketplace there with retail SMAs? And how much is it contributing to flows today. Maybe you can just remind us how many strategies you currently offer in SMAs and where you'd like to see that in three years and some of the hurdles you guys may have to overcome so you kind of want to bring more to the marketplace, particularly over on the fixed income side?\nRobert Sharps: Yeah. Brendan, this is an important element of our strategic initiative with regard to US wealth. And we've worked pretty hard to bring a broader number of strategies to market. Today, we are over 20% in terms of the number of investment strategies that we offer in retail SMA, and we are getting traction as we broaden the availability and broaden our offering. It's going to take some time. This is a part of the market where manager rosters and lineups are, in many instances, reasonably well established. I do think that many of our wealth partners want T. Rowe Price strategies available in SMA and are looking for opportunities for us to get new placements. We have seen a number of new placements this year. So it is a focus. Jen, any specifics with regard to AUA or flows that we share?\nJen Dardis: No. There hasn't been. It's not a significant number in the flows at this point. Again, I think this is part of an overall plan. If you think about the wealth strategy that we've been talking about for the last year. Newer vehicles are part of that broader plan and some clients prefer ETF just based on their clients and how they buy, some prefer SMAs and obviously, some platforms still have a fairly large mutual fund complex. And so as we think about being able to provide our products for clients, we want to just make sure we have that broad suite of vehicles available for whatever type of clients that are buying from them.\nRobert Sharps: Yeah. With regard to specific successes or launches this year, we did bring a muni SMA that was developed specifically for a single distribution partner. We also launched earlier this year two additional equity SMAs, US all-cap opportunities and global focused growth. As I said, this continues to be a big opportunity. I think we disclosed an AUA number that is roundly $10 billion. But you have to remember that, that includes not only model account submission in retail SMA, but also where we do glide path advisory and custom target date funds. So that wouldn't all be the sort of SMA that you're necessarily referring to or that we're talking about in terms of addressing the channel -- the opportunity in the wealth channel.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for your next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. I guess, straightforward one. Target date allocations to you all have normally or traditionally been very long equity. It's helped you have great performance, your flows are great, kind of no complaints. But I'm curious if you've made or contemplated making any shifts in allocation given the rise in yields and flows into fixed income. Just curious how you're thinking about that as the world has obviously shifted some? Thanks.\nRobert Sharps: Yeah. Glenn, maybe less straightforward than you think. First, we offer our flagship series, which is a higher equity glide path. We also offer a target series which is a lower equity glide path for those clients whose participant base has a lower risk tolerance or for clients that prefer that as part of their overall plan design. That's the first point I would make. The second point I would make is that while the strategic portfolio design determines the equity allocation at a certain point along the glide path, we also have the ability to make tactical allocations to asset classes and underlying building blocks. And we've actually been underweight equities over the course of this year from a tactical asset allocation perspective. So our asset allocation committee has the flexibility to -- within bands, reallocate funds along that glide path.  I also would say that within our equity allocation, there are building blocks that are more or less conservative, and we've worked on developing and introducing a hedged equity component that ultimately has a little less equity beta. Finally, I would point out that in Q3, while the markets were down, we had excellent performance within our target date series across low and high equity glide path and across vintages and that was driven -- at the margin a little bit by that underweight of equities, but I would say more so by the strategic portfolio design in some of the building blocks that we have in fixed income and just very strong security selection in the underlying strategies. So beneath the surface, there's a lot going on there. You're right that philosophically, we do believe, particularly for longer dated vintages that a high equity component is really important. But there are other ways to drive value in terms of the strategic portfolio design and the building blocks, the tactical asset allocation and the security selection of the underlying portfolios. And so far this year, I think we've been hitting on all cylinders.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the target date franchise. I think, Rob, you mentioned gross sales were up 10% year-over-year. And then, Jen, you also mentioned some of the year-end dynamics that sometimes happens with plan sponsors. And so I was hoping to talk about the near-term opportunity associated with some of the strong performance you just highlighted and what that means for gross sales. But also maybe longer term, as you think about the passive dynamic within this asset class or this channel and ultimately, how conversations are happening with plan sponsors and how you think that develops over the next kind of 12 months?\nRobert Sharps: Yeah. Dan, thank you for the question. Look, we feel like our flagship retirement date funds are the best offering in the business. If you look at the strategic portfolio design, if you look at the underlying building blocks, a number of alpha rich diversifiers in there, areas like bank loan, areas like high yield. It's been a big focus for us. We made a substantial investment in 2021 in the competitiveness of our fees. And we also have a broad range. For those plans that are particularly fee sensitive, we have a blend series that does use passive in US -- in large cap US equity and in core fixed income. So we really believe we have a great value proposition to take on passive. And I think if you look at the performance of the T. Rowe Price fund, whether it's the flagship or whether it's blend and you compare that to passive, I think the numbers really stand for themselves. It's an important area for us. It's an area that we dedicate specific marketing dollars and support to and it's an area where we have momentum right now.  We have record flows on a year-to-date basis in the target date franchise. There are always some planned dynamics around year-end, where you might have a plan that's terminated oftentimes, new ones on board in January. So I'm not going to comment on -- and sometimes there's not even a lot of visibility as you go into year-end with regard to whether or not something kind of either going out or coming in will land in December or land in January. But if you take the longer view, we feel really good about the value proposition. We feel really good about our momentum. It feels like our retirement date franchise as a whole is really resonating in the marketplace, and we're excited to carry that momentum forward into 2024.\nJen Dardis: I think we've talked in previous times. If you think about the flows into target dates, there are two components. There's the participant flows that go in that are kind of more regular. These are the paycheck additions or distributions for people who are in retirement those don't add significantly to the balances year-end and throughout the year. But -- so when you see the flows into target dates on a net basis, those are actual new plan wins typically. And so when we talk about pressure at year-end. That's about plan changes, not about participant changes. And so this is a good sign for us as we look at positive flows that we're continuing to add new plans to the stable of clients that we have.\nOperator: Thank you. I actually have 1 more question. One moment please for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nFinian O'Shea: Hey, everyone. Good morning. Thanks so much. A question for OCredit. Can you give an update on your progress with distribution partners and maybe how you're seeing monthly or quarterly sales starting out in the context of what the industry is doing? And then maybe how do you consider the puts and takes in rolling out additional direct lending vehicles for retail in the registered fund format? Thank you.\nRobert Sharps: Yeah. Finian, thank you for the question. Okay. In terms of trends, we actually just reached effectiveness at the end of the third quarter. So this is really our first month. And our current focus is on building a wide distribution syndicate of wealth platforms by leveraging our strong existing relationships in the wealth channel. So we have regional investment consultants in the field that have relationships with brokers and advisers. We've got the home office relationships, and we're really just getting started. I think what we've heard is that the combination of OHA's 30-year history of delivering great performance in alternative credit and T. Rowe Price's presence in the wealth channel and resources in the wealth channel should be pretty powerful. Before we worry about kind of thinking about what we're going to do next, I think we're really, really focused on executing with regard to OCredit. We think it is a very well-designed, excellent value proposition in a way to bring the OHA capabilities to the wealth channel. We will, in time, think about what our product pipeline is and kind of ultimately, I think, build on the success of this with follow-on offerings and we'll engage with our wealth clients to see where there are opportunities to do some things that are unique and it will be in demand. We -- as we go out, we do have a handful of top advisory platforms that we're launching on in Q4 and have some visibility with regard to launch -- with regard to other partners as we get into early 2024. So for now, we're really excited about OCredit. I'd say much too early to comment on kind of monthly flows, but we're encouraged by the platforms that we're launching on. And our team will be working hard on what the right follow-on will be in this marketplace, but it will be some time until our focus pivots from being really successful with OCredit to what the next offering will be.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Rob Sharps for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nRobert Sharps: All right. Very good. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in T. Rowe Price. As we've talked about, our investment performance continued to show signs of strength this quarter, particularly in our largest franchises. Our associates are working hard to make progress on our strategic initiatives, and we're very, very focused on executing against our cost-saving efforts. While we continue to face elevated net outflows, we are very optimistic that the flow picture will improve in 2024. And I'm very confident in the work our associates are doing and our plan to make progress toward returning to organic growth. Really appreciate the dedication and hard work of our associates, and that's kind of really what's behind that progress. So thank you again.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Sharps",
            "content": "Thank you, Linsley, and thank you all for joining us today. Third quarter trends were largely similar to what we experienced earlier in the year. Relative investment performance was solid and particularly strong in our largest franchises. We made progress on our strategic initiatives and we executed on planned cost savings efforts. At the same time, we haven't seen any improvement in net flows and don't expect to for the balance of the year. That said, we do expect flow trends to recover somewhat in 2024 as improved performance takes the pressure off of redemptions from US large cap equity products. Investors come off the sidelines, and we realize the impact of our strategic investments. Turning now to investment performance. As you know, most equity and fixed income markets fell in the third quarter as investors grew increasingly concerned about a prolonged period of higher interest rates. During these choppy markets, we posted another quarter of solid investment performance relative to peers, particularly in many of our US equity and multi-asset strategies.  Our US equity products were resilient with more than 70% of the mutual funds outperforming their peer group medians. All three of our large cap growth products were above the median and beat their benchmarks in the quarter and each have top quartile performance for the year-to-date time period. Other strong performers in our US equity range included all cap opportunities, US large cap core and science and technology, which all had top quartile performance versus peers for the quarter, adding to their solid multi-year track records. International equity products continued to have solid long-term relative peer results, despite losing some ground during the quarter. We launched five new active ETFs in June, and our four active US equity ETFs got off to a strong start with all beating their benchmarks in the first full quarter since launching. Our capital appreciation fund continues to deliver consistent outperformance relative to peers and is in the top decile versus peers in the 1, 3, 5, and 10-year time periods. Our target date products added another strong quarter, largely driven by our active security selection and differentiated portfolio construction. All vintages of the flagship retirement funds were in the top quartile versus peers, adding to their strong long-term track record. Fixed income performance was solid with over 60% of our mutual funds outperforming their peer group medians. Topping the list were our Dynamic Credit Bond Fund, which was recently added to our target date building blocks and the Global High Income Bond Fund, both of which were top decile performers in the quarter. Alternative strategies generated solid absolute and relative performance during the quarter with strong results in private market strategies. OHA liquid credit strategies outperformed their benchmarks as well. While I'm encouraged by improvements in our investment performance, as I mentioned at the outset, we continue to see net outflows. Third quarter flows and negative $17.4 billion were largely consistent with recent levels. The asset class trends remain the same, with US large cap equity accounting for a majority of the net outflows. Looking ahead, we expect fourth quarter flows to be worse than recent trends with further weakness concentrated in November and December. Our forecast considers that December has been particularly weak over the last few years, and reflects notified terminations and redemptions, including those related to a handful of large sub-advisory mandates. We continue to proactively manage expenses to create a cost structure appropriate for the size and scale of the firm today and to allow for continued investment in our strategic priorities. Jen will talk more about these expense efforts in a moment. But first, I'd like to highlight a few of our accomplishments during the quarter. We launched our first joint investment offering with OHA, the T. Rowe Price OHA select Private Credit Fund, offered as a non-traded perpetual life business development company or BDC structure. We are focused on building a durable and repeatable process to deliver alternative investments to the wealth management channel. OCredit launched with $1.5 billion of investable capital, making it one of the industry's largest non-traded BDC launches. This includes over $600 million raised in equity commitments from T. Rowe Price in a group of global institutional investors in addition to $875 million in credit facility commitments. Our ETF franchise is expanding with AUM totaling $1.7 billion as of September 30. Our new capital appreciation equity ETF, or TCAP, has attracted strong interest since launching in June with over $190 million in net flows and placement with 12 broker/dealer clients. In the third quarter, associates in London moved to our new office in Warwick Court on Pattern Oster Square, and we marked the end of exterior construction of our new global headquarters at Harbor Point in Baltimore, Maryland, with a ceremonial beam signing. Both offices are an investment in the associate experience and have been designed to foster collaboration, a cornerstone of our culture. It's our culture and the dedication and hard work of our associates that are driving our progress on our path to return the firm to organic growth. We have some of the best talent in the industry, and we're squarely focused on delivering consistently strong long-term investment performance and world-class service for our clients, sustaining our culture of excellence and collaboration and carefully managing our financial results through this environment. I'm grateful to our teams for keeping our clients at the center of all we do. I'll now turn to Jen to cover our financial results for the quarter. Yeah. Alex, good morning. And thank you for the question. Look, I did note in the prepared remarks that we expect November and December to have elevated outflows. And November, in particular, is impacted by a single large mandate. December should be consistent with what we've seen in December for the last couple of years. So I do think it's logical to ask given that weakness, why are we confident that outflows should be lower next year. And the first thing I would say is that we're already seeing some year-over-year improvement in flows in certain channels. In particular, channels that tend to respond a little more quickly to changes in performance. And that's despite what I would characterize as a pretty challenging industry backdrop. That is specific -- that improvement -- I'd say you can point to a number of areas. If you just look at trends in Q3, we had just under $3 billion of inflows in the retirement date funds and gross sales up 10% year-over-year. We have positive flows in fixed income, multi-asset broadly and alternatives. You mentioned ETFs. We had our best quarter for ETF sales. It's still small in building. I think it can be a contributor in 2024, but I don't think it will be the most meaningful driver of performance or improvement in flows. I think the most meaningful driver will be one, I think if some of the money on the sidelines from an industry perspective extends their time horizon or risk appetite, and you have more flows in equities broadly. Two, I think a broadening of performance in the US equity market would be helpful for active relative to passive. Three, ultimately, the longer term performance numbers as they flow through will really begin to impact flows. And four, we've highlighted a number of different strategic initiatives that we're working on. Alternatives being one of them. So we do think that OCredit will contribute next year. But in the overall scale of our organization, I wouldn't necessarily say that I think either OCredit or ETF will be a predominant driver of improved flows. I think they'll be additive. But we're going to have to see improvement in the core asset classes and in the core channels to really have 2024 kind of be a better picture with regard to flows than 2023. Sure, Craig. Nice to hear your voice, and good morning. I would say a couple of things as it relates to these strategies. First of all, we're definitely encouraged by the improved performance over the year-to-date period. And we're encouraged because it's come broadly and it's come with the support of really strong performance from our underlying research platform. Our analyst managed portfolio had a really strong year and continues to support our overall performance, which is key to what we do. A client conversations vary -- a lot depending upon the type of clients. As you know, we're in basically every channel, every geography around the world with these strategies. What we're seeing as it relates to flows, as you discussed, those channels that tend to respond more quickly to performance, we are starting to see some better numbers. But we have to continue to deliver the performance that we delivered year-to-date, over continued time periods because we will see eventually the one, the three and the five get better as we do that and more and more channels are focused on those three and those five. So we're encouraged in the short-term, but we are far from complacent about it and recognize that we still have many more quarters and years of strong performance to deliver to get those three and five-year numbers where we want them to be. I'll start and then Jen or Eric can add any perspective. Look, our sub-advisory business is broad. We have sub-advisory opportunities in the wealth channel, and we have a meaningful variable annuity sub-advisory business. The variable annuity sub-advisory business over time is likely to be under more pressure. In terms of sizing it, it is meaningful, but kind of well less than 10% of our overall book. Overall, sub-advisory is a very, very good business for us and a business that we are committed to. We think it's a channel that values our brand. We think it's a channel that values performance. We do see some additional opportunity over the long-term in sub-advisory, particularly in the wealth channel, but we don't anticipate that there'll be much opportunity for growth outside of perhaps consolidating some market share, which is really dependent on very good service, as well as excellent performance in that VA channel. Yeah. I would note quickly with regard to the VA channel, the challenges in the VA channel, something that we've navigated for a very long period of time. So that's not something that's new or specific to the elevated outflows this year. It may be in a particular month or a particular quarter. But it's a part of the book that we've navigated some pressure over a relatively long period of time. Yeah. Hi, Brian. Very good question. Look, we incorporate ESG into our investment decision-making process consistently and we don't let near-term or long-term political issues affect it. Our process is very much based on using insights generated by our fundamental analysts are using our fixed income team, using our responsible investing team. And what the RI team specifically does it helps our portfolio managers and analysts identify risks and opportunities understand the parts of the company's long-term strategy that could be materially affected by changes across ESoG and then incorporating that into our investment decision-making process. So it is not affected by short-term political wins, and it leads us to better outcomes for our clients in all environments. In terms of demand, the ESG set broadly defined still grew in 2023. And across the channels geographically. If you look at EMEA, APAC and even North America, if you exclude one very large reallocation that was done by a competitor firm within their retirement set. So we still think that there's commercial opportunity here and we work with clients to meet them where they want to be. We have the capabilities to do that across fixed income and equities. And we feel really good about that -- the capability that we've built over many years. I would just add quickly, we do think there's a big opportunity for active ETFs in the wealth channel. We do have some ETF specialists that support our regional investment consultants and home office teams that engage with our broker/dealer and advisory clients. We think there's a big opportunity given our multi-asset capabilities in models over time to use our ETFs as components of those underlying models. And I do think longer term, given the of the traits of the ETF vehicle that there will be more for us to do with regard to evaluating opportunities where we can deliver our unique investment capabilities and address needs that clients have. So I think I'm encouraged that we're making some progress, but I do think we've got much more to do here. Yeah. Brendan, this is an important element of our strategic initiative with regard to US wealth. And we've worked pretty hard to bring a broader number of strategies to market. Today, we are over 20% in terms of the number of investment strategies that we offer in retail SMA, and we are getting traction as we broaden the availability and broaden our offering. It's going to take some time. This is a part of the market where manager rosters and lineups are, in many instances, reasonably well established. I do think that many of our wealth partners want T. Rowe Price strategies available in SMA and are looking for opportunities for us to get new placements. We have seen a number of new placements this year. So it is a focus. Jen, any specifics with regard to AUA or flows that we share? Yeah. With regard to specific successes or launches this year, we did bring a muni SMA that was developed specifically for a single distribution partner. We also launched earlier this year two additional equity SMAs, US all-cap opportunities and global focused growth. As I said, this continues to be a big opportunity. I think we disclosed an AUA number that is roundly $10 billion. But you have to remember that, that includes not only model account submission in retail SMA, but also where we do glide path advisory and custom target date funds. So that wouldn't all be the sort of SMA that you're necessarily referring to or that we're talking about in terms of addressing the channel -- the opportunity in the wealth channel. Yeah. Glenn, maybe less straightforward than you think. First, we offer our flagship series, which is a higher equity glide path. We also offer a target series which is a lower equity glide path for those clients whose participant base has a lower risk tolerance or for clients that prefer that as part of their overall plan design. That's the first point I would make. The second point I would make is that while the strategic portfolio design determines the equity allocation at a certain point along the glide path, we also have the ability to make tactical allocations to asset classes and underlying building blocks. And we've actually been underweight equities over the course of this year from a tactical asset allocation perspective. So our asset allocation committee has the flexibility to -- within bands, reallocate funds along that glide path.  I also would say that within our equity allocation, there are building blocks that are more or less conservative, and we've worked on developing and introducing a hedged equity component that ultimately has a little less equity beta. Finally, I would point out that in Q3, while the markets were down, we had excellent performance within our target date series across low and high equity glide path and across vintages and that was driven -- at the margin a little bit by that underweight of equities, but I would say more so by the strategic portfolio design in some of the building blocks that we have in fixed income and just very strong security selection in the underlying strategies. So beneath the surface, there's a lot going on there. You're right that philosophically, we do believe, particularly for longer dated vintages that a high equity component is really important. But there are other ways to drive value in terms of the strategic portfolio design and the building blocks, the tactical asset allocation and the security selection of the underlying portfolios. And so far this year, I think we've been hitting on all cylinders. Yeah. Dan, thank you for the question. Look, we feel like our flagship retirement date funds are the best offering in the business. If you look at the strategic portfolio design, if you look at the underlying building blocks, a number of alpha rich diversifiers in there, areas like bank loan, areas like high yield. It's been a big focus for us. We made a substantial investment in 2021 in the competitiveness of our fees. And we also have a broad range. For those plans that are particularly fee sensitive, we have a blend series that does use passive in US -- in large cap US equity and in core fixed income. So we really believe we have a great value proposition to take on passive. And I think if you look at the performance of the T. Rowe Price fund, whether it's the flagship or whether it's blend and you compare that to passive, I think the numbers really stand for themselves. It's an important area for us. It's an area that we dedicate specific marketing dollars and support to and it's an area where we have momentum right now.  We have record flows on a year-to-date basis in the target date franchise. There are always some planned dynamics around year-end, where you might have a plan that's terminated oftentimes, new ones on board in January. So I'm not going to comment on -- and sometimes there's not even a lot of visibility as you go into year-end with regard to whether or not something kind of either going out or coming in will land in December or land in January. But if you take the longer view, we feel really good about the value proposition. We feel really good about our momentum. It feels like our retirement date franchise as a whole is really resonating in the marketplace, and we're excited to carry that momentum forward into 2024. Yeah. Finian, thank you for the question. Okay. In terms of trends, we actually just reached effectiveness at the end of the third quarter. So this is really our first month. And our current focus is on building a wide distribution syndicate of wealth platforms by leveraging our strong existing relationships in the wealth channel. So we have regional investment consultants in the field that have relationships with brokers and advisers. We've got the home office relationships, and we're really just getting started. I think what we've heard is that the combination of OHA's 30-year history of delivering great performance in alternative credit and T. Rowe Price's presence in the wealth channel and resources in the wealth channel should be pretty powerful. Before we worry about kind of thinking about what we're going to do next, I think we're really, really focused on executing with regard to OCredit. We think it is a very well-designed, excellent value proposition in a way to bring the OHA capabilities to the wealth channel. We will, in time, think about what our product pipeline is and kind of ultimately, I think, build on the success of this with follow-on offerings and we'll engage with our wealth clients to see where there are opportunities to do some things that are unique and it will be in demand. We -- as we go out, we do have a handful of top advisory platforms that we're launching on in Q4 and have some visibility with regard to launch -- with regard to other partners as we get into early 2024. So for now, we're really excited about OCredit. I'd say much too early to comment on kind of monthly flows, but we're encouraged by the platforms that we're launching on. And our team will be working hard on what the right follow-on will be in this marketplace, but it will be some time until our focus pivots from being really successful with OCredit to what the next offering will be."

            "name": "Eric Veiel",
            "content": "Yeah. Hey, Ken. This is Eric. I'll start, and then Rob or Jen may want to come in as well. The way we've approached this market has been, I think, a very thoughtful one. As you know, we started first with five semitransparent active ETFs, which were clones of existing strategies that we're well known for. We then added five fixed income fully transparent ETFs and then this year launched five fully transparent active equity ETFs. Our approach to marketing these is to target the channels where we think that there's the most uptake for the improved structure that the ETF offers, especially for taxable accounts. So that would be ideally the US wealth channel. And within that, the RIA channels as well as now we're starting to gain some traction on the larger broker/dealers as we get to our 12-month track records across this different suite. In the case of TCAF, because the capital appreciation strategy and the portfolio manager, David Drew, are quite well known. We've been able to accelerate some of the placements with that specific strategy. We've also backed this with targeted marketing campaigns and some dedicated sales function as well. So we feel good about the approach that we're taking. And I think long-term, over the next, call it, three to five-plus years, there's no reason why this can't be a very large and important business for us, and I think we'll grow meaningfully. I'm not going to comment about how we'll do versus other specific competitors. I'm very comfortable with the approach that we're taking, and I'm bullish on our long-term prospects here."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Jen Dardis",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. I'll review our financial results, and then we will open the line for questions. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 for Q3 2023 was up from $2.02 in Q2 2023, driven by higher investment advisory revenues and higher carried interest-related income. A decline in markets following a peak at the end of July, led to Q3 end-of-period AUM of $1.35 trillion, down 3.8% from Q2. But our Q3 average AUM of $1.4 trillion was 2.7% higher than Q2 and 3.4% higher than Q3 2022, driving the higher investment advisory revenues this quarter. As Rob mentioned, we had $17.4 billion in net outflows for the quarter, including a previously disclosed sub-advisory mandate termination in August. Consistent with last quarter, our three US large cap growth equity strategies drove the majority of the net outflows. Outflows from equity products were partially offset with inflows in our multi-asset fixed income and alternative asset classes, and our Asia-Pacific business posted positive flows for the quarter as well. Within multi-asset, target date net inflows were $2.9 billion for the quarter, bringing year-to-date inflows to $12.8 billion. When thinking about the rest of the year, keep in mind, we historically have seen some plan-driven seasonality in the DC channel with some plans departing in December and new ones onboarding in January. Other highlights from the quarter included net inflows into capital appreciation, all cap opportunities equity, international core equity and blended emerging market bond. In September, we reopened our international small-cap equity and our high-yield bond strategies to new clients, which we expect will support future sales. Both strategies have solid long-term performance track records. Turning to the income statement, Q3 adjusted net revenues were nearly $1.7 billion, including over $1.4 billion in investment advisory revenue. Our annualized effective fee rate was 41.7 basis points in Q3 2023, down from 42.3% in Q2. The effective fee rate decrease is primarily driven by the timing of performance based fee earnings on certain equity and alternative products that were realized in Q2, along with mix shift towards lower fee asset classes and vehicles. Q3 adjusted net revenues also included over $90 million in accrued carried interest related revenue, reflecting strong absolute and relative performance in those alternative products with carried interest paying structures. This was a higher level of carried interest related revenue than previous quarters, and this will likely continue to vary widely quarter-to-quarter, in line with absolute and relative returns in the products. Our adjusted operating expenses were nearly $1.1 billion, up a little over 3% from both Q2 2023 and Q3 2022. The Q3 included severance costs related to our July reduction in force and higher carried interest related expense, partially offset by a non-recurring benefit in G&A. For full year 2023, we are narrowing our guidance range for adjusted operating expense, excluding the carried interest related compensation to be 2% to 4% over the comparable full year 2022 amount of nearly $4.1 billion. With adjusted operating expense growth, excluding carried interest compensation of just under 1% year-to-date, we do expect higher expenses in a few categories in Q4, several of which are seasonal or timing related so will not fully carry forward into 2024. Specifically, we expect G&A to be higher than typical run rate as we have higher professional fee spend in Q4 that spilled over from Q3. Stock-based compensation is typically higher in Q4 as our annual grant date falls in December. Advertising and promotion is also typically highest in Q4 to support seasonal campaigns. And finally, we will realize a full quarter of higher technology, occupancy and facilities costs related to our new London location. As we mentioned last quarter, we have been focused on managing our expense growth and driving efficiency to allow us to continue to invest in the strategic initiatives that we believe will result in future growth. As part of this effort and in light of our hybrid working environment, we have been reviewing our real estate usage with the dual goals of enhancing in-person collaboration and reducing real estate costs. As a result of this review, we made the decision to consolidate associates at our Owings Mills, Maryland campus into four buildings down from six and to reduce the amount of space occupied in our Colorado Springs buildings by year-end. This is a change in office configuration, not a change in location or workforce strategy. We have also been focused on enhancing our business, data and technology architecture to ensure we have the foundational support to underpin our strategic initiatives and drive efficiency going forward. As we shared last quarter, our cost savings efforts over the last 12 months have removed or reallocated over $200 million in operating expenses versus the run rate for 2024. We continue to expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses, excluding carried interest compensation will grow in the low single digit range. This growth rate will depend on final 2023 adjusted operating expense levels. And as always, this estimated growth rate is based on current market levels, and we may choose to adjust it if markets rise or fall significantly. Spending a moment on capital management. We repurchased over 977,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of about $108 for a total of $106 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased a little under 1.4 million shares for just over $150 million. As of September 30, we had 223.5 million shares outstanding. Our recurring dividend remains a top priority. Through buybacks and dividends year-to-date, we have returned about $992 million to stockholders while maintaining ample liquidity to support our seed capital program, opportunistic share buybacks and potential M&A. As we complete the year and plan for 2024, we will continue to invest in our strategic priorities to pursue excellent investment performance and client service and to drive growth over time. We are also executing on our plans to reduce costs to fund these initiatives and maintain a low single digit expense growth into 2024. While flows will remain challenged through the fourth quarter, we are confident that we will start to see the benefits of these efforts in 2024. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. I'd also add. I think thematically, as Eric talked about ESG and being able to be a point we can talk with clients about their needs and meeting where they are, ETFs are similar in the sense it's another capability where we can have conversations with clients about where they have gaps in their lineups and how we can meet those with the capabilities that we can develop, given the suite of products we already have. Sure. So from an overall perspective, that's what we tried to give the 2% to 4% range for the full year to give you a sense for what the fourth quarter would be to fill in against the actuals through the first three quarters. And then with regard to the seasonal items, some are seasonal and would be similar in fourth quarter this year and fourth quarter next year, some are more one-time in nature. But the comment that you made about carrying over into Q1, certainly things that are seasonal in Q4, we would expect it wouldn't go into the Q1 number. Just to dimensionalize it, first of all, we mentioned a one-time item. This was an operating item that we mentioned was a recovery of prior period costs. That's about $20 million, so you would expect that would not recur and then that benefit would not recur. And then the other items are a little bit more evenly split in terms of an increase in professional fees the long-term incentive plans. This is the stock-based compensation, and we have retirement vesting that are recognized in December when we do those grants. So that creates a pop every quarter, every fourth quarter. No. There hasn't been. It's not a significant number in the flows at this point. Again, I think this is part of an overall plan. If you think about the wealth strategy that we've been talking about for the last year. Newer vehicles are part of that broader plan and some clients prefer ETF just based on their clients and how they buy, some prefer SMAs and obviously, some platforms still have a fairly large mutual fund complex. And so as we think about being able to provide our products for clients, we want to just make sure we have that broad suite of vehicles available for whatever type of clients that are buying from them. I think we've talked in previous times. If you think about the flows into target dates, there are two components. There's the participant flows that go in that are kind of more regular. These are the paycheck additions or distributions for people who are in retirement those don't add significantly to the balances year-end and throughout the year. But -- so when you see the flows into target dates on a net basis, those are actual new plan wins typically. And so when we talk about pressure at year-end. That's about plan changes, not about participant changes. And so this is a good sign for us as we look at positive flows that we're continuing to add new plans to the stable of clients that we have."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer period. I will give you instructions on how to ask questions at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded, and will be available for replay on T. Rowe Price's website shortly after the call concludes. I will now turn the call over to Linsley Carruth, T Rowe Price's Director of Investor Relations.\nLinsley Carruth: Hello, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. The press release and a supplemental materials document can be found on our IR website at investors.troweprice.com. Today's call will last approximately 45 minutes. Our CEO and President, Rob Sharps, and CFO, Jen Dardis, will discuss the company's results for about 15 minutes, and then we'll open it up to your questions. We ask that you limit it to one question per participant. I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements and reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statement language and the reconciliations to GAAP in the supplemental materials as well as in our press release and 10-Q. Now, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRob Sharps: Thank you, Linsley, and thank you all for joining us today. While equity outflows continued in the second quarter, we saw improved performance in a number of important investment strategies. Stronger equity markets helped lift revenue from first quarter levels, and we identified substantial cost savings that will allow us to meaningfully slow expense growth while continuing to pursue our strategic initiatives. On today's call, I'll give an overview of our investment performance followed by a brief update on the key milestones we've reached in advancing our strategic initiatives. Jen will then provide a detailed view of our financial results before we take your questions. Overall, second quarter investment performance was encouraging with reasonably solid results across asset classes and the percentage of funds outperforming their peers increasing from the prior quarter. The U.S. large-cap growth franchise outperformed this quarter, with blue chip growth stock and large-cap growth posting top-quartile results versus peers and beating their benchmarks. Our U.S. equity research and mid-cap value strategies continued to deliver strong performance. In contrast, the large-cap value franchise, a bright spot in 2022, gave back some of its relative outperformance in the first half of 2023. However, the long-term results remain favorable. Our target date franchise delivered another strong quarter of performance with all of our flagship retirement funds ranking in the top quartile. Performance in fixed income and international equity was solid as well, with the majority of funds in both segments outperforming peer groups and a number of products, including global multisector bond and U.S. high yield, in the top decile for the quarter. Our global stock, overseas stock and several of our municipal bond strategies were top-quartile performers in the second quarter and all have strong three-, five- and 10-year performance track records. Despite these gains, organic growth remains under pressure. As we reported, net outflows for the second quarter were $20 billion. The sales and redemption patterns that we saw in the first quarter largely continued in the second. U.S. equity outflows were primarily driven by U.S. large-cap growth strategies as market demand remained muted and we saw the lagging impact of past investment performance on sales and redemptions. International and global outflows slowed with improved market demand and better performance. Fixed income net flows declined from the prior quarter as rates rose and demand softened. Target date products had net inflows of $2.4 billion for the quarter. To protect our ability to invest in our corporate strategy and deliver for our clients, we are proactively managing expense growth. We are pursuing a number of efforts to manage expenses, drive efficiency and create a cost structure that's appropriate for the size and scale of our firm today. Jen will discuss these efforts in greater detail, but since the fourth quarter of 2022, we have taken steps to remove or reallocate over $200 million in run rate costs for 2024. This work partly reflects ongoing company and industry challenges, but also reflects a broader commitment to efficiency, process improvement and durability, driving a culture of continuous improvement in innovation with an agile mindset. Institutionalizing this work will allow us to better invest in our corporate strategy and continue to deliver for our clients even in challenging times. Our corporate strategy is focused on areas where we believe we have the greatest opportunity for growth and long-term success. In the second quarter, we advanced efforts to deepen our client partnerships, expand our investment in operational capabilities, and continued to broaden our global reach. We've made important hires and met some key milestones. We are making steady progress in bolstering our USI Wealth channel by fortifying partnerships with the largest intermediary firms in the industry. Clients expect compelling investment strategies offered in a variety of vehicles to meet their needs, and we made progress delivering on both this quarter. On June 15, we launched five fully-transparent active equity ETFs, which are already generating client interest and inflows. Our existing lineup of 15 ETFs now at $1.5 billion in AUM is steadily building momentum. We continue to fill out our roster of SMA strategies with the addition of four muni and two equity SMA strategies this quarter. We finalized the seed commitment for our first joint co-branded product with OHA, T. Rowe Price OHA Select Private Credit Fund, or OCredit, and closed for our business development company, or BDC, election filing on June 30. The filing is a key legal milestone for the launch, which is planned for later this year. We also hired a Head of U.S. Intermediary Alternative Sales and we'll continue to invest in resources and expertise to support this effort. We closed on our acquisition of Retiree, Inc., which will enhance our ability to expand and retain relationships with pre-retiree and retiree clients by providing tax aware retirement income and social security claiming strategies. With this acquisition, we demonstrate our commitment to expanding and evolving our already strong retirement capabilities. So, while our flows continue to reflect lingering challenges, we are making clear progress. Our work on driving efficiencies and managing expenses will allow us to continue to invest to deliver for our clients and support future growth. I'm impressed by the resiliency and commitment of our associates and I remain confident in the long-term fundamental value that a global active investment management firm like T. Rowe Price can deliver no matter the environment. I'll now turn to Jen to cover our financial results for the second quarter.\nJen Dardis: Thank you, Rob, and hello everyone. I will begin today by reviewing our financial results and will provide additional detail on our expense management efforts before we open the line for questions. As reported, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.02 for Q2 2023 versus $1.69 in Q1 2023, an increase from both higher revenues and carefully managed expense growth. Q2 2023 EPS was also favorably impacted by a lower quarterly effective tax rate. We ended the quarter with $1.4 trillion in AUM, an increase of $58 billion from March 31, 2023, driven by market appreciation and partially offset by net outflows. Our average assets for the quarter were $1.36 trillion, up from Q1 2023, but down almost $50 billion from Q2 2022. As Rob mentioned, we posted $20 billion in net outflows for the quarter. Across the entire complex, we continue to see clients taking longer to make decisions based on current market volatility, which is resulting in lower sales and net inflows than we've seen in prior years. Industry-wide, active equity and fixed income fund flows have been muted for over a year. We expect that this slowdown is cyclical and will revert to more normal patterns as the direction of interest rates, inflation and the likelihood of a recession become clearer. Also consistent with last quarter, our U.S. large-cap growth equity products drove a majority of the outflows, and we are seeing performance-related lower sales and elevated redemptions from a range of clients. It will take some time for the recent performance improvement in these products to slow the outflows. Positive inflows for the quarter included U.S. equity research, capital appreciation, international core and all-cap opportunities. We also had net inflows to international fixed income, driven by Global Investment Grade, Global Multisector and Euro Corporate Bond. However, the inflows to international fixed income were more than offset by outflows from our U.S. fixed income stable value and floating rate products. Our target date net inflows were $2.4 billion for the quarter. While this was down from Q1, keep in mind that first quarter flows are typically the strongest given that a higher proportion of planned decisions happen around year-end. In the first half of the year, we recorded $9.9 billion of net inflows to our target date products. In response to changing market conditions and more available capacity, we have reopened to new investors, some of our previously closed products, including mid-cap growth, small-cap growth and emerging market equity, which we expect will support future sales and net flows. We also continue to evaluate the capacity levels for other closed strategies, and we'll consider reopening these in the future. Our Q2 adjusted net revenues were $1.6 billion, including $1.4 billion of investment advisory revenue, that was up from Q1 2023 on equity market gains. Our effective fee rate was 42.3 basis points, back to the same level it was in Q4 2022 after a slight uptick in the first quarter of 2023. Our adjusted operating expenses were a little over $1 billion, which was generally flat to the first quarter of this year, but up 8.3% from the second quarter of 2022. The year-over-year change was largely driven by the change in capital allocation-based income related compensation. As a reminder, in second quarter last year, there was negative capital allocation-based income, which created an expense offset. Excluding the compensation expense related to capital allocation-based income, adjusted operating expenses were up 1.8% over the same period last year, with compensation and related costs up less than 1% year-over-year. We continue to forecast our 2023 adjusted operating expense growth, excluding capital allocation-based income related compensation expense, will be in the range of 2% to 6% over the comparable full year 2022 amount of $4.1 billion. Based on current market conditions, we still expect to land at or below the midpoint of this range. As Rob mentioned, we are pursuing a number of efforts to proactively manage our expense growth and drive efficiency. Last week, we internally communicated the difficult decision to eliminate approximately 2% of our existing positions globally. We have also slowed the pace of hiring and headcount growth by closing select open positions across the firm. All of these actions have been based on a careful review to make sure we are aligning our resources to best support our clients and drive long-term growth for the firm. Based on our current pace of hiring against our strategic initiatives, we expect headcount at the end of 2023 to be modestly higher than the start of the year, even with the reductions I just mentioned. Most of the costs related to the recent reduction in force will be incurred in the third quarter and are already included in our expense guidance. As we move forward, we remain committed to finding ways to be more efficient and drive a culture of continuous improvement. For example, we are evaluating our current real estate use in light of our new hybrid work approach, with the objective of slowing our occupancy and facilities expense growth. It will be some time, however, before any impact to expenses from real estate would be realized. In total, between the expense efforts we took last year and this year, we will have removed or reallocated over $200 million in operating expenses versus the run rate for 2024. This financial discipline will allow us to continue investing in our strategic initiatives to support future growth, while positioning us for low-single digit adjusted operating expense growth in 2024, excluding the impact of capital allocation-based income related compensation. We will refine these estimates as we get closer to year-end. As always, this estimate is based on current market levels and we could choose to adjust it if markets rise or fall significantly. Shifting to capital management, we found some buying opportunities in May and June, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to over 420,000 shares at an average price of just over $107 per share for $45 million in total. We remain opportunistic in our approach to buybacks. However, given continued market uncertainty, we are being patient in the process. Supporting our recurring dividend remains a top priority, and in the first half of 2023, we returned over $600 million to stockholders. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity to support both our seed capital program and potential M&A. We are confident in the efforts we've identified to drive efficiency and slow our expense growth, as we continue to manage the business to support our clients and return the firm to organic growth over time. As Rob said, institutionalizing this work will allow us to better invest in our corporate strategy and continue to deliver value for our clients even in challenging times. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Performance has improved in a number of your most prominent growth funds. And while outflows were still elevated in 2Q, are you seeing any early indications that the better near-term performance is starting to positively impact the net sales outlook? And if so, what distribution channels are benefiting? And if not, which channels would you expect to come back more quickly to reflect the improved performance, given your comments that the timeline for decision making has been extended?\nRob Sharps: Yes, Ken. Good morning. Thank you for the question. This is Rob. With regard to the large-cap growth franchise, as you note, meaningfully better performance in the second quarter and year-to-date. With regard to whether the improved performance is translating into better flows, the direct answer is, at the margin, but it's way too early to call this a trend. Our experience suggests that performance impacts flows with a lag that for institutional buyers, the three- and five-year numbers are important considerations. And while we have a very compelling performance on a year-to-date basis and attractive performance on a one-year basis, we do have further work to do on the three- and five-year numbers. In terms of what channels you might pick the early signals up or where you would expect it to improve earliest, it would be in USI Wealth and in the individual investor business. I think, again, the more sizable institutional decision making tends to more heavily weigh three- and five-year. I think the pattern we would expect to see is a lessening of redemptions and then eventually a more meaningful pickup in gross sales. If I take a step back and talk about flows broadly, it's clearly the missing ingredient. Overall, I'm feeling better about things. I think we've been very front-footed in putting ourself in a position where we can invest against our strategic initiatives yet kind of have an appropriate level of expense growth. For now at least the market has given us a lift in revenues and we're working really hard to put ourselves in a position where we can return to organic growth. As it stands today, the industry conditions are challenging. There is a lot of money on the sidelines. I don't think that will last forever, but it's difficult to know when it will ultimately come back. We'll need to continue to drive improved performance. And ultimately, we'll need to execute against our strategic initiatives to become more central with our existing clients and to reach more clients. My sense is if you look at historical patterns, if we execute against those things and investors come off the sidelines and begin to invest with a more long-term orientation again, we should see meaningfully less in the way of outflows in 2024 and demonstrate that we can put the company on a path back to organic growth at some point in 2025. If I look at all of the leading indicators that I'm seeing right now, it suggests to me that we're experiencing the worst of the pressure on flows, which is another way of saying I wouldn't expect the run rate in the back half of the year to be greater than what we saw in the first half of the year. And as we work our way through '24, we think we'll see, as I say, noticeably less in the way of net outflows. But again, there are some things that have to happen in terms of the industry backdrop, in terms of our investment performance, which we're deeply focused on and I'm encouraged by, and again, with regard to execution against all of our strategic initiatives.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Finian O'Shea from Wells Fargo Securities.\nFinian O'Shea: Hi, everyone. Good morning. A question on the active ETF launches. Can you talk about the success so far there as to the extent that they capture the outflows, say, of their sister mutual funds? And also on a high level, are you encouraged by what you're seeing, or are there roadblocks for that strategy to gain traction? Thank you.\nRob Sharps: Look, at a high level, I am encouraged by what we've been seeing more recently. I think active strategies delivered in the ETF vehicle have really started to garner more attention and interest across the industry, and we've continued to expand our lineup, kind of we now have a broader range across equity and fixed income. And as noted, launched a series of new ETFs this quarter. We have particular early traction in the capital appreciation equity ETF offering. But kind of broadly, we're getting more and more engagement and are increasingly encouraged by interest in ETFs. With regard to whether it's just cannibalizing the open-ended 40 Act business, I think there's an element of that, but I also think we're attracting a lot of new investors. What you find is that there are certain advisors that use ETFs exclusively. And until we had an ETF lineup, we weren't able to engage or deliver our strategies to those advisors. Tim Coyne and our USI Wealth Broker-Dealer Financial Advisory team have done a really good job of getting out into the marketplace and ultimately kind of giving people a sense for our strategies and why they could be appropriate in their clients' portfolios. We're really pleased with how they're performing. We think there's a long way to go there. It's early days, and I would say for us the momentum has really just started to build frankly kind of over the course of the last several months.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Jen, I was hoping to expand a bit upon the expense commentary. So, at or below the midpoint of this year, I assume that's based on kind of June 30 AUM levels? And then also would be curious about what kind of one-time or severance might be included in 3Q as you think about the actions that have been taken? And then, further, just on the commentary for next year, low-single digits at this point, did that include some of the real estate and longer-term dynamic -- potentials cost saving actions that you mentioned, or would that be above and beyond as we think about '25 and further?\nJen Dardis: Thanks, Dan. I'll try to make sure I get all of those. So, first, on the midpoint of the range, the at or below the midpoint of the range, as usual, we tend to look at an average of the month as you might have noticed in this particular quarter, the markets went straight up into the end of the quarter. So, we tend to look at about a 30-day rolling average to look at what the balance might be for the balance of the year. In terms of severance, there's about $15 million to $20 million worth of severance costs that would be reflected in Q3. And we would expect for the balance of the year, if you look at how things would roll into Q4, you would have that partially offset by some of the lower salaries based on the roles that departed in July. Just remember, as we think about how that expense guidance would roll into the end of the year, fourth quarter typically has our long-term incentive plans where new LTI plans are issued and that tends to create a bit of a pop along with ad promo that tends to be more seasonal in the fourth quarter. And last, as we look into next year, that low-single digit guidance, it includes much of what I just mentioned. It includes the $200 million. The real estate savings would roll in over time. I would expect that would probably be more into the late '24 or early '25 timeframe. But again, we're still going through planning for the year. We just wanted to give you a general sense for where next year might land.\nRob Sharps: I'll just say a few words with regard to expense management. We're trying to take an approach that really reflects our long-term priorities. We do want to invest against our strategic initiatives and invest for growth. We want to invest in our talent and maintain our culture and have the ability to be central to our clients and reach more clients. In order to do that and sustain profitability in various market environments, we're going to have to be more efficient, we're going to have to be better at prioritization, we're going to have to make space to invest in and acquire new skills. So, we should be able to drive additional savings through process improvement and optimization over time, but we're going to want to be able to use that to invest in our business and to put the company in a position to be successful over the long term.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning. We're coming up on the two-year anniversary of the Oak Hill acquisition announcement. So, maybe this is a good time to provide us an update on the M&A effort, and also get your thoughts on potentially acquiring another private markets manager, maybe one with a focus on real estate or infrastructure.\nRob Sharps: Yes, Craig, good morning. Thank you for the question. Look, our priorities with regard to M&A typically don't change quarter-to-quarter. We are constantly evaluating opportunities to add new capabilities that we don't currently offer and that are important to our clients. We typically evaluate that relative to developing something organically. So, we're evaluating strategic opportunities. It's a stated goal of ours to build our alternatives business over time. So, it's natural that as opportunities present themselves in areas like real estate and infrastructure, as you suggest, that we would evaluate them. Look, we're only going to do things that we believe are compelling. We're only going to do things where we believe there is real cultural fit. We want to associate ourselves with investors and teams that are performance-oriented, that are client-focused and that have a long-term orientation. So, when those opportunities present themselves, we're going to do work and, ultimately, feel like -- ultimately determine whether or not we should engage and do more work and whether it's something that we might move forward with. There isn't anything that's imminent right now, but this is an active time in the industry from a consolidation perspective. With regard to OHA, the Board and I continue to be very happy with the acquisition overall. I think the market backdrop is a little more challenging with regard to capital raising and deployment across private markets, private credit and private equity, but it's a moment in time. I'm very enthusiastic about OHA business in the long term. They are talented investors with solid performance and a very strong reputation and great client relationships. I'm also encouraged by the work that our distribution teams are doing around the globe as they've spent time learning OHA's offering and they are beginning to bring new opportunities from our client relationships to OHA. Last thing I'd say about this is I'm really excited about our joint BDC, where we've noted we've secured $600 million of seed cap and are building a pipeline of intermediaries to partner with for distribution. Again, demand is muted in this space right now. But we think it's a compelling product. It's an area that we didn't serve in the past, either T. Rowe Price or OHA. So, we feel like we can have a preeminent product on those platforms when demand for the private credit BDC type vehicle comes back.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. So, I want to take a step back on the intermediary channel, because it's a little bit weird time where the markets go up a lot, yet you have a bunch of outflows. So, the question I have is, is the same performance drives flows on a lag basis? Is that relationship still what's driving things in here, and as your performance started to improve, we should see things slow? That would be what history would say, but is it bigger than that now? Are you seeing like just a massive product preference change in the channel hence the ETFs and SMAs that you've been putting out, maybe you could weave in what the responsibilities of your new Head of Intermediate Distribution might be in charge of making happen? Appreciate it. Thanks.\nRob Sharps: Yes. Glenn, it's a good question. It is an unusual moment in time. If you look at where most of the inflows have come in the industry, it's been in passive, a lot of that in ETF and in money market. People are getting yields on money market funds that they haven't had in 15 years or more. And it's an uncertain environment. I think there are a lot of investors that are on sidelines that are waiting for the Fed to get out of the way or waiting for a more attractive buying opportunity. I'd also say that it's been a narrow market. You'd note that the market is up quite a bit. It's been driven by kind of a very narrow portion of the market and a small number of overall names. So there hasn't been as broad participation as you might expect. Look, I still believe that good performance will drive flows across vehicles. And we saw this quarter inflows into a number of strategies including funds where performance was good. Again, I think longer term, there is a shift away from open-ended 40 Act mutual funds in favor of other vehicles, you see that in fund to trust migration in our retirement business. And as you noted, SMA and ETF are both growing more rapidly. But we're I think moving quickly to offer a broader range of strategies across those vehicles. So, while the trends that you note are real, in terms of a shift to SMA with lower account minimums, more customization, tax loss optimization, shift to ETF, to some extent, a shift to thematic or shift to passive, I think those are things that we can navigate if we leverage our, I think, best-in-class global investment platform, global research platform across equities and fixed income. All of those are opportunities that we should be able to address, that I think we've made progress in building out our shelf space and availability and we'll make further progress with -- going forward. So look, I deeply believe that there will always be a market for active management that excellent security selection will drive value. And I think it's incumbent on us to engage with our clients to understand kind of how we can deliver that value to them. So, I think there's an element of this, Glenn, that is cyclical, that is kind of where we are today. And kind of ultimately, you'll see behavior change and money flow back to strategies where you have a very good performance. But there's also an element of it that I think is likely to be more enduring, which is why we're working hard on SMA, ETF, things like the OCredit, BDC, we want to be more present and better represented in areas where we've been less well represented in the past because there are some changing demand trends.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. If I could just dive deeper in on two channels, the 401(k) channel, both DCIO and recordkeeping, and then maybe contrasting that with the online brokerage platform channels, so like for example, Charles Schwab as just one of them. In the 401(k) channel, we saw elevated outflows in the institutional side of your business. So, I assume that's a concentrating in your 401(k). Maybe if you can just talk about whether there were any lumpy either mandate losses or something that drove that in the second quarter? And then, are you seeing better potential trends in the DCIO versus the recordkeeping? And then, on the online brokerage platforms, are you seeing better trends there? They're more retail focused, they may be more performance sensitive. Not sure if it's a big enough contribution yet, but if you can just provide some color on those? Thanks.\nRob Sharps: Yes, I'll start and ask Jen to offer her perspective as well. I'll start with our retirement plan services business or our bundled 401(k) recordkeeping business. It's a business that overall I would characterize as healthy. We are growing in what we call the core market, which is below the large enterprise market. We're expanding our coverage of advisors that specialize in retirement and recordkeeping for small-, medium-sized businesses. And kind of overall, I think it's a business that is executing quite well for us. Where we have some challenges is in, we often have planned deconversions when there is consolidation where you have one of those large enterprises by a midcap or more medium-sized company that's one of our clients. So that's pressured that business to some extent, but we've largely been able to set that with growth in the core market. And I feel good about our momentum there. So, I'll leave that for the 401(k) recordkeeping business. In terms of the DC investment only or institutional defined contribution business, I'd say it's more mixed. We continue to meet with success in the retirement date franchise there. But it's an area where we were very well represented in large-cap growth. And that we have had some terminations from plans as a result of performance in that channel and that has put some pressure on close. It's part of the reason why we've called it out. I think it's been particularly elevated or acute in the first part of this year. I don't think we're out of the woods yet with regard to that. But I think if we continue to drive performance and get back to our historical standards, eventually that will run its course.\nJen Dardis: Yes, I'd add to that, if we think about we've been asked previously about trends in the DC, the defined contribution investment only versus our record-kept business. Those are both important business lines for us and we actually see the benefits of the work that we do representing planned sponsors in that 401(k) recordkeeping business. It's able to help us think about plan design, it's able to help us think about product design and it's really helped us to stay front of mind from an innovation perspective in both our target date products and in thinking about retirement income products going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions or question, I guess. So, my understanding of T. Rowe's incentive comp is that you tend to skew to longer-term performance track records on the investment professional side. So, just wanted to confirm if that's right, and whether or not we -- number one, like what track records or which time periods are more important and have a bigger impact? And was the better-than-expected compensation expense this quarter beginning to reflect the fact that some of the longer-term track records have begun to deteriorate, and therefore, we could expect to see some continued tailwinds on the expense side from that dynamic?\nRob Sharps: Yes, I'm not going to comment on specifically what the underlying drivers are of the compensation accrual. I will say that our approach and philosophy around incentive compensation does emphasize longer-term track records. And kind of how you define that really depends on the tenure of the investment professional. But we look not only at the current year results, but at three-, five- and even 10-year results for long-tenured portfolio managers. So, our incentives are basically designed to reflect the long-term performance for investment proposals. But you've got to remember, we have 8,000 associates. And we have people that are doing a lot of different things in the organization. We also have a very broad range of strategies. So kind of while we might have delivered disappointing three- and five-year results in certain strategies, we have other strategies where you have excellent results. So, kind of at the end of the day, as I've said before, we're really focused on, from an expense perspective overall, making sure that we have the capacity to attract and retain world-class diverse talent and maintain our culture. And those are the things that I think are really essential for us to be able to deliver for our clients over time and to be able to deliver for our shareholders.\nJen Dardis: I think it is worth noting, as we talked about the steps that we've been taking from an expense perspective, we had the notable announcement where we took the actions with the 2% of existing roles. But in leading up to that, we've been working for the past several months at looking how we can actually slow down and close open roles, and that will have an impact on the expense growth rate in salaries. So, trying to manage that over a period of time allows us to do that through closing open roles, not necessarily having to eliminate roles that have people in them. So, you would see that flowing through in the impact of salaries.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Brown from KBW.\nMike Brown: Hi, good morning. So Jennifer, as you noted, the market rally was particularly strong at the end of the quarter. So, just wanted to see if you had any color about the exit fee rate here relative to the second quarter? And any puts and takes we should really consider here for the second half?\nJen Dardis: No. I'd say, look, if you look at our trend over the last several years, five-plus, we've had modest fee compression rates over the past several years in the range of 1% to 2%, depending on the actions that we've been taking to lower fees across different product lines and be competitive. So, I would expect that wouldn't change. Obviously, in times of market rally, you'll see a little bit of an uptick as the business mix shifts, but nothing really specific to call out that's different from trends.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, everyone. So, T. Rowe is widely known to be one of the best places to work in asset management and you've obviously been able to maintain that strong culture and strong pay packages through the last decades plus bull market. But history would suggest that asset managers to start cutting more aggressively, start to impact the investment management process and then, ultimately, performance. So, after now two, I guess, waves of layoffs in a year, how are you balancing this new restraint on expenses with the risk that you negatively impact the investment franchise?\nRob Sharps: I think I've said this now maybe the third time. Our approach here is to have a balanced -- a balance between driving efficiency overall, and that's throughout the organization, making sure that we're getting value out of all of our roles, making sure that we are a company that is dynamic and, in the long term, has growth opportunity in a way that will allow us to sustain our culture and have the resources to compensate and attract top diverse talent throughout the organization, but particularly in investments. Look, our retention is very strong. I think we have a very strong culture. Our compensation is based on all of the market data that we have, very competitive, if not compelling. I expect it will remain the case. The vast majority of the headcount initiatives did not impact investments. So, it seems to be something that is very much top of mind for a handful of you all, but it's not something that I particularly am overly concerned with. It's something that we're always very, very focused on. But there's no question in my mind that we have the capacity and intent to make sure that our compensation practices are very competitive and that we have appropriate incentives in place for people throughout the organization. Again, the proof is in the pudding there, if you look at our investment professional retention, I think it's excellent. Our retention throughout the organization is quite strong. What we're doing, I think, is very consistent with what you've seen throughout the organization in almost every one of our peers. So, in that way, I would say I do not think that we are an outlier. Jen, I don't know if you'd have anything to add.\nJen Dardis: Yes, I think it's also important to put it in context. If we look at the last five years, we were coming off a period of very rapid investment in the business. We've added a number of capabilities across investments, distribution, technology, operations and globalization of the business over the -- again, over the past five-plus years, to the tune of increasing operating expenses over $1 billion in run rate during that timeframe. So these adjustments, I think these are nice moments in time to be able to take a look, make sure that we're doing things as efficiently as we can. And if we look at the -- particularly on the role side of things, there were three things we were trying to do. One was increasing efficiency in the way we work. So trying to look at processes, rebalancing work, making sure that we have -- we're doing things in the right ways with the most beneficial technology that we can. The second is just looking at a need for changing skill sets. As we look at places that Rob mentioned, new vehicles, making sure that we have our skills decked against the places where the business is going. And then the last thing is about pivoting and reprioritizing resources against these strategic priorities that we've been talking about. So, some of this is about expense reduction. Some of this is about expense reallocation. And to help put it into context, for next year, as we started the baseline work, our expense growth next year would have been somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 basis points to 400 basis points higher from an expense growth perspective, if we were just investing in all new things in the business. So, we view this, again, not only as an expense-cutting exercise, but also as a reallocation to make sure we're investing in the right spot.\nRob Sharps: Yes. And just to close the loop on this, for context, the role eliminations were roundly 2% of our global workforce and impacted multiple functions. The impact across investment divisions was minimal. You talk about dozens of people over a base of between 400 and 500 portfolio managers, associate portfolio managers, investment analysts across our -- all of our investment divisions. I think it's also important to understand that we've invested very steadily over time across our base of investment professionals, and we remain very confident in the strength of our global investment platform and our ability to deliver for clients. If you look back just to the -- since the end of 2013 to June 30 this year, our total number of investors has grown by over 25%. So, if there's any sense or concern that we're not investing in our platform or taking care of our investment talent, I think it's misplaced.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line will be opened momentarily. Your line is now open.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in here. More of a big picture question for you. AI has been getting a lot of attention and focus across the world today. Just curious how you're thinking about the potential and opportunity from AI with respect to your business. Do you see this as more of a revenue or an expense play? What sort of impact could this have on the competitive landscape for the asset management industry? Maybe you could talk a little bit about how you're experimenting with this today, or how you may experiment with that in the future?\nJen Dardis: Sure. Thanks for the question. I think it's important here that I know a lot of people are talking about generative AI and the capabilities that have been rapidly evolving over the past several quarters versus machine learning AI. I'd say we've been investing behind that in certain parts of our business for some time now and our investment data insight team is an example, to make sure that we're using the benefits of machine learning in all of our processes. Specifically with regard to generative AI, we're looking at it across two fronts. One is from a risk perspective, just making sure that we have appropriate safeguards in place to protect data. And that's been one of the important things that we've been focused on in the early days. And then, the second piece of that, we've been establishing pilots across the business just to evaluate what the capabilities are to make sure that we can implement generative AI in ways that will improve our ability to generate insights for clients, the ability to reach and impact new clients and also to drive efficiency across the business. So, I'd say we're looking at pilots across our investment organization, across our distribution channels and within our technology organization specifically to look at how we can use that to drive efficiencies. So, I think the opportunities are potentially significant over time, but it's early days, and we want to do it in a way that is durable.\nRob Sharps: All right. I think that was the last question. So, I'll just close by thanking everyone for joining us and for their interest and good questions. As we noted, we're encouraged by investment performance. We continue to be deeply focused on it. And I think we believe that while there are some lingering issues that will impact flows, we have a path to improvement as we work our way through 2024. We believe deeply in our corporate strategic initiatives, and I'm really encouraged by the dedication and commitment of our associates and their focus on delivering for our clients. So, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jen Dardis",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob, and hello everyone. I will begin today by reviewing our financial results and will provide additional detail on our expense management efforts before we open the line for questions. As reported, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.02 for Q2 2023 versus $1.69 in Q1 2023, an increase from both higher revenues and carefully managed expense growth. Q2 2023 EPS was also favorably impacted by a lower quarterly effective tax rate. We ended the quarter with $1.4 trillion in AUM, an increase of $58 billion from March 31, 2023, driven by market appreciation and partially offset by net outflows. Our average assets for the quarter were $1.36 trillion, up from Q1 2023, but down almost $50 billion from Q2 2022. As Rob mentioned, we posted $20 billion in net outflows for the quarter. Across the entire complex, we continue to see clients taking longer to make decisions based on current market volatility, which is resulting in lower sales and net inflows than we've seen in prior years. Industry-wide, active equity and fixed income fund flows have been muted for over a year. We expect that this slowdown is cyclical and will revert to more normal patterns as the direction of interest rates, inflation and the likelihood of a recession become clearer. Also consistent with last quarter, our U.S. large-cap growth equity products drove a majority of the outflows, and we are seeing performance-related lower sales and elevated redemptions from a range of clients. It will take some time for the recent performance improvement in these products to slow the outflows. Positive inflows for the quarter included U.S. equity research, capital appreciation, international core and all-cap opportunities. We also had net inflows to international fixed income, driven by Global Investment Grade, Global Multisector and Euro Corporate Bond. However, the inflows to international fixed income were more than offset by outflows from our U.S. fixed income stable value and floating rate products. Our target date net inflows were $2.4 billion for the quarter. While this was down from Q1, keep in mind that first quarter flows are typically the strongest given that a higher proportion of planned decisions happen around year-end. In the first half of the year, we recorded $9.9 billion of net inflows to our target date products. In response to changing market conditions and more available capacity, we have reopened to new investors, some of our previously closed products, including mid-cap growth, small-cap growth and emerging market equity, which we expect will support future sales and net flows. We also continue to evaluate the capacity levels for other closed strategies, and we'll consider reopening these in the future. Our Q2 adjusted net revenues were $1.6 billion, including $1.4 billion of investment advisory revenue, that was up from Q1 2023 on equity market gains. Our effective fee rate was 42.3 basis points, back to the same level it was in Q4 2022 after a slight uptick in the first quarter of 2023. Our adjusted operating expenses were a little over $1 billion, which was generally flat to the first quarter of this year, but up 8.3% from the second quarter of 2022. The year-over-year change was largely driven by the change in capital allocation-based income related compensation. As a reminder, in second quarter last year, there was negative capital allocation-based income, which created an expense offset. Excluding the compensation expense related to capital allocation-based income, adjusted operating expenses were up 1.8% over the same period last year, with compensation and related costs up less than 1% year-over-year. We continue to forecast our 2023 adjusted operating expense growth, excluding capital allocation-based income related compensation expense, will be in the range of 2% to 6% over the comparable full year 2022 amount of $4.1 billion. Based on current market conditions, we still expect to land at or below the midpoint of this range. As Rob mentioned, we are pursuing a number of efforts to proactively manage our expense growth and drive efficiency. Last week, we internally communicated the difficult decision to eliminate approximately 2% of our existing positions globally. We have also slowed the pace of hiring and headcount growth by closing select open positions across the firm. All of these actions have been based on a careful review to make sure we are aligning our resources to best support our clients and drive long-term growth for the firm. Based on our current pace of hiring against our strategic initiatives, we expect headcount at the end of 2023 to be modestly higher than the start of the year, even with the reductions I just mentioned. Most of the costs related to the recent reduction in force will be incurred in the third quarter and are already included in our expense guidance. As we move forward, we remain committed to finding ways to be more efficient and drive a culture of continuous improvement. For example, we are evaluating our current real estate use in light of our new hybrid work approach, with the objective of slowing our occupancy and facilities expense growth. It will be some time, however, before any impact to expenses from real estate would be realized. In total, between the expense efforts we took last year and this year, we will have removed or reallocated over $200 million in operating expenses versus the run rate for 2024. This financial discipline will allow us to continue investing in our strategic initiatives to support future growth, while positioning us for low-single digit adjusted operating expense growth in 2024, excluding the impact of capital allocation-based income related compensation. We will refine these estimates as we get closer to year-end. As always, this estimate is based on current market levels and we could choose to adjust it if markets rise or fall significantly. Shifting to capital management, we found some buying opportunities in May and June, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to over 420,000 shares at an average price of just over $107 per share for $45 million in total. We remain opportunistic in our approach to buybacks. However, given continued market uncertainty, we are being patient in the process. Supporting our recurring dividend remains a top priority, and in the first half of 2023, we returned over $600 million to stockholders. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity to support both our seed capital program and potential M&A. We are confident in the efforts we've identified to drive efficiency and slow our expense growth, as we continue to manage the business to support our clients and return the firm to organic growth over time. As Rob said, institutionalizing this work will allow us to better invest in our corporate strategy and continue to deliver value for our clients even in challenging times. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for Q&A. Thanks, Dan. I'll try to make sure I get all of those. So, first, on the midpoint of the range, the at or below the midpoint of the range, as usual, we tend to look at an average of the month as you might have noticed in this particular quarter, the markets went straight up into the end of the quarter. So, we tend to look at about a 30-day rolling average to look at what the balance might be for the balance of the year. In terms of severance, there's about $15 million to $20 million worth of severance costs that would be reflected in Q3. And we would expect for the balance of the year, if you look at how things would roll into Q4, you would have that partially offset by some of the lower salaries based on the roles that departed in July. Just remember, as we think about how that expense guidance would roll into the end of the year, fourth quarter typically has our long-term incentive plans where new LTI plans are issued and that tends to create a bit of a pop along with ad promo that tends to be more seasonal in the fourth quarter. And last, as we look into next year, that low-single digit guidance, it includes much of what I just mentioned. It includes the $200 million. The real estate savings would roll in over time. I would expect that would probably be more into the late '24 or early '25 timeframe. But again, we're still going through planning for the year. We just wanted to give you a general sense for where next year might land. Yes, I'd add to that, if we think about we've been asked previously about trends in the DC, the defined contribution investment only versus our record-kept business. Those are both important business lines for us and we actually see the benefits of the work that we do representing planned sponsors in that 401(k) recordkeeping business. It's able to help us think about plan design, it's able to help us think about product design and it's really helped us to stay front of mind from an innovation perspective in both our target date products and in thinking about retirement income products going forward. I think it is worth noting, as we talked about the steps that we've been taking from an expense perspective, we had the notable announcement where we took the actions with the 2% of existing roles. But in leading up to that, we've been working for the past several months at looking how we can actually slow down and close open roles, and that will have an impact on the expense growth rate in salaries. So, trying to manage that over a period of time allows us to do that through closing open roles, not necessarily having to eliminate roles that have people in them. So, you would see that flowing through in the impact of salaries. No. I'd say, look, if you look at our trend over the last several years, five-plus, we've had modest fee compression rates over the past several years in the range of 1% to 2%, depending on the actions that we've been taking to lower fees across different product lines and be competitive. So, I would expect that wouldn't change. Obviously, in times of market rally, you'll see a little bit of an uptick as the business mix shifts, but nothing really specific to call out that's different from trends. Yes, I think it's also important to put it in context. If we look at the last five years, we were coming off a period of very rapid investment in the business. We've added a number of capabilities across investments, distribution, technology, operations and globalization of the business over the -- again, over the past five-plus years, to the tune of increasing operating expenses over $1 billion in run rate during that timeframe. So these adjustments, I think these are nice moments in time to be able to take a look, make sure that we're doing things as efficiently as we can. And if we look at the -- particularly on the role side of things, there were three things we were trying to do. One was increasing efficiency in the way we work. So trying to look at processes, rebalancing work, making sure that we have -- we're doing things in the right ways with the most beneficial technology that we can. The second is just looking at a need for changing skill sets. As we look at places that Rob mentioned, new vehicles, making sure that we have our skills decked against the places where the business is going. And then the last thing is about pivoting and reprioritizing resources against these strategic priorities that we've been talking about. So, some of this is about expense reduction. Some of this is about expense reallocation. And to help put it into context, for next year, as we started the baseline work, our expense growth next year would have been somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 basis points to 400 basis points higher from an expense growth perspective, if we were just investing in all new things in the business. So, we view this, again, not only as an expense-cutting exercise, but also as a reallocation to make sure we're investing in the right spot. Sure. Thanks for the question. I think it's important here that I know a lot of people are talking about generative AI and the capabilities that have been rapidly evolving over the past several quarters versus machine learning AI. I'd say we've been investing behind that in certain parts of our business for some time now and our investment data insight team is an example, to make sure that we're using the benefits of machine learning in all of our processes. Specifically with regard to generative AI, we're looking at it across two fronts. One is from a risk perspective, just making sure that we have appropriate safeguards in place to protect data. And that's been one of the important things that we've been focused on in the early days. And then, the second piece of that, we've been establishing pilots across the business just to evaluate what the capabilities are to make sure that we can implement generative AI in ways that will improve our ability to generate insights for clients, the ability to reach and impact new clients and also to drive efficiency across the business. So, I'd say we're looking at pilots across our investment organization, across our distribution channels and within our technology organization specifically to look at how we can use that to drive efficiencies. So, I think the opportunities are potentially significant over time, but it's early days, and we want to do it in a way that is durable."

            "content": "Thank you, Linsley, and thank you all for joining us today. While equity outflows continued in the second quarter, we saw improved performance in a number of important investment strategies. Stronger equity markets helped lift revenue from first quarter levels, and we identified substantial cost savings that will allow us to meaningfully slow expense growth while continuing to pursue our strategic initiatives. On today's call, I'll give an overview of our investment performance followed by a brief update on the key milestones we've reached in advancing our strategic initiatives. Jen will then provide a detailed view of our financial results before we take your questions. Overall, second quarter investment performance was encouraging with reasonably solid results across asset classes and the percentage of funds outperforming their peers increasing from the prior quarter. The U.S. large-cap growth franchise outperformed this quarter, with blue chip growth stock and large-cap growth posting top-quartile results versus peers and beating their benchmarks. Our U.S. equity research and mid-cap value strategies continued to deliver strong performance. In contrast, the large-cap value franchise, a bright spot in 2022, gave back some of its relative outperformance in the first half of 2023. However, the long-term results remain favorable. Our target date franchise delivered another strong quarter of performance with all of our flagship retirement funds ranking in the top quartile. Performance in fixed income and international equity was solid as well, with the majority of funds in both segments outperforming peer groups and a number of products, including global multisector bond and U.S. high yield, in the top decile for the quarter. Our global stock, overseas stock and several of our municipal bond strategies were top-quartile performers in the second quarter and all have strong three-, five- and 10-year performance track records. Despite these gains, organic growth remains under pressure. As we reported, net outflows for the second quarter were $20 billion. The sales and redemption patterns that we saw in the first quarter largely continued in the second. U.S. equity outflows were primarily driven by U.S. large-cap growth strategies as market demand remained muted and we saw the lagging impact of past investment performance on sales and redemptions. International and global outflows slowed with improved market demand and better performance. Fixed income net flows declined from the prior quarter as rates rose and demand softened. Target date products had net inflows of $2.4 billion for the quarter. To protect our ability to invest in our corporate strategy and deliver for our clients, we are proactively managing expense growth. We are pursuing a number of efforts to manage expenses, drive efficiency and create a cost structure that's appropriate for the size and scale of our firm today. Jen will discuss these efforts in greater detail, but since the fourth quarter of 2022, we have taken steps to remove or reallocate over $200 million in run rate costs for 2024. This work partly reflects ongoing company and industry challenges, but also reflects a broader commitment to efficiency, process improvement and durability, driving a culture of continuous improvement in innovation with an agile mindset. Institutionalizing this work will allow us to better invest in our corporate strategy and continue to deliver for our clients even in challenging times. Our corporate strategy is focused on areas where we believe we have the greatest opportunity for growth and long-term success. In the second quarter, we advanced efforts to deepen our client partnerships, expand our investment in operational capabilities, and continued to broaden our global reach. We've made important hires and met some key milestones. We are making steady progress in bolstering our USI Wealth channel by fortifying partnerships with the largest intermediary firms in the industry. Clients expect compelling investment strategies offered in a variety of vehicles to meet their needs, and we made progress delivering on both this quarter. On June 15, we launched five fully-transparent active equity ETFs, which are already generating client interest and inflows. Our existing lineup of 15 ETFs now at $1.5 billion in AUM is steadily building momentum. We continue to fill out our roster of SMA strategies with the addition of four muni and two equity SMA strategies this quarter. We finalized the seed commitment for our first joint co-branded product with OHA, T. Rowe Price OHA Select Private Credit Fund, or OCredit, and closed for our business development company, or BDC, election filing on June 30. The filing is a key legal milestone for the launch, which is planned for later this year. We also hired a Head of U.S. Intermediary Alternative Sales and we'll continue to invest in resources and expertise to support this effort. We closed on our acquisition of Retiree, Inc., which will enhance our ability to expand and retain relationships with pre-retiree and retiree clients by providing tax aware retirement income and social security claiming strategies. With this acquisition, we demonstrate our commitment to expanding and evolving our already strong retirement capabilities. So, while our flows continue to reflect lingering challenges, we are making clear progress. Our work on driving efficiencies and managing expenses will allow us to continue to invest to deliver for our clients and support future growth. I'm impressed by the resiliency and commitment of our associates and I remain confident in the long-term fundamental value that a global active investment management firm like T. Rowe Price can deliver no matter the environment. I'll now turn to Jen to cover our financial results for the second quarter. Yes, Ken. Good morning. Thank you for the question. This is Rob. With regard to the large-cap growth franchise, as you note, meaningfully better performance in the second quarter and year-to-date. With regard to whether the improved performance is translating into better flows, the direct answer is, at the margin, but it's way too early to call this a trend. Our experience suggests that performance impacts flows with a lag that for institutional buyers, the three- and five-year numbers are important considerations. And while we have a very compelling performance on a year-to-date basis and attractive performance on a one-year basis, we do have further work to do on the three- and five-year numbers. In terms of what channels you might pick the early signals up or where you would expect it to improve earliest, it would be in USI Wealth and in the individual investor business. I think, again, the more sizable institutional decision making tends to more heavily weigh three- and five-year. I think the pattern we would expect to see is a lessening of redemptions and then eventually a more meaningful pickup in gross sales. If I take a step back and talk about flows broadly, it's clearly the missing ingredient. Overall, I'm feeling better about things. I think we've been very front-footed in putting ourself in a position where we can invest against our strategic initiatives yet kind of have an appropriate level of expense growth. For now at least the market has given us a lift in revenues and we're working really hard to put ourselves in a position where we can return to organic growth. As it stands today, the industry conditions are challenging. There is a lot of money on the sidelines. I don't think that will last forever, but it's difficult to know when it will ultimately come back. We'll need to continue to drive improved performance. And ultimately, we'll need to execute against our strategic initiatives to become more central with our existing clients and to reach more clients. My sense is if you look at historical patterns, if we execute against those things and investors come off the sidelines and begin to invest with a more long-term orientation again, we should see meaningfully less in the way of outflows in 2024 and demonstrate that we can put the company on a path back to organic growth at some point in 2025. If I look at all of the leading indicators that I'm seeing right now, it suggests to me that we're experiencing the worst of the pressure on flows, which is another way of saying I wouldn't expect the run rate in the back half of the year to be greater than what we saw in the first half of the year. And as we work our way through '24, we think we'll see, as I say, noticeably less in the way of net outflows. But again, there are some things that have to happen in terms of the industry backdrop, in terms of our investment performance, which we're deeply focused on and I'm encouraged by, and again, with regard to execution against all of our strategic initiatives. Look, at a high level, I am encouraged by what we've been seeing more recently. I think active strategies delivered in the ETF vehicle have really started to garner more attention and interest across the industry, and we've continued to expand our lineup, kind of we now have a broader range across equity and fixed income. And as noted, launched a series of new ETFs this quarter. We have particular early traction in the capital appreciation equity ETF offering. But kind of broadly, we're getting more and more engagement and are increasingly encouraged by interest in ETFs. With regard to whether it's just cannibalizing the open-ended 40 Act business, I think there's an element of that, but I also think we're attracting a lot of new investors. What you find is that there are certain advisors that use ETFs exclusively. And until we had an ETF lineup, we weren't able to engage or deliver our strategies to those advisors. Tim Coyne and our USI Wealth Broker-Dealer Financial Advisory team have done a really good job of getting out into the marketplace and ultimately kind of giving people a sense for our strategies and why they could be appropriate in their clients' portfolios. We're really pleased with how they're performing. We think there's a long way to go there. It's early days, and I would say for us the momentum has really just started to build frankly kind of over the course of the last several months. I'll just say a few words with regard to expense management. We're trying to take an approach that really reflects our long-term priorities. We do want to invest against our strategic initiatives and invest for growth. We want to invest in our talent and maintain our culture and have the ability to be central to our clients and reach more clients. In order to do that and sustain profitability in various market environments, we're going to have to be more efficient, we're going to have to be better at prioritization, we're going to have to make space to invest in and acquire new skills. So, we should be able to drive additional savings through process improvement and optimization over time, but we're going to want to be able to use that to invest in our business and to put the company in a position to be successful over the long term. Yes, Craig, good morning. Thank you for the question. Look, our priorities with regard to M&A typically don't change quarter-to-quarter. We are constantly evaluating opportunities to add new capabilities that we don't currently offer and that are important to our clients. We typically evaluate that relative to developing something organically. So, we're evaluating strategic opportunities. It's a stated goal of ours to build our alternatives business over time. So, it's natural that as opportunities present themselves in areas like real estate and infrastructure, as you suggest, that we would evaluate them. Look, we're only going to do things that we believe are compelling. We're only going to do things where we believe there is real cultural fit. We want to associate ourselves with investors and teams that are performance-oriented, that are client-focused and that have a long-term orientation. So, when those opportunities present themselves, we're going to do work and, ultimately, feel like -- ultimately determine whether or not we should engage and do more work and whether it's something that we might move forward with. There isn't anything that's imminent right now, but this is an active time in the industry from a consolidation perspective. With regard to OHA, the Board and I continue to be very happy with the acquisition overall. I think the market backdrop is a little more challenging with regard to capital raising and deployment across private markets, private credit and private equity, but it's a moment in time. I'm very enthusiastic about OHA business in the long term. They are talented investors with solid performance and a very strong reputation and great client relationships. I'm also encouraged by the work that our distribution teams are doing around the globe as they've spent time learning OHA's offering and they are beginning to bring new opportunities from our client relationships to OHA. Last thing I'd say about this is I'm really excited about our joint BDC, where we've noted we've secured $600 million of seed cap and are building a pipeline of intermediaries to partner with for distribution. Again, demand is muted in this space right now. But we think it's a compelling product. It's an area that we didn't serve in the past, either T. Rowe Price or OHA. So, we feel like we can have a preeminent product on those platforms when demand for the private credit BDC type vehicle comes back. Yes. Glenn, it's a good question. It is an unusual moment in time. If you look at where most of the inflows have come in the industry, it's been in passive, a lot of that in ETF and in money market. People are getting yields on money market funds that they haven't had in 15 years or more. And it's an uncertain environment. I think there are a lot of investors that are on sidelines that are waiting for the Fed to get out of the way or waiting for a more attractive buying opportunity. I'd also say that it's been a narrow market. You'd note that the market is up quite a bit. It's been driven by kind of a very narrow portion of the market and a small number of overall names. So there hasn't been as broad participation as you might expect. Look, I still believe that good performance will drive flows across vehicles. And we saw this quarter inflows into a number of strategies including funds where performance was good. Again, I think longer term, there is a shift away from open-ended 40 Act mutual funds in favor of other vehicles, you see that in fund to trust migration in our retirement business. And as you noted, SMA and ETF are both growing more rapidly. But we're I think moving quickly to offer a broader range of strategies across those vehicles. So, while the trends that you note are real, in terms of a shift to SMA with lower account minimums, more customization, tax loss optimization, shift to ETF, to some extent, a shift to thematic or shift to passive, I think those are things that we can navigate if we leverage our, I think, best-in-class global investment platform, global research platform across equities and fixed income. All of those are opportunities that we should be able to address, that I think we've made progress in building out our shelf space and availability and we'll make further progress with -- going forward. So look, I deeply believe that there will always be a market for active management that excellent security selection will drive value. And I think it's incumbent on us to engage with our clients to understand kind of how we can deliver that value to them. So, I think there's an element of this, Glenn, that is cyclical, that is kind of where we are today. And kind of ultimately, you'll see behavior change and money flow back to strategies where you have a very good performance. But there's also an element of it that I think is likely to be more enduring, which is why we're working hard on SMA, ETF, things like the OCredit, BDC, we want to be more present and better represented in areas where we've been less well represented in the past because there are some changing demand trends. Yes, I'll start and ask Jen to offer her perspective as well. I'll start with our retirement plan services business or our bundled 401(k) recordkeeping business. It's a business that overall I would characterize as healthy. We are growing in what we call the core market, which is below the large enterprise market. We're expanding our coverage of advisors that specialize in retirement and recordkeeping for small-, medium-sized businesses. And kind of overall, I think it's a business that is executing quite well for us. Where we have some challenges is in, we often have planned deconversions when there is consolidation where you have one of those large enterprises by a midcap or more medium-sized company that's one of our clients. So that's pressured that business to some extent, but we've largely been able to set that with growth in the core market. And I feel good about our momentum there. So, I'll leave that for the 401(k) recordkeeping business. In terms of the DC investment only or institutional defined contribution business, I'd say it's more mixed. We continue to meet with success in the retirement date franchise there. But it's an area where we were very well represented in large-cap growth. And that we have had some terminations from plans as a result of performance in that channel and that has put some pressure on close. It's part of the reason why we've called it out. I think it's been particularly elevated or acute in the first part of this year. I don't think we're out of the woods yet with regard to that. But I think if we continue to drive performance and get back to our historical standards, eventually that will run its course. Yes, I'm not going to comment on specifically what the underlying drivers are of the compensation accrual. I will say that our approach and philosophy around incentive compensation does emphasize longer-term track records. And kind of how you define that really depends on the tenure of the investment professional. But we look not only at the current year results, but at three-, five- and even 10-year results for long-tenured portfolio managers. So, our incentives are basically designed to reflect the long-term performance for investment proposals. But you've got to remember, we have 8,000 associates. And we have people that are doing a lot of different things in the organization. We also have a very broad range of strategies. So kind of while we might have delivered disappointing three- and five-year results in certain strategies, we have other strategies where you have excellent results. So, kind of at the end of the day, as I've said before, we're really focused on, from an expense perspective overall, making sure that we have the capacity to attract and retain world-class diverse talent and maintain our culture. And those are the things that I think are really essential for us to be able to deliver for our clients over time and to be able to deliver for our shareholders. I think I've said this now maybe the third time. Our approach here is to have a balanced -- a balance between driving efficiency overall, and that's throughout the organization, making sure that we're getting value out of all of our roles, making sure that we are a company that is dynamic and, in the long term, has growth opportunity in a way that will allow us to sustain our culture and have the resources to compensate and attract top diverse talent throughout the organization, but particularly in investments. Look, our retention is very strong. I think we have a very strong culture. Our compensation is based on all of the market data that we have, very competitive, if not compelling. I expect it will remain the case. The vast majority of the headcount initiatives did not impact investments. So, it seems to be something that is very much top of mind for a handful of you all, but it's not something that I particularly am overly concerned with. It's something that we're always very, very focused on. But there's no question in my mind that we have the capacity and intent to make sure that our compensation practices are very competitive and that we have appropriate incentives in place for people throughout the organization. Again, the proof is in the pudding there, if you look at our investment professional retention, I think it's excellent. Our retention throughout the organization is quite strong. What we're doing, I think, is very consistent with what you've seen throughout the organization in almost every one of our peers. So, in that way, I would say I do not think that we are an outlier. Jen, I don't know if you'd have anything to add. Yes. And just to close the loop on this, for context, the role eliminations were roundly 2% of our global workforce and impacted multiple functions. The impact across investment divisions was minimal. You talk about dozens of people over a base of between 400 and 500 portfolio managers, associate portfolio managers, investment analysts across our -- all of our investment divisions. I think it's also important to understand that we've invested very steadily over time across our base of investment professionals, and we remain very confident in the strength of our global investment platform and our ability to deliver for clients. If you look back just to the -- since the end of 2013 to June 30 this year, our total number of investors has grown by over 25%. So, if there's any sense or concern that we're not investing in our platform or taking care of our investment talent, I think it's misplaced. All right. I think that was the last question. So, I'll just close by thanking everyone for joining us and for their interest and good questions. As we noted, we're encouraged by investment performance. We continue to be deeply focused on it. And I think we believe that while there are some lingering issues that will impact flows, we have a path to improvement as we work our way through 2024. We believe deeply in our corporate strategic initiatives, and I'm really encouraged by the dedication and commitment of our associates and their focus on delivering for our clients. So, thank you."

Rowe Price's Director of Investor Relations.\nLinsley Carruth: Hello and thank you for joining us today for our first quarterly earnings call. The press release and a new supplemental materials document can be found on our IR website at investors.troweprice.com and from the download link in the upper right of the webcast platform. Today's call will last 45 minutes. Our CEO and President, Rob Sharps and CFO, Jen Dardis, will discuss the company's results for a little over 15 minutes and then we'll open it up to your questions. We ask that you limit it to one question per participant. I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements and reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statement language and the reconciliations to GAAP in the supplemental materials as well as in our press release and 10-Q. Now, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRob Sharps: Thank you, Linsley and welcome to everyone joining us today for our inaugural earnings call. I'd like to start by saying that in rapidly evolving market conditions like the ones we experienced this quarter, what we deliver for our clients matters more than ever. Our clients have entrusted us with over $1.3 trillion of assets and we are deeply focused on helping them meet their long-term financial objectives. I'm pleased by how our teams have responded in these times, staying close to our clients, sharing insights, and helping them navigate uncertainty. Our first quarter shows some encouraging signs. Markets posted gains and our investment performance showed signs of improvement. However, the market environment remains uncertain, and our flows remain under pressure. In light of this uneven backdrop, we continue to carefully manage our financials to preserve our ability to invest in long-term initiatives to support growth. I remain confident in the long-term fundamental value that a global active investment management firm like T. Rowe Price can deliver, no matter the environment. With that, I'll provide an overview of the market context and our investment performance as well as an update on our strategic priorities before turning it over to Jen to review the quarterly financial results. Stocks in the US and most other major equity markets recorded solid gains in the first quarter, although returns were trimmed by the banking turmoil in the US and later Switzerland. Bonds also offered good returns as growth and interest rate expectations moderated. A flight to safety following the banking turmoil led to a sharp decrease in US treasury yields, especially in the two-year yield. The yield curve stayed inverted, however, which may be an indicator of the coming recession. Stock returns in the US vary markedly. Turmoil in the banking sector and signs of ebbing growth and inflation pressures led to lower treasury yields and boosted gross shares by increasingly implied value of future earnings. The NASDAQ Composite Index jumped nearly 17% and technology shares within the S&P 500 Index returned nearly 22%, including dividends during the first quarter. Conversely, declines in bank stocks and oil prices contributed to a modest overall decline in the small-cap Russell 2000 Value Index. Monetary and fiscal tightening, healing supply chains and easing energy prices helped lower inflation in most major economies, even if not yet to central banker satisfaction. The annual headline inflation rate fell from 6.4% to 5% over the quarter in the US and from 9.2% to 6.9% in the Eurozone with UK inflation being an outlier in both direction and magnitude. In this choppy market environment, we saw our investment performance improve for some of our equity and fixed income strategies did struggle last year. While it was reassuring to see performance rebound in a number of key strategies in the first quarter, we are keenly aware that one quarter does not make a trend, especially in such an unsettled macro environment. Periods of market transition and elevated uncertainty can work to the advantage of quality active managers. Near-term dislocations often create long-term opportunities, as the market refocuses on fundamental drivers such as valuation and earnings quality. Our firm has navigated both sides of the investment performance cycle before. We persevered by adhering to our rigorous investment process and leveraging the insights generated by our global research platform. The solid long-term track record of our target date franchise reflects these strengths, as does the performance of our value and core equity strategies last year. And I'm encouraged by the resilience of our US equity research strategy, where more than 25 of our TRPA research analysts contribute to the portfolio in their focused area of expertise. As a fundamental research-driven investment organization, our deep sector expertise and long-standing engagement with management teams is pivotal to understanding the long-term strategy and goals of the companies we invest in. We are proud that among more than 330 asset management firms nominated, we came in a very close second in institutional investors inaugural 2023 ranking of America's Top Asset Management Firms. I am pleased that so many corporate voters recognized our differentiated research and corporate access model. Despite these bright spots, net flows continue to be under pressure. As we reported, net outflows for the first quarter were $16.1 billion. The primary driver was net outflows in our large-cap growth equity strategies, reflecting both continued weak industry demand and the lagging impact of investment performance challenges in these strategies. While those net outflows were broad based, they were particularly apparent in our United States defined contribution investment only and broker-dealer channels. We continue to face headwinds with net flows to our large-cap growth strategies, but we expect that they will abate with sustained investment performance and time. On the positive side, we recorded $7.5 billion of net inflows into the target date franchise and over $250 million in net flows in each of global multi-sector bond, US dividend growth, US taxable cash management, US all-cap opportunities and US short-term bond strategies during the quarter. We expect that we will return the firm to positive organic growth over time with a combination of more constructive markets, sustained improved performance in key strategies, traction with a broader range of vehicles and continued progress with our strategic initiatives. Although, excellent investment performance is central to our long-term success, our industry has gotten more competitive. We are committed to investing in the areas where we have scaled businesses such as our leading retirement franchise and to building capabilities to support future growth. We see an opportunity to elevate our focus on areas where we have already invested resources over many years and where we believe we have the greatest opportunity for growth and long-term success. I would like to highlight some areas of focus and our progress against our strategic initiatives. We are bolstering our US intermediary wealth channel, leveraging and extending the partnerships we have built. This quarter, we were named a top tier provider to another one of the largest intermediary firms in the industry. With this decision, we are now a top-tier partner with six of the 10 largest intermediary firms in this space. We are also broadening our range of products to ensure we deliver our investment strategies in the vehicle of choice. As more advisers look to do more with fewer investment management partners, we are well-positioned to build on these deep partnerships. We are accelerating growth in international markets with a focus on unlocking growth in select countries where we have existing businesses that offer the greatest opportunity. During this quarter, I spent two weeks in Asia where we have 365 associates and clients representing $50 billion of assets under management. I had a chance to spend time with several of our clients and it reinforced for me the depth of relationships that we are building in the region and the opportunity that we have to do much more with them over time. In our direct retail business, we are enhancing our individual investor client experience through an improved digital experience and differentiated service offering. We recently completed the acquisition of Retiree, Inc. a fintech firm that offers innovative retirement income planning software. This acquisition will complement and expand our retirement income capabilities across our audiences with planning tools for individuals and practitioner tools for financial professionals. We expect to use the technology in our retail direct, defined contribution and wealth management channels. Finally, we are expanding our private markets and alternative capabilities by leveraging our distribution channels and OHA's investment capabilities. As we previously shared, we acquired OHA to accelerate our expansion into alternative investments. Our first joint co-branded product, T. Rowe Price OHA Select Private Credit Fund, or OCredit [ph], is advancing. This business development company is a retail product developed to leverage OHA's private credit investment expertise with T. Rowe Price's distribution capabilities. We expect to close the seed round in the second quarter and launch OCredit more broadly later this year. I am grateful to our associates around the world for focusing on delivering for our existing clients and for continuing to find new ways to bring what we do to a broader, more global base of clients. I will now turn to Jen to cover our financial results for Q1.\nJen Dardis: Thank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll provide a summary of our financial results and key drivers, including assets under management and flows, revenue and operating expenses, and I'll conclude with a few comments on capital management before we take questions. Our adjusted earnings per share was $1.69 for Q1 2023 versus $1.74 in Q4 2022 and $2.62 in Q1 2022. Compared with Q4 2022, adjusted operating income was up 3.7% to $528 million, primarily on a decline in expenses. A higher effective tax rate in the quarter drove the modest decline in adjusted EPS from Q4 2022. The change versus Q1 2022 reflects the decline in AUM and revenues from sharply lower markets and net outflows over the last 12 months. Looking at the drivers behind these results, we ended the quarter with $1.3 trillion in AUM, an increase of $67 billion from December 31st, 2022. Improving markets in Q1 increased assets by $83 billion, offset by $16 billion in net outflows. Our average assets for the quarter were $1.3 trillion, which was up 3% from Q4 2022, but down 15. 2% from Q1 2022. We've provided some detail on flows on page six of the supplemental materials, but as Rob mentioned, outflows in Q1 were concentrated. We posted $23.5 billion of outflows in global equities with the majority of the net amount attributable to our US large-cap growth equity strategies. On a channel view, outflows were largely focused in our US DCIO and broker-dealer channels and with a few institutional clients. We experienced net outflows across all regions with the percentage of AUM sourced from outside the US, ending the quarter at 8.9%. There were a few notable areas of strength in the quarter, including $7.5 billion of net inflows into the target date franchise, $1.3 billion of net inflows into international fixed income strategies, and nearly $200 million of net inflows into alternatives. During Q1, we typically see some seasonality in target date flows in part due to planned sponsor lineup activity around the turn of the year. We've provided an AUM inflows breakdown by institutional and retail client type, which replaces the vehicle views we have provided in the past. The assets and flows for global institutions and DC plans, including those we record keep and those we manage on an investment-only basis are reflected in the institutional bar. The retail assets and flows include both direct and intermediary sold retail accounts, including our platform and broker-dealer channels. Our effective fee rate of 42.7 basis points for the quarter was a slight uptick from Q4 2022. This reflects a bit of noise from mix shift during the quarter. Over time, we continue to see modest downward fee pressure in line with new vehicle adoption and overall industry pricing headwinds. Turning to revenues, our Q1 adjusted net revenues were $1.5 billion, with $1.4 billion from investment advisory revenues. We saw a small increase in net investment advisory revenues from Q4 2022 on higher average assets versus the fourth quarter. Compared with Q1 2022, investment advisory revenues were down 16.3%, reflecting the decline in average AUM. Capital allocation based income for the quarter was $16.9 million. And as a reminder, capital allocation-based income includes the change in accrued carried interest from some of our alternative funds along with acquisition-related amortization. Additionally, accrued carried interest will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the underlying portfolio company-specific performance, along with the market environment at the end of each quarterly period. This quarter was down from Q1 2022 due to a more challenging market environment than a year ago. It was also down from Q4 2022 as that period included additional accrued carried interest to cover required tax distributions. Typically, 50% to 60% of accrued carried interest is expected to be retained in operating income as the remainder is passed through to fund partners who are also employees and recognized as compensation expense. We've included additional details about accrued carried interest on page 11 of the supplemental materials. Now, shifting to expenses. Adjusted operating expenses were about $1 billion, which is a decrease of 1.6% from Q1 2022 and down 4.7% from Q4 2022. The decline from Q4 2022 is largely driven by the declines in compensations, benefits and related along with the accrued carried interest related compensation. Compensation benefits and related costs, which excludes the carried interest-related compensation, was $593 million for the quarter, which was in line with Q1 2022 and down about $31 million from Q4 2022. Lower compensation expenses in Q1 primarily reflect lower stock-based compensation expense related to the firm's annual equity grant, as well as the absence of severance and other costs associated with the workforce reduction action recognized in Q4 2022, which more than offset the Q1 impact of annual increases. As a reminder, about a-third of our adjusted operating expenses excluding compensation related to carried interest, are driven by AUM and revenues. This is predominantly cash and stock-based incentive compensation and distribution expenses. For the balance of the year, we maintain the prior guidance that we expect our adjusted operating expenses, excluding capital allocation-based income to grow in the range of 2% to 6% over the comparative full year 2022 amount of $4.1 billion. Though we have started the year below the 2% to 6% range, the savings associated with the workforce reduction action in late 2022 will be offset through the year as we rehire for new skill sets aligned to our strategic initiatives. Based on the current market environment, we are trending to land at or below the midpoint of that range. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate of 30.3% was outside the annual range we gave in January, as we increased the valuation allowances recognized on certain foreign-based deferred tax assets, including net operating losses. Currently, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full year 2023 will be in the range of 26.5% to 29.5%. In a more cash-constrained environment, we continue to prioritize the recurring dividend, which we increased for the 37th consecutive year since the firm's initial public offering in 1986. Our near-term focus beyond the dividend is to balance the needs for seed capital and opportunistic buybacks over the long term to offset dilution from the equity incentive programs and to preserve cash for potential M&A. In Q1, we initiated minimal stock buybacks. We expect to repurchase some during the remainder of the year, though not at the same level as 2021 and 2022 when we were offsetting the shares issued for the OHA purchase. We've also been modestly rebuilding our cash position since the purchase of OHA in late 2021 to maintain our strong balance sheet. We added roughly $233 million in cash reserves in 2022. We are more focused than ever on prioritizing investment in our strategic initiatives, maintaining efficient operations and carefully managing our cash position. This financial discipline gives us the strength to navigate through market volatility and stay focused on the long term. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Please standby while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Fannon with Jefferies LLC. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning and thanks for doing the call. I was hoping you could give us a broader progress report on the OHA transaction. You talked about a product that's coming to market here. But more broadly, can you talk about their performance, what growth has been stand-alone, because we know they were growing reasonably well before you bought them, but AUM hasn't really moved that much. So maybe just a little bit more context around that business today and what it's done since you've owned it? And maybe what you see as the opportunity over the next 12 to 24 months?\nRob Sharps: Good morning, Dan. Thank you for the question. I would characterize our first year with OHA at a high level as very successful. We've integrated the appropriate functions and worked really hard to identify distribution synergies, the ability to take their strategies to institutional clients and prospects around the globe and also to take OHA capabilities into the wealth channel. I think the specific product that you're referring to is our T. Rowe Price OHA Credit BDC. We've made a lot of progress with regard to the institutional seed and expect to launch it late this year in the wealth channel. In terms of their performance, it's remained quite strong. Their absolute results have been impacted by the difficult overall fixed income and credit markets over the course of the last year. And that's also impacted their incentive income and fees and carry, but their relative performance has remained very, very strong. So we're really pleased right now with the progress that we've made and feel very confident with regard to the opportunity and potential that our teams have together.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Thank you. Maybe a follow-on on OHA and broadened a little bit. I'm curious on how OHA and the T. Rowe Price fixed income teams can work together, can learn from each other? And maybe any observations you might have on trends in private versus public credit markets? And how you can design products, how you can learn from each other from that? Thanks, Rob.\nRob Sharps: Yeah, Glenn, we purposefully kept the investment teams largely separate. OHA had a 30-year track record of delivering great investment results for their clients in private credit and distressed in their liquid offerings. I do think there's some overlap in expertise, but we really wanted to minimize disruption in terms of the overall investment philosophy and process and in terms of the culture. We are exploring ways to leverage ideas across the two platforms and share perspectives, particularly at the industry level. But we don't have any intention of integrating the T. Rowe Price fixed income platform with the OHA platform. I think that was one of the tenants of the acquisition at the outset. We are really, really focused on driving distribution synergy. We see a very large opportunity long-term, again, to take OHA to institutions around the globe, but also to take them into the broker-dealer and advisory channel. And that's a place where T. Rowe Price has very strong relationships at the home office. It's a place where T. Rowe Price has very strong relationships and support in the field. Many of the wealth platforms have done business with OHA in the past and they are more traditional structures and vehicles. And we're really excited for the opportunity to use more evergreen vehicles to take their capabilities there. Again, we expect to show some progress in that regard later this year and think the opportunity will build. I will say that, in general, the demand for private credit broadly is softer than what it was 12 or 18 months ago. There's a denominator effect where people's allocation to private assets has risen as marks have lagged the decline in public markets. I think in general, particularly on the wealth platforms, a number of advisers and clients are more -- taking a more cautious approach. I think there's a lot on the sidelines. And I think if you look at where spreads and absolute rates are now, the return and risk return profile of a well-managed private credit strategy is really compelling. So, we do see substantial opportunity there. But I think the current demand and the current capital raising is softer than the trends that you would have seen if you go back to 2020, 2021, or early 2022.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey good morning. Thanks. So, I appreciate the strong seasonal target date flows. But in that channel more broadly, any sign that last year's performance issues are driving plans or consultants to rethink having to run the lineup? And secondly, remind us how active you can be in those discussions, or do you just find out after they make the decision? Thank you.\nRob Sharps: Yes, I'll take the second part of the question first. We're very engaged and generally have the opportunity to share our outlook and give a performance update. I think that's not the case in every instance. We reach plans in a number of ways. In some instances, we are the record keeper and we have direct interaction. In some instances, we go directly to the plan sponsor. And in those instances, have through a direct DCIO opportunity on another record keepers platform have the opportunity to interact with the client or prospect. And in a number of instances, we work through aggregators or advisers. And there, we really are able to articulate our value proposition with those folks, and it's more indirect to the end client. When I think about the target date business, first thing I would say is that, in general, people are less sensitive to near-term performance than they might be with single strategies. People tend to focus much more on three, five, and 10-year results just given the nature of the objective being retirement and the long-dated return objective of retirement investing and savings. If you look at our flows in Q1, as you mentioned, they were very strong. I think our pipeline remains very robust. Long-term performance is important and when you have an active offering, ultimately, you're going to need to deliver it. I think if you look at our retirement date fund, it is -- it offers the strongest value proposition in the industry. We have a number of alpha-rich diversifiers in our building block lineup from non-investment-grade credit to emerging markets in small and mid-cap equity areas where you can add a tremendous amount of value as an active manager. And I'm very confident that if you continue to look at rolling three and five-year periods that our retirement date franchise will sort to the top and that we can continue to grow that franchise. And yes, I feel quite good about it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and thanks for hosting the earnings call. Really appreciate the increased transparency and chance to engage regularly. So on expenses, no change to the growth expectations. That's helpful and helpful to get the color around what the profile of the quarter -- the year will look like? Could you maybe give a breakdown of how much of this expense growth is tied to core inflation, maybe impact of the market-sensitive expenses? And then how much of the growth you are allocating to continued investments in the firm? Thank you.\nJen Dardis: Thanks, Brennan. So I'll start, as a reminder, we had in the commentary that about a-third of our expenses are market-driven in some way, either related to assets under management or revenues. And so, we typically look at the fluctuations during the quarter in markets to give a sense for what the range might be for those market-driven expenses. So that would be built into the guide that we have with the 2% to 6%. As far as investments in strategic initiatives, we haven't broken it out specifically, but last -- when we had the earnings release at the end of the year, we talked about the fact that we had taken actions last year that accounted for about $85 million worth of spend, that we had taken out of the expense base run rate coming out of the end of the year to be able to reinvest this year. So that's about the level that we're looking at for investments in new things. Again, most of these are not new areas that we're investing in. There are extensions of existing places where we're already active either in a distribution sense or in a product construct. So, again, not as many de novo investments, but further follow-on investments that we have in the business. If we think about the first part of your question about inflation, certainly, that's something that we saw mid-year in the labor market context. We had announced that we had done an increase of 4% for 85% of our associates in salaries. And that impact has obviously rolled through into our expense base this year. But some of the steps we've taken have been to try to mitigate that headwind in the labor market. Obviously, we've also seen cost increases in other places where we have third-party spend. But, again, trying to actively manage that as we go forward.\nRob Sharps: Yes. I would just say, we really believe we have a big opportunity to drive share in US wealth and in our focus markets around the world, but we also recognize that we need to drive efficiency and productivity in order to fund those investments going forward, and we're laser-focused on doing that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question as well. Rob, a little bit maybe bigger picture question about sort of the firms or EPS and operating income growth algorithm over the next couple of years. So, as you sort of think about your comments regarding organic growth and organic base, your growth being maybe challenged for some period of time, expense growth, is it kind of like in this mid-single-digit range? So that obviously just kind of comes down to the market, but do you see areas where you could flex expenses more where the sort of earnings growth algorithm can improve even if organic growth remains challenged for some time?\nRob Sharps: Yes. Alex, thanks for the question. The first thing I would say is that, we see a path back to organic growth, but it is going to take some time. And in the interim, I do think we'll need to manage expenses in order to bridge that gap. So, as I've said before, we do want to continue to invest in our strategic initiatives to get back to consistent organic growth. But we're -- we need to be very disciplined with regard to how we get there. Look, in terms of the algorithm, the market does play a big part when you have a $1.3 trillion AUM installed base and where kind of over half of that is in equities. That said, flows can play a part in time. Excess return and performance can play a part in time. Capital deployment can play a part in time. We have a number of areas that I think can drive longer-term growth, whether it's OHA or deep partnerships in the intermediary channel, whether it's continued growth in our focus markets. But, look, I think it's realistic to say during this period of time where our flows are under pressure and our organic growth is negative, that we will have to be more focused on expenses and that would there be just a less robust overall EPS growth algorithm. And that's just the arithmetic of it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kenneth Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nKenneth Worthington: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Investors domiciled outside the US was 9% in the quarter. This has historically been a faster-growing part of the business that got to, I think, 9.9% at the end of 2021 after the OHA deal closed. I think you have allocated significant resources to this build-out outside the US. I guess, first, are you getting the results commensurate with the resources allocated? And second, can you talk about the outlook for returning the non-US business growth towards better than enterprise growth period again? Thanks.\nJen Dardis: Thanks, Ken, and I appreciate the question. So as we look at the business outside the US, obviously, it's not a single market. Those are a number of individual markets, and we've been investing across a series of focused markets outside the US. I would say, over the long term, we continue to see growth out in those markets as an important leg of area for potential growth, particularly in core markets in Japan and Australia, the UK, Italy, Germany and Canada as we think about opportunities to grow the business. If we think about the near term and you're referencing, I believe, the first quarter flows, you can see some lumpiness within that business, because there are some institutional flows. And, obviously, if we think about the intersection between the comments we made on the large cap equity business and the flows there, we have exposure to those asset classes in all of those markets as well. So in the short term, you can see the impact of the same trends that we saw across the broader part of the business. But over the long term, we expect that that's an opportunity for growth for us. And specifically about the results that we're seeing for what we've invested there, I think we've been very pleased with the places where we've made core investments. Rob mentioned during his comments, the client meetings that he had had while he was in Asia, and we think there are some really good opportunities for us over the long term.\nRob Sharps: Yes. I would say our pipeline in Japan and Australia, in particular, is encouraging, Ken. But again, this is a business where there are some sizable mandates is \u2013 I don\u2019t think you can necessarily read quarter in and quarter out, you can make a trend. I do expect that this business will grow more quickly than the rest of the business, probably more so APAC than EMEA. But kind of overall I think we\u2019re reasonably confident that if you look at it, you kind of want a two or three year planning horizon that the growth rates will be meaningfully higher than the overall book.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nBill Katz: Thank you very much and thank you for hosting the call and the added disclosure, it very helpful. Just focusing on page six of the supplement and thank you for the extra detail. It would appear that you\u2019re loosing share across vehicle, product and geography and maybe distribution channel. And I appreciate its one quarter, but last five quarter sort of seems has to be the trend. So how do you think about the urgency to drive better growth versus M&A and you mentioned the focus on sort of rebuilding cash. You have a very strong balance sheet to begin with. How much cash is necessary and then how you think about incremental M&A to maybe catalyze overall organic growth? Thank you.\nRob Sharps: Thanks for the question, Bill. The first thing I would say is in terms of share, there's a meaningful element of it that is mix related. I'll note that we have had positive flows in fixed income overall, which is above category. I think our target date results continue to be robust. We've had positive flows turn in this category. But you're right, we have had meaningful outflows in parts of our equity franchise, and those parts of our equity franchise are a substantial part of the business. So kind of ultimately, I think if you look at that in aggregate, it has led to share loss over the more recent time horizon. Look, we want to manage this business with a very long-term lens. I think that we do want to have more exposure to parts of the business, whether it is product or vehicle or asset class or geography that have more tailwinds of growth, and we think we can do that organically. But we also will continue to look very seriously at acquisition opportunities. But I think we have a very high bar for acquisitions. They need to have minimal disruption to our ability to deliver on our existing commitments to clients and our culture. They have to be a strategic fit. They have to make financial sense. Most deals in this industry, the weight of the evidence would suggest that they haven't been compelling. So, again, I think we will continue to look. And I think OHA and Retiree were both examples of the sorts of things that can be meaningfully additive. OHA obviously much, much greater in scale and scope. But nonetheless, I mean, we think that M&A is a tool that can help us evolve our business mix and kind of help us build more growth into the business in time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. \nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you. You mentioned that you're looking to broaden out the range of products and vehicles. I was hoping you could elaborate on that where you see white space from a product standpoint and vehicle standpoint. And maybe you could talk a little bit about how you're building out the SMA platform and also active ETFs and some of the actions that you could take there to accelerate growth?\nRob Sharps: Sure. I'll start with ETFs. We have been in market for a couple of years. We just crossed $1 billion in AUM in our ETFs and I would say that momentum is building. Our first offerings in the equity space were semitransparent, which was new. And I'd say, it took a little while for advisers and investors to get comfortable with the semi-transparent approach. But as I say, we've been building substantial momentum with TCHP with TDBG. We also are in market with some transparent active fixed income ETFs, which are also beginning to build momentum. We will launch an additional series of ETFs toward the middle of this year and are really excited about the opportunity that those will bring. In mid-March, we filed registration statements with the SEC for five new active equity ETFs, a value ETF, a growth ETF, an international ETF, small and mid-cap ETF and capital appreciation equity ETF and feel very good based on feedback that we've gotten from investors, advisers and kind of users of ETFs that these will -- can really allow us to meet the clearly strong demand in the ETF category, and ultimately will also allow us to be in market with ETF models using our asset allocation capabilities. So we'll be quite active and kind of really feel like we've got an approach that will allow us to continue to build momentum and have a bigger impact in ETFs. In terms of SMA, we, last week -- or in late April, seeded four new muni SMAs, which will be available later in Q2. That will bring us to 20 strategies offered as SMAs. We have placement with all of the top 10 SMA distributors and kind of continuously hear feedback from the wealth platforms that they want to do more with fewer high-quality investment management firms and that they want strategies available across vehicle ranges. So mutual funds, ETFs, SMAs, model account delivery, et cetera. I also would add, globally, we'd continue to scale vehicles that will allow us to penetrate the intermediary market in those focused markets that Jen mentioned earlier. And then finally, the BDC is a new vehicle and a new product for us. So I think we're investing to be top of mind and very relevant with our intermediary partners globally, again, whether that's at the home office level or in the field.\nJen Dardis: I would just add to that, beyond the products themselves and the vehicles that they're offered in, this intersects with the investments that Rob mentioned earlier, where we're making investments behind our distribution, sales, marketing teams with the US wealth channel, where a lot of these vehicles are sold. And so, it's not just developing the products and putting them out there, but actually putting the marketing and sales resources behind it to make sure that we can pull those vehicles all the way through to the end client.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nFinian O'Shea: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Another for Oak Hill. Can you give us a sense of employee retention as the firm integrates into T. Rowe? And is OCREDIT intended to expand into direct lending as many of your peers focus on, or might you draw on more of a mix of the firm's private credit capabilities? Thank you.\nRob Sharps: With regard to OHA associate retention, there's really been no change. It's been very strong. That's a big part of the reason why we kept the investment platform separate again, to minimize disruption and to allow them to sustain their momentum. They've got great talent. And there's -- generally, in our business, some small amount of turnover, particularly among more junior associates. But we've seen -- we haven't -- have not seen any regrettable attrition at the more senior associate or partner level at OHA. OCREDIT will have the opportunity to invest in both private and liquid credit. I think the target for OCREDIT is -- will be more in private credit, but kind of really will have flexibility to make investments where the risk return is most compelling.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, good morning, everyone. Rob, my question is a long-term one on the 401(k) business. From a timing standpoint, where do you think we are in the unbundling theme where 401(k) plan sponsors have been separating record keepers from asset manager? And I know this doesn't impact your bigger DCO business, but we wanted your perspective on if the bulk of these migrations are now behind us?\nRob Sharps: Craig, I think it's difficult to say. This is a trend that's been unfolding for a relatively long period of time, and there continues to be consolidation in the record-keeping business. Recordkeeping is a scale business. That said, I think T. Rowe Price has a very compelling value proposition in RPS. And particularly in core market, we're growing the number of plans and continuing to get attractive economics with the majority of the AUM on the plan managed by T. Rowe Price and in particular, having very strong representation of our target date funds. So, look, I think the trend towards consolidation and unbundling of asset management and record keeping is probably fairly far along. I also would say, I think, there will always be a place for a well done bundled recordkeeping offering in parts of the market, particularly in what we characterize as the core markets, so below the large enterprise level, where I think you can really deliver a very compelling value proposition. And if you were to look at our plan count, if you were to look at our flows, I mean the core RPS market is a market that we're investing in. We're investing in our coverage and territories and one that we think will be a growth driver for us over the course of the next several years. So while the unbundling trend, I think, is particularly important at the very large enterprise level, I don't think it's something that is a meaningful threat to our business. Again, as you mentioned, we have a very sizable representation in DCIO. We interact with the 401(k) market in a number of different ways, right? DCIO direct to the plan sponsor, DCIO through consultants and advisers, record-keeping where we sell directly to the plan sponsor, record-keeping through aggregators and advisers. Over 60% of our AUM is retirement related, and we've got a multi-pronged strategy to penetrate that opportunity. I think we've got a great value proposition with, as I've mentioned before, our range of retirement date funds. So this is a business that I'm pretty enthusiastic about. And I would say I don't spend a lot of time thinking about the disaggregation of recordkeeping and asset management at the very large plan level. And that's something that we've lived with for a decade or more.\nJen Dardis: Yeah. And if anything, that's benefited us over time, because as we've been able to bring our target date to plans, we don't record keep, because, obviously, we're not among the largest record keepers in the business as that consolidation has happened. So, if anything, this trend has helped us to build the target date franchise over time.\nRob Sharps: Okay. I think that was the last question. In closing, I just thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in T. Rowe Price. As we shared, I think Q1 showed promising signs in the market backdrop and also some improved investment performance as well as strong target date net flows. And while the market environment remains uncertain, I'm very pleased with how our associates and our teams are responding. And we remain deeply committed and focused on helping our clients meet their long-term financial objectives. So, again, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jen Dardis",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll provide a summary of our financial results and key drivers, including assets under management and flows, revenue and operating expenses, and I'll conclude with a few comments on capital management before we take questions. Our adjusted earnings per share was $1.69 for Q1 2023 versus $1.74 in Q4 2022 and $2.62 in Q1 2022. Compared with Q4 2022, adjusted operating income was up 3.7% to $528 million, primarily on a decline in expenses. A higher effective tax rate in the quarter drove the modest decline in adjusted EPS from Q4 2022. The change versus Q1 2022 reflects the decline in AUM and revenues from sharply lower markets and net outflows over the last 12 months. Looking at the drivers behind these results, we ended the quarter with $1.3 trillion in AUM, an increase of $67 billion from December 31st, 2022. Improving markets in Q1 increased assets by $83 billion, offset by $16 billion in net outflows. Our average assets for the quarter were $1.3 trillion, which was up 3% from Q4 2022, but down 15. 2% from Q1 2022. We've provided some detail on flows on page six of the supplemental materials, but as Rob mentioned, outflows in Q1 were concentrated. We posted $23.5 billion of outflows in global equities with the majority of the net amount attributable to our US large-cap growth equity strategies. On a channel view, outflows were largely focused in our US DCIO and broker-dealer channels and with a few institutional clients. We experienced net outflows across all regions with the percentage of AUM sourced from outside the US, ending the quarter at 8.9%. There were a few notable areas of strength in the quarter, including $7.5 billion of net inflows into the target date franchise, $1.3 billion of net inflows into international fixed income strategies, and nearly $200 million of net inflows into alternatives. During Q1, we typically see some seasonality in target date flows in part due to planned sponsor lineup activity around the turn of the year. We've provided an AUM inflows breakdown by institutional and retail client type, which replaces the vehicle views we have provided in the past. The assets and flows for global institutions and DC plans, including those we record keep and those we manage on an investment-only basis are reflected in the institutional bar. The retail assets and flows include both direct and intermediary sold retail accounts, including our platform and broker-dealer channels. Our effective fee rate of 42.7 basis points for the quarter was a slight uptick from Q4 2022. This reflects a bit of noise from mix shift during the quarter. Over time, we continue to see modest downward fee pressure in line with new vehicle adoption and overall industry pricing headwinds. Turning to revenues, our Q1 adjusted net revenues were $1.5 billion, with $1.4 billion from investment advisory revenues. We saw a small increase in net investment advisory revenues from Q4 2022 on higher average assets versus the fourth quarter. Compared with Q1 2022, investment advisory revenues were down 16.3%, reflecting the decline in average AUM. Capital allocation based income for the quarter was $16.9 million. And as a reminder, capital allocation-based income includes the change in accrued carried interest from some of our alternative funds along with acquisition-related amortization. Additionally, accrued carried interest will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the underlying portfolio company-specific performance, along with the market environment at the end of each quarterly period. This quarter was down from Q1 2022 due to a more challenging market environment than a year ago. It was also down from Q4 2022 as that period included additional accrued carried interest to cover required tax distributions. Typically, 50% to 60% of accrued carried interest is expected to be retained in operating income as the remainder is passed through to fund partners who are also employees and recognized as compensation expense. We've included additional details about accrued carried interest on page 11 of the supplemental materials. Now, shifting to expenses. Adjusted operating expenses were about $1 billion, which is a decrease of 1.6% from Q1 2022 and down 4.7% from Q4 2022. The decline from Q4 2022 is largely driven by the declines in compensations, benefits and related along with the accrued carried interest related compensation. Compensation benefits and related costs, which excludes the carried interest-related compensation, was $593 million for the quarter, which was in line with Q1 2022 and down about $31 million from Q4 2022. Lower compensation expenses in Q1 primarily reflect lower stock-based compensation expense related to the firm's annual equity grant, as well as the absence of severance and other costs associated with the workforce reduction action recognized in Q4 2022, which more than offset the Q1 impact of annual increases. As a reminder, about a-third of our adjusted operating expenses excluding compensation related to carried interest, are driven by AUM and revenues. This is predominantly cash and stock-based incentive compensation and distribution expenses. For the balance of the year, we maintain the prior guidance that we expect our adjusted operating expenses, excluding capital allocation-based income to grow in the range of 2% to 6% over the comparative full year 2022 amount of $4.1 billion. Though we have started the year below the 2% to 6% range, the savings associated with the workforce reduction action in late 2022 will be offset through the year as we rehire for new skill sets aligned to our strategic initiatives. Based on the current market environment, we are trending to land at or below the midpoint of that range. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate of 30.3% was outside the annual range we gave in January, as we increased the valuation allowances recognized on certain foreign-based deferred tax assets, including net operating losses. Currently, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full year 2023 will be in the range of 26.5% to 29.5%. In a more cash-constrained environment, we continue to prioritize the recurring dividend, which we increased for the 37th consecutive year since the firm's initial public offering in 1986. Our near-term focus beyond the dividend is to balance the needs for seed capital and opportunistic buybacks over the long term to offset dilution from the equity incentive programs and to preserve cash for potential M&A. In Q1, we initiated minimal stock buybacks. We expect to repurchase some during the remainder of the year, though not at the same level as 2021 and 2022 when we were offsetting the shares issued for the OHA purchase. We've also been modestly rebuilding our cash position since the purchase of OHA in late 2021 to maintain our strong balance sheet. We added roughly $233 million in cash reserves in 2022. We are more focused than ever on prioritizing investment in our strategic initiatives, maintaining efficient operations and carefully managing our cash position. This financial discipline gives us the strength to navigate through market volatility and stay focused on the long term. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for Q&A. Thanks, Brennan. So I'll start, as a reminder, we had in the commentary that about a-third of our expenses are market-driven in some way, either related to assets under management or revenues. And so, we typically look at the fluctuations during the quarter in markets to give a sense for what the range might be for those market-driven expenses. So that would be built into the guide that we have with the 2% to 6%. As far as investments in strategic initiatives, we haven't broken it out specifically, but last -- when we had the earnings release at the end of the year, we talked about the fact that we had taken actions last year that accounted for about $85 million worth of spend, that we had taken out of the expense base run rate coming out of the end of the year to be able to reinvest this year. So that's about the level that we're looking at for investments in new things. Again, most of these are not new areas that we're investing in. There are extensions of existing places where we're already active either in a distribution sense or in a product construct. So, again, not as many de novo investments, but further follow-on investments that we have in the business. If we think about the first part of your question about inflation, certainly, that's something that we saw mid-year in the labor market context. We had announced that we had done an increase of 4% for 85% of our associates in salaries. And that impact has obviously rolled through into our expense base this year. But some of the steps we've taken have been to try to mitigate that headwind in the labor market. Obviously, we've also seen cost increases in other places where we have third-party spend. But, again, trying to actively manage that as we go forward. Thanks, Ken, and I appreciate the question. So as we look at the business outside the US, obviously, it's not a single market. Those are a number of individual markets, and we've been investing across a series of focused markets outside the US. I would say, over the long term, we continue to see growth out in those markets as an important leg of area for potential growth, particularly in core markets in Japan and Australia, the UK, Italy, Germany and Canada as we think about opportunities to grow the business. If we think about the near term and you're referencing, I believe, the first quarter flows, you can see some lumpiness within that business, because there are some institutional flows. And, obviously, if we think about the intersection between the comments we made on the large cap equity business and the flows there, we have exposure to those asset classes in all of those markets as well. So in the short term, you can see the impact of the same trends that we saw across the broader part of the business. But over the long term, we expect that that's an opportunity for growth for us. And specifically about the results that we're seeing for what we've invested there, I think we've been very pleased with the places where we've made core investments. Rob mentioned during his comments, the client meetings that he had had while he was in Asia, and we think there are some really good opportunities for us over the long term. I would just add to that, beyond the products themselves and the vehicles that they're offered in, this intersects with the investments that Rob mentioned earlier, where we're making investments behind our distribution, sales, marketing teams with the US wealth channel, where a lot of these vehicles are sold. And so, it's not just developing the products and putting them out there, but actually putting the marketing and sales resources behind it to make sure that we can pull those vehicles all the way through to the end client. Yeah. And if anything, that's benefited us over time, because as we've been able to bring our target date to plans, we don't record keep, because, obviously, we're not among the largest record keepers in the business as that consolidation has happened. So, if anything, this trend has helped us to build the target date franchise over time."

            "name": "Rob Sharps",
            "content": "Thank you, Linsley and welcome to everyone joining us today for our inaugural earnings call. I'd like to start by saying that in rapidly evolving market conditions like the ones we experienced this quarter, what we deliver for our clients matters more than ever. Our clients have entrusted us with over $1.3 trillion of assets and we are deeply focused on helping them meet their long-term financial objectives. I'm pleased by how our teams have responded in these times, staying close to our clients, sharing insights, and helping them navigate uncertainty. Our first quarter shows some encouraging signs. Markets posted gains and our investment performance showed signs of improvement. However, the market environment remains uncertain, and our flows remain under pressure. In light of this uneven backdrop, we continue to carefully manage our financials to preserve our ability to invest in long-term initiatives to support growth. I remain confident in the long-term fundamental value that a global active investment management firm like T. Rowe Price can deliver, no matter the environment. With that, I'll provide an overview of the market context and our investment performance as well as an update on our strategic priorities before turning it over to Jen to review the quarterly financial results. Stocks in the US and most other major equity markets recorded solid gains in the first quarter, although returns were trimmed by the banking turmoil in the US and later Switzerland. Bonds also offered good returns as growth and interest rate expectations moderated. A flight to safety following the banking turmoil led to a sharp decrease in US treasury yields, especially in the two-year yield. The yield curve stayed inverted, however, which may be an indicator of the coming recession. Stock returns in the US vary markedly. Turmoil in the banking sector and signs of ebbing growth and inflation pressures led to lower treasury yields and boosted gross shares by increasingly implied value of future earnings. The NASDAQ Composite Index jumped nearly 17% and technology shares within the S&P 500 Index returned nearly 22%, including dividends during the first quarter. Conversely, declines in bank stocks and oil prices contributed to a modest overall decline in the small-cap Russell 2000 Value Index. Monetary and fiscal tightening, healing supply chains and easing energy prices helped lower inflation in most major economies, even if not yet to central banker satisfaction. The annual headline inflation rate fell from 6.4% to 5% over the quarter in the US and from 9.2% to 6.9% in the Eurozone with UK inflation being an outlier in both direction and magnitude. In this choppy market environment, we saw our investment performance improve for some of our equity and fixed income strategies did struggle last year. While it was reassuring to see performance rebound in a number of key strategies in the first quarter, we are keenly aware that one quarter does not make a trend, especially in such an unsettled macro environment. Periods of market transition and elevated uncertainty can work to the advantage of quality active managers. Near-term dislocations often create long-term opportunities, as the market refocuses on fundamental drivers such as valuation and earnings quality. Our firm has navigated both sides of the investment performance cycle before. We persevered by adhering to our rigorous investment process and leveraging the insights generated by our global research platform. The solid long-term track record of our target date franchise reflects these strengths, as does the performance of our value and core equity strategies last year. And I'm encouraged by the resilience of our US equity research strategy, where more than 25 of our TRPA research analysts contribute to the portfolio in their focused area of expertise. As a fundamental research-driven investment organization, our deep sector expertise and long-standing engagement with management teams is pivotal to understanding the long-term strategy and goals of the companies we invest in. We are proud that among more than 330 asset management firms nominated, we came in a very close second in institutional investors inaugural 2023 ranking of America's Top Asset Management Firms. I am pleased that so many corporate voters recognized our differentiated research and corporate access model. Despite these bright spots, net flows continue to be under pressure. As we reported, net outflows for the first quarter were $16.1 billion. The primary driver was net outflows in our large-cap growth equity strategies, reflecting both continued weak industry demand and the lagging impact of investment performance challenges in these strategies. While those net outflows were broad based, they were particularly apparent in our United States defined contribution investment only and broker-dealer channels. We continue to face headwinds with net flows to our large-cap growth strategies, but we expect that they will abate with sustained investment performance and time. On the positive side, we recorded $7.5 billion of net inflows into the target date franchise and over $250 million in net flows in each of global multi-sector bond, US dividend growth, US taxable cash management, US all-cap opportunities and US short-term bond strategies during the quarter. We expect that we will return the firm to positive organic growth over time with a combination of more constructive markets, sustained improved performance in key strategies, traction with a broader range of vehicles and continued progress with our strategic initiatives. Although, excellent investment performance is central to our long-term success, our industry has gotten more competitive. We are committed to investing in the areas where we have scaled businesses such as our leading retirement franchise and to building capabilities to support future growth. We see an opportunity to elevate our focus on areas where we have already invested resources over many years and where we believe we have the greatest opportunity for growth and long-term success. I would like to highlight some areas of focus and our progress against our strategic initiatives. We are bolstering our US intermediary wealth channel, leveraging and extending the partnerships we have built. This quarter, we were named a top tier provider to another one of the largest intermediary firms in the industry. With this decision, we are now a top-tier partner with six of the 10 largest intermediary firms in this space. We are also broadening our range of products to ensure we deliver our investment strategies in the vehicle of choice. As more advisers look to do more with fewer investment management partners, we are well-positioned to build on these deep partnerships. We are accelerating growth in international markets with a focus on unlocking growth in select countries where we have existing businesses that offer the greatest opportunity. During this quarter, I spent two weeks in Asia where we have 365 associates and clients representing $50 billion of assets under management. I had a chance to spend time with several of our clients and it reinforced for me the depth of relationships that we are building in the region and the opportunity that we have to do much more with them over time. In our direct retail business, we are enhancing our individual investor client experience through an improved digital experience and differentiated service offering. We recently completed the acquisition of Retiree, Inc. a fintech firm that offers innovative retirement income planning software. This acquisition will complement and expand our retirement income capabilities across our audiences with planning tools for individuals and practitioner tools for financial professionals. We expect to use the technology in our retail direct, defined contribution and wealth management channels. Finally, we are expanding our private markets and alternative capabilities by leveraging our distribution channels and OHA's investment capabilities. As we previously shared, we acquired OHA to accelerate our expansion into alternative investments. Our first joint co-branded product, T. Rowe Price OHA Select Private Credit Fund, or OCredit [ph], is advancing. This business development company is a retail product developed to leverage OHA's private credit investment expertise with T. Rowe Price's distribution capabilities. We expect to close the seed round in the second quarter and launch OCredit more broadly later this year. I am grateful to our associates around the world for focusing on delivering for our existing clients and for continuing to find new ways to bring what we do to a broader, more global base of clients. I will now turn to Jen to cover our financial results for Q1. Good morning, Dan. Thank you for the question. I would characterize our first year with OHA at a high level as very successful. We've integrated the appropriate functions and worked really hard to identify distribution synergies, the ability to take their strategies to institutional clients and prospects around the globe and also to take OHA capabilities into the wealth channel. I think the specific product that you're referring to is our T. Rowe Price OHA Credit BDC. We've made a lot of progress with regard to the institutional seed and expect to launch it late this year in the wealth channel. In terms of their performance, it's remained quite strong. Their absolute results have been impacted by the difficult overall fixed income and credit markets over the course of the last year. And that's also impacted their incentive income and fees and carry, but their relative performance has remained very, very strong. So we're really pleased right now with the progress that we've made and feel very confident with regard to the opportunity and potential that our teams have together. Yeah, Glenn, we purposefully kept the investment teams largely separate. OHA had a 30-year track record of delivering great investment results for their clients in private credit and distressed in their liquid offerings. I do think there's some overlap in expertise, but we really wanted to minimize disruption in terms of the overall investment philosophy and process and in terms of the culture. We are exploring ways to leverage ideas across the two platforms and share perspectives, particularly at the industry level. But we don't have any intention of integrating the T. Rowe Price fixed income platform with the OHA platform. I think that was one of the tenants of the acquisition at the outset. We are really, really focused on driving distribution synergy. We see a very large opportunity long-term, again, to take OHA to institutions around the globe, but also to take them into the broker-dealer and advisory channel. And that's a place where T. Rowe Price has very strong relationships at the home office. It's a place where T. Rowe Price has very strong relationships and support in the field. Many of the wealth platforms have done business with OHA in the past and they are more traditional structures and vehicles. And we're really excited for the opportunity to use more evergreen vehicles to take their capabilities there. Again, we expect to show some progress in that regard later this year and think the opportunity will build. I will say that, in general, the demand for private credit broadly is softer than what it was 12 or 18 months ago. There's a denominator effect where people's allocation to private assets has risen as marks have lagged the decline in public markets. I think in general, particularly on the wealth platforms, a number of advisers and clients are more -- taking a more cautious approach. I think there's a lot on the sidelines. And I think if you look at where spreads and absolute rates are now, the return and risk return profile of a well-managed private credit strategy is really compelling. So, we do see substantial opportunity there. But I think the current demand and the current capital raising is softer than the trends that you would have seen if you go back to 2020, 2021, or early 2022. Yes, I'll take the second part of the question first. We're very engaged and generally have the opportunity to share our outlook and give a performance update. I think that's not the case in every instance. We reach plans in a number of ways. In some instances, we are the record keeper and we have direct interaction. In some instances, we go directly to the plan sponsor. And in those instances, have through a direct DCIO opportunity on another record keepers platform have the opportunity to interact with the client or prospect. And in a number of instances, we work through aggregators or advisers. And there, we really are able to articulate our value proposition with those folks, and it's more indirect to the end client. When I think about the target date business, first thing I would say is that, in general, people are less sensitive to near-term performance than they might be with single strategies. People tend to focus much more on three, five, and 10-year results just given the nature of the objective being retirement and the long-dated return objective of retirement investing and savings. If you look at our flows in Q1, as you mentioned, they were very strong. I think our pipeline remains very robust. Long-term performance is important and when you have an active offering, ultimately, you're going to need to deliver it. I think if you look at our retirement date fund, it is -- it offers the strongest value proposition in the industry. We have a number of alpha-rich diversifiers in our building block lineup from non-investment-grade credit to emerging markets in small and mid-cap equity areas where you can add a tremendous amount of value as an active manager. And I'm very confident that if you continue to look at rolling three and five-year periods that our retirement date franchise will sort to the top and that we can continue to grow that franchise. And yes, I feel quite good about it. Yes. I would just say, we really believe we have a big opportunity to drive share in US wealth and in our focus markets around the world, but we also recognize that we need to drive efficiency and productivity in order to fund those investments going forward, and we're laser-focused on doing that. Yes. Alex, thanks for the question. The first thing I would say is that, we see a path back to organic growth, but it is going to take some time. And in the interim, I do think we'll need to manage expenses in order to bridge that gap. So, as I've said before, we do want to continue to invest in our strategic initiatives to get back to consistent organic growth. But we're -- we need to be very disciplined with regard to how we get there. Look, in terms of the algorithm, the market does play a big part when you have a $1.3 trillion AUM installed base and where kind of over half of that is in equities. That said, flows can play a part in time. Excess return and performance can play a part in time. Capital deployment can play a part in time. We have a number of areas that I think can drive longer-term growth, whether it's OHA or deep partnerships in the intermediary channel, whether it's continued growth in our focus markets. But, look, I think it's realistic to say during this period of time where our flows are under pressure and our organic growth is negative, that we will have to be more focused on expenses and that would there be just a less robust overall EPS growth algorithm. And that's just the arithmetic of it. Yes. I would say our pipeline in Japan and Australia, in particular, is encouraging, Ken. But again, this is a business where there are some sizable mandates is \u2013 I don't think you can necessarily read quarter in and quarter out, you can make a trend. I do expect that this business will grow more quickly than the rest of the business, probably more so APAC than EMEA. But kind of overall I think we're reasonably confident that if you look at it, you kind of want a two or three year planning horizon that the growth rates will be meaningfully higher than the overall book. Thanks for the question, Bill. The first thing I would say is in terms of share, there's a meaningful element of it that is mix related. I'll note that we have had positive flows in fixed income overall, which is above category. I think our target date results continue to be robust. We've had positive flows turn in this category. But you're right, we have had meaningful outflows in parts of our equity franchise, and those parts of our equity franchise are a substantial part of the business. So kind of ultimately, I think if you look at that in aggregate, it has led to share loss over the more recent time horizon. Look, we want to manage this business with a very long-term lens. I think that we do want to have more exposure to parts of the business, whether it is product or vehicle or asset class or geography that have more tailwinds of growth, and we think we can do that organically. But we also will continue to look very seriously at acquisition opportunities. But I think we have a very high bar for acquisitions. They need to have minimal disruption to our ability to deliver on our existing commitments to clients and our culture. They have to be a strategic fit. They have to make financial sense. Most deals in this industry, the weight of the evidence would suggest that they haven't been compelling. So, again, I think we will continue to look. And I think OHA and Retiree were both examples of the sorts of things that can be meaningfully additive. OHA obviously much, much greater in scale and scope. But nonetheless, I mean, we think that M&A is a tool that can help us evolve our business mix and kind of help us build more growth into the business in time. Sure. I'll start with ETFs. We have been in market for a couple of years. We just crossed $1 billion in AUM in our ETFs and I would say that momentum is building. Our first offerings in the equity space were semitransparent, which was new. And I'd say, it took a little while for advisers and investors to get comfortable with the semi-transparent approach. But as I say, we've been building substantial momentum with TCHP with TDBG. We also are in market with some transparent active fixed income ETFs, which are also beginning to build momentum. We will launch an additional series of ETFs toward the middle of this year and are really excited about the opportunity that those will bring. In mid-March, we filed registration statements with the SEC for five new active equity ETFs, a value ETF, a growth ETF, an international ETF, small and mid-cap ETF and capital appreciation equity ETF and feel very good based on feedback that we've gotten from investors, advisers and kind of users of ETFs that these will -- can really allow us to meet the clearly strong demand in the ETF category, and ultimately will also allow us to be in market with ETF models using our asset allocation capabilities. So we'll be quite active and kind of really feel like we've got an approach that will allow us to continue to build momentum and have a bigger impact in ETFs. In terms of SMA, we, last week -- or in late April, seeded four new muni SMAs, which will be available later in Q2. That will bring us to 20 strategies offered as SMAs. We have placement with all of the top 10 SMA distributors and kind of continuously hear feedback from the wealth platforms that they want to do more with fewer high-quality investment management firms and that they want strategies available across vehicle ranges. So mutual funds, ETFs, SMAs, model account delivery, et cetera. I also would add, globally, we'd continue to scale vehicles that will allow us to penetrate the intermediary market in those focused markets that Jen mentioned earlier. And then finally, the BDC is a new vehicle and a new product for us. So I think we're investing to be top of mind and very relevant with our intermediary partners globally, again, whether that's at the home office level or in the field. With regard to OHA associate retention, there's really been no change. It's been very strong. That's a big part of the reason why we kept the investment platform separate again, to minimize disruption and to allow them to sustain their momentum. They've got great talent. And there's -- generally, in our business, some small amount of turnover, particularly among more junior associates. But we've seen -- we haven't -- have not seen any regrettable attrition at the more senior associate or partner level at OHA. OCREDIT will have the opportunity to invest in both private and liquid credit. I think the target for OCREDIT is -- will be more in private credit, but kind of really will have flexibility to make investments where the risk return is most compelling. Craig, I think it's difficult to say. This is a trend that's been unfolding for a relatively long period of time, and there continues to be consolidation in the record-keeping business. Recordkeeping is a scale business. That said, I think T. Rowe Price has a very compelling value proposition in RPS. And particularly in core market, we're growing the number of plans and continuing to get attractive economics with the majority of the AUM on the plan managed by T. Rowe Price and in particular, having very strong representation of our target date funds. So, look, I think the trend towards consolidation and unbundling of asset management and record keeping is probably fairly far along. I also would say, I think, there will always be a place for a well done bundled recordkeeping offering in parts of the market, particularly in what we characterize as the core markets, so below the large enterprise level, where I think you can really deliver a very compelling value proposition. And if you were to look at our plan count, if you were to look at our flows, I mean the core RPS market is a market that we're investing in. We're investing in our coverage and territories and one that we think will be a growth driver for us over the course of the next several years. So while the unbundling trend, I think, is particularly important at the very large enterprise level, I don't think it's something that is a meaningful threat to our business. Again, as you mentioned, we have a very sizable representation in DCIO. We interact with the 401(k) market in a number of different ways, right? DCIO direct to the plan sponsor, DCIO through consultants and advisers, record-keeping where we sell directly to the plan sponsor, record-keeping through aggregators and advisers. Over 60% of our AUM is retirement related, and we've got a multi-pronged strategy to penetrate that opportunity. I think we've got a great value proposition with, as I've mentioned before, our range of retirement date funds. So this is a business that I'm pretty enthusiastic about. And I would say I don't spend a lot of time thinking about the disaggregation of recordkeeping and asset management at the very large plan level. And that's something that we've lived with for a decade or more. Okay. I think that was the last question. In closing, I just thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in T. Rowe Price. As we shared, I think Q1 showed promising signs in the market backdrop and also some improved investment performance as well as strong target date net flows. And while the market environment remains uncertain, I'm very pleased with how our associates and our teams are responding. And we remain deeply committed and focused on helping our clients meet their long-term financial objectives. So, again, thank you."

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer period. I will give you instructions on how to ask a question at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be available for replay on T. Rowe Price's website shortly after the call concludes. I will now turn the call over to Linsley Carruth, T. Rowe Price's Director of Investor Relations.\nLinsley Carruth : Hello, and thank you for joining us today for our Third Quarter Earnings Call. The press release and the supplemental materials document can be found on our IR website at investors.troweprice.com. Today's call will last approximately 45 minutes. Our Chair, CEO, and President, Rob Sharps; and CFO, Jen Dardis, will discuss the company's results for about 15 minutes, then we'll open it up for your questions. We ask that you limit it to one question per participant. I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements and reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statement language and the reconciliation to GAAP in the supplemental materials, as well as in our press release and 10-Q. All investment performance references to peer groups on today's call are using Morningstar peer groups and for the quarter that ended September 30, 2024. Now I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRob Sharps : Thank you, Linsley. And thank you all for joining our third quarter earnings call. We closed the quarter with $1.63 trillion in assets under management, up 3.9% from June 30th, despite $12.2 billion in net outflows. While our net outflows increased in the third quarter, we are seeing encouraging signs that we are on the right path. Our active ETF franchise is expanding, we are deepening our retirement leadership position with the launch of innovative retirement solutions and our associates are advancing our strategic initiatives across the business. We remain on track to reduce net outflows this year. I'll now turn to investment performance. Our long-term investment performance remains solid despite softer results this quarter. In our equity franchise, US mid-cap value, US Equity research, integrated US Small midcap core equity, and integrated global equity all continue to be top quartile performers for the one, three, and five-year time periods. In our ETF franchise, our semi-transparent US equity research ETF now has top quartile performance for both the one-year and three-year time periods, and in our more recently launched transparent equity ETFs, the growth and small mid-cap ETFs remain top quartile performers for the one-year time period. In fixed income, our muni-strategies continue to be strong performers, as do our floating rate and ultra short-term bond ETFs, both of which have top quartile performance across multiple time periods. While underlying stock selection and an overweight toward US Equities were detractors to relative performance in the third quarter. Our flagship retirement funds and the new retirement blend funds continue to have strong long-term performance. Over 90% of our target date assets are in the top quartile for the five, 10, and 15-year time periods on an AUM basis. Returns across alternative strategies were positive during the quarter and broadly consistent with the constructive market backdrop. Private, structured, and liquid strategies generated stronger results while distressed and special situations lagged. As I shared earlier, third quarter net outflows totaled $12.2 billion. We do expect further increases in net outflows during the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonal trends and a large sub-advised variable annuity termination now expected in late Q4. Even with this loss, we remain on track to reduce net outflows this year, although not as significantly as we had previously expected. Excluding the [VA termination] (ph), we estimated 2024 net outflows to be less than half of 2023 levels. Jen will share more detail in a moment, but I want to underscore that while this unanticipated loss was deeply disappointing, it doesn't undo the progress we have made in other areas. We are expanding our ETF business and deepening our leadership in retirement with innovative new strategies. With our recently launched technology ETF, we provide investors our first sector focused fully transparent portfolio with the tax efficient, convenient, and cost effective benefits of the ETF wrapper. We also recently launched two new retirement offerings, personalized retirement manager and managed lifetime income. Personalized retirement manager is the industry's first managed account designed to create a unique asset allocation tailored for the individual, incorporating personal data into the proven life cycle investment philosophy and process that underpin our leading target date strategies. Managed lifetime income is a new retirement solution designed to provide retirees in a defined contribution plan with stable and predictable monthly income for life. Managed lifetime income combines a managed payout investment from T. Rowe Price with a qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract from Pacific Life to offer a unique union of professional asset management and guaranteed monthly payouts. We are also seeing increased client interest in co-developing and customizing our target date capabilities and we're notified of a sizable custom glide path win expected next year. We were reaching key milestones in areas beyond retirement as well. We had our first close for OLEND, our Senior Private Lending Fund, which drove much of this quarter's $3 billion increase in unfunded capital commitments. Our focus on US Wealth resulted in new relationships that are launching this year, new placements in home office models, and more partnerships focused on ETFs and SMAs. Finally, despite the VA termination I noted earlier, our weighted net pipeline grew quarter-over-quarter, suggesting that elevated fourth quarter outflows are not indicative of the underlying trajectory of our business. I want to recognize the tremendous work our associates are doing on behalf of our clients, our firm, and our stockholders. It's their focus on continuous improvement in their agile mindset that are driving our progress. I'll now turn to Jen to provide an overview of our financial results.\nJen Dardis : Thank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. I'll review our third quarter results before opening the line for questions. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.57 for Q3 2024 is up over 18% from Q3 of last year, driven by higher average AUM, higher adjusted operating income, and a lower effective tax rate. These factors also drove a nearly 14% increase in EPS from Q2 of this year. We reported $12.2 billion in net outflows this quarter, which is an improvement from Q3 2023, but higher than the first half of 2024. US Equity products remain the primary driver of outflows, particularly in our growth strategies. Our US Equity research strategy, however, had net inflows of over $1.5 billion this quarter. We also had positive net inflows across fixed income, multi-asset, and alternatives. Within multi-asset, we had another strong quarter in our target date franchise with net inflows of $3.6 billion. Our year-to-date inflows of $14.1 billion outpaces the active industry growth rate, particularly in the blend category. Our ETF business had just under $1 billion of net inflows in the quarter, bringing our September 30 AUM to over $6.5 billion. And outside the US, we had positive net inflows driven by global equity in the APAC region and alternatives in the EMEA region. As Rob mentioned, we were recently notified of a large sub-advised variable annuity termination. We expect that nearly all of the assets related to this termination will be redeemed during the fourth quarter. Given the size of this outflow, I want to provide some background on our VA business, which you'll find on page 15 of the supplement. At a high level, we provide investment management services for VA products sold by insurance company sponsors. In some cases, we are the sole manager and the product may be branded as T. Rowe, while in other cases we're one sleeve of a multi-manager product. Our VA assets are $104 billion, or a little over 6% of our total AUM, which is down from 9% in 2019. Similar to the overall VA industry, our VA business has experienced net outflows for the past several years, and we don't expect that trend to change meaningfully. That said, given the large fourth quarter termination, the level of VA outflows for the full year 2024 will be higher than we would have otherwise expected. While this area is not an organic growth driver for the firm, this book of business has many long-standing and important clients and we will continue to deliver on their behalf. Shifting to our financials, our Q3 adjusted net revenues were $1.8 billion, which is up 7% from last year and up 3% from the second quarter, driven by higher investment advisory revenue from higher average AUM. Our Q3 annualized effective fee rate of 40.9 basis points declined from Q3 2023 and Q2 2024, as assets continue to shift into lower fee vehicles and asset classes. This quarter's investment advisory revenue of $1.6 billion included $5.6 million in performance-based fees from alternatives products, primarily from the BDC. Our adjusted operating expenses of $1.1 billion were up 3.6% from Q3 2023, due mainly to increases in compensation, benefits, and related costs and distribution and servicing fees on higher AUM. While G&A is also up from last year, Q3 2023 included a $20 million non-recurring cost recovery. Our adjusted operating income of $718 million was up 13% from Q3 2023 and almost 10% from last quarter. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses, excluding carried interest expense, to be 6% to 8% over the comparable full year 2023 amount of $4.19 billion. While we're at the bottom end of this range through nine months, Similar to last year, we anticipate an increase in a number of expense categories in Q4, some of which are due to seasonal factors and timing and will not carry into the 2025 run rate. Notably, our stock-based compensation is typically higher in December, given the timing of our annual grant. And we expect advertising and promotion expenses to be higher due to the seasonality of our advertising effort. We are also forecasting higher professional fees as we complete projects before the close of the year. Turning our attention to capital management, we repurchased $71 million worth of shares during the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date value of buybacks to nearly $264 million. We feel comfortable with our current pace of buybacks, as we evaluate repurchases through the remaining months of 2024. Combined with a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share, we have returned over $1.1 billion to stockholders in the first nine months of the year. Our balance sheet remains strong with over $3.6 billion in cash and discretionary investments at the end of Q3. As we approach year end, our teams are focusing on 2025 and identifying the areas where we will invest to drive future growth and deliver new capabilities to best serve our clients. We will continue to balance this investment with the need for ongoing expense discipline. And now I'll ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlexander Blostein: Hi, good morning everyone. Thank you for the question. Rob, would love to get your perspective on the organic growth to start a good perspective on the VA business on Slide 15. I think you mentioned that, you guys obviously made progress on the business, excluding the VA sub-advisory outflows expected to be, I guess less than half of the apples you sell last year. That still, I think implies a pretty meaningful step-up in outflows in Q4, excluding the VA sub-advisory issue. So maybe just on PAC, what you're seeing in the fourth quarter and whether or not the outflows there on a kind of core basis are also a bit more elevated than normally. And any thoughts you have for '25, but would be appreciated as well. Thanks.\nRob Sharps: Yes. Alex, Specifically, as it relates to '24, I would say that what we are seeing outside of the specific VA mandate is pretty consistent with typical seasonal patterns. We tend to have a little bit more in the way of redemption pressure in the fourth quarter and particularly near year-end. Outside of that, I think the underlying trends are pretty clearly headed in the right direction. So if I take a step back, as you said and as I noted earlier, that -- excluding the VA loss, '24 outflows would have been less than half of '23 levels. I think that reflects pretty substantive progress relative to where we were. Regarding '25, I would say we expect sizable further improvement as we trend toward positive flows. And if you take a step back and think about the trends and drivers, Active equities as an asset class and mutual funds as a vehicle or in outflow and have been for some time. That said, I think there is meaningful room for improvement in active equities given performance improvement in a few of our key franchises, notably large cap growth, where we are seeing both gross sales and redemptions following improved performance and trending in the right direction. Outside of that, we have positive flows in all of the other asset classes in most other vehicles. Gross sales are up in all but one of our channels and geographies year-over-year so far in '24, we continue to expect strong growth in retirement date funds in '25 and beyond. So this year, year-to-date is up relative to last year. We expect the year to be up and feel very good about the momentum that we have across the retirement date franchise. In '25, you can expect that we'll have a larger contribution from alternatives, ETFs and SMAs. I also think we have opportunity to build further momentum in fixed income, especially in areas like insurance. And we have work to do to bring those opportunities to fruition, but they're out there, and I think we're well positioned to capitalize on. It -- flows are really hard to predict. I'd say it's very difficult to say whether all of this will be enough to move us into positive territory in '25. My base case at this point, based on our most current forecast is that we will make meaningful further progress. But won't get there for the full year. Regardless, I think we'll demonstrate that we are on a path that will take us back to organic growth, whether we get there in 2025 or not. Jen, would you add anything?\nJen Dardis: No, I think you covered it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask about retirement. I was hoping maybe you could just update us on the -- your views there on the retirement market, competitive landscape. Some of the steps you guys are taking to drive growth in the retirement channel, including the new lifetime managed payout product. Maybe you could talk about how that works your go-to-market strategy for that, how you sort of plan to build traction. And then I think you mentioned a Glide Path win for next year. Maybe you can help quantify that. Thank you.\nRob Sharps: Yes. Hi, good morning. So the specific win that we referenced is a custom Glide Path win. So as you know, we have a tremendous amount of research behind our life cycle investing approach, and we have a Glide Path that underlies the asset allocation of our target date funds. There are certain instances where you have a plan sponsor that wants a Glide Path that is designed specifically to the demographics of their participant pool. And for us, typically a fee for that would be relatively small, and it would come in the as AUA, so it wouldn't come in the investment advisory fee-line. So that was what that specific reference was. In terms of broad trends, I would say, we've got a lot of momentum across our set of offerings, flagship retirement date fund, but also blend. Our pipeline there is very strong. specifically as it relates to the two new products that were launched, they are launched on our recordkeeping system, which I think shows the strategic benefit of having a record keeper. Personalized retirement manager is a managed account strategy that's customized based on input from the participant in addition to just their estimated retirement date. And we think it is particularly compelling. It uses a lot of the research and assumptions that underlie the core target date franchise, but custom tailor it to the particular interest and positioning of the underlying participant. I would also say that the fees on that are attractive relative to other managed account offerings in retirement overall. Finally, with regard to the lifetime income product that incorporates a QLAC, we think it's a compelling design structure. It is also initially being launched on the T. Rowe Price record-keeping platform. Both products are new to market. But in time, as we build scale and demonstrate the attractiveness, we expect to be able to extend them to other record-keeping platforms in time.\nJen Dardis: Yes. I might just add. I mean you asked about the go-to-market strategy and many of the things that Rob highlighted, as you just mentioned are on our record-keeping platform. But we serve retirement plans not only on our own recordkeeping platform, but even more so on what we call DCIO, our DC investment-only strategy. And we have opportunities to either provide our target date products. Over time to be able to sell some of these more extended strategies, but also to be able to participate as a sleeve in certain cases of other people's products that they're developing.\nRob Sharps: Yes, we've really leaned in to build our partnership with a number of the leading retirement franchises, both firms that focus on retirement consulting, but also the record-keeping platforms. We worked hard with co-development. And as a result of that, I think we are very, very well positioned with our suite of retirement day products, as well as some of the things that we're doing for retirement income across recordkeepers, not just on the dealer price recordkeeping platform.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Benjamin Budish with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about private credit. I guess maybe kind of a two-parter. First, can you remind us how much of the business is sort of related to senior direct lending, just thinking about sort of the opportunity set going into next year if has -- what the market seems to be expecting happens, which is that we see a big pickup in transacting activity. How are you positioned for that? And then Rob, you mentioned something about doing more on the fixed income side in insurance. I'm curious to what extent could that perhaps be related to private credit or what else did you mean there? Thank you.\nRob Sharps: Yes, Ben, I'll take the latter part of the question first. Specifically with regard to opportunities in insurance, it's really across our fixed income business. Fixed insurance general account tends to have very, very sizable investments in investment-grade corporate credit and we see some opportunity there. We also would see opportunity to offer private credit and alternative strategies to insurance investors. I think many insurance investors are looking to increase yield on their underlying portfolio and looking to private strategies as a way to do that attractively on a risk-adjusted basis. That would basically improve their own economics, but also improve the attractiveness of their underlying products. So it certainly would incorporate opportunities with OHA, but wouldn't be exclusive or limited. I think it would also include opportunities on the liquid side, potentially both with OHA, but also with the T. Rowe Prices fixed income platform. Specifically as it relates to private credit dedicated senior private lending is not an area that OHA historically had operated -- had offered to their clients. They've got a lot of experience in private credit broadly, but they have actually closed their first dedicated senior private lending fund. If you zoom out a little bit, OHA had a record quarter of capital raising, [$5.5 trillion] (ph) of new capital commitments this quarter, bringing the year-to-date number to over $9 billion. And I would say, a meaningful portion of that, a notable portion was in private credit. So they closed their first close on their senior private lending fund, which was $2 billion. So these increased capital commitments will boost flows, as the capital is deployed. So that will be based on where there's origination and where OHA sees opportunities, but I'm pretty confident based on what we're seeing from a capital commitment perspective, that alternatives flow should accelerate into 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks, good morning. Rob, I wanted to follow up on your comments around the institutional backlog building ex the sub-advised mandate. So can you put some context around that in terms of the products and ultimately, how you think about I guess, the sales cycle here today? Is that the funding is that looking into next year? Or is that more of the kind of three months, four months kind of window?\nRob Sharps: Yes. Thank you for the question Dan. It is over a year, it is a weighted pipeline. It's not just institutional. It is really across our book of business, and it's across asset classes. So basically, we have mandates that are risk-weighted and marked at risk, as well as opportunities that are risk-weighted. And I think it was very notable that despite the fact that we were notified of this sizable termination that the risk-weighted pipeline actually increased on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Now this particular mandate was partially marked at risk but not fully kind of marked at risk, which it clearly is now given that we've been notified of termination. But we were able to, on a risk-weighted basis, bring in enough new opportunity that we think will close over the course of the next 12 months that despite taking that to full loss that the pipeline has increased. And I would say that it's broad-based. Again, I think it is reflective of the trends that you see in the underlying business. It is less at risk and more opportunity in active equity in particular, large growth. It is continued momentum in equity in areas like structured research in certain of our global equity strategies. It shows some momentum in fixed income and clearly a very nice pipeline across the retirement date suite.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. In terms of your ETF franchise, to what extent is it expanding your customer reach and allowing you to get into different distribution channels? And to what extent is it just sort of cannibalizing your existing fund assets for an extra basis point? And in terms of the cost of distribution here for ETFs, is it any different than kind of what you're paying for access with the fund franchise? Thanks.\nRob Sharps: So on the first part of the question, Ken, I would say there's some element of both, right? And in other words, I think there are some buyers that have historically used open-ended mutual funds that at the margin have a preference, particularly if the same strategy is available for ETF. That said, we have a number of strategies that we're offering in ETF, particularly the fully transparent suite that are not strategies that are available in open-ended fund. I'd also say that we're reaching a different set of buyers. There are a number of advisers that are exclusive to ETF. So by definition, historically, they wouldn't have been involved in our open-ended fund. We actually just hosted a due diligence event for a number of ETF-focused advisers here. So I do think we are reaching new buyers. I think in particular with several of those strategies that aren't offered in open-ended fund, we can clearly ascribe that to being an incremental opportunity. But there has to be some element, particularly with the semi-transparent clone of cannibalization. I can't say that we see a lot of people moving from one to the other. You have to remember, a lot of the investors in the open-ended funds have sizable embedded gains. So it will be costly for them to sell the open-ended fund just to buy the ETF. I think, there are a lot of wealth platforms that prefer not to offer the same strategy in both vehicles. So I think we can say with reasonable confidence that a substantial portion of what we are getting in the ETF business is new and incremental. But there clearly is some cannibalization. With regard to cost to access, I\u2019d say, it really is no different. I mean it really varies by platform. We have some partnerships with folks that are focused on ETF that we are developing. And I would say the same sort of distribution economics apply to ETFs that they do to open-ended funds with the exception being that you don't have kind of some of the non-management fee expense ratio opportunity with an ETF that you do with an open-ended fund.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hi, good morning everyone. Hope you're all doing well. I have a follow-up to Mike's question on Managed Lifetime Income. So many view the rider, as a positive by recreating a defined benefit like experience for retirees. But I was curious on the IRR math by adding an insurance guarantee onto our Foreign key investment product just given the added cost and they take away downside risk, but what is the annual cost of these riders? So essentially, how does it impact the long-term return math and given that foreign key plan sponsors are generally pretty fee-sensitive, how does the guarantee get around that constraint?\nRob Sharps: Yes. That's a pretty specific question. I think to get into the detailed specifics, I will have you follow up with Linsley, but we think this is a really well-designed product. We think incorporating the QLAC and having the guaranteed payout start on a deferred basis creates a more optimal outcome for the plan participant. I think our team believes that marrying it with T. Rowe Price to manage payout option gives a tremendous amount of flexibility in the early years of retirement when the participant is more active and may require greater flexibility, and then the guaranteed pay outcomes later in life where it ultimately becomes more important. Specifically with regard to the trade-offs and the economics, QLACs are quite affordable relative to other fixed annuity. So kind of ultimately, there is some cost to getting the guarantee, obviously. But in terms of the specific economics, I probably should have somebody from that team and Linsley follow up with you on that.\nLinsley Carruth: And part of the design of it is that it's not the full amount of the assets that the client has. So you are designed to do a small portion of it so that you\u2019re balancing the risk and cost trade-off.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks, hello. Quickie, how close do you think we are to seeing private market allocations inside target date funds and retirement plans? And maybe more importantly, how are you thinking about leveraging the great T. Rowe Price brand and distribution network, specifically related to private markets? Thanks.\nRob Sharps: Yes, Glenn, I'd say, it's really hard to know. Obviously, we've got an election next week, and the results of that election will determine kind of where we are headed from a regulatory perspective. Look, I think there is a lot of discussion and potentially some interest. But until we get some regulatory clarity, I think it is unlikely to happen. So we don't have a lot of visibility on when that will happen, let alone how it would happen. I think we have a tremendous amount of flexibility, kind of once there is an interest among plan sponsors to incorporate private market alternatives into defined contribution offerings and things like target date funds to be thoughtful about how we would incorporate. What we would do that is related to OHA or T. Rowe Price proprietary, who we would partner with, we've had a lot of discussions and done a lot of work. And I think we have a really good sense of what our range of options are. But as things stand, I'll reiterate what I've said before. The defined contribution market is a fee-sensitive market, and the record-keeping platforms are not designed to deal with the lack of daily pricing, lack of liquidity that private market alternatives would introduce. I'll also say that again, there is not any clarity at all from a regulatory perspective with regard to incorporating private market alternatives. And I think many plan sponsors are quite concerned with regard to litigation. So I think it's some ways out. I think even once you get regulatory clarity, getting the plan sponsors to buy in and getting the infrastructure in place to incorporate and accommodate it will take some amount of time, but what -- I guess, my message to you is that I think when that happens, we'll be an extraordinarily attractive partner. It will create an opportunity for us with some of the things that we do inside of T. Rowe Price. And whatever we do, we'll make sure that it's attractive and compelling as part of our offering to plan sponsors and participants. That wasn't such a quickie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nPatrick Davitt: Thanks for the VA disclosure helpful. Could you remind on the makeup of the client base of the other $85 billion and why that's stickier than the VA side? Thank you.\nJen Dardis: So the rest of the other $85 billion or thereabouts based on once we would have the outflow, they are VA, I just want to clarify, you said that outside of VA, but those are -- oh, I'm sorry, getting [clear] (ph), there are other $85 billion outside of the VA. I just want to clarify because there could be some discontinuity between those numbers. Yes. Sorry. So in other cases, we are the sub-advised carrier for other types of plans outside of variable annuity. And that could be in retirement, that could be in -- it's well primarily in retirement. And those assets tend to be more sticky that I would go into more detail than that.\nRob Sharps: Yes. I think we are not seeing the same trends across the sub-advisory platform that we're seeing within VA. VA is a business that several of our clients have deemphasized or within their portfolio have lost share to fixed index annuities, [RILAs] (ph) fixed annuities in a higher rate environment. So the underlying product is one that kind of -- while still important and still prioritized by certain of our clients across the book. That's not necessarily the case. The rest of the sub-advisory business, which would be across wealth and retirement doesn't face some of that same underlying pressure. So the trends would not be consistent with what we're showing in VA.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The performance this quarter seem to take a rather meaningful hit, especially on a one-year basis. Could you maybe provide some color around what you think might have driven that? And any potential adjustments or actions you guys could be taken on the back of it?\nRob Sharps: Yes, sure. In terms of what drove it, I don't want to get into too much detail around one specific quarter, and I won't make -- I don't want to kind of make too much of one quarter, but it wasn't a great quarter. I would say, that there was a pretty meaningful risk on rallying once it became clear that was going to cut 50 basis points in September, and a lot of our portfolio is well positioned. For that, if you had to generalize, again it's difficult to generalize across the range and breadth of what we do. But look, I'm the first to acknowledge that the aggregate statistics as they stand today are soft and not where we want them. But I would say it is a moment in time. I'm really confident in our research platform and our portfolio managers. I think if you look at the year-to-date in the 1 year, there's clear continued improvement in important franchises, including US large cap growth. I think the performance of our US structured research strategy shows that the research platform is very strong. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned a number of places where the numbers are really good. There are clearly places we need to do better, but I'm confident that we have an approach that will deliver over time. And I don't think, there are any kind of drastic measures or steps that we'll need to take in order to deliver performance. I'd also say, that we are at a point now where if you look at the starting point for three-year and five-year in particular, the very poor performance year in 2022, Looms pretty large. That poor performance period actually started in Q4 of '21. So for a number of our big strategies, we start to begin to roll off that period where we were in a negative performance cycle. So as long as we do our job over the course of the next several quarters, I expect those aggregate metrics to steadily increase or improve.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Brown with WFS. Your line is open.\nMike Brown: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jen, I appreciate the expense comments for next quarter and for the full year. I guess I know it's early in probably the planning process. But as you look to 2025, how are you thinking about expense growth next year? And what are some kind of key areas of investment that you'll be focusing on next year? Thank you.\nJen Dardis: Thanks for the question. So we are still in the middle of our annual planning process, and I'm not prepared to give formal guidance on 2025 today. But -- and that said, similar to last year, our ingoing goal, as we've been going through the planning process has been to roughly try to align expense growth with forecasted revenue growth on a planned basis, assuming our current AUM trajectory and average market returns. So last year, we started the year with 3% to 5% expense growth, excluding carried interest comp and have increased that range to 6% to 8% based on higher average market returns and the resulting higher market-driven expenses. If you think about where we are with revenue momentum from '24 into '25, it's stronger this time than last year. So I would expect our opening expense guide would be a little bit higher than last year, but we won't get to a final number for you all until next quarter. We are mindful of balancing those areas of investment, as you mentioned, with the need to manage expense growth. If we think about the places where we've been investing, it's really behind the momentum that Rob mentioned earlier, investing in the ETF franchise, some of our other vehicles continuing to expand our marketing and reach outside of the US, continuing to invest behind our alternative sales plans and platforms and continuing to invest in ways to make sure that we can be more efficient in our core operating and operations and technology.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Rob Sharps for closing remarks.\nRob Sharps: All right. Very good. Thank you all for your questions and your interest in T. Rowe Price, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jen Dardis",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. I'll review our third quarter results before opening the line for questions. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.57 for Q3 2024 is up over 18% from Q3 of last year, driven by higher average AUM, higher adjusted operating income, and a lower effective tax rate. These factors also drove a nearly 14% increase in EPS from Q2 of this year. We reported $12.2 billion in net outflows this quarter, which is an improvement from Q3 2023, but higher than the first half of 2024. US Equity products remain the primary driver of outflows, particularly in our growth strategies. Our US Equity research strategy, however, had net inflows of over $1.5 billion this quarter. We also had positive net inflows across fixed income, multi-asset, and alternatives. Within multi-asset, we had another strong quarter in our target date franchise with net inflows of $3.6 billion. Our year-to-date inflows of $14.1 billion outpaces the active industry growth rate, particularly in the blend category. Our ETF business had just under $1 billion of net inflows in the quarter, bringing our September 30 AUM to over $6.5 billion. And outside the US, we had positive net inflows driven by global equity in the APAC region and alternatives in the EMEA region. As Rob mentioned, we were recently notified of a large sub-advised variable annuity termination. We expect that nearly all of the assets related to this termination will be redeemed during the fourth quarter. Given the size of this outflow, I want to provide some background on our VA business, which you'll find on page 15 of the supplement. At a high level, we provide investment management services for VA products sold by insurance company sponsors. In some cases, we are the sole manager and the product may be branded as T. Rowe, while in other cases we're one sleeve of a multi-manager product. Our VA assets are $104 billion, or a little over 6% of our total AUM, which is down from 9% in 2019. Similar to the overall VA industry, our VA business has experienced net outflows for the past several years, and we don't expect that trend to change meaningfully. That said, given the large fourth quarter termination, the level of VA outflows for the full year 2024 will be higher than we would have otherwise expected. While this area is not an organic growth driver for the firm, this book of business has many long-standing and important clients and we will continue to deliver on their behalf. Shifting to our financials, our Q3 adjusted net revenues were $1.8 billion, which is up 7% from last year and up 3% from the second quarter, driven by higher investment advisory revenue from higher average AUM. Our Q3 annualized effective fee rate of 40.9 basis points declined from Q3 2023 and Q2 2024, as assets continue to shift into lower fee vehicles and asset classes. This quarter's investment advisory revenue of $1.6 billion included $5.6 million in performance-based fees from alternatives products, primarily from the BDC. Our adjusted operating expenses of $1.1 billion were up 3.6% from Q3 2023, due mainly to increases in compensation, benefits, and related costs and distribution and servicing fees on higher AUM. While G&A is also up from last year, Q3 2023 included a $20 million non-recurring cost recovery. Our adjusted operating income of $718 million was up 13% from Q3 2023 and almost 10% from last quarter. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses, excluding carried interest expense, to be 6% to 8% over the comparable full year 2023 amount of $4.19 billion. While we're at the bottom end of this range through nine months, Similar to last year, we anticipate an increase in a number of expense categories in Q4, some of which are due to seasonal factors and timing and will not carry into the 2025 run rate. Notably, our stock-based compensation is typically higher in December, given the timing of our annual grant. And we expect advertising and promotion expenses to be higher due to the seasonality of our advertising effort. We are also forecasting higher professional fees as we complete projects before the close of the year. Turning our attention to capital management, we repurchased $71 million worth of shares during the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date value of buybacks to nearly $264 million. We feel comfortable with our current pace of buybacks, as we evaluate repurchases through the remaining months of 2024. Combined with a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share, we have returned over $1.1 billion to stockholders in the first nine months of the year. Our balance sheet remains strong with over $3.6 billion in cash and discretionary investments at the end of Q3. As we approach year end, our teams are focusing on 2025 and identifying the areas where we will invest to drive future growth and deliver new capabilities to best serve our clients. We will continue to balance this investment with the need for ongoing expense discipline. And now I'll ask the operator to open the line for Q&A. No, I think you covered it. Yes. I might just add. I mean you asked about the go-to-market strategy and many of the things that Rob highlighted, as you just mentioned are on our record-keeping platform. But we serve retirement plans not only on our own recordkeeping platform, but even more so on what we call DCIO, our DC investment-only strategy. And we have opportunities to either provide our target date products. Over time to be able to sell some of these more extended strategies, but also to be able to participate as a sleeve in certain cases of other people's products that they're developing. So the rest of the other $85 billion or thereabouts based on once we would have the outflow, they are VA, I just want to clarify, you said that outside of VA, but those are -- oh, I'm sorry, getting [clear] (ph), there are other $85 billion outside of the VA. I just want to clarify because there could be some discontinuity between those numbers. Yes. Sorry. So in other cases, we are the sub-advised carrier for other types of plans outside of variable annuity. And that could be in retirement, that could be in -- it's well primarily in retirement. And those assets tend to be more sticky that I would go into more detail than that. Thanks for the question. So we are still in the middle of our annual planning process, and I'm not prepared to give formal guidance on 2025 today. But -- and that said, similar to last year, our ingoing goal, as we've been going through the planning process has been to roughly try to align expense growth with forecasted revenue growth on a planned basis, assuming our current AUM trajectory and average market returns.

            "name": "Rob Sharps",
            "content": "Thank you, Linsley. And thank you all for joining our third quarter earnings call. We closed the quarter with $1.63 trillion in assets under management, up 3.9% from June 30th, despite $12.2 billion in net outflows. While our net outflows increased in the third quarter, we are seeing encouraging signs that we are on the right path. Our active ETF franchise is expanding, we are deepening our retirement leadership position with the launch of innovative retirement solutions and our associates are advancing our strategic initiatives across the business. We remain on track to reduce net outflows this year. I'll now turn to investment performance. Our long-term investment performance remains solid despite softer results this quarter. In our equity franchise, US mid-cap value, US Equity research, integrated US Small midcap core equity, and integrated global equity all continue to be top quartile performers for the one, three, and five-year time periods. In our ETF franchise, our semi-transparent US equity research ETF now has top quartile performance for both the one-year and three-year time periods, and in our more recently launched transparent equity ETFs, the growth and small mid-cap ETFs remain top quartile performers for the one-year time period. In fixed income, our muni-strategies continue to be strong performers, as do our floating rate and ultra short-term bond ETFs, both of which have top quartile performance across multiple time periods. While underlying stock selection and an overweight toward US Equities were detractors to relative performance in the third quarter. Our flagship retirement funds and the new retirement blend funds continue to have strong long-term performance. Over 90% of our target date assets are in the top quartile for the five, 10, and 15-year time periods on an AUM basis. Returns across alternative strategies were positive during the quarter and broadly consistent with the constructive market backdrop. Private, structured, and liquid strategies generated stronger results while distressed and special situations lagged. As I shared earlier, third quarter net outflows totaled $12.2 billion. We do expect further increases in net outflows during the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonal trends and a large sub-advised variable annuity termination now expected in late Q4. Even with this loss, we remain on track to reduce net outflows this year, although not as significantly as we had previously expected. Excluding the [VA termination] (ph), we estimated 2024 net outflows to be less than half of 2023 levels. Jen will share more detail in a moment, but I want to underscore that while this unanticipated loss was deeply disappointing, it doesn't undo the progress we have made in other areas. We are expanding our ETF business and deepening our leadership in retirement with innovative new strategies. With our recently launched technology ETF, we provide investors our first sector focused fully transparent portfolio with the tax efficient, convenient, and cost effective benefits of the ETF wrapper. We also recently launched two new retirement offerings, personalized retirement manager and managed lifetime income. Personalized retirement manager is the industry's first managed account designed to create a unique asset allocation tailored for the individual, incorporating personal data into the proven life cycle investment philosophy and process that underpin our leading target date strategies. Managed lifetime income is a new retirement solution designed to provide retirees in a defined contribution plan with stable and predictable monthly income for life. Managed lifetime income combines a managed payout investment from T. Rowe Price with a qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract from Pacific Life to offer a unique union of professional asset management and guaranteed monthly payouts. We are also seeing increased client interest in co-developing and customizing our target date capabilities and we're notified of a sizable custom glide path win expected next year. We were reaching key milestones in areas beyond retirement as well. We had our first close for OLEND, our Senior Private Lending Fund, which drove much of this quarter's $3 billion increase in unfunded capital commitments. Our focus on US Wealth resulted in new relationships that are launching this year, new placements in home office models, and more partnerships focused on ETFs and SMAs. Finally, despite the VA termination I noted earlier, our weighted net pipeline grew quarter-over-quarter, suggesting that elevated fourth quarter outflows are not indicative of the underlying trajectory of our business. I want to recognize the tremendous work our associates are doing on behalf of our clients, our firm, and our stockholders. It's their focus on continuous improvement in their agile mindset that are driving our progress. I'll now turn to Jen to provide an overview of our financial results. Yes. Alex, Specifically, as it relates to '24, I would say that what we are seeing outside of the specific VA mandate is pretty consistent with typical seasonal patterns. We tend to have a little bit more in the way of redemption pressure in the fourth quarter and particularly near year-end. Outside of that, I think the underlying trends are pretty clearly headed in the right direction. So if I take a step back, as you said and as I noted earlier, that -- excluding the VA loss, '24 outflows would have been less than half of '23 levels. I think that reflects pretty substantive progress relative to where we were. Regarding '25, I would say we expect sizable further improvement as we trend toward positive flows. And if you take a step back and think about the trends and drivers, Active equities as an asset class and mutual funds as a vehicle or in outflow and have been for some time. That said, I think there is meaningful room for improvement in active equities given performance improvement in a few of our key franchises, notably large cap growth, where we are seeing both gross sales and redemptions following improved performance and trending in the right direction. Outside of that, we have positive flows in all of the other asset classes in most other vehicles. Gross sales are up in all but one of our channels and geographies year-over-year so far in '24, we continue to expect strong growth in retirement date funds in '25 and beyond. So this year, year-to-date is up relative to last year. We expect the year to be up and feel very good about the momentum that we have across the retirement date franchise. In '25, you can expect that we'll have a larger contribution from alternatives, ETFs and SMAs. I also think we have opportunity to build further momentum in fixed income, especially in areas like insurance. And we have work to do to bring those opportunities to fruition, but they're out there, and I think we're well positioned to capitalize on. It -- flows are really hard to predict. I'd say it's very difficult to say whether all of this will be enough to move us into positive territory in '25. My base case at this point, based on our most current forecast is that we will make meaningful further progress. But won't get there for the full year. Regardless, I think we'll demonstrate that we are on a path that will take us back to organic growth, whether we get there in 2025 or not. Jen, would you add anything? Yes. Hi, good morning. So the specific win that we referenced is a custom Glide Path win. So as you know, we have a tremendous amount of research behind our life cycle investing approach, and we have a Glide Path that underlies the asset allocation of our target date funds. There are certain instances where you have a plan sponsor that wants a Glide Path that is designed specifically to the demographics of their participant pool. And for us, typically a fee for that would be relatively small, and it would come in the as AUA, so it wouldn't come in the investment advisory fee-line. So that was what that specific reference was. In terms of broad trends, I would say, we've got a lot of momentum across our set of offerings, flagship retirement date fund, but also blend. Our pipeline there is very strong. specifically as it relates to the two new products that were launched, they are launched on our recordkeeping system, which I think shows the strategic benefit of having a record keeper. Personalized retirement manager is a managed account strategy that's customized based on input from the participant in addition to just their estimated retirement date. And we think it is particularly compelling. It uses a lot of the research and assumptions that underlie the core target date franchise, but custom tailor it to the particular interest and positioning of the underlying participant. I would also say that the fees on that are attractive relative to other managed account offerings in retirement overall. Finally, with regard to the lifetime income product that incorporates a QLAC, we think it's a compelling design structure. It is also initially being launched on the T. Rowe Price record-keeping platform. Both products are new to market. But in time, as we build scale and demonstrate the attractiveness, we expect to be able to extend them to other record-keeping platforms in time. Yes, we've really leaned in to build our partnership with a number of the leading retirement franchises, both firms that focus on retirement consulting, but also the record-keeping platforms. We worked hard with co-development. And as a result of that, I think we are very, very well positioned with our suite of retirement day products, as well as some of the things that we're doing for retirement income across recordkeepers, not just on the dealer price recordkeeping platform. Yes, Ben, I'll take the latter part of the question first. Specifically with regard to opportunities in insurance, it's really across our fixed income business. Fixed insurance general account tends to have very, very sizable investments in investment-grade corporate credit and we see some opportunity there. We also would see opportunity to offer private credit and alternative strategies to insurance investors. I think many insurance investors are looking to increase yield on their underlying portfolio and looking to private strategies as a way to do that attractively on a risk-adjusted basis. That would basically improve their own economics, but also improve the attractiveness of their underlying products. So it certainly would incorporate opportunities with OHA, but wouldn't be exclusive or limited. I think it would also include opportunities on the liquid side, potentially both with OHA, but also with the T. Rowe Prices fixed income platform. Specifically as it relates to private credit dedicated senior private lending is not an area that OHA historically had operated -- had offered to their clients. They've got a lot of experience in private credit broadly, but they have actually closed their first dedicated senior private lending fund. If you zoom out a little bit, OHA had a record quarter of capital raising, [$5.5 trillion] (ph) of new capital commitments this quarter, bringing the year-to-date number to over $9 billion. And I would say, a meaningful portion of that, a notable portion was in private credit. So they closed their first close on their senior private lending fund, which was $2 billion. So these increased capital commitments will boost flows, as the capital is deployed. So that will be based on where there's origination and where OHA sees opportunities, but I'm pretty confident based on what we're seeing from a capital commitment perspective, that alternatives flow should accelerate into 2025. Yes. Thank you for the question Dan. It is over a year, it is a weighted pipeline. It's not just institutional. It is really across our book of business, and it's across asset classes. So basically, we have mandates that are risk-weighted and marked at risk, as well as opportunities that are risk-weighted. And I think it was very notable that despite the fact that we were notified of this sizable termination that the risk-weighted pipeline actually increased on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Now this particular mandate was partially marked at risk but not fully kind of marked at risk, which it clearly is now given that we've been notified of termination. But we were able to, on a risk-weighted basis, bring in enough new opportunity that we think will close over the course of the next 12 months that despite taking that to full loss that the pipeline has increased. And I would say that it's broad-based. Again, I think it is reflective of the trends that you see in the underlying business. It is less at risk and more opportunity in active equity in particular, large growth. It is continued momentum in equity in areas like structured research in certain of our global equity strategies. It shows some momentum in fixed income and clearly a very nice pipeline across the retirement date suite. So on the first part of the question, Ken, I would say there's some element of both, right? And in other words, I think there are some buyers that have historically used open-ended mutual funds that at the margin have a preference, particularly if the same strategy is available for ETF. That said, we have a number of strategies that we're offering in ETF, particularly the fully transparent suite that are not strategies that are available in open-ended fund. I'd also say that we're reaching a different set of buyers. There are a number of advisers that are exclusive to ETF. So by definition, historically, they wouldn't have been involved in our open-ended fund. We actually just hosted a due diligence event for a number of ETF-focused advisers here. So I do think we are reaching new buyers. I think in particular with several of those strategies that aren't offered in open-ended fund, we can clearly ascribe that to being an incremental opportunity. But there has to be some element, particularly with the semi-transparent clone of cannibalization. I can't say that we see a lot of people moving from one to the other. You have to remember, a lot of the investors in the open-ended funds have sizable embedded gains. So it will be costly for them to sell the open-ended fund just to buy the ETF. I think, there are a lot of wealth platforms that prefer not to offer the same strategy in both vehicles. So I think we can say with reasonable confidence that a substantial portion of what we are getting in the ETF business is new and incremental. But there clearly is some cannibalization. With regard to cost to access, I'd say, it really is no different. I mean it really varies by platform. We have some partnerships with folks that are focused on ETF that we are developing. And I would say the same sort of distribution economics apply to ETFs that they do to open-ended funds with the exception being that you don't have kind of some of the non-management fee expense ratio opportunity with an ETF that you do with an open-ended fund. Yes. That's a pretty specific question. I think to get into the detailed specifics, I will have you follow up with Linsley, but we think this is a really well-designed product. We think incorporating the QLAC and having the guaranteed payout start on a deferred basis creates a more optimal outcome for the plan participant. I think our team believes that marrying it with T. Rowe Price to manage payout option gives a tremendous amount of flexibility in the early years of retirement when the participant is more active and may require greater flexibility, and then the guaranteed pay outcomes later in life where it ultimately becomes more important. Specifically with regard to the trade-offs and the economics, QLACs are quite affordable relative to other fixed annuity. So kind of ultimately, there is some cost to getting the guarantee, obviously. But in terms of the specific economics, I probably should have somebody from that team and Linsley follow up with you on that. Yes, Glenn, I'd say, it's really hard to know. Obviously, we've got an election next week, and the results of that election will determine kind of where we are headed from a regulatory perspective. Look, I think there is a lot of discussion and potentially some interest. But until we get some regulatory clarity, I think it is unlikely to happen. So we don't have a lot of visibility on when that will happen, let alone how it would happen. I think we have a tremendous amount of flexibility, kind of once there is an interest among plan sponsors to incorporate private market alternatives into defined contribution offerings and things like target date funds to be thoughtful about how we would incorporate. What we would do that is related to OHA or T. Rowe Price proprietary, who we would partner with, we've had a lot of discussions and done a lot of work. And I think we have a really good sense of what our range of options are. But as things stand, I'll reiterate what I've said before. The defined contribution market is a fee-sensitive market, and the record-keeping platforms are not designed to deal with the lack of daily pricing, lack of liquidity that private market alternatives would introduce. I'll also say that again, there is not any clarity at all from a regulatory perspective with regard to incorporating private market alternatives. And I think many plan sponsors are quite concerned with regard to litigation. So I think it's some ways out. I think even once you get regulatory clarity, getting the plan sponsors to buy in and getting the infrastructure in place to incorporate and accommodate it will take some amount of time, but what -- I guess, my message to you is that I think when that happens, we'll be an extraordinarily attractive partner. It will create an opportunity for us with some of the things that we do inside of T. Rowe Price. And whatever we do, we'll make sure that it's attractive and compelling as part of our offering to plan sponsors and participants. That wasn't such a quickie. Yes. I think we are not seeing the same trends across the sub-advisory platform that we're seeing within VA. VA is a business that several of our clients have deemphasized or within their portfolio have lost share to fixed index annuities, [RILAs] (ph) fixed annuities in a higher rate environment. So the underlying product is one that kind of -- while still important and still prioritized by certain of our clients across the book. That's not necessarily the case. The rest of the sub-advisory business, which would be across wealth and retirement doesn't face some of that same underlying pressure. So the trends would not be consistent with what we're showing in VA. Yes, sure. In terms of what drove it, I don't want to get into too much detail around one specific quarter, and I won't make -- I don't want to kind of make too much of one quarter, but it wasn't a great quarter. I would say, that there was a pretty meaningful risk on rallying once it became clear that was going to cut 50 basis points in September, and a lot of our portfolio is well positioned. For that, if you had to generalize, again it's difficult to generalize across the range and breadth of what we do. But look, I'm the first to acknowledge that the aggregate statistics as they stand today are soft and not where we want them. But I would say it is a moment in time. I'm really confident in our research platform and our portfolio managers. I think if you look at the year-to-date in the 1 year, there's clear continued improvement in important franchises, including US large cap growth. I think the performance of our US structured research strategy shows that the research platform is very strong. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned a number of places where the numbers are really good. There are clearly places we need to do better, but I'm confident that we have an approach that will deliver over time. And I don't think, there are any kind of drastic measures or steps that we'll need to take in order to deliver performance. I'd also say, that we are at a point now where if you look at the starting point for three-year and five-year in particular, the very poor performance year in 2022, Looms pretty large. That poor performance period actually started in Q4 of '21. So for a number of our big strategies, we start to begin to roll off that period where we were in a negative performance cycle. So as long as we do our job over the course of the next several quarters, I expect those aggregate metrics to steadily increase or improve. All right. Very good. Thank you all for your questions and your interest in T. Rowe Price, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Daniel, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to T. Rowe Price's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer period. I will give you instructions on how to ask questions at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be available for replay on T. Rowe Price's website shortly after the call concludes. I will now turn the call over to Linsley Carruth, T. Rowe Price's Director of Investor Relations.\nLinsley Carruth: Hello, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. The press release and a supplemental materials document can be found on our IR website at investors.troweprice.com. Today's call will last approximately 45 minutes. Our CEO and President, Rob Sharps, and CFO, Jen Dardis, will discuss the company's results for about 10 minutes. Then we'll open it up to your questions, at which time we'll be joined by Head of Global Investments, Eric Veiel. We ask that you limit it to one question per participant. I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements and reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statement language and the reconciliations to GAAP in the supplemental materials as well as in our press release and 10-Q. All investment performance references to peer groups on today's call are using Morningstar peer groups and are for the quarter that ended June 30, 2024. Now, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRob Sharps: Linsley, thank you and thank you all for joining us today. As we shared in our earnings release, we ended the quarter with just under $1.57 trillion in assets under management and $3.7 billion in net outflows. While market gains continued to support our financial results, I'm pleased to say that we are making steady progress in flows and investment performance. Our sales pipeline is healthy, redemption pressure is stabilizing, and our associates are driving our strategic initiatives forward. We continue to be on track to substantially reduce net outflows this year. Overall, our investment performance remained solid in the second quarter with two-thirds of our funds beating their peer group one-year medians and over 40% of our funds in the top quartile. In our equity franchise, US equity research, US mid-cap value, international value, financial services, integrated US small mid-cap core equity and integrated global equity are all top-quartile performers for the one-year, three-year and five-year time periods. The transparent equity ETFs we launched last year are demonstrating strong performance with the growth, value and small mid-cap ETFs, all top-quartile performers versus peers for the one-year time period. In our fixed income franchise, several of our muni funds as well as our institutional floating rate and credit opportunities funds have one-year, three-year and five-year top quartile performance. Both our flagship retirement funds and the newer retirement blend version of the strategy continued to deliver strong performance across multiple time periods. Returns across alternative strategies continued to be strong with alpha generated across the portfolios, primarily due to effective individual credit selection. Jen will discuss our flows and financials in more detail shortly, but I wanted to take a moment to highlight our ETF business. As of June 30, we reached $5.3 billion in assets under management, up from $1.2 billion in June 2023. In the first half of this year, we've had $2.4 billion of inflows to our ETFs. We are excited by this growth in our ETFs and that we are attracting diverse investors across wealth management, institutional, direct retail and investors outside the United States. We expect that the appetite for our ETFs will continue to grow throughout the year as five of our 16 ETFs, including US equity research and blue chip growth have each grown to over $300 million in assets, which is the size eligible for many platforms. Our transparent equity ETFs now have a one-year track record, a requirement for most platforms. We are broadening the product lineup, including the recently launched T. Rowe Price Intermediate Municipal Income ETF, which is our sixth fixed income ETF and our first federal tax-free fixed income ETF. And we are planning to make additional investment strategies available as ETFs over time. Our associates are driving this progress and it extends beyond our ETF business. I'll highlight a few recent milestones. We filed the launch of the T. Rowe Price OHA Flexible Credit Income Fund or OFLEX, our first interval fund. We were named a strategic partner to one of the largest independent broker-dealers in the United States, allowing us to bring our products and insights to their more than 10,000 financial advisors and their 2 million end clients. Our SMA franchise grew to more than $8 billion in assets as of June 30 with $1 billion in net flows year-to-date. After seeing strong demand for the ETF version of capital appreciation equity, we launched this strategy as an SMA. We unveiled our retirement income solutions 5D framework. This new patent-pending framework will help define the contribution plan sponsors evaluate retirement income offerings and quantify which solutions may best fit the needs and preferences of their planned participants. I'd like to finish by noting that I spent time in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in the second quarter. The constant across our offices is our associates' deep commitment to delivering results for our clients and to advancing our strategic initiatives. We are seeing their efforts reflected in our results, and I want to thank associates across all of our locations for their hard work to deliver value for our clients and our firm. I'll now turn to Jen for our financial results.\nJen Dardis: Thank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. I'll review our second quarter results before opening the line for questions. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.26 was up nearly 12% from Q2 2023, driven by higher operating income and a lower effective tax rate. As Rob mentioned, we reported $3.7 billion in Q2 net outflows. Results this quarter included a large fixed income win from an insurance client that funded in May. While these types of flows can be lumpy, we are pleased it's in a space where we've been building client relationships to help grow and diversify our business. We had net inflows in fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives this quarter. Within alternatives, net inflows were primarily driven by deployments across several private credit funds and from CLOs. Outflows remain concentrated in our equity products. However, we had several equity products with strong inflows, including our US equity research, US all cap opportunities and global focused growth strategies. Our target date franchise had another strong quarter with net inflows of $3.7 billion. In the first half of the year, we've recorded $10.5 billion in net inflows to target date strategies. During the quarter, we also saw positive net flows from clients outside the US. Looking at our income statement. Q2 adjusted net revenues were $1.8 billion, an 8.5% increase from Q2 2023, driven by higher average AUM. Compared with Q1 2024, adjusted net revenues were essentially flat as higher investment advisory fees were offset by a decline in accrued carried interest. Our annualized effective fee rate for Q2 2024 was 41.6 basis points, which is down from the prior quarter as client flows and transfers led to a mix shift in assets under management to lower fee products and asset classes. Investment advisory revenue of $1.6 billion included $16.8 million of performance-based fees, predominantly from certain alternatives products. Our Q2 adjusted operating expenses of $1.1 billion is up 7.8% from Q2 2023, due primarily to an increase in market-driven expenses, including a higher interim bonus accrual and distribution and servicing fees. This quarter also included an increase in advertising and promotional spend as we continue executing on the investment in our brand to support future growth and higher professional fees and travel and entertainment. Our adjusted operating income increased 9.8% from Q2 2023 to $655 million. We now expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses, excluding carried interest expense to be up 6% to 8% over the comparable full-year 2023 amount of $4.19 billion. The increase in the range is entirely due to the sustained rise in equity markets and the impact on our market-driven expenses. Additionally, we are tightening our prior tax rate guidance for the full year 2024. We now anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. Our long-term capital management philosophy remains unchanged. Returning capital to stockholders through the recurring dividend remains our top priority and our strong balance sheet provides ample liquidity to also fund our seed capital program, buybacks and select future M&A, should the opportunity arise. We remain opportunistic in our approach to buybacks and repurchased $112 million worth of shares during the second quarter, reducing shares outstanding to less than 223 million. Combined with our quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share, we have returned nearly $761 million to stockholders during the first half of the year. We continue to thoughtfully manage expenses while sustaining our core investment in our associates and delivering new capabilities to best serve our clients and expand in growth areas of the market. While we have more work to do, we are encouraged by the year-over-year improvement in overall flow trends, driven by the combination of a more positive market environment, improved investment performance and certain strategies leading to lower redemptions and increasing sales pipeline and our strategic initiatives yielding results. And now, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, there. How are you? So a question on cash in retirement accounts and target date funds. I'm sure you've seen there's been heightened focus in the wealth management community in terms of what options and what people are getting paid on their cash. So I'm curious your thought process on how you handle it? Are there multiple options for clients or is this all client-driven? I'm just curious, you have obviously different business here and just want to see your approach. Thank you.\nRob Sharps: Yeah, Glenn, this is Rob. I'll start. It's predominantly client-driven. In our individual investor business, clients have multiple options for money market funds. We don't have a big sweep business in the retirement plan services business, where we're the record keeper and also on other platforms, if the plan sponsor elects, we offer stable value as a short-duration option and a highly liquid option. And we also offer money market funds. So I think the issue that you're referring to is one that really doesn't touch us as much as it does many of the wealth platforms that have sweep approaches.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Rob, I was hoping you could just expand upon the sales pipeline that you've talked about. Clearly, flow is getting better. You had a large institutional fixed income win. But was hoping you could talk about the breadth, maybe, of the sales pipeline, some of the geographical differences. You had inflows outside the US. So just a little more granularity around, not so much the quarter, but the conversations in the prospective outlook around the sales and how that compares to previous periods.\nRob Sharps: Yeah, maybe I'll zoom out a little bit and talk about flows broadly and then also talk about the pipeline. In terms of flows, I'm really pleased with the magnitude of improvement that we've had in the first half of the year. Our net outflows were $24 billion less in the first half of '24 than they were in '23. And I think we demonstrated in the second quarter, a lot of progress in really important areas. The target date flows were strong in the first half at $10.5 billion, which was better than last year's very strong $9.9 billion. That's also an area where, from a pipeline perspective, we continue to see strength. There's an element of seasonality to target date flows, but nonetheless, I really like what we're seeing, both in the flagship retirement date funds as well as with our blend offerings in retirement date. I think within alternatives, our fee basis AUM was up 11% year-over-year. But I think there's also a lot of interesting momentum in terms of new capital commitments and opportunities with OHA, whether it's in the wealth channel, as we steadily build momentum with OCREDIT, where we had $172 million [of flows] (ph) in the quarter, and continue to bring some new platforms on and are well placed to continue to build momentum there. To OLEND, which is a dedicated senior private lending facility, where there's been very strong interest. We had a first close this month and I think it also will continue to help us to show improved or accelerated growth in the alternatives area. As I noted in the prepared remarks, we had $2.4 billion of inflows year-to-date in our ETFs, with two-thirds of that in the second quarter. And I would expect the momentum there to continue to build given platform placements for several of our ETFs that either happen late in Q2 or are expected to happen in Q3. I see improvement broadly. Gross sales were up in most channels and most asset classes. We had net inflows in our Americas institutional business, in our EMEA business, and in our APAC business. I think if you look at the net sales pipeline, it does continue to improve broadly, across channels and most geographies. One element of that, though, is not just new business opportunity, I'd say it's a sharp decrease in at-risk assets corresponding largely to stronger investment performance in a lot of our well-distributed strategies. As you said, Q2 did benefit from a sizable insurance mandate. I think we have very strong positioning with scale buyers, whether it be in insurance, in retirement, in wealth, or OCIO, and I think that's likely to lead to additional large mandates down the road. In fact, we had six new wins of greater than $1 billion in the quarter, but these will be lumpy, and the one that came in in May was particularly outsized. So I'd say that combined with some seasonality would suggest to me that outflows are likely to be somewhat higher than the Q2 run rate in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, but still well below the levels that we saw last year. We're making meaningful progress, but I think we have more work to do to get to our goal of returning to positive flows at some point in calendar 2025. Hopefully, that answers the question, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nKen Worthington: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I believe you said you're partnering with a new distribution broker. I think you said 10,000 representatives. A couple of questions here. Like first, can you talk about what this means? What do you expect to get from the relationship? What are the costs of partnering on this platform? And are there other larger distribution relationships that you aspire to work with that may actually be your partners in the not-so-distant future?\nRob Sharps: Yeah, Ken, we have partnership arrangements with most of the large wealth platforms in the US. Each of them is bespoke, and I'm not going to get into the particular terms. But needless to say, I think given our breadth of offering, our scale, our investment performance in brand, we've got a big opportunity as we've continued to build out our field coverage to further penetrate those accounts. We assess each of these individual opportunities standalone and kind of ultimately engage where we think there's a win-win and where it's mutually beneficial. This particular opportunity is a platform that we've worked with in the past, but this will give us additional shelf space and placement and additional opportunity to engage with their advisors, which should allow us to grow our share. It's a relationship where I think historically our share isn't what it could be. And I think this gives us the opportunity to meaningfully gain share over time. I'm optimistic about the impact of it, but again, this is one of many of these sorts of relationships. I think we simply called it out because it's a new one.\nKen Worthington: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you. On the bond mandate, could you give us the actual size so we have a better idea of what the flows looks like without it? And you mentioned six new wins of $1 billion-plus. Should we take that to mean that those are still to fund or were those funded in the first half? Thank you.\nRob Sharps: Specifically to the latter part of the question, they funded in the second quarter. Yeah. Again, I call that out partly just to say that I think we're really well positioned with buyers of scale and our pipeline would suggest that there are additional opportunities. But again, they'll be uneven. I'm not going to talk about the size of a particular mandate, but it was quite substantial. And I don't know, Jen, if we've said more about it.\nJen Dardis: No, we haven't. I mean, I think you can get a sense by looking at our fixed income assets quarter over quarter and you can get a sense for general size.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Rob, if you can talk about the distribution channels that you think are most sensitive to the improved performance, where you may be able to more quickly leverage the performance improvement and in conjunction with that, the platforming of the equity ETFs and maybe just talk about the pipeline of adding new products there. And to what extent do you think these will be -- can be more bought products rather than sold products phase on online channels and whether that might be more sensitive to improve performance?\nRob Sharps: Sure. I think in general, look, all underlying investors are sensitive to performance, right? That's our value proposition as an active manager. But the cadence tends to happen differently in different channels. What I've observed is that in the -- our direct individual and in the wealth business, the reaction tends to happen a little bit more quickly. And in the institutional or large intermediary mandate channel, it tends to happen with more of a lag. I think we've observed in some of the areas where we had a performance challenge improvement in those areas that tend to leverage funds or commingled vehicles first and then subsequently, have started to see some improvement on the institutional or large mandate size. So if you think about institutional separate account, whether it's defined benefit mandate or defined contribution investment only, where it's on somebody else's recordkeeping platform or a big sub-advise mandate, those tend to react a little bit more slowly. So we first began to see improvement in the funds portion that tends to be leveraged in the wealth channel, and now we're beginning to see some improvement as well in the institutional channel.\nJen Dardis: We've talked before about the fact that you'll see redemptions pick up when you have a performance cycle. You'll see redemptions pick up or sales slow first, then redemptions pick up, then you'll see redemption start to slow, and then you'll finally see sales start to pick up. I'd say on the redemption cycle, we're very far through seeing the improvement in redemptions, getting much closer to what are more traditional levels of redemptions in those products. I'd say on the sales cycle, we're much earlier in seeing the improvement in sales.\nRob Sharps: Yeah. And then, with regard to ETFs and the pipeline, we launched, I think just recently our 16th ETF, which is intermediate muni bond ETF offering. We've got a handful of others that we're working on launching, and we'll continue to evaluate where there is a sizable opportunity and where we believe we can deliver a differentiated or compelling offering. It would be my intention to broaden the number of strategies that we offer as ETFs over time, but I think we'll do it in a thoughtful way. We want to do it kind of in areas that our clients value and where we can deliver something that's differentiated and durable.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you. Maybe just continuing with the ETF topic here. You seem to be having some good traction and success there. Just want to drill down a little more. Hoping you could elaborate on your sales and distribution approach with ETFs. How that differs from your approach to sale of more traditional mutual funds for you? And then more broadly, if you could just comment on your strategy and approach, including the way that you are going to market with, in some cases, replications of what you already offer in mutual funds, versus opportunities with other strategies that are different from what you already have. How you think about that approach and navigate certain challenges in the marketplace that may or may not create. Thank you.\nEric Veiel: Sure. This is Eric. I'll take a first cut at that one. In terms of how we go to market with our ETFs, it is, as Rob mentioned, we have 16 different strategies across asset classes. We have a specialist ETF capability where we have dedicated expertise from a sales perspective to support our field team as they're out talking to different parts of the USI or the US intermediary channel, across the wealth advisors specifically, but also to target parts of the market where historically we haven't done as much because prior to the last several years, we didn't have much of an ETF offering. So there are dedicated advisors out there who solely use ETFs and we've been working to discover those advisors and reach out to them with our capabilities. That's coincided with increased interest in active ETFs from a market perspective, and we've benefited from our capabilities as an active manager and the brand that we have in building out our presence there. I think there's plenty more to do, and we're still in, what I would say, the early stages of identifying and penetrating that unique market opportunity. In terms of the second part of your question, where we offer clones or similar clones to our existing strategies, as well as new capabilities, we want to be able to bring, as Rob said before, our full set of investment capabilities to our clients. We started with the semitransparent active equity ETF suite because that is what we were well known for, strategies that we believed that the market would embrace. And they did, up to a point. We then wanted to make sure that we were able to bring new capabilities, using our research platform to offer strategies that brought even more capabilities across the ETF suite, meaning, full transparency, maximized tax efficiency into that market. And we were able to do that also then to get into categories that we weren't able to do before with semitransparent, specifically the international area where the semitransparent doesn't allow you to do some of the holdings. So that allowed us to broaden our suite out.\nRob Sharps: Yeah, I'd just add that we find that there are certain clients that really value the clone, semitransparent approach because they're able to access known strategy with long tenure track record in the ETF vehicle. I think there are other clients that are much more familiar and comfortable with the fully transparent approach. And I think we are now in a place where we are comfortable delivering a range of investment strategies across both approaches and feel both approaches have merit.\nJen Dardis: And I think back to the earlier point of those relationships with larger platforms and clients, we use those relationships to help inform where people have gaps. I mean, we want to understand where things can get placement as early as possible. Because I think you've seen with a number of offerings in market. It's really important to try to get those scaled strategies -- those strategies scaled as quickly as you possibly can to make sure that they can cut through the noise. And so our focus has really been on both getting those products launched, but also getting them above those important sort of $100 million to $200 million asset ranges.\nRob Sharps: I'd say I've been pleased and maybe a little surprised at the range of investors that the ETFs have appealed to. As Eric said, we're targeting a number of RIAs that are ETF power users, as well as more traditional wealth platforms and broker-dealers. And we've got some interesting placements that I think kind of really present a big opportunity. But we've also had some institutional investors, some investors based outside the US that have been attracted to the ETF vehicle. So I think it's encouraging. It's still relatively small in the context of our overall AUM base, but I think it's a huge and compelling opportunity for us, and it's one we're really leaning into.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I actually have a request and then a question. So one thing just to consider, many of your peers provide an adjusted income statement, which really would reduce the potential for misunderstandings and errors around interpreting your results. And I'd like to just please ask you to request putting that together because of the way the disclosure now is a little -- I'm worried it could lead to some confusion. My question is on OCREDIT. So we hear it's a bit of a me too product and given that it came after some firmly established products in the marketplace. I'd love to hear you lay out for me the case for how it's differentiated from established offerings such as BCRED and maybe how you're explaining that differentiation to your distribution partners. Thanks.\nRob Sharps: Yeah. I think it's differentiated in a handful of ways. Look, it is a competitive marketplace and there are a number of established offerings. I think our approach is compelling, one, because we bring OHA's 30-year track record to delivering private credit strategies. Two, we bring T. Rowe Price's relationships with the wealth platforms and our relationships in the field. If you think about our regional investment consultants, they work with a lot of brokers and advisors that may not have used alternatives or a BDC in the past. And when I engage with the big wealth platforms, one of their key objectives is to broaden the penetration of alternatives within their advisor and client base. So I think what's differentiated about our approach is we can use the depth of our relationships in the field to help them further penetrate their base with a product that is being managed by a team that has a very compelling standout track record in running private credit strategies. So I do think that it is difficult to stand out, particularly in an environment where credit defaults have been extraordinarily low from an investment performance perspective. And I think it's fair to say that you really have to work hard to differentiate and get attention. I think there's a tremendous amount of power in the combination of T. Rowe Price's presence and relationships in the wealth channel, particularly with advisors that might this -- where this might be a first experience or a first opportunity to engage in alternatives. So that's the approach and the part of the market that we're really starting to attack. I think this is a first offering. We're also working on OFLEX, which is an interval fund. We're taking feedback from the wealth platforms on where there is interest and where something might be more differentiated or more attractive and I think are hopeful that as we roll those out and build those relationships that we'll be able to leverage them and establish more momentum going forward.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, Rob. Hey, good morning everybody. Question for you guys on the fee rates. It looks like the pace of fee rate compression picked up a little bit sequentially and I know you talked about both kind of the mix of flows and just some of the transfer. So can you help kind of go through that a little more? And as you think about the difference in the fee rates among some of the larger kind of transfer buckets, what does that stand today and how do you expect that to evolve over the next couple of quarters?\nJen Dardis: Yeah, thanks Alex. I'll start. We've said that over time we see fee compression of about 1% to 1.5%. That's what we've seen over the past several years. Quarter-to-quarter you can see some noise. And so in any given quarter, we can see the impact of clients choosing lower fee products, which could be vehicles or asset classes or individual strategies. You can also see periodically we'll do some realignments of clients into vehicles, so that'll be existing clients moving from one vehicle to another, and that can create kind of more noise in a specific quarter. We saw both of that during this quarter. And again, so I think over a longer period of time we've seen that continued trend, but this particular quarter you saw both of those things.\nRob Sharps: Yeah, Alex, as Jen said, a lot of factors impact the fee rate, asset class mix, vehicle mix, performance fees, each of those can move around a lot in any one quarter. So I wouldn't read too much into a quarter\u2019s results favorable or unfavorable. We want to continue to share some of the benefits of scale with our clients and invest in our value proposition and hope to win sizable new mandates, growing fixed income, growing some other lower fee areas including integrated equity and with our blend RDF strategy. So -- and the arithmetic is that success in those areas will pressure the fee rate, but it's still very good business. I would say that as we grow in alternatives, there should be some offset. And I think the net result is that we're likely to see kind of fee compression very consistent if you look over multiple quarters with what we've navigated in the past.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nBill Katz: Okay, thank you very much for taking the question and also thank you for the abbreviated opening remarks. I hope that's a trend for your peers. In terms of just a clarifying question, you mentioned that you expect seasonally a second half pick up in redemptions. Just wondering if you could sort of highlight the reason for that. But the broader question I have is, as you think about some of the changes that are happening in the competitive landscape, whether it be on the traditional side or more opportunity on the alternative side, where I think the greater focus is, how are you thinking about the sort of attacking that on a de novo basis and to alignments like KKR and Capital Group maybe shift your thinking about how to accelerate that opportunity? Thank you.\nJen Dardis: Well, I think, starting with the redemptions question, I think seasonally we look at our flows and so it's both sales and redemptions and I think Rob had specifically referenced earlier the target date franchise. There it's less about redemptions, and it's more about the pace of sales and the pipeline that we see in the second half of the year. We've talked in the past about it's not fully seasonal, it's not that everything happens in the first quarter of the year, but you do see more activity in the first quarter of the year. You can see plan size changes in just smaller amounts through the balance of the year. I think -- yes?\nRob Sharps: Bill, I think what I was trying to get across isn't that I expect redemptions to pick up in the back half of the year. It's that, if you think about net flows, it\u2019s gross sales and redemptions. And gross sales in the second quarter were inflated by a lumpy sizable mandate. So I wouldn't take the Q2 net flow rate and annualize it in the back half of the year. That's all I was really trying to say. We actually see a trend of redemption pressure easing in some of the places where we had some performance struggles at this point over a year and a half ago. So, again, I'm encouraged both on the gross sales side and the redemption side with regard to the outlook, but there is a little bit of seasonality in the gross sales side of the target date fund business. And we did have the benefit of that sizeable insurance mandate that funded in May. So that\u2019s really only point that I was making there. I think we're well positioned whether it's across multi-asset with retirement date fund, we've got a big opportunity to grow outside of the United States, we've got a big opportunity to grow in fixed income, we've got a big opportunity to grow in ETFs, and we've got a big opportunity with OHA. I think there are more things that we can do in alternatives. And I think there are instances where we might be open to partnering, but only where I believe it would make sense. There are things that we can do de novo that we can develop organically and we'll continue to evaluate doing additional acquisitions like OHA. There might be instances where there's an offering that we choose not to be the manager for and to marry as part of a multi-asset offering or otherwise. But I think my preferred approach would be to kind of ultimately have our distribution focus on selling T. Rowe Price or T. Rowe Price controlled strategies. I think it makes things cleaner and simpler than having two investment teams coordinate, delivering a strategy. And obviously it gives us a little bit more control over the caliber of outcome that we deliver on behalf of our clients.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session and today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

That's coincided with increased interest in active ETFs from a market perspective, and we've benefited from our capabilities as an active manager and the brand that we have in building out our presence there. I think there's plenty more to do, and we're still in, what I would say, the early stages of identifying and penetrating that unique market opportunity. In terms of the second part of your question, where we offer clones or similar clones to our existing strategies, as well as new capabilities, we want to be able to bring, as Rob said before, our full set of investment capabilities to our clients. We started with the semitransparent active equity ETF suite because that is what we were well known for, strategies that we believed that the market would embrace. And they did, up to a point. We then wanted to make sure that we were able to bring new capabilities, using our research platform to offer strategies that brought even more capabilities across the ETF suite, meaning, full transparency, maximized tax efficiency into that market. And we were able to do that also then to get into categories that we weren't able to do before with semitransparent, specifically the international area where the semitransparent doesn't allow you to do some of the holdings. So that allowed us to broaden our suite out."

            "name": "Jen Dardis",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. I'll review our second quarter results before opening the line for questions. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.26 was up nearly 12% from Q2 2023, driven by higher operating income and a lower effective tax rate. As Rob mentioned, we reported $3.7 billion in Q2 net outflows. Results this quarter included a large fixed income win from an insurance client that funded in May. While these types of flows can be lumpy, we are pleased it's in a space where we've been building client relationships to help grow and diversify our business. We had net inflows in fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives this quarter. Within alternatives, net inflows were primarily driven by deployments across several private credit funds and from CLOs. Outflows remain concentrated in our equity products. However, we had several equity products with strong inflows, including our US equity research, US all cap opportunities and global focused growth strategies. Our target date franchise had another strong quarter with net inflows of $3.7 billion. In the first half of the year, we've recorded $10.5 billion in net inflows to target date strategies. During the quarter, we also saw positive net flows from clients outside the US. Looking at our income statement. Q2 adjusted net revenues were $1.8 billion, an 8.5% increase from Q2 2023, driven by higher average AUM. Compared with Q1 2024, adjusted net revenues were essentially flat as higher investment advisory fees were offset by a decline in accrued carried interest. Our annualized effective fee rate for Q2 2024 was 41.6 basis points, which is down from the prior quarter as client flows and transfers led to a mix shift in assets under management to lower fee products and asset classes. Investment advisory revenue of $1.6 billion included $16.8 million of performance-based fees, predominantly from certain alternatives products. Our Q2 adjusted operating expenses of $1.1 billion is up 7.8% from Q2 2023, due primarily to an increase in market-driven expenses, including a higher interim bonus accrual and distribution and servicing fees. This quarter also included an increase in advertising and promotional spend as we continue executing on the investment in our brand to support future growth and higher professional fees and travel and entertainment. Our adjusted operating income increased 9.8% from Q2 2023 to $655 million. We now expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses, excluding carried interest expense to be up 6% to 8% over the comparable full-year 2023 amount of $4.19 billion. The increase in the range is entirely due to the sustained rise in equity markets and the impact on our market-driven expenses. Additionally, we are tightening our prior tax rate guidance for the full year 2024. We now anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. Our long-term capital management philosophy remains unchanged. Returning capital to stockholders through the recurring dividend remains our top priority and our strong balance sheet provides ample liquidity to also fund our seed capital program, buybacks and select future M&A, should the opportunity arise. We remain opportunistic in our approach to buybacks and repurchased $112 million worth of shares during the second quarter, reducing shares outstanding to less than 223 million. Combined with our quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share, we have returned nearly $761 million to stockholders during the first half of the year. We continue to thoughtfully manage expenses while sustaining our core investment in our associates and delivering new capabilities to best serve our clients and expand in growth areas of the market. While we have more work to do, we are encouraged by the year-over-year improvement in overall flow trends, driven by the combination of a more positive market environment, improved investment performance and certain strategies leading to lower redemptions and increasing sales pipeline and our strategic initiatives yielding results. And now, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. No, we haven't. I mean, I think you can get a sense by looking at our fixed income assets quarter over quarter and you can get a sense for general size. We've talked before about the fact that you'll see redemptions pick up when you have a performance cycle. You'll see redemptions pick up or sales slow first, then redemptions pick up, then you'll see redemption start to slow, and then you'll finally see sales start to pick up. I'd say on the redemption cycle, we're very far through seeing the improvement in redemptions, getting much closer to what are more traditional levels of redemptions in those products. I'd say on the sales cycle, we're much earlier in seeing the improvement in sales. And I think back to the earlier point of those relationships with larger platforms and clients, we use those relationships to help inform where people have gaps. I mean, we want to understand where things can get placement as early as possible. Because I think you've seen with a number of offerings in market. It's really important to try to get those scaled strategies -- those strategies scaled as quickly as you possibly can to make sure that they can cut through the noise. And so our focus has really been on both getting those products launched, but also getting them above those important sort of $100 million to $200 million asset ranges. Yeah, thanks Alex. I'll start. We've said that over time we see fee compression of about 1% to 1.5%. That's what we've seen over the past several years. Quarter-to-quarter you can see some noise. And so in any given quarter, we can see the impact of clients choosing lower fee products, which could be vehicles or asset classes or individual strategies. You can also see periodically we'll do some realignments of clients into vehicles, so that'll be existing clients moving from one vehicle to another, and that can create kind of more noise in a specific quarter. We saw both of that during this quarter. And again, so I think over a longer period of time we've seen that continued trend, but this particular quarter you saw both of those things. Well, I think, starting with the redemptions question, I think seasonally we look at our flows and so it's both sales and redemptions and I think Rob had specifically referenced earlier the target date franchise. There it's less about redemptions, and it's more about the pace of sales and the pipeline that we see in the second half of the year. We've talked in the past about it's not fully seasonal, it's not that everything happens in the first quarter of the year, but you do see more activity in the first quarter of the year. You can see plan size changes in just smaller amounts through the balance of the year. I think -- yes?"

            "name": "Rob Sharps",
            "content": "Linsley, thank you and thank you all for joining us today. As we shared in our earnings release, we ended the quarter with just under $1.57 trillion in assets under management and $3.7 billion in net outflows. While market gains continued to support our financial results, I'm pleased to say that we are making steady progress in flows and investment performance. Our sales pipeline is healthy, redemption pressure is stabilizing, and our associates are driving our strategic initiatives forward. We continue to be on track to substantially reduce net outflows this year. Overall, our investment performance remained solid in the second quarter with two-thirds of our funds beating their peer group one-year medians and over 40% of our funds in the top quartile. In our equity franchise, US equity research, US mid-cap value, international value, financial services, integrated US small mid-cap core equity and integrated global equity are all top-quartile performers for the one-year, three-year and five-year time periods. The transparent equity ETFs we launched last year are demonstrating strong performance with the growth, value and small mid-cap ETFs, all top-quartile performers versus peers for the one-year time period. In our fixed income franchise, several of our muni funds as well as our institutional floating rate and credit opportunities funds have one-year, three-year and five-year top quartile performance. Both our flagship retirement funds and the newer retirement blend version of the strategy continued to deliver strong performance across multiple time periods. Returns across alternative strategies continued to be strong with alpha generated across the portfolios, primarily due to effective individual credit selection. Jen will discuss our flows and financials in more detail shortly, but I wanted to take a moment to highlight our ETF business. As of June 30, we reached $5.3 billion in assets under management, up from $1.2 billion in June 2023. In the first half of this year, we've had $2.4 billion of inflows to our ETFs. We are excited by this growth in our ETFs and that we are attracting diverse investors across wealth management, institutional, direct retail and investors outside the United States. We expect that the appetite for our ETFs will continue to grow throughout the year as five of our 16 ETFs, including US equity research and blue chip growth have each grown to over $300 million in assets, which is the size eligible for many platforms. Our transparent equity ETFs now have a one-year track record, a requirement for most platforms. We are broadening the product lineup, including the recently launched T. Rowe Price Intermediate Municipal Income ETF, which is our sixth fixed income ETF and our first federal tax-free fixed income ETF. And we are planning to make additional investment strategies available as ETFs over time. Our associates are driving this progress and it extends beyond our ETF business. I'll highlight a few recent milestones. We filed the launch of the T. Rowe Price OHA Flexible Credit Income Fund or OFLEX, our first interval fund. We were named a strategic partner to one of the largest independent broker-dealers in the United States, allowing us to bring our products and insights to their more than 10,000 financial advisors and their 2 million end clients. Our SMA franchise grew to more than $8 billion in assets as of June 30 with $1 billion in net flows year-to-date. After seeing strong demand for the ETF version of capital appreciation equity, we launched this strategy as an SMA. We unveiled our retirement income solutions 5D framework. This new patent-pending framework will help define the contribution plan sponsors evaluate retirement income offerings and quantify which solutions may best fit the needs and preferences of their planned participants. I'd like to finish by noting that I spent time in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in the second quarter. The constant across our offices is our associates' deep commitment to delivering results for our clients and to advancing our strategic initiatives. We are seeing their efforts reflected in our results, and I want to thank associates across all of our locations for their hard work to deliver value for our clients and our firm. I'll now turn to Jen for our financial results. Yeah, Glenn, this is Rob. I'll start. It's predominantly client-driven. In our individual investor business, clients have multiple options for money market funds. We don't have a big sweep business in the retirement plan services business, where we're the record keeper and also on other platforms, if the plan sponsor elects, we offer stable value as a short-duration option and a highly liquid option. And we also offer money market funds. So I think the issue that you're referring to is one that really doesn't touch us as much as it does many of the wealth platforms that have sweep approaches. Yeah, maybe I'll zoom out a little bit and talk about flows broadly and then also talk about the pipeline. In terms of flows, I'm really pleased with the magnitude of improvement that we've had in the first half of the year. Our net outflows were $24 billion less in the first half of '24 than they were in '23. And I think we demonstrated in the second quarter, a lot of progress in really important areas. The target date flows were strong in the first half at $10.5 billion, which was better than last year's very strong $9.9 billion. That's also an area where, from a pipeline perspective, we continue to see strength. There's an element of seasonality to target date flows, but nonetheless, I really like what we're seeing, both in the flagship retirement date funds as well as with our blend offerings in retirement date. I think within alternatives, our fee basis AUM was up 11% year-over-year. But I think there's also a lot of interesting momentum in terms of new capital commitments and opportunities with OHA, whether it's in the wealth channel, as we steadily build momentum with OCREDIT, where we had $172 million [of flows] (ph) in the quarter, and continue to bring some new platforms on and are well placed to continue to build momentum there. To OLEND, which is a dedicated senior private lending facility, where there's been very strong interest. We had a first close this month and I think it also will continue to help us to show improved or accelerated growth in the alternatives area. As I noted in the prepared remarks, we had $2.4 billion of inflows year-to-date in our ETFs, with two-thirds of that in the second quarter. And I would expect the momentum there to continue to build given platform placements for several of our ETFs that either happen late in Q2 or are expected to happen in Q3. I see improvement broadly. Gross sales were up in most channels and most asset classes. We had net inflows in our Americas institutional business, in our EMEA business, and in our APAC business. I think if you look at the net sales pipeline, it does continue to improve broadly, across channels and most geographies. One element of that, though, is not just new business opportunity, I'd say it's a sharp decrease in at-risk assets corresponding largely to stronger investment performance in a lot of our well-distributed strategies. As you said, Q2 did benefit from a sizable insurance mandate. I think we have very strong positioning with scale buyers, whether it be in insurance, in retirement, in wealth, or OCIO, and I think that's likely to lead to additional large mandates down the road. In fact, we had six new wins of greater than $1 billion in the quarter, but these will be lumpy, and the one that came in in May was particularly outsized. So I'd say that combined with some seasonality would suggest to me that outflows are likely to be somewhat higher than the Q2 run rate in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, but still well below the levels that we saw last year. We're making meaningful progress, but I think we have more work to do to get to our goal of returning to positive flows at some point in calendar 2025. Hopefully, that answers the question, Dan. Yeah, Ken, we have partnership arrangements with most of the large wealth platforms in the US. Each of them is bespoke, and I'm not going to get into the particular terms. But needless to say, I think given our breadth of offering, our scale, our investment performance in brand, we've got a big opportunity as we've continued to build out our field coverage to further penetrate those accounts. We assess each of these individual opportunities standalone and kind of ultimately engage where we think there's a win-win and where it's mutually beneficial. This particular opportunity is a platform that we've worked with in the past, but this will give us additional shelf space and placement and additional opportunity to engage with their advisors, which should allow us to grow our share. It's a relationship where I think historically our share isn't what it could be. And I think this gives us the opportunity to meaningfully gain share over time. I'm optimistic about the impact of it, but again, this is one of many of these sorts of relationships. I think we simply called it out because it's a new one. Specifically to the latter part of the question, they funded in the second quarter. Yeah. Again, I call that out partly just to say that I think we're really well positioned with buyers of scale and our pipeline would suggest that there are additional opportunities. But again, they'll be uneven. I'm not going to talk about the size of a particular mandate, but it was quite substantial. And I don't know, Jen, if we've said more about it. Sure. I think in general, look, all underlying investors are sensitive to performance, right? That's our value proposition as an active manager. But the cadence tends to happen differently in different channels. What I've observed is that in the -- our direct individual and in the wealth business, the reaction tends to happen a little bit more quickly. And in the institutional or large intermediary mandate channel, it tends to happen with more of a lag. I think we've observed in some of the areas where we had a performance challenge improvement in those areas that tend to leverage funds or commingled vehicles first and then subsequently, have started to see some improvement on the institutional or large mandate size. So if you think about institutional separate account, whether it's defined benefit mandate or defined contribution investment only, where it's on somebody else's recordkeeping platform or a big sub-advise mandate, those tend to react a little bit more slowly. So we first began to see improvement in the funds portion that tends to be leveraged in the wealth channel, and now we're beginning to see some improvement as well in the institutional channel. Yeah. And then, with regard to ETFs and the pipeline, we launched, I think just recently our 16th ETF, which is intermediate muni bond ETF offering. We've got a handful of others that we're working on launching, and we'll continue to evaluate where there is a sizable opportunity and where we believe we can deliver a differentiated or compelling offering. It would be my intention to broaden the number of strategies that we offer as ETFs over time, but I think we'll do it in a thoughtful way. We want to do it kind of in areas that our clients value and where we can deliver something that's differentiated and durable. Yeah, I'd just add that we find that there are certain clients that really value the clone, semitransparent approach because they're able to access known strategy with long tenure track record in the ETF vehicle. I think there are other clients that are much more familiar and comfortable with the fully transparent approach. And I think we are now in a place where we are comfortable delivering a range of investment strategies across both approaches and feel both approaches have merit. I'd say I've been pleased and maybe a little surprised at the range of investors that the ETFs have appealed to. As Eric said, we're targeting a number of RIAs that are ETF power users, as well as more traditional wealth platforms and broker-dealers. And we've got some interesting placements that I think kind of really present a big opportunity. But we've also had some institutional investors, some investors based outside the US that have been attracted to the ETF vehicle. So I think it's encouraging. It's still relatively small in the context of our overall AUM base, but I think it's a huge and compelling opportunity for us, and it's one we're really leaning into. Yeah. I think it's differentiated in a handful of ways. Look, it is a competitive marketplace and there are a number of established offerings. I think our approach is compelling, one, because we bring OHA's 30-year track record to delivering private credit strategies. Two, we bring T. Rowe Price's relationships with the wealth platforms and our relationships in the field. If you think about our regional investment consultants, they work with a lot of brokers and advisors that may not have used alternatives or a BDC in the past. And when I engage with the big wealth platforms, one of their key objectives is to broaden the penetration of alternatives within their advisor and client base. So I think what's differentiated about our approach is we can use the depth of our relationships in the field to help them further penetrate their base with a product that is being managed by a team that has a very compelling standout track record in running private credit strategies. So I do think that it is difficult to stand out, particularly in an environment where credit defaults have been extraordinarily low from an investment performance perspective. And I think it's fair to say that you really have to work hard to differentiate and get attention. I think there's a tremendous amount of power in the combination of T. Rowe Price's presence and relationships in the wealth channel, particularly with advisors that might this -- where this might be a first experience or a first opportunity to engage in alternatives. So that's the approach and the part of the market that we're really starting to attack. I think this is a first offering. We're also working on OFLEX, which is an interval fund. We're taking feedback from the wealth platforms on where there is interest and where something might be more differentiated or more attractive and I think are hopeful that as we roll those out and build those relationships that we'll be able to leverage them and establish more momentum going forward. Yeah, Alex, as Jen said, a lot of factors impact the fee rate, asset class mix, vehicle mix, performance fees, each of those can move around a lot in any one quarter. So I wouldn't read too much into a quarter's results favorable or unfavorable. We want to continue to share some of the benefits of scale with our clients and invest in our value proposition and hope to win sizable new mandates, growing fixed income, growing some other lower fee areas including integrated equity and with our blend RDF strategy. So -- and the arithmetic is that success in those areas will pressure the fee rate, but it's still very good business. I would say that as we grow in alternatives, there should be some offset. And I think the net result is that we're likely to see kind of fee compression very consistent if you look over multiple quarters with what we've navigated in the past. Bill, I think what I was trying to get across isn't that I expect redemptions to pick up in the back half of the year. It's that, if you think about net flows, it's gross sales and redemptions. And gross sales in the second quarter were inflated by a lumpy sizable mandate. So I wouldn't take the Q2 net flow rate and annualize it in the back half of the year. That's all I was really trying to say. We actually see a trend of redemption pressure easing in some of the places where we had some performance struggles at this point over a year and a half ago. So, again, I'm encouraged both on the gross sales side and the redemption side with regard to the outlook, but there is a little bit of seasonality in the gross sales side of the target date fund business. And we did have the benefit of that sizeable insurance mandate that funded in May. So that's really only point that I was making there. I think we're well positioned whether it's across multi-asset with retirement date fund, we've got a big opportunity to grow outside of the United States, we've got a big opportunity to grow in fixed income, we've got a big opportunity to grow in ETFs, and we've got a big opportunity with OHA. I think there are more things that we can do in alternatives. And I think there are instances where we might be open to partnering, but only where I believe it would make sense. There are things that we can do de novo that we can develop organically and we'll continue to evaluate doing additional acquisitions like OHA. There might be instances where there's an offering that we choose not to be the manager for and to marry as part of a multi-asset offering or otherwise. But I think my preferred approach would be to kind of ultimately have our distribution focus on selling T. Rowe Price or T. Rowe Price controlled strategies. I think it makes things cleaner and simpler than having two investment teams coordinate, delivering a strategy. And obviously it gives us a little bit more control over the caliber of outcome that we deliver on behalf of our clients."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be available for replay on T. Rowe Price's website shortly after the call concludes. \n I will now turn the call over to Linsley Carruth, T. Rowe Price's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nLinsley Carruth: Hello, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. The press release and the supplemental materials document can be found on our IR website at investors.troweprice.com. \n Today's call will last approximately 45 minutes. Our CEO and President, Rob Sharps; CFO, Jen Dardis, and Head of Global Distribution, Dee Sawyer, will discuss the company's results for about 20 minutes. Then we'll open it up to your questions, at which time we'll be joined by Head of Global Investments, Eric Veiel. We ask that you limit it to 1 question per participant. \n I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements and reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statement language and the reconciliations to GAAP in the supplemental materials as well as in our press release and 10-Q. All investment performance references to peer groups on today's call are using Morningstar peer groups. \n Now I'll turn it over to Rob. \nRobert Sharps: Linsley, thank you. And thank you all for joining us this morning for our first quarter update. Before I get started, I'm pleased to say that Dee Sawyer, our Head of Global Distribution and a member of our firm's Management Committee, will be joining us today. Dee will provide an overview of our Retirement business, which is critical to our clients and integral to our firm's long-term success. We'll hear from Dee after Jen's update on our financial results. \n With that, I'll turn to first quarter performance. Tailwinds from stronger-than-anticipated markets drove assets under management up in the first quarter, bringing our total assets under management to $1.54 trillion as of March 31, a 15% increase over the first quarter of 2023. \n Our first quarter net outflows of $8 billion were about half the level we had in the first quarter of last year. This improvement came from increased client demand driving higher sales and stronger investment performance reducing redemptions, particularly in U.S. equity. \n As I said on last quarter's call, we expect to see net outflows in 2024, but anticipate substantial improvement compared to last year. However, this improvement will not be linear. It's important to understand that monthly flows can be heavily impacted by client activity, including rebalancing, new mandates and terminations. \n So far in the second quarter, net flows are shaping up to be weaker in April, in part due to rebalancing in a handful of large clients. However, at this point, our pipeline suggests the balance of the quarter will be stronger. \n Investment performance was solid in the first quarter, with 65% of our funds beating their peer group 1-year medians. \n I'd like to mention a few other performance highlights. Our capital appreciation, U.S. equity research, mid-cap value and financial services funds all had top quartile performance versus peers for the 1-, 3- and 5-year time periods. Our integrated U.S. Small Cap Core and integrated global equity funds, which combine our fundamental and systematic processes were also top quartile performers for these time periods. \n And in our multi-asset range, our nearer dated retirement funds, the 2005 to 2035 vintages as well as our managed payout fund, retirement income 2020 are all top quartile performers for the 1-, 3- and 5-year periods. All vintages of our more recently launched retirement blend funds are top quartile performers for the 1-year period. \n Over 50% of our fixed income funds beat their peer group medians for the 1-, 3- and 5-year time periods, and several of our fixed income Muni Funds as well as our global multi-sector bond, credit opportunities and U.S. dollar-hedged international bond funds are in the top third of their peer groups for these same periods. \n Investment performance across the alternatives platform in the first quarter was generally strong. Private credit, Structured products and liquid portfolios generated attractive returns driven by strong credit selection and favorable market dynamics. \n Before I turn it over to Jen, I want to acknowledge our associates. We reached important milestones in the first quarter, thanks to their hard work and commitment to our clients, including our capital appreciation equity ETF surpassed $1 billion in assets under management, less than a year after its launch last June. \n Across a number of channels, we are seeing sales momentum with significant year-over-year gross sales improvement with our wealth and individual investor clients. \n Earlier this month, OCREDIT launched on its first major wire house, demonstrating the close partnership of T. Rowe Price and OHA in successfully launching our first BDC with a key strategic partner in the wealth management channel. \n We retained our #2 position among the over 330 asset managers nominated in Institutional Investors 2024 ranking of America's top asset management firms. This distinction reflects the value of our corporate access model and the importance of our differentiated research capabilities. \n And for the 14th consecutive year, the firm was named one of Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. I'm proud of these accomplishments, and I'm grateful to our associates around the globe, who continue to put our clients first in everything they do. \n With that, Jen will now provide an overview of our first quarter results. \nJen Dardis: Thank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. I'll review our first quarter results before turning to Dee for a look at our Retirement business. \n Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.38 for Q1 2024 was up 40% from Q1 2023, driven by higher average AUM and investment advisory revenue and offset marginally by higher expenses. \n As Rob mentioned, we had $8 billion in net outflows for the quarter. Across asset classes, outflows were concentrated in U.S. equity, particularly large and mid-cap growth strategies. However, it's important to note that this quarter's U.S. equity outflows were less than half the level in the first quarter of last year, a meaningful improvement driven by higher sales and lower redemption rates, and consistent with improved investment performance. \n There were a few notable areas of strength within the equity franchise, including U.S. structured research and U.S. smaller companies, both of which had strong flows to the CCAP product from EMEA-based clients. \n In fixed income, strong investment-grade flows in the institutional channel were offset by continued outflows from stable value in the DC channel. \n Our target date franchise was positive for the quarter, with inflows of $6.8 billion, offset in part by outflows from other multi-asset products. And finally, we had just under $1 billion of outflows in alternatives from manager-driven distribution. However, we are encouraged by recent trends in fundraising and expect capital raising to increase through the year. \n Turning to our income statement. Q1 adjusted net revenues were $1.8 billion, a nearly 14% increase from Q1 of last year, driven by higher average AUM. Our investment advisory revenue of $1.6 billion included $17.6 million in performance-based fees, predominantly from 2 of our U.S. equity strategies. These performance-based fees had a 0.5 basis point impact on our effective fee rate of 42.1 basis points. \n Our Q1 adjusted operating expenses were $1.1 billion, which is up almost 5% over last year from market-driven expenses, including the interim bonus accrual and distribution and servicing costs. Expense growth was tempered by the cost savings efforts we announced last summer. Our adjusted operating expenses were down nearly 7% from Q4 2023, due to the Q4 seasonality in stock-based compensation, professional fees and advertising and promotion expenses. \n Adjusted operating income increased 31% from Q1 2023 to $692 million. This brings our rolling 12-month adjusted operating margin to 36%, up from 35% a year ago. \n Given the rise in equity markets over the last few months and related impact on our market-driven expenses, which, as a reminder, is about 1/3 of our expense base, we now expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses, excluding carried interest expense, to be up 5% to 7% over 2023's $4.19 billion. \n Maintaining a strong cash position and distributing capital back to our stockholders remains a priority. We bought back $80 million worth of shares during the first quarter, reducing the shares outstanding to 223.5 million as of March 31, and have continued to buy back in April. Combined with our quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share, we returned $365 million in the first quarter. \n With $2.9 billion of cash and discretionary investments on our balance sheet, we have ample liquidity to support the recurring dividend, continue opportunistic buybacks and if they were to arise, to pursue select M&A opportunities to add capabilities to our business. \n We continue to manage the business with a long-term lens, balancing the investment in our strategic initiatives to drive growth over time with the need for ongoing expense discipline. From this position, we can continue delivering exceptional value for our clients by decking resources against new opportunities and added capabilities, while also identifying process improvements and driving efficiency. \n And now I'll turn it over to Dee. \nDorothy Sawyer: Thank you, Jen. I am pleased to join today's call to talk about our Retirement business. As Rob noted, our clients have entrusted us with $1.54 trillion in assets. Of that, over $1 trillion, more than 2/3, are identifiable as retirement assets, demonstrating that retirement is a critical component of our business. Slides 15 and 16 in the supplemental deck provide a detailed view of our retirement assets. \n I want to take a moment to share a few highlights. First, the majority of our retirement assets, $676 billion or 65% are in U.S. defined contribution plans, with the balance in defined benefit and individual IRA accounts. \n Taking a closer look at our U.S. defined contribution assets, 395 billion or almost 60% are in our Target Date franchise. In fact, we are the top manager of active Target Date assets, a position we have held for 7 years, and we have the third largest market share overall. \n But our DC business is more than Target Date. Plan sponsors select T. Rowe Price for equity and fixed income investment options as well, with U.S. large cap growth equity and stable value being the largest proportion of the balance of our DC business. \n We serve the DC channel in 2 ways. The majority of our DC assets are DC investment-only or DCIO, where the consultant adviser or plan sponsor selects T. Rowe Price to provide one or more of the investment options in their plan that is a record kept on an external platform. We are the fifth largest DCIO provider in the U.S. \n About 1/4 of our DC assets are in our full-service record-keeping business, which we refer to as retirement plan services or RPS. Plan sponsors hire us to provide record-keeping services as well as key investment options for their plan lineup. As of the end of 2023, we provided these services for over 8,100 retirement plans. \n About 60% of all of our RPS assets under administration are invested in T. Rowe Price products, which has been consistent over the past several years and is a significantly higher portion of proprietary assets than the industry average of 27%. \n We provide solutions for a wide variety of clients, including our broad array of equity and fixed income strategies and our market-leading Target Date franchise. These are offered through a range of funds, common trust and custom solutions. \n Within our Target Date franchise, we offer higher and lower equity glide path and approaches that include both active and passive building blocks. And our solutions extend to not only investment products, but also to tools and services to help clients, plan sponsors and participants manage their retirement accounts, track progress along their retirement journey and help improve their overall financial wellness. \n Through our record-keeping business as well as our individual investors channel, we have direct retirement account relationships with over 3.2 million end investors. The insights we derive from these relationships, coupled with the emerging trends we identify from our work with plan sponsors and intermediaries, enhance our ability to design innovative solutions and research to pursue better retirement outcomes. \n As a generation of retirement savers have aged and shifted from the accumulation phase to the decumulation phase, developing solutions to help people convert their retirement assets into income has become increasingly important. \n Our proprietary research suggests that participants will need a variety of retirement income products and services to meet their individual needs in the decumulation phase. So we take a broad approach to retirement income. That means stand-alone retirement income products such as our managed payout products, single strategy investment products such as fixed income funds, along with the various services we offer, including guidance, retirement thought leadership and calculators are all included within our definition of retirement income. \n Our broad distribution organization allows us to access all retirement client segments, whether direct to the consumer or through intermediaries, institutions, consultants or advisers. \n We also have been adapting the expertise we have honed in the U.S. retirement market to pursue opportunities in the large retirement savings market in other countries. This access, along with directly managing end investor relationships, uniquely positions us to anticipate and deliver what our clients need. And as a result, we are continuously innovating and adding new capability. \n A few examples include our managed payout products, an all-in-one solution for retirees, which offers the familiarity of our Target Date product, with the benefit of providing stable monthly income throughout retirement. We added a 2025 version of these funds in January. \n The recently launched social security optimizer tool, which is designed to help individual investors and participants maximize social security benefits, which are a critical part of the retirement income equation for many favors. This is an early example of the impact of last year's Retiree Inc. acquisition. \n And the retirement advisory service, which offers ongoing access to advisers and personalized financial planning. The financial plans include tax aware retirement income planning and actively managed portfolios led by the expertise of our multi-asset investment professionals. \n We are excited we will be launching our new personalized retirement manager in the third quarter. This is an evolution of our robust Target Date offerings, driven by a highly customized approach. We plan to deliver a dynamic personal glide path for each participant by using plan level data, additional factors provided by participants and analyzing their portfolio through a monthly multifactor assessment. \n And in the fourth quarter, we plan to launch a managed lifetime income solution that will allow participants to combine a managed payout strategy with a qualified longevity annuity contract or QLAC. The product is designed to enable a consistent income stream in retirement, while guaranteeing a minimal level of income for life after a defined age. \n It is also important to mention that the breadth of our retirement platform enables us to develop industry-leading thought leadership and research on key retirement topics. We leverage both to build client relationships, advance our position as a retirement leader and enable clients and participants to pursue better retirement outcomes. \n I will close by saying that the leadership team and our associates are deeply committed to helping our clients confidently prepare for, pay for and live in retirement. We are grateful for their trust in us, and we will continue to use our expertise to drive capabilities and solutions that meet their evolving needs. \n With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Given that Dee is joining us, I do have a retirement question for her. If alternative investments enter the retirement channel, is it more likely through single investment elections or inside of a Target Date fund? And given that T. Rowe's ownership now includes OHA, is there potential for alts inside of a T. Rowe Target Date fund anytime soon, because we understand price may be one headwind with DC plan sponsors. \nDorothy Sawyer: With regard to alternatives, this is an area we have been actively researching. Given preferences and regulatory guidance, there are some complexity around adding alternatives within a 401(k) plan such as the daily NAV. However, if we were to introduce alternatives for our Target Date strategy, we could act quickly with Target Date solutions, including T. Rowe price solutions or OHA solutions or others because we have a long list of partners that would be able to work with us in order to do that. \n In regards to the specifics, we would likely offer that in a custom solution with a plan sponsor, and we have the benefit to be able to work with many plan sponsors, who are asking us around how can we continue to advance solutions. \n Certainly, we could offer this also in a stand-alone parallel solution, and that would be another way that we could bring this to market when and if it makes sense. \nRobert Sharps: Yes, Craig, this is Rob. I'll just add a few things. One, it's a priority for us to continue to evolve and improve our Target Date offering. And this is an area that we've given a lot of thought to. \n My first observation is that we've seen very limited interest from plan sponsors in incorporating alternatives into defined contribution lineup, either as a stand-alone investment offering or as part of target date funds. And as Dee mentioned, there are some limitations around accommodation of the record-keeping system daily liquidity, daily pricing, those sorts of things. There's also a tremendous amount of fee sensitivity in the defined contribution marketplace and alternatives naturally have higher fees. \n Where we have seen interest and where we've engaged are primarily in custom target dates that are designed by corporate clients, usually where they have a defined benefit plan, and they have an investment staff and an existing roster of alternative investment managers. So it's something that we're paying a lot of attention to. We're engaging with our plan sponsor clients and listening to what they want. But so far, there's been really very little adoption or interest in alternatives in defined contribution. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Cyprys: Maybe just sticking with the retirement theme. I was hoping to double click on decumulation. Just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the opportunity set that you see for decumulation products. What product structures, in particular, do you think have the biggest opportunity as you look out over the next 10 years? \n And with the products you have so far, just curious what traction you're seeing and with the new managed lifetime income solution that you're slated to launch later this year, just curious what ultimately you think will be the most successful way to approach that from a distribution standpoint to win as you think about the channels and go-to-market strategy? \nDorothy Sawyer: Great. Thank you so much for the question. I'll start us off. So first, I think I would highlight the breadth of our retirement platform, which gives us access to plan sponsors, intermediaries and participants. And this is really important because it allows us to really understand what types of retirement income solutions are critical for the varying types of participant needs in the decumulation phase. \n What our research indicates is that these needs and preferences are diverse, and our perspective is that there will not be a one-size-fits-all solution for retirement income. \n As you noted, we currently offer managed payout solutions, and we do have nearly 60 retirement plans that are using those solutions, which represents approximately 20% of our AUA in terms of overall coverage. \n Our payout solutions, our retirement income 2020 solution has been launched 7 years ago, and then we extended that to offer it through our retirement plan services solution. \n As you noted, we are working on a retirement insured solution, which we're calling Managed Lifetime Income product. This will be a collective investment trust vehicle, and we're planning to launch that in the fourth quarter of this year. \n We also are planning to launch, as I mentioned earlier, personalized retirement manager, which is also a way to extend, as time goes by, into retirement income as well. This is a managed account program that we're excited about launching, and it will be introduced in the third quarter of this year. \n So long-winded way, perhaps of saying that we do believe that it's really important to offer a variety of types of solutions in order to meet the different types of needs, and that's what we found by working with participants, individual investors, plan sponsors as well as advisers. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. \nDaniel Fannon: Rob, I was hoping you could provide additional context around the trends you discussed of better gross sales as well as lower redemptions. It seems like April here is a bit more mixed. But can you talk to maybe the difference in the channels and/or geographies where you're seeing the biggest improvements versus what we saw last year? \nRobert Sharps: Yes. Dan, thanks for the question. At a high level, I would say that our outlook for flows for the year really hasn't changed from what we discussed in January on the fourth quarter call. Although I would say that we have higher conviction now that our outflows this year will be substantially lower than they were last year. \n As I've talked about in the past, I think investment performance is a good leading indicator and continue to be pleased with what we're seeing, particularly in U.S. equity. Performance in U.S. large cap growth is clearly having an impact. We've seen redemption rates there normalize. And we've begun to see the beginnings of a recovery in gross sales in that suite. \n Obviously, outflows in Q1 being half of last year's level is an encouraging data point. I'm encouraged that the retirement date fund flows remain strong, just shy of $7 billion in Q1. I'd say our ETF momentum, Dan, is building, it's small, but growing to a point where it is having an impact. \n And I would just say our pipeline is healthier in general. With improved performance, we have less AUM marked as at risk. We have more in the way of notified unfunded wins, fewer notified terminations, and there's just more activity around new opportunities. \n At OHA, I think the capital raising pipeline there is going well, and ultimately that will convert to growth in fee basis, AUM and flows. \n With regard to channels, we actually had modest positive inflows in 3 of our channels in Q1. And even in the areas where we remain with outflows, we did see less in redemptions and improving gross sales. \n Look, flows are extraordinarily hard to predict. As I noted in the prepared remarks, we did have some rebalancing impact in April that was very short notification and went against us. That easily could have gone the other way. I mean ultimately, there are instances where you have really compelling performance or you manage an asset class that has outsized performance, and the underlying clients need to target back -- or rebalance back to their target allocation. \n So those sorts of flows are part of the business. I think that is -- it makes me much less concerned than when we're losing mandates or being terminated. \n The last thing I would say with regard to flows is that the industry backdrop really seemed to be firming in the first part of the year really through Q1, and it has been softer in April from the high-frequency data that we get. So I think we'll just have to watch with regard to whether that's a blip or kind of whether it's the beginning of a period of softer underlying flows broadly. \n But ultimately, there are a lot of things that I see that are encouraging that will allow us to, as I said, kind of have substantially less in the way of outflows throughout the course of the year, even if it isn't linear improvement. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. \nPatrick Davitt: My question is on the expense guide. Are you factoring in the full 1Q AUM mark to that? Or did you discount it a bit given the Q-to-date beta quite negative? \nJen Dardis: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. We -- similar to last quarter, we used first quarter average as an estimate for our expense growth guide, and we try to give a range around reasonable assumptions for market movement from that average in our percentage guide. And as you noted, we've had some decrease in markets in the first start of the -- in the start of April in the quarter, but that puts us back around the place we started from an average perspective. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. \nBrian Bedell: Maybe just to go back to the retirement business. Can you talk a little bit about how you viewed the DCIO segment versus the full-service record-keeping segment in terms of economics to T. Rowe Price? I know full service is more costly, can be lower margin, but you, I think, have a better ability to capture IRA rollovers there. So if you can talk about that dynamic. \n And then as you evolve your solutions, do you have more flexibility to do that with the record-keeping plans, hence that makes that segment more attractive than DCIO from that standpoint? \nDorothy Sawyer: Sure. So thanks for the question. Let me offer a couple of points. So the first point that I would offer is when you look at our U.S. defined contribution assets under management, roughly 75% of those defined contribution assets are our DCIO channel. And so we feel really strongly about the fact that we continue to offer solutions across many different types of record-keepers and through many different types of accounts in that DCIO channel, and that's through hard work with partners on the intermediary side of our business. \n With specifically about our retirement services business, we feel really good about that business in the fact of 2 things. So number one, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, in the fact that 60% of that business overall is in proprietary products, and that's unique for T. Rowe Price. \n The second thing about that retirement business is we do also have an individual investor channel where a participant, if they should choose, can roll over. And we do see that, that is an advantage for us in terms of overall economics, but overall meeting participant needs where they are. So hopefully, that's helpful perspective. \nRobert Sharps: Yes. The one thing that I would add quickly is within our individual investor is one area that we've been investing in is our advisory capability, specifically around rollovers and retirement. \n So in addition to the Retiree acquisition last year, which is another tool to help optimize decumulation, we've been investing in retirement advisory services, and it's part of the individual investor business that's growing. \nJen Dardis: Maybe picking up on one more point that you mentioned, Brian, because we do have the recordkeeping business in-house, we are able to more quickly roll out solutions that we want to add on from a plan sponsor perspective. \n So all the services that Dee talked about earlier, because we have the interworkings of the planned record keeping, we're able to launch those more quickly than if we had to do that on another platform. But it does allow us to kind of test those and then roll them out more broadly as clients prefer. \nRobert Sharps: It also gives us some pretty meaningful perspective to engage with clients outside of the U.S. as defined contribution schemes evolved. So we have an existing opportunity in Asia. We're working on another one. And there are a handful of opportunities to partner with folks to leverage the expertise that we have as a retirement date fund provider. But also as a plan sponsor to kind of partner with people outside of the U.S. as they really develop their approach to defined contribution. \nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. \nAlexander Blostein: I was hoping we could dig into OHA a little more, just kind of thinking about the underlying growth drivers from here. The revenue base has been a little bit more range bound over the last couple of quarters, and it's nice to see you guys launch a nontraded BDC out, so that's up and running. \n But as you think forward, what do you see as kind of the key building blocks to accelerating revenue growth in this business? And are there any other known redemptions that you might call out kind of related similar to what you've seen regionally? \nRobert Sharps: Yes, Alex, thanks for the question. On the latter, I would say nothing that kind of would be material enough to call out in terms of known redemptions there. \n If you take a step back, I'd say there are many elements of the OHA deal that I'm very happy with. I think it's been an excellent cultural fit. They are very good investors. They have associates that are deeply committed to their clients. Their investment performance across their range of strategies from distressed to structure to multisector has been very strong. \n We have some emerging distribution synergy. You mentioned launching the BDC in the wealth channel, so that's the first of many potential opportunities there. And I'll spend a few seconds more specifically on that. But we've also seen multiple T. Rowe Price referrals from institutional relationships around the globe that are now translating into new business for OHA. \n But as you noted, the growth in fee-based AUM has been slower, particularly over the course of the last couple of quarters. There have been some redemptions primarily in their liquid book. There's been some challenges around deployment. Some of what they do in distressed is trigger based. And it -- I suppose it's a good thing that there hasn't been a lot of distressed or spreads haven't been wide enough to actually trigger calling and deploying some of that capital. \n There's been less new issuance in private credit in general, and OHA has been less active in some of the parts of the market that have grown most rapidly. So insurance or senior direct lending. \n That said, I think the direction of travel here is encouraging. I noted earlier, when I was talking about flows, that our capital raising pipeline is strengthening. I would expect call it, mid-teens growth in capital under management, and in particular, their dedicated senior private lending product is gathering a lot of momentum. \n I do think, ultimately, they'll have, call it, kind of mid -- high single-digit growth in fee-based AUM this year, and that will start to build momentum going forward. \n Specifically as it relates to OCREDIT, we had almost $1.4 billion in invested assets in OCREDIT at March 31. And I think we're doing all of the things we need to do to deliver a great experience for our wealth partners and their underlying clients. \n The most important order of business right now is scaling and successfully launching on multiple platforms. We had an important launch our first wire house earlier this month, and we've had several smaller launches and have several lined up for the May to July time frame, and are working on filling things in beyond that. And I would say I'm encouraged by those discussions and the visibility, with regard to how that will unfold over the course of the next year. \n We've had really good conversations with a range of clients from large broker-dealers and private banks to regional RIAs. We are investing in our sales capacity and field support, including education and additional alternative specialists. Again, this is the first of several offerings that we hope to bring to the wealth channel. \n I think what I found is that this is a long sales cycle. It's the first time we've done this. So it has taken longer than I would have anticipated or I think the OHA folks would have anticipated at the outset. But I still think that it's a very, very large opportunity and I'm really enthusiastic about kind of what it will bring in time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Worthington: Dee, a couple more questions for you, please. BlackRock announced its Paycheck product. Does the BlackRock announcement change the equation at all for de-accumulation or the competitive environment in retirement? \n Maybe second, do you feel that T. Rowe is ahead of peers in decumulation or retirement customization? And if so, are you ahead enough to win new business? Or is this more about keeping existing business? \nDorothy Sawyer: In terms of -- let me answer your second question first. I think we are in a really good position where we are with our overall approach to retirement income and how we are making sure that we are continuing to meet the evolving needs and addressing the complexity of decumulation. And so we certainly already have products in the marketplace. And then I mentioned a couple that are already in development that we're excited about launching later in the year. And so I would tell you, I feel really well -- really good about our position overall to be able to meet the needs of plan sponsors and end investors. \n I think it's also important to note that we do plan to continue to extend those relationships through our other channels, including our intermediary channel, making sure that we're partnering with advisers and their end clients. And so we feel good about our lineup that we have today as well as the lineup coming. So that would answer the first question -- or the second part of your question. \n Regarding the first part of your question, what I would tell you, though, is as we think about retirement income, it's just important to note that there is a fair number of solutions in the marketplace. And where I would say we are differentiated is in the fact of the breadth of our platform. \n If you think about the fact that T. Rowe Price is uniquely positioned in the fact that we work with plan sponsors. We work with end investors. We work with intermediary clients. We work with institutions. We work with clients across the globe. We are uniquely positioned to be able to support that all the way across. \n More specifically around retirement income, we also have solutions comparable to the solutions that you've mentioned. And so I do feel that we are well positioned, and there isn't anything that I would say is notable to say that we're behind to mention on this call. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. \nBrennan Hawken: I was curious about a couple of things on the expense front. You mentioned that there's a capitalization of labor in the U.K. So curious about what that impact was in the quarter and how you expect that would impact the expense growth going forward. You also referenced a change in practice around explicit payment for research. So curious about what sort of impact that has on 2024 growth in expenses? \nJen Dardis: I think for the first part of the question, just maybe to clarify, it wasn't about a capitalization of labor. This was related to our U.K. entity where we moved into a new building at the end of last year, and we had a nonrecurring benefit in the first quarter of this year related to that. It's not material in terms of operations and really wouldn't be expected going forward. We just called it out as a onetime benefit. \n With regard to research fees, yes, we did call that out as a benefit in 2024. I think what I would say is that we remain fully committed to external research and its value, but the mix of hard and soft dollar will flex over time as we work with different regulations and work with how our clients want to receive those. \nRobert Sharps: Yes, that mix is really driven by the regulatory environment and client preference. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Aidan Hall with KBW. \nAidan Hall: Just wondering if you could provide us with some color on the trajectory of fee rates by asset class, just given some of the mix shift that's taking place in the asset base. And then it was nice to see the contribution of performance fees this quarter. I know it's tough to predict, but should we be thinking about that as a more normal contributor on a go-forward basis? Have you seen some stronger performance from your products? \nJen Dardis: Sure. So I mean, we've spoken in the past, on average, if we take a step back, I mean, a number of our products, whether it's by different vehicles or by larger institutional clients, we tend to see about 1% to 1.5% fee compression annually. Again, that can be higher or lower depending on specific choices we make about fees. \n But certainly, the direction of travel has been that when clients can take advantage of scale, they will get discounts for the pricing and when they come in and we have a number of large relationships that we manage as part of our strategic relationships. \n With regard to performance fees, this was one-off. I mean, there are a handful of equity products that we have, not a significant number that have fee arrangements. Of course, within the OHA product range, there are more. This one in particular, this quarter related to a handful of equity products on the T. Rowe side. \nRobert Sharps: Yes. We use our scale to invest in our value proposition. And I would say that within asset classes, the trend of fee compression has -- is something that we've navigated for a very long time and is comparatively stable right now. \n A few years ago, we made a substantial investment in fee competitiveness of the target date funds and called that out specifically at the time. But I would say, overall, I feel very good about our value proposition and our fee competitiveness right now. So where you see fee compression, I think it would be natural where you have a migration from funds to trust where you have more rapid growth in some lower fee vehicles or kind of ultimately, there are puts and takes. \n I'd say market movement also drives a fair bit of this from quarter-to-quarter. But I don't think that there's anything unusual or that I would call out with regard to the fee environment right now. \nEric Veiel: Yes, this is Eric. The one other thing I would add to that is that even within asset class, again, client preference is an important part of that. And when you have really strong performance in something like structured research in the U.S. equity business, which competes directly with passive but at a better fee versus passive, but lower than our overall average fee, you'll see some mix within asset class, but that's really a good business for us and is a really strong endorsement of our underlying research capabilities. \nOperator: And this completes our Q&A portion. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Rob Sharps for closing remarks. \nRobert Sharps: All right. Great. Well, we appreciate your questions and your interest in T. Rowe Price. Thank you for joining us this morning. Hopefully, you found Dee's retirement update informative. We will continue to evaluate special topics to integrate into future calls, so we can give you a deeper understanding of our business. \n So again, thanks for joining us, and have a good day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Sharps",
            "content": "Linsley, thank you. And thank you all for joining us this morning for our first quarter update. Before I get started, I'm pleased to say that Dee Sawyer, our Head of Global Distribution and a member of our firm's Management Committee, will be joining us today. Dee will provide an overview of our Retirement business, which is critical to our clients and integral to our firm's long-term success. We'll hear from Dee after Jen's update on our financial results. \n With that, I'll turn to first quarter performance. Tailwinds from stronger-than-anticipated markets drove assets under management up in the first quarter, bringing our total assets under management to $1.54 trillion as of March 31, a 15% increase over the first quarter of 2023. \n Our first quarter net outflows of $8 billion were about half the level we had in the first quarter of last year. This improvement came from increased client demand driving higher sales and stronger investment performance reducing redemptions, particularly in U.S. equity. \n As I said on last quarter's call, we expect to see net outflows in 2024, but anticipate substantial improvement compared to last year. However, this improvement will not be linear. It's important to understand that monthly flows can be heavily impacted by client activity, including rebalancing, new mandates and terminations. \n So far in the second quarter, net flows are shaping up to be weaker in April, in part due to rebalancing in a handful of large clients. However, at this point, our pipeline suggests the balance of the quarter will be stronger. \n Investment performance was solid in the first quarter, with 65% of our funds beating their peer group 1-year medians. \n I'd like to mention a few other performance highlights. Our capital appreciation, U.S. equity research, mid-cap value and financial services funds all had top quartile performance versus peers for the 1-, 3- and 5-year time periods. Our integrated U.S. Small Cap Core and integrated global equity funds, which combine our fundamental and systematic processes were also top quartile performers for these time periods. \n And in our multi-asset range, our nearer dated retirement funds, the 2005 to 2035 vintages as well as our managed payout fund, retirement income 2020 are all top quartile performers for the 1-, 3- and 5-year periods. All vintages of our more recently launched retirement blend funds are top quartile performers for the 1-year period. \n Over 50% of our fixed income funds beat their peer group medians for the 1-, 3- and 5-year time periods, and several of our fixed income Muni Funds as well as our global multi-sector bond, credit opportunities and U.S. dollar-hedged international bond funds are in the top third of their peer groups for these same periods. \n Investment performance across the alternatives platform in the first quarter was generally strong. Private credit, Structured products and liquid portfolios generated attractive returns driven by strong credit selection and favorable market dynamics. \n Before I turn it over to Jen, I want to acknowledge our associates. We reached important milestones in the first quarter, thanks to their hard work and commitment to our clients, including our capital appreciation equity ETF surpassed $1 billion in assets under management, less than a year after its launch last June. \n Across a number of channels, we are seeing sales momentum with significant year-over-year gross sales improvement with our wealth and individual investor clients. \n Earlier this month, OCREDIT launched on its first major wire house, demonstrating the close partnership of T. Rowe Price and OHA in successfully launching our first BDC with a key strategic partner in the wealth management channel. \n We retained our #2 position among the over 330 asset managers nominated in Institutional Investors 2024 ranking of America's top asset management firms. This distinction reflects the value of our corporate access model and the importance of our differentiated research capabilities. \n And for the 14th consecutive year, the firm was named one of Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. I'm proud of these accomplishments, and I'm grateful to our associates around the globe, who continue to put our clients first in everything they do. \n With that, Jen will now provide an overview of our first quarter results. Yes, Craig, this is Rob. I'll just add a few things. One, it's a priority for us to continue to evolve and improve our Target Date offering. And this is an area that we've given a lot of thought to. \n My first observation is that we've seen very limited interest from plan sponsors in incorporating alternatives into defined contribution lineup, either as a stand-alone investment offering or as part of target date funds. And as Dee mentioned, there are some limitations around accommodation of the record-keeping system daily liquidity, daily pricing, those sorts of things. There's also a tremendous amount of fee sensitivity in the defined contribution marketplace and alternatives naturally have higher fees. \n Where we have seen interest and where we've engaged are primarily in custom target dates that are designed by corporate clients, usually where they have a defined benefit plan, and they have an investment staff and an existing roster of alternative investment managers. So it's something that we're paying a lot of attention to. We're engaging with our plan sponsor clients and listening to what they want. But so far, there's been really very little adoption or interest in alternatives in defined contribution. Yes. Dan, thanks for the question. At a high level, I would say that our outlook for flows for the year really hasn't changed from what we discussed in January on the fourth quarter call. Although I would say that we have higher conviction now that our outflows this year will be substantially lower than they were last year. \n As I've talked about in the past, I think investment performance is a good leading indicator and continue to be pleased with what we're seeing, particularly in U.S. equity. Performance in U.S. large cap growth is clearly having an impact. We've seen redemption rates there normalize. And we've begun to see the beginnings of a recovery in gross sales in that suite. \n Obviously, outflows in Q1 being half of last year's level is an encouraging data point. I'm encouraged that the retirement date fund flows remain strong, just shy of $7 billion in Q1. I'd say our ETF momentum, Dan, is building, it's small, but growing to a point where it is having an impact. \n And I would just say our pipeline is healthier in general. With improved performance, we have less AUM marked as at risk. We have more in the way of notified unfunded wins, fewer notified terminations, and there's just more activity around new opportunities. \n At OHA, I think the capital raising pipeline there is going well, and ultimately that will convert to growth in fee basis, AUM and flows. \n With regard to channels, we actually had modest positive inflows in 3 of our channels in Q1. And even in the areas where we remain with outflows, we did see less in redemptions and improving gross sales. \n Look, flows are extraordinarily hard to predict. As I noted in the prepared remarks, we did have some rebalancing impact in April that was very short notification and went against us. That easily could have gone the other way. I mean ultimately, there are instances where you have really compelling performance or you manage an asset class that has outsized performance, and the underlying clients need to target back -- or rebalance back to their target allocation. \n So those sorts of flows are part of the business. I think that is -- it makes me much less concerned than when we're losing mandates or being terminated. \n The last thing I would say with regard to flows is that the industry backdrop really seemed to be firming in the first part of the year really through Q1, and it has been softer in April from the high-frequency data that we get. So I think we'll just have to watch with regard to whether that's a blip or kind of whether it's the beginning of a period of softer underlying flows broadly. \n But ultimately, there are a lot of things that I see that are encouraging that will allow us to, as I said, kind of have substantially less in the way of outflows throughout the course of the year, even if it isn't linear improvement. Yes. The one thing that I would add quickly is within our individual investor is one area that we've been investing in is our advisory capability, specifically around rollovers and retirement. \n So in addition to the Retiree acquisition last year, which is another tool to help optimize decumulation, we've been investing in retirement advisory services, and it's part of the individual investor business that's growing. It also gives us some pretty meaningful perspective to engage with clients outside of the U.S. as defined contribution schemes evolved. So we have an existing opportunity in Asia. We're working on another one. And there are a handful of opportunities to partner with folks to leverage the expertise that we have as a retirement date fund provider. But also as a plan sponsor to kind of partner with people outside of the U.S. as they really develop their approach to defined contribution. Yes, Alex, thanks for the question. On the latter, I would say nothing that kind of would be material enough to call out in terms of known redemptions there. \n If you take a step back, I'd say there are many elements of the OHA deal that I'm very happy with. I think it's been an excellent cultural fit. They are very good investors. They have associates that are deeply committed to their clients. Their investment performance across their range of strategies from distressed to structure to multisector has been very strong. \n We have some emerging distribution synergy. You mentioned launching the BDC in the wealth channel, so that's the first of many potential opportunities there. And I'll spend a few seconds more specifically on that. But we've also seen multiple T. Rowe Price referrals from institutional relationships around the globe that are now translating into new business for OHA. \n But as you noted, the growth in fee-based AUM has been slower, particularly over the course of the last couple of quarters. There have been some redemptions primarily in their liquid book. There's been some challenges around deployment. Some of what they do in distressed is trigger based. And it -- I suppose it's a good thing that there hasn't been a lot of distressed or spreads haven't been wide enough to actually trigger calling and deploying some of that capital. \n There's been less new issuance in private credit in general, and OHA has been less active in some of the parts of the market that have grown most rapidly. So insurance or senior direct lending. \n That said, I think the direction of travel here is encouraging. I noted earlier, when I was talking about flows, that our capital raising pipeline is strengthening. I would expect call it, mid-teens growth in capital under management, and in particular, their dedicated senior private lending product is gathering a lot of momentum. \n I do think, ultimately, they'll have, call it, kind of mid -- high single-digit growth in fee-based AUM this year, and that will start to build momentum going forward. \n Specifically as it relates to OCREDIT, we had almost $1.4 billion in invested assets in OCREDIT at March 31. And I think we're doing all of the things we need to do to deliver a great experience for our wealth partners and their underlying clients. \n The most important order of business right now is scaling and successfully launching on multiple platforms. We had an important launch our first wire house earlier this month, and we've had several smaller launches and have several lined up for the May to July time frame, and are working on filling things in beyond that. And I would say I'm encouraged by those discussions and the visibility, with regard to how that will unfold over the course of the next year. \n We've had really good conversations with a range of clients from large broker-dealers and private banks to regional RIAs. We are investing in our sales capacity and field support, including education and additional alternative specialists. Again, this is the first of several offerings that we hope to bring to the wealth channel. \n I think what I found is that this is a long sales cycle. It's the first time we've done this. So it has taken longer than I would have anticipated or I think the OHA folks would have anticipated at the outset. But I still think that it's a very, very large opportunity and I'm really enthusiastic about kind of what it will bring in time. Yes, that mix is really driven by the regulatory environment and client preference. Yes. We use our scale to invest in our value proposition. And I would say that within asset classes, the trend of fee compression has -- is something that we've navigated for a very long time and is comparatively stable right now. \n A few years ago, we made a substantial investment in fee competitiveness of the target date funds and called that out specifically at the time. But I would say, overall, I feel very good about our value proposition and our fee competitiveness right now. So where you see fee compression, I think it would be natural where you have a migration from funds to trust where you have more rapid growth in some lower fee vehicles or kind of ultimately, there are puts and takes. \n I'd say market movement also drives a fair bit of this from quarter-to-quarter. But I don't think that there's anything unusual or that I would call out with regard to the fee environment right now. All right. Great. Well, we appreciate your questions and your interest in T. Rowe Price. Thank you for joining us this morning. Hopefully, you found Dee's retirement update informative. We will continue to evaluate special topics to integrate into future calls, so we can give you a deeper understanding of our business. \n So again, thanks for joining us, and have a good day."

            "content": "Yes, this is Eric. The one other thing I would add to that is that even within asset class, again, client preference is an important part of that. And when you have really strong performance in something like structured research in the U.S. equity business, which competes directly with passive but at a better fee versus passive, but lower than our overall average fee, you'll see some mix within asset class, but that's really a good business for us and is a really strong endorsement of our underlying research capabilities."

            "name": "Jen Dardis",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. I'll review our first quarter results before turning to Dee for a look at our Retirement business. \n Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.38 for Q1 2024 was up 40% from Q1 2023, driven by higher average AUM and investment advisory revenue and offset marginally by higher expenses. \n As Rob mentioned, we had $8 billion in net outflows for the quarter. Across asset classes, outflows were concentrated in U.S. equity, particularly large and mid-cap growth strategies. However, it's important to note that this quarter's U.S. equity outflows were less than half the level in the first quarter of last year, a meaningful improvement driven by higher sales and lower redemption rates, and consistent with improved investment performance. \n There were a few notable areas of strength within the equity franchise, including U.S. structured research and U.S. smaller companies, both of which had strong flows to the CCAP product from EMEA-based clients. \n In fixed income, strong investment-grade flows in the institutional channel were offset by continued outflows from stable value in the DC channel. \n Our target date franchise was positive for the quarter, with inflows of $6.8 billion, offset in part by outflows from other multi-asset products. And finally, we had just under $1 billion of outflows in alternatives from manager-driven distribution. However, we are encouraged by recent trends in fundraising and expect capital raising to increase through the year. \n Turning to our income statement. Q1 adjusted net revenues were $1.8 billion, a nearly 14% increase from Q1 of last year, driven by higher average AUM. Our investment advisory revenue of $1.6 billion included $17.6 million in performance-based fees, predominantly from 2 of our U.S. equity strategies. These performance-based fees had a 0.5 basis point impact on our effective fee rate of 42.1 basis points. \n Our Q1 adjusted operating expenses were $1.1 billion, which is up almost 5% over last year from market-driven expenses, including the interim bonus accrual and distribution and servicing costs. Expense growth was tempered by the cost savings efforts we announced last summer. Our adjusted operating expenses were down nearly 7% from Q4 2023, due to the Q4 seasonality in stock-based compensation, professional fees and advertising and promotion expenses. \n Adjusted operating income increased 31% from Q1 2023 to $692 million. This brings our rolling 12-month adjusted operating margin to 36%, up from 35% a year ago. \n Given the rise in equity markets over the last few months and related impact on our market-driven expenses, which, as a reminder, is about 1/3 of our expense base, we now expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses, excluding carried interest expense, to be up 5% to 7% over 2023's $4.19 billion. \n Maintaining a strong cash position and distributing capital back to our stockholders remains a priority. We bought back $80 million worth of shares during the first quarter, reducing the shares outstanding to 223.5 million as of March 31, and have continued to buy back in April. Combined with our quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share, we returned $365 million in the first quarter. \n With $2.9 billion of cash and discretionary investments on our balance sheet, we have ample liquidity to support the recurring dividend, continue opportunistic buybacks and if they were to arise, to pursue select M&A opportunities to add capabilities to our business. \n We continue to manage the business with a long-term lens, balancing the investment in our strategic initiatives to drive growth over time with the need for ongoing expense discipline. From this position, we can continue delivering exceptional value for our clients by decking resources against new opportunities and added capabilities, while also identifying process improvements and driving efficiency. \n And now I'll turn it over to Dee. Yes. Thanks, Patrick. We -- similar to last quarter, we used first quarter average as an estimate for our expense growth guide, and we try to give a range around reasonable assumptions for market movement from that average in our percentage guide. And as you noted, we've had some decrease in markets in the first start of the -- in the start of April in the quarter, but that puts us back around the place we started from an average perspective. Maybe picking up on one more point that you mentioned, Brian, because we do have the recordkeeping business in-house, we are able to more quickly roll out solutions that we want to add on from a plan sponsor perspective. \n So all the services that Dee talked about earlier, because we have the interworkings of the planned record keeping, we're able to launch those more quickly than if we had to do that on another platform. But it does allow us to kind of test those and then roll them out more broadly as clients prefer. I think for the first part of the question, just maybe to clarify, it wasn't about a capitalization of labor. This was related to our U.K. entity where we moved into a new building at the end of last year, and we had a nonrecurring benefit in the first quarter of this year related to that. It's not material in terms of operations and really wouldn't be expected going forward. We just called it out as a onetime benefit. \n With regard to research fees, yes, we did call that out as a benefit in 2024. I think what I would say is that we remain fully committed to external research and its value, but the mix of hard and soft dollar will flex over time as we work with different regulations and work with how our clients want to receive those. Sure. So I mean, we've spoken in the past, on average, if we take a step back, I mean, a number of our products, whether it's by different vehicles or by larger institutional clients, we tend to see about 1% to 1.5% fee compression annually. Again, that can be higher or lower depending on specific choices we make about fees. \n But certainly, the direction of travel has been that when clients can take advantage of scale, they will get discounts for the pricing and when they come in and we have a number of large relationships that we manage as part of our strategic relationships. \n With regard to performance fees, this was one-off. I mean, there are a handful of equity products that we have, not a significant number that have fee arrangements. Of course, within the OHA product range, there are more. This one in particular, this quarter related to a handful of equity products on the T. Rowe side."

            "name": "Dorothy Sawyer",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen. I am pleased to join today's call to talk about our Retirement business. As Rob noted, our clients have entrusted us with $1.54 trillion in assets. Of that, over $1 trillion, more than 2/3, are identifiable as retirement assets, demonstrating that retirement is a critical component of our business. Slides 15 and 16 in the supplemental deck provide a detailed view of our retirement assets. \n I want to take a moment to share a few highlights. First, the majority of our retirement assets, $676 billion or 65% are in U.S. defined contribution plans, with the balance in defined benefit and individual IRA accounts. \n Taking a closer look at our U.S. defined contribution assets, 395 billion or almost 60% are in our Target Date franchise. In fact, we are the top manager of active Target Date assets, a position we have held for 7 years, and we have the third largest market share overall. \n But our DC business is more than Target Date. Plan sponsors select T. Rowe Price for equity and fixed income investment options as well, with U.S. large cap growth equity and stable value being the largest proportion of the balance of our DC business. \n We serve the DC channel in 2 ways. The majority of our DC assets are DC investment-only or DCIO, where the consultant adviser or plan sponsor selects T. Rowe Price to provide one or more of the investment options in their plan that is a record kept on an external platform. We are the fifth largest DCIO provider in the U.S. \n About 1/4 of our DC assets are in our full-service record-keeping business, which we refer to as retirement plan services or RPS. Plan sponsors hire us to provide record-keeping services as well as key investment options for their plan lineup. As of the end of 2023, we provided these services for over 8,100 retirement plans. \n About 60% of all of our RPS assets under administration are invested in T. Rowe Price products, which has been consistent over the past several years and is a significantly higher portion of proprietary assets than the industry average of 27%. \n We provide solutions for a wide variety of clients, including our broad array of equity and fixed income strategies and our market-leading Target Date franchise. These are offered through a range of funds, common trust and custom solutions. \n Within our Target Date franchise, we offer higher and lower equity glide path and approaches that include both active and passive building blocks. And our solutions extend to not only investment products, but also to tools and services to help clients, plan sponsors and participants manage their retirement accounts, track progress along their retirement journey and help improve their overall financial wellness. \n Through our record-keeping business as well as our individual investors channel, we have direct retirement account relationships with over 3.2 million end investors. The insights we derive from these relationships, coupled with the emerging trends we identify from our work with plan sponsors and intermediaries, enhance our ability to design innovative solutions and research to pursue better retirement outcomes. \n As a generation of retirement savers have aged and shifted from the accumulation phase to the decumulation phase, developing solutions to help people convert their retirement assets into income has become increasingly important. \n Our proprietary research suggests that participants will need a variety of retirement income products and services to meet their individual needs in the decumulation phase. So we take a broad approach to retirement income. That means stand-alone retirement income products such as our managed payout products, single strategy investment products such as fixed income funds, along with the various services we offer, including guidance, retirement thought leadership and calculators are all included within our definition of retirement income. \n Our broad distribution organization allows us to access all retirement client segments, whether direct to the consumer or through intermediaries, institutions, consultants or advisers. \n We also have been adapting the expertise we have honed in the U.S. retirement market to pursue opportunities in the large retirement savings market in other countries. This access, along with directly managing end investor relationships, uniquely positions us to anticipate and deliver what our clients need. And as a result, we are continuously innovating and adding new capability. \n A few examples include our managed payout products, an all-in-one solution for retirees, which offers the familiarity of our Target Date product, with the benefit of providing stable monthly income throughout retirement. We added a 2025 version of these funds in January. \n The recently launched social security optimizer tool, which is designed to help individual investors and participants maximize social security benefits, which are a critical part of the retirement income equation for many favors. This is an early example of the impact of last year's Retiree Inc. acquisition. \n And the retirement advisory service, which offers ongoing access to advisers and personalized financial planning. The financial plans include tax aware retirement income planning and actively managed portfolios led by the expertise of our multi-asset investment professionals. \n We are excited we will be launching our new personalized retirement manager in the third quarter. This is an evolution of our robust Target Date offerings, driven by a highly customized approach. We plan to deliver a dynamic personal glide path for each participant by using plan level data, additional factors provided by participants and analyzing their portfolio through a monthly multifactor assessment. \n And in the fourth quarter, we plan to launch a managed lifetime income solution that will allow participants to combine a managed payout strategy with a qualified longevity annuity contract or QLAC. The product is designed to enable a consistent income stream in retirement, while guaranteeing a minimal level of income for life after a defined age. \n It is also important to mention that the breadth of our retirement platform enables us to develop industry-leading thought leadership and research on key retirement topics. We leverage both to build client relationships, advance our position as a retirement leader and enable clients and participants to pursue better retirement outcomes. \n I will close by saying that the leadership team and our associates are deeply committed to helping our clients confidently prepare for, pay for and live in retirement. We are grateful for their trust in us, and we will continue to use our expertise to drive capabilities and solutions that meet their evolving needs. \n With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. With regard to alternatives, this is an area we have been actively researching. Given preferences and regulatory guidance, there are some complexity around adding alternatives within a 401(k) plan such as the daily NAV. However, if we were to introduce alternatives for our Target Date strategy, we could act quickly with Target Date solutions, including T. Rowe price solutions or OHA solutions or others because we have a long list of partners that would be able to work with us in order to do that. \n In regards to the specifics, we would likely offer that in a custom solution with a plan sponsor, and we have the benefit to be able to work with many plan sponsors, who are asking us around how can we continue to advance solutions. \n Certainly, we could offer this also in a stand-alone parallel solution, and that would be another way that we could bring this to market when and if it makes sense. Great. Thank you so much for the question. I'll start us off. So first, I think I would highlight the breadth of our retirement platform, which gives us access to plan sponsors, intermediaries and participants. And this is really important because it allows us to really understand what types of retirement income solutions are critical for the varying types of participant needs in the decumulation phase. \n What our research indicates is that these needs and preferences are diverse, and our perspective is that there will not be a one-size-fits-all solution for retirement income. \n As you noted, we currently offer managed payout solutions, and we do have nearly 60 retirement plans that are using those solutions, which represents approximately 20% of our AUA in terms of overall coverage. \n Our payout solutions, our retirement income 2020 solution has been launched 7 years ago, and then we extended that to offer it through our retirement plan services solution. \n As you noted, we are working on a retirement insured solution, which we're calling Managed Lifetime Income product. This will be a collective investment trust vehicle, and we're planning to launch that in the fourth quarter of this year. \n We also are planning to launch, as I mentioned earlier, personalized retirement manager, which is also a way to extend, as time goes by, into retirement income as well. This is a managed account program that we're excited about launching, and it will be introduced in the third quarter of this year. \n So long-winded way, perhaps of saying that we do believe that it's really important to offer a variety of types of solutions in order to meet the different types of needs, and that's what we found by working with participants, individual investors, plan sponsors as well as advisers. Sure. So thanks for the question. Let me offer a couple of points. So the first point that I would offer is when you look at our U.S. defined contribution assets under management, roughly 75% of those defined contribution assets are our DCIO channel. And so we feel really strongly about the fact that we continue to offer solutions across many different types of record-keepers and through many different types of accounts in that DCIO channel, and that's through hard work with partners on the intermediary side of our business. \n With specifically about our retirement services business, we feel really good about that business in the fact of 2 things. So number one, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, in the fact that 60% of that business overall is in proprietary products, and that's unique for T. Rowe Price. \n The second thing about that retirement business is we do also have an individual investor channel where a participant, if they should choose, can roll over. And we do see that, that is an advantage for us in terms of overall economics, but overall meeting participant needs where they are. So hopefully, that's helpful perspective. In terms of -- let me answer your second question first. I think we are in a really good position where we are with our overall approach to retirement income and how we are making sure that we are continuing to meet the evolving needs and addressing the complexity of decumulation. And so we certainly already have products in the marketplace. And then I mentioned a couple that are already in development that we're excited about launching later in the year. And so I would tell you, I feel really well -- really good about our position overall to be able to meet the needs of plan sponsors and end investors. \n I think it's also important to note that we do plan to continue to extend those relationships through our other channels, including our intermediary channel, making sure that we're partnering with advisers and their end clients. And so we feel good about our lineup that we have today as well as the lineup coming. So that would answer the first question -- or the second part of your question. \n Regarding the first part of your question, what I would tell you, though, is as we think about retirement income, it's just important to note that there is a fair number of solutions in the marketplace. And where I would say we are differentiated is in the fact of the breadth of our platform. \n If you think about the fact that T. Rowe Price is uniquely positioned in the fact that we work with plan sponsors. We work with end investors. We work with intermediary clients. We work with institutions. We work with clients across the globe. We are uniquely positioned to be able to support that all the way across. \n More specifically around retirement income, we also have solutions comparable to the solutions that you've mentioned. And so I do feel that we are well positioned, and there isn't anything that I would say is notable to say that we're behind to mention on this call."
