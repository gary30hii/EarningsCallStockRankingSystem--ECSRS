My name is Cathy, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJill Greer: Thanks, Cathy. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us for our December quarter and full-year 2020 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our Interim Co-CFO, Gary Chase. Our entire leadership team is available for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, Glenn will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Gary will discuss cost liquidity in our balance sheet. We have extended our call today to 90 minutes total to make sure we have plenty of time for questions. For analysts, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst's Q&A, we will move to our media questions. After this, Ed will provide some closing remarks. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call to Ed.\nEd Bastian: So thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. This morning we reported pretax losses of $2.1 billion for the December quarter, and $9 billion for the full-year, capping the toughest year in Delta's history. We've been saying all along that this recovery wouldn't follow a straight line, with demand choppiness as COVID infections rose across the country, and government and public health officials issues travel advisories, our revenues, of $3.5 billion for the fourth quarter, was just 30% of last year's levels. And although we still have the tough winter ahead of us, we're encouraged by the progress that's been made on the vaccine front, and are confident that Delta is positioned to successfully lead our industry into recovery as the year unfolds. While 2020 was a challenging year, we delivered results for all of our stakeholders. For our employees, we prioritized protecting their health and safety, and preserving our culture. For example, throughout the past year we have offered and continue to offer an extensive employee testing program and paid protection programs for employees diagnosed, exposed, or at high risk of COVID-19. We have had remarkable volunteerism, up to 40,000 employees taking unpaid leaves throughout the summer to protect jobs and preserve cash. And in fact, we still have over 10,000 employees in the month of January out on unpaid leaves. And we have made it through this year without furloughing any employees. Our emphasis on taking care of our people is reflected in Delta's recognition this week by Glassdoor as one of the best places to work for the 5th year in a row, coming in seventh overall on a list of 100 large companies, the highest rank Delta has ever received, all in the face of a pandemic, really incredible work by our team. For our customers, we're keeping them at the center of our recovery. Our health and safety efforts on being the only major U.S. airline that continues to block middle seats, to partnering with leading names, like the Mayo Clinic, Emory Healthcare, Lysol, and Purell in developing the Delta care standard, to launching the industry's first COVID-tested transatlantic flights with no quarantine on arrival, are all targeted at restoring consumer confidence in travel, and reopening borders, which will be an important driver of revenue growth in the future. Our customers recognize the outstanding service our people provide with an all-time high December Net Promoter Score of 71, up 20 points year-over-year, and by Business Travel News naming Delta the top airline for corporate travelers for the 10th year in a row, and once again coming in first place on all 12 metrics that they measure in the survey. That customer preference and loyalty is what underlies our revenue premium, and has never been stronger. And finally, for our shareholders, we secured our liquidity position and rescaled our cost structure. We reduced liquidity risk by raising over $25 billion in capital since the pandemic began. With approximately $17 billion of liquidity our adjusted net debt however only increased $8 billion year-over-year and we don't expect that net debt will increase going forward. We've swiftly removed cost from the business with three consecutive quarters of operating expenses declining by nearly 50% or more, increasing the variable nature of our cost structure. In fact, in the December quarter, our all-in unit costs were down 4.5% year-over-year despite flown capacity being down 44%. That is a remarkable achievement, and credit to all Delta employees for making that happen. And by keeping our cost under control we've leveraged the modest increase in net sales to reduce our average daily cash burns $12 million a day for the December quarter, half of what it was in the September quarter, and a decrease of 90% since the early days of the pandemic in late March. Turning to 2021, we expect the March quarter to look similar to the December quarter, with March quarter revenues at 35% to 40% of March quarter 2019 levels, and our cash burn for the quarter holding at $10 million to $15 million per day. We expect that will be followed by an inflection point this spring as vaccine distribution continues, travel restrictions start to ease, and consumer confidence begins to grow, hopefully resulting in cash burn reaching breakeven or better by the second quarter. And as the year progresses, we expect demand will start to accelerate as vaccinations become more widespread and the virus is in a contained state, and customers gain greater confidence to make future travel commitments. This should enable a sustained recovery to begin in the second-half of 2021, with a return to profitability this summer. So, as we work through this environment, we're focused on five things. First, as always, we're committed to keeping our culture intact and our employees engaged. The Delta people are our most strategic asset. We have done a tremendous job this year, and together we'll lead our airline through the recovery. Second, we'll continue to prioritize the customer with a focus on health and safety, and the maintenance of the industry's strongest network, thereby increasing loyalty and preference for our brand. Customers have shown they are willing to pay more for the quality of our network, product, and our service. The gains we have achieved in customer satisfaction position us well to drive sustainable revenue growth in the future. Third, we'll maintain our focus on innovation, which will enable our employees improve the customer experience and drive efficiency through the business. And innovative thinking will power our ability to tackle big challenges in front of us, like our goal of achieving carbon neutrality in the next decade. Fourth, we'll drive a competitive cost structure. Given the changes we've made over the last year, our goal is to sustain our non-fuel unit cost at or below 2019 levels by the December quarter of this year, on roughly 75% of 2019 capacity levels, displaying continued agility in managing our cost. And finally, we are committed to debt reduction and creating long-term shareholder value, including continuing to protect our owners so that they can participate in future upside without dilution, because for investors while the near-term demand path is murky, industry fundamentals remain intact. Following almost a year of subdued travel customers are beginning to exhibit behavior that is indicative of pent up demand. Shopping visits across Delta's digital channels are significantly outpacing the passenger volumes we're carrying. In our most recent corporate survey, 40% of respondents expect full recovery by 2022. Our partners at American Express are also seeing encouraging signs, whether it's cardholders holding on to their points in anticipation of redeeming them for air travel, for a recent survey that suggested approximately 70% of respondents expect to take a trip in 2021 after not traveling in 2020. Although it will take time, customers want to travel again when they feel it's safe. They feel they've had a year of their life taken from them, and they're starting to get ready to reclaim. Until then, we're fortunate to have the support of the U.S. government which recognizes the importance of the airline industry, and we thank Congress and the administration for passing the COVID relief bill last month. As a result of that bill, we anticipate receiving approximately $3 billion in addition -- in additional payroll support funds, largely on terms similar to the initial CARES Act program. These funds have been critical in saving thousands of industry jobs during an unprecedented level of demand decline, and it's why the U.S. airline industry is in the best position to recover from the pandemic over any other international market. So, while 2020 was a difficult year and challenges will continue in 2021, I'm encouraged by some of the data that we're seeing, and I'm proud of the foundation that we built at Delta. This company is well positioned to emerge in a stronger competitive position from this crisis, and we'll continue to lead our industry in the years ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Glen.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thanks, Ed, and good morning everyone. As Ed mentioned, we started the December quarter seeing encouraging demand trends, but with rising COVID cases and travel advisory we began to see some weakness around Thanksgiving and into December. Despite that softness, the peak periods continue to outperform non-peak periods, and we've seen sequential improvement in total revenues, which recovered from being down 80% in the September to down 70% in the December quarter on salable capacity that was down 62%. On January 3, we had a $15 million ticket revenue day, and carried more than 250,000 customers. Both of these were the highest since the onset of the pandemic. And despite having meaningfully less inventory per sale giving our middle seat block, we outperformed on passenger revenue generation in the first nine months of the year. This is a testament to customers' willingness to pay a premium for the Delta difference. Leisure markets and sun destinations are the best performers in our network, with our approach of targeting salable capacity to match demand we are biasing restoring capacity to leisure markets. As result, roughly one-third of our domestic capacity is currently deployed into leisure destinations. Our coastal hubs, especially New York and Boston, are still some of the weakest areas in our network with demand in those hubs only 20 to 25% recovered. International demand remains weak and is limited to essential travel. That said, we continue to work towards opening additional COVID tested lanes of travel with no quarantine on arrival similar to our Atlanta and Rome -- Atlanta to Rome and Atlanta to Amsterdam flights. This will be important in restoring confidence in long haul international travel as vaccine rollouts continue. Our premium seat strategy is holding up well. Domestic premium revenues performed in line with main cabin in the quarter. A good outcome considering that we are continuing to operate in largely leisure driven environment with higher proportion of premium seats held back due to our middle seat blocks. As all of you are aware, corporate demand continues to be depressed and was only 10 to 15% restored for the quarter. Corporate revenue was about 3 points higher than the September quarter with small and medium accounts which make up half of our corporate revenue, recovering five points faster in large corporates. While the passenger revenue environment remains challenging, we are encouraged that efforts to diversify our revenue streams have paid off. Our American Empress remuneration in 2020 was nearly $3 billion, down only 30% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, American Express has shared its spending on our co-branded card portfolio has performed in line to slightly better in their overall card portfolio spend in 2020. In the December quarter, MRO revenue was down almost 30% relative to the same period last year while cargo revenue was up 10% on year-over-year basis. This marks the first quarter of cargo revenue growth since the December 2018 quarter. Our December quarter results reflect the challenges that the pandemic has brought not just to Delta but to the entire airline industry. I am incredibly grateful for the efforts of the entire Delta team in managing through the challenging year that we faced. Now that we think about 2021, we see three distinct phases to the year. And for each phase, we have levers to help us react to the emerging demand environment. In the first phase, we expect demand shopping as to continue. The booking curve to remain more compressed and results to be similar to December quarter. In response, we are focused on making sure that our sellable capacity largely aligns with the emerging demand environment. For example, our January and February domestic schedule seats will be down 3 to 6% versus the non-holiday period in November. That will result in our March quarter sellable capacity being approximately 55% lower relative to the same period in 2019 consistent with the expected 60 to 65% revenue decline. We will also continue to leverage our non-ticket revenue streams like cargo, royalty, and MRO that we believe should continue to outperform passenger revenues. In the second phase, vaccination distribution continues, travel restriction and advisory begin to ease, and customer confidence begins to grow. As that happens, we expect to see an extension of booking curve resulting in a cash-led recovery with revenue recovery to follow. We anticipate this will happen in the spring and will result in us achieving our cash burn breakeven targets. In response to the second phase, our middle seats will be a very powerful tool for us, one we can use to add capacity in a very cost-efficient way generating a meaningful margin tailwind. In the final phase, vaccinations become more widespread and offices begin to reopen. We expect that to occur in the second half of '21. And as a result -- and result in a sustained improvement in demand with progression in cash generation as the booking curve normalizes. With the recovery initially fueled by leisure demand, Delta's success will be driven by our superior connecting economics through our core hubs domestically and our partner hubs internationally. The 34 new aircraft deliveries this year will also leverage high gauge and more efficient aircraft that produce lower seat cost, more premium seats, and a better customer experience. This will allow us to capitalize on our brand affinity and upsell opportunities which are enabled by the elimination of change fees for U.S. customers and the redemption of e-credits. It will take longer for corporate demand to return, but we are encouraged by the results over a recent corporate survey. Our corporate accounts are telling us that they largely anticipate returning to their offices and travel in the June and September quarters. They are also telling us by the end of '21, half are expecting to return to 50%, to 100% of pre-COVID domestic travel, and up to 50% of pre-COVID international travel. To our corporate customers, our commitment to you remains unchanged. Delta is ready when you are. We will be ready to serve our corporate customers by leveraging the strongest domestic and international networks, rebuilding focus cities, and point-to-point flying based on customer needs and by capitalizing on our efforts to always put the customer experience at the center of what we do. We're optimistic for the future, having built the right foundation and focusing on what we can control. We are confident in our ability to successfully navigate the post-pandemic recovery. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Chase: Thanks, Glenn, and good morning everyone. Let me touch on the fourth quarter in 2020, and then I'll turn to the outlook for costs in the balance sheet as we head into '21. Our December quarter pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion is about $500 million better than the September quarter, given the revenue improvement Glen just discussed combined with strong cost discipline. We reduced costs by approximately 50% from 2019 levels for the third consecutive quarter. More importantly, our costs were up just 6% from the third quarter on 30% capacity growth. And three quarters of that increase came from higher fuel. Total unit cost including fuel was down 4.5%, compared to 2019 on 44% lower flow and capacity. Our average daily cash burn for the December quarter was $12 million, half of the third quarters 24. We closed the year with $16.7 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of $18.8 billion up about $8 billion versus year-end 2019. Now, as we look into the year ahead, improving demand fundamentals will underpin a transition of our financial focus from protecting our liquidity, to positioning the company for a return to profitability and free cash flow. I will explain our approach to costs on our balance sheet as we make this transition. Let's start with costs. We need to stay flexible and maintain our discipline in order to position the company for the return to profitability Ed mentioned, as we expect continued choppiness and demand in the early part of the year. We've already taken structural steps to resize our business. Our two largest cost drivers, fleet and headcount are both 15% to 20% smaller than they were in 2019. Headcount reductions were a difficult, but necessary decision. It was hard to see 18,000 talented and dedicated co-workers leave, but it's a testament to the Delta culture that these reductions were achieved entirely through voluntary means. We accelerated our fleet transformation by retiring aircraft with relatively short remaining lives and simplified our fleet by eliminating two entire families while increasing our gauge, on a run rate basis, these changes will derive more than $400 million in annualized cost benefits. As we add capacity in '21, we will drive higher utilization of our system and we have room to rebuild our network from current levels at low incremental costs, approximately 40% to 50% of our December quarter non-fuel CASM. Our goal is to produce and sustain non-fuel unit costs below 2019 levels by the fourth quarter that cost focus will be a key driver of profitability later in the year when demand returns. Looking to the March quarter, we're preparing for stronger demand by reactivating aircraft and restoring our people to full hours, driving about $200 million in additional costs versus the December quarter. Our March quarter total operating expense will be 35% to 40% lower than March quarter '19 with a total unit cost including fuel down 5% to 10% on approximately 35% lower flown capacity. Let's move now to capital, the balance sheet and liquidity. As we begin the year, conditions are similar to where we exited 2020; a modest uplift in net sales should offset the cost investments we're making in the quarter. And as a result, we expect average daily cash burn between $10 million and $15 million similar to the December quarter. With further improvements in net sales as customers gain confidence, we expect our cash burn cease this spring. With that goal in sight, we're turning our focus to how we will balance reinvesting in the business while reducing our debt levels. Given our expectations for cash flow in '21 and proceeds from the PSP extension, we expect our current adjusted net levels to be the high watermark for that important metric. For the full-year, we're expecting $2.5 billion in gross CapEx, significant reduction from the $4 billion to $5 billion that we were spending pre-COVID. We have $1.3 billion of aircraft purchase commitments for 34 new deliveries this year, which we have the option to fully finance, and about $1 billion in non aircraft CapEx. Including retirements, we expect our fleet count at the end of 2021 will be 15% smaller than at year-end '19, with total fleet declining from about 1,350 to about 1,130. An equal priority is to work on our balance sheet by reducing our liquidity and paying down debt. We have approximately $1.8 billion of debt maturities in '21, and $2.1 billion in '22. Our debt has an average interest rate of 4.6%, which will drive approximately $350 million in quarterly interest expense. However, we will begin reducing those expenses by paying down debt this year. We do not have mandatory pension contributions until 2025 under airline relief, but we expect to make at least $500 million in voluntary contributions this year. In terms of a quarter-end outlook, with about $3 billion in PSP support expected from the government the March quarter, we project ending the period with $18 billion to $19 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of approximately $18 billion. Let me close by saying this, the Delta difference has never been more important. And I'd like to thank the Delta team for delivering for each other and for our customers amid the industry's most challenging environment ever. Because of your dedication we will emerge from the crisis stronger and more resilient than ever. With that, turn the call back over the Jill to begin the Q&A.\nJill Greer: Thanks, Gary. Cathy, we're ready for questions from the analysts, if you could give the instructions on how to get in the queue.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning, everyone. I'm just kind of curious after the vaccine news that have you seen a change in booking behavior? And also, I know the testing requirement is probably positive longer-term for opening up international demand, but are you seeing travelers perhaps shifting to more domestic sun and sand destinations from international?\nEd Bastian: Savi, the vaccine deployment still is very early, and we haven't really seen much in the form of changed behaviors. And we hear a lot anecdotally, but it's also one of the weakest travel periods of the year in the current month that we're in. We've not seen the booking curve start to expand. We certainly hope to see that as we get through the quarter, and vaccines continue to become more prevalent.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. And I'd be curious just to follow-up on some of the kind of the changing dynamics here. I was wondering if you have any kind of preliminary thoughts on how maybe the American and JetBlue partnership might impact the northeast position.\nEd Bastian: We're not going to comment on our competitors or speculate. We -- you know us well. You know we love competition, and I think competition makes you better.\nSavi Syth: All right. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jamie Baker of JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. First question, for Glen, sort of a follow-up I suppose on Savi's question. In normal times what percentage of international revenue is made up of trips that last fewer than four or five days? I'm asking because I would think a trip of that duration would be particularly jeopardized by the need to land, and almost immediately take a COVID test so that you could come home?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I think that's dependent on how far customers are traveling. Generally, the longer they travel the longer the stay is. So, I think what we are seeing is a very good response from the closer in Caribbean and Mexico resorts, where hotels are now going to be offering that as part of the package. And so while there may be some choppiness, as there has been through this whole environment. As we start adopting those testing procedures we think in a pretty short order here that customers will adapt. And to the extent that travel does shift from short-haul international back to domestic, we'll be ready to move the airplanes back too.\nEd Bastian: And, Jamie, I'd like to add to Glen\u2019s comment. We're still working obviously with the CDC. We endorse and support the testing requirements they've put in place. But a new feature is the inclusion of rapid testing into the mix, so it doesn't necessarily mean it only has to be a PCR test. And with the growth of antigen testing, the quality of antigen testing that's out there and the supplies in place you literally could get some of these tests done within a 10-minute interval shortly before you return.\nJamie Baker: Excellent. Thank you for that, gentlemen. And a question for Gary, how are you thinking about the optimum level of liquidity to carry in the future, sort of a post-pandemic question. And if you haven't reached that conclusion yet is that because it's just not a priority right now or do you simply need to wait and see how the recovery plays out before reaching a decision?\nGary Chase: Jamie, I think what I would say is it's obviously less than today. We need some time. We have I think some work in front of us to think through where we ultimately want that to be. But I think the important point is we're getting started, and I think you see some of that. During the quarter, we prepaid our term loan that was -- matured in April, for about $3 billion. We mentioned during the script that we do plan to make a pension contribution which, as you know, we consider part of our financial obligation. So we are getting started. We don't have more specifics, but we are getting started. And we're very focused on that $350 million number that I described, and using the liquidity that we have, where it makes sense to drive that down.\nJamie Baker: And just a fine point on PSP, a simple yes or no question, have the terms been achieved, and if so are they the same as the first round? Thanks.\nPeter Carter: Yes, Jamie, it's Peter Carter. The terms are identical to the PSP 1.\nJamie Baker: Perfect.\nPeter Carter: We've already signed the agreements with the government.\nJamie Baker: Thank you, everybody. Take care.\nEd Bastian: Okay, thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Good morning. Ed, I thought a year ago we talked on this call about intentionally running lower load factors, and it's happening, but in a weird way. But you're getting paid for it, and your NPS scores are, as you mentioned, at an all-time high. So, unblocking middle seats is obviously a tactical choice, but even when you unblock them you don't have to sell them. So, I guess the question is, longer-term how are you thinking about running less full airplanes as an opportunity to differentiate yourself with that premium traveler?\nEd Bastian: Yes, Hunter, it is an interesting year, I'll say that. We've not made a decision beyond the end of March relative to our -- when to unblock the middle seats, but we have some time to continue to look at that. I think it's going to be very much driven by customer demand, customer input, the confidence customers have in their seats. But no question about it, we are generating a meaningful premium due to that decision.\nGlen Hauenstein: Hunter, if I could have just a quick follow-up on that, is there -- I guess there are two ways, as we discussed last year, to do that. One is by creating more premium seats, and the other is by running lower load factors. As we go through this fleet transition where premium seats as a percent of our total seats continue to rise, and I think that's our primary way to satisfy the demand for premium customers is to continue to provide them with a higher level of quality.\nHunter Keay: Got it. Yes, thank you, Glen. And then on the 18,000 early outs there or can you achieve 2019 capacity without backfilling any of those positions?\nEd Bastian: Could you speak louder, we missed your question -- the start of your question, Hunter? Or I did.\nHunter Keay: Sorry, about that, Ed. That's cool. The 18,000 early outs, that the question is like how much of -- can you achieve 2019 capacity levels without backfilling the majority or the entirety of those positions?\nEd Bastian: We can't achieve 2019 levels without [of course] [ph] 20% of our people, no question about it. But there is that we don't need to backfill it entirely either. So there's a middle ground there.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And then just one more quick one since we have 90 minutes, just -- it's a follow-up on Jamie's follow-up. Have you -- Peter, have you negotiated the new strike prices for the ones attached to PSP 2?\nPeter Carter: We have, and it's $39 and some change.\nHunter Keay: Thank you.\nOperator: And now we will go to Andrew Didora of Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. Glen, my first question is for you, kind of little tough to answer. But just curious about how you are thinking about the kind of the tradeoff between loads and load factor as you move through kind of the different phases of the recovery that you talk to, as I think as those travel restrictions ease, do you see -- can you stimulate more demand with price or do you think there is enough pent up demand in the network that now load factor [indiscernible] driver, just curious how you're thinking about that?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think we're taking a yield bias as we go into the peak summer, hoping that demand exceeds supply. And if that doesn't materialize we can make those adjustments later. But we have anticipated that there will be a nice recovery in demand as we get towards the summer, and we've taken a conservative approach. I hope that answers your question.\nAndrew Didora: And certainly helps a bit. And then, Ed, I know Gary gave some information about CapEx this year. But how are you thinking about that over the next few years, especially in light with your [indiscernible] to de-lever here. And what do you need to see in order to feel more comfortable in placing new aircraft orders? Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Well, Andrew, I think we're a little early yet in terms of thinking about the long-term CapEx fixture thinking that we move $5 billion of aircraft CapEx alone over there to Airbus out over the next several years. You know, to a degree to which we want to take positions and new positions coming up, we'll continue to evaluate that based on demand. But right now, I feel pretty comfortable with where we sit.\nAndrew Didora: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And now we'll go to Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Great. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the questions. Gary, can you talk about some of the structural things that you've taken out of the cost structure? Can you reach that CASM target by the end of the year? And I think you made a comment about incrementally like 40% to 50% of your fourth quarter CASM there'd be variable event, if I hear it right.\nGary Chase: Yes, Brandon, let me start with the first question, that the structural costs, the two biggest ones in our business are really headcount and fleet, as we mentioned. The fleet really determines an awful lot of the infrastructure that we need from a cost standpoint. We expect to get leverage out of all of our costs associated with assets, we look about a third of our cost structure on a monthly basis is fixed. So as we grow we'll obviously get leverage there. And we have pockets of opportunity in terms of better utilization of just the overall system. When I think about what we're doing here, and this gets to your second question, there are kind of two big things that I talk about or that we all talk about internally as we think about this effort that we're embarking on. The first is baseline aggressively, and it's -- really have a laser focus on what's in the cost structure now, and what makes sense. You see that in the 50% reductions that we've been posting now for several quarters. The second thing we say is leverage the build, and that's really where the incremental thought process comes. That's about being very thoughtful about better leveraging the system as we start to rebuild. Now I think in terms of your second question, incremental costs, it's pretty simple the way we're thinking about it. It's just change in cost divided by change in ASM. And we wanted to give some guidepost as to the leverage that we do expect going forward for the 40% to 50% of December capacity comes in. I'll just note, if you take a look at the second-half of 2020, it was quite a bit better than that. And that is why I emphasized that comment in the prepared remarks about how we scale the system, particularly in the fourth quarter.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Thank you. I think those were my few.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Morning, everyone. A couple of questions on business travel. You said that small and medium-sized corporates are coming back first. Are you surprised by that? And is that good news or bad news for, when the bigger guys come back when the world opens up again?\nEd Bastian: Robin, we're not surprised by that. These are small business owners who need to get out to their customers who have to work hard every single day to keep their sales and their business moving. And we do see a meaningful continued improvement in small business traffic, some that we can measure, others that we can't say, they're not under contracts with us, but we know that consuming important part of overall business travel. But I do want to talk about the overall corporate travel results. As you probably know, we extensively survey our corporate customers, our large corporate customers on a quarterly basis, in addition to just being with them on a weekly basis as to their thoughts on the return of travel. And the most recent survey that we conducted, which just ended a couple of weeks ago, indicated that 40% of our big corporate customers expect they will be fully back to 2019 levels by 2022. And another 11% said that they expect to be fully back by 2023. So that's little over 50% of the customers and these are the people everyone's speculating what's going to happen to business travel, these are the customers who make those decisions, 7% said we'll never be back to 2019 levels, only 7%. And 42% said they weren't sure needed more time to figure it out. So with all the dialog and speculation around the depth of business travel, just looking at that survey, it's very interesting. If you take the 51%, that said they'll be fully backed by '23, the majority of which is in '22. And then you consider the second quadrant of 50%, who said they'll never return or they're not sure of their return. And even if you assumed only 50% of their travel returns; that gets you 75% of the way back no later than '23, and I think that's a very pessimistic view on business travel. So what we've been talking about corporate travel, business travel returning, I felt optimistic when I saw those results, we know it's going to be different going forward. As I've said many times, it could be 10% to 20%, lower over a period as it's substituted and complemented, there'll be different types of travelers, different reasons for people traveling. But I think business travel has got a very, very strong opportunity return over the next two years, and we're going to be well positioned to carry.\nRavi Shanker: That is great color on the demand side of business travel. Thank you for that. If I can just follow-up with the question on the supply side, clearly you guys are leaders from a corporate travel standpoint, but we have seen some of your LCC competitors, start to maybe find make some inroads as that traffic comes back. So maybe can you give us more color on kind of how you maintain that leadership and how you see the competitive environment looking like for business travel, when that does come back?\nEd Bastian: I think that the Delta difference has never been more pronounced than it is right now. And if you look at our share of corporate travel that is traveling, we have experienced the highest levels in our history. So, demand for our products and services is incredibly high for people who want it. And I think that's where our challenge remains is to continue to provide industry leading products and services that our corporate travelers want and need. And that's been what we've been doing over the past several years. And what we'll continue to do as we get to the end of this pandemic, and I think that's going to be what differentiates us. And clearly, there's always people who would like to take that travel away from you, because it is some of the highest yielding travel in the system. But I think that's our goal. And our mission is to stay ahead of that and provide it to people who want to fly Delta. And as opposed to a push, which is, \"Hey, we can lower fares and triumphs, move to all the sides for the bottom of this.\"\nRavi Shanker: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: And now our next question will come from Catherine O'Brien, Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for the time. So my first question is actually about your products earlier about seeing a cash recovery before revenue recovery. And to try and square that with this 65% of your ATL is vouchers. As a really early perspective, bookings are coming until later in the year, are these majority new bookings or maybe there's a higher percentage of those vouchers that are corporate and you expect that early part of it probably be leisure, I would just want some color on that comment? Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Yes, Katie, some of that came through a little garbled, let me say this, I think the distinction is really about timing, in the Spring, what we expect and I mentioned it a few times, we think as confidence starts to build, what you'll see is that people will start booking for further out in the booking curve, and so we will have a build in our air traffic liability, that helps us cross cash breakeven, earlier in the Spring, P&L breakeven is something that will take a little bit more, that's when you know, our revenue is going to be covering our expenses. And that is something that we expect will lag a little bit behind the building bookings. And we'll be there by the summer, as we've mentioned.\nCatherine O'Brien: Maybe just a little bit on our redemptions for the E-credit suites, we're running in the low to mid teens right now in terms of total revenues, with the E-credits coming back, and we expect that to stay below 20 as we move through this next period here.\nEd Bastian: And that number has been pretty consistent throughout the entire year. So we have a pretty good sense of what that's going to look like.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, understood. And can you guys hear me a little bit better now?\nEd Bastian: Yes.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, great, understood. And I know you guys have one of the furthest out periods through which people are doing, so that that makes sense. Maybe one of the cost structure of course, the pandemic has created a lot of pain for the industry. But I don't want to glaze over that. But, outside of speeding up your fleet simplification, have you found other opportunities to make the operation more efficient, perhaps maybe speeding up some of your automation plans in the customer facing side, wanted to share about other opportunities maybe born out of crisis? Thank you very much.\nGary Chase: We have Katie, I'm not sure we're going to get into some of the specifics. I will say that the fleet simplification has been something actually, that we think is in our run rate. Today, you're seeing some of the benefit in the fourth quarter. But it is something that will have a much bigger impact as we move to rescale the network through '21. When I mentioned the concept of leveraging the build and maybe one of the reasons why I'm thinking through it, just as I'm thinking through it is there are a lot of things that we want to think about doing differently. One of the unique opportunities, we always want to make something good out of what has transpired. And it does give us an opportunity to start fresh. One of the reasons I think we're showing the kind of leverage as we rebuild is because we have a clean sheet of paper in some sense to start from.\nEd Bastian: I'd like to add to Gary's comments, I think it's remarkable, the work the team has done on the cost side to get out in the fourth quarter to the point where our all-in unit costs are 4.5% lower quarter-over-quarter despite having over 40% less capacity to work with. It speaks to the ingenuity of the team, rethinking as we speak, what not just the current environment, but the future environment is and these are not costs that we're deferring out into the future. We're making real changes, real time here. And it touches every part of our business. So it's been one of the, since the demand has been low, we've been all over costs the entire year, and the team has done really, really good, good working.\nCatherine O'Brien: Yes, definitely fantastic staff, they're able to tell it earlier. Well, thank you all for the time.\nEd Bastian: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. You covered this in pieces in a follow-up to a couple of other analysts. But one of the things that Delta has been talking about during this crisis was, which makes a lot of sense is, getting to 2019 CASM on a capacity footprint that's smaller. So I wonder if you'd kind of quantify, how much smaller a footprint can Delta still deliver 2019 CASM and is the thinking or the logic and the focus really more on CASM recovery and margin recovery before necessarily capacity recovery.\nEd Bastian: Why not? I'll take that. Listen, they're all interrelated. You need to put the revenue and the capacity out there and remind the demand of the CASM strategy, but they're certainly connected to the ability to drive costs down. But one of the things that we have been a leader for many, many years, really the last decade is on our up-gaging strategy, domestic particularly, and that will continue to be important as we move forward and while we talk about simple flying to fleet, we've taken some big steps in that direction. We're also going to be advancing the up-gaging of the domestic fleet at the same time. So that's a big contributor. We'll continue to be a contributor with both driving down costs as well as improving the customer experience in revenue including premium revenue opportunities. I said in my remarks that our goal is to get that 2019 unit cost by the end of this year on roughly 75% of 2019 capacity level. We're in this pretty good market. We hope our capacity level is higher. I'll be honest that the demand environment is driving, but that's going to be driven by demand, not by cost.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's very helpful. And then maybe just broad brushstroke, you gave us the 75% by year-end. Is that how we should be thinking about your view of exit rate, and how are you thinking again, it can change, but how are you thinking about the summer as a percent of 2019?\nEd Bastian: No, we're not using that as a guide for capacity levels. We're using that for our own internal calculus in terms of where we need to get our cost structure down. It won't be 75% and maybe higher, and may be lower. I don't know. There is a long way to go between here and there, and we'll keep you posted as we go.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then just last one, maybe a question from a different era, but could you walk us through the comps on revenue monthly, because it seems like your guidance foots well, January, February similar to kind of 4Q levels, but March, it seems like there is a wide range of outcomes on March and obviously the comps fall off materially middle of March. So I don't know if you have the data handy, but how much easier is March and April relative to kind of Jan fab?\nEd Bastian: Duane, we're not going back to get in monthly revenue guide, so I'm starting to have to pass.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Fair enough. The comps do get easier. Thanks for taking the questions.\nEd Bastian: Right, comps will give you -- it will be easier.\nOperator: And now we will go to you Joseph DeNardi of Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hi, thanks, good morning. Ed, you talked about the corporate travel environment in a scenario where corporate traffic is impaired 15% to 20%. What does that mean for your earnings power, and why shouldn't we be concerned that I guess that the fleet strategy is adding more premium seats into a declining premium market?\nEd Bastian: Joe, I wouldn't draw the conclusion that corporate travel is impaired at all. In fact, I've not said that, I think we may see lower corporate travel, but I also think it will be changed essentially a different mix. So I don't think we should be for either ringing alarm bells relative to the future of corporate travel. All indications is corporate travel is ready to start coming back and we'll come back pretty aggressively beginning the second half of this year. We are a smaller airline, was there 200 fewer planes today, we've already right-sized the business to be smaller, which will help protect the premium revenue sources and the margins of the business. And well, that's why we spent a lot of time on this call talking about our cost performance that's going to be the key to make sure that we protect the margins in an environment where corporate travel will be down for the foreseeable future. Maybe it's permanently down by a little bit of lower amount that I'm not ready to declare that call yet.\nGlen Hauenstein: Could I add something to that? I think when you think about our premium products and services, you also ought to think that these are not only filled by corporate travelers. So as a matter of fact only less than a third of the seats are actually filled by the corporate travelers, and two-thirds are filled by non-corporates, and I think it's our ability to provide the right products and services for the non-corporates as well with the right sell up opportunities, so that we can match their preferences to our products and services. And I think that's really been one of the great hallmarks of the transformation is to say this is really available to everybody at reasonable prices. And that's been one of our key successes I think.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. That makes sense. Ed, it's my understanding that the owners of your SkyMiles are getting access to quarterly updated financial disclosures for SkyMiles similar to those you provided when you marketed the transaction. It's my understanding that equity investors are not. So my question for you is how is that fair? How do you expect your equity investors to make a fully informed decision on your stuff if they're not being provided with updated disclosures for what you guys have proven is your most valuable asset? Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Joe, I'll let Gary take that because he was closer to the financial disclosure as well say. Well, the law department is a very important asset, our most important asset are people, Gary?\nGary Chase: Yes. Joe, we too, we are providing some disclosures to those debt holders as you described. I think we agree with some of the sentiments that you have expressed over time. We see the value there. I think Glen did a good job of articulating how well it is holding up. We've been on a path to provide more information there. I think you'll have to be a little forgiving. We've had a lot on our mind and I think you can expect us to continue down that path for the reason, for the very same reason that I think you'd been asking about it, uh, because we do see the value there.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: And now we will go to Greg Konrad of Jefferies.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning and thank you. Just to follow-up on some of the past questions. I mean, I guess in terms of the competitive environment, your yields have held up relatively well, only down 2% or 3% on a relatively short booking curve with reduced corporate travel. I mean, how do you think about that potential trajectory for yield as you -- the booking curve normalizes and some of the corporate travel returns? I mean, is there opportunity to kind of be above where you were in 2019?\nEd Bastian: Well, I think there is always opportunity to be above where we were in 2019. That's clearly our goal, if it could be your short-term goal would be better. I think it's more medium to a long-term goal, but I think we are going to come out with a higher preference than we've ever had and that higher preference it will drive a higher demand. So -- which should enable us to work on yields as we come out the back end of this, so I think it goes back to how did people react to the pandemic and how to Delta's brand come through to us, and I think from all the research we've done from all the data that we see that our brand has never been stronger and demand for our products and services has never been stronger on a relative basis. And we're planning on capitalizing on that on the back end of this.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up, just a cleanup question, I mean, how should we think about a refinery sales for the year or any change versus what you saw in Q4?\nEd Bastian: Are you referring to the third party sales is that what you are asking?\nGreg Konrad: Yes, sorry, third-party.\nEd Bastian: The phenomenon that you're seeing in the third party sales is anything we produce and do not exchange for jet fuel. We sell to third parties, obviously with our jet consumption being weighed down, we've had a lot more of those sales to third parties. So that is going to likely trend with how we rebuild our network and how much jet fuel were consuming. I do think it's important to point out that those sales have no margin. If you look in some of the reconciliations in the back of the release, you'll see that those are offset dollar for dollar rather on the cost side. So they're all wrapped into the economics of the refinery, but you should expect those to start trending down as our consumption picks back up and we're exchanging more for our own use.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you.\nOperator: And next we will go to Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Hi, good morning everyone. I would like to just go back on the mandatory COVID test for international arrivals. Are you aware of any potential carve-outs like for those 24-48 hour roundtrips? And if you would have a vaccine to be vaccinated, would you be precluded from having to provide that test on entry?\nEd Bastian: Hey, Mike. It's Ed. We are still working through the guidance from the CDC. While we have mentioned - I've personally have had a number of conversations with Dr. Wakefield around this. We've mentioned the need to consider some waivers in unusual circumstances where, for example, COVID testing resources are not available, or if they are some relatively short term as you mentioned air travel. So, we are working through the implementation details. I think it's absolutely right thing to do for the long term for our industry. But, it's going to create some short-term hiccups.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. And then, just a question to Glen and if possible, Peter Carter, I know that you had sort of deferred on check all American, what I am more interested is that it looks like as part of that transaction, it does look like that there's going to be a slot divestiture. And that would obviously be at airports that are near and dear to Delta. Are those slots that -- from what you know are those slots that only new entrants can bid on, or are those slots that all carriers can bid on? And if that's the case, is that something that would interest Delta? Thank you.\nPeter Carter: So, the DOT has not made it clear what the rules are with respect to those slots, and I think it's suffice to say that we are deserving a DTA without question because of our market position.\nMike Linenberg: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: And now, we will go to David Vernon of Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Hi, good morning. So, Ed or Gary, could you talk to how as we move through these actual savings, how and when discretionary cost may come back in the system? I am wondering if there is going to be a need to prime the pump a little bit on the cost side to prepare for what should be a pretty steep recovery as vaccination rollout.\nEd Bastian: Well, there will be some, David. We expect, for example, to have reactivation expenses around maintenance in aircraft through the remainder of the year. So, we expect that pace to continue. I am not sure I quite heard the non -- was it discretionary or non-discretionary expenses that you were asking?\nDavid Vernon: I imagine you guys have curtailed a lot of discretionary expense, so there is marketing, right, new development or systems work, or training programs what have you. I am just wondering if there is going to be need to step up that spend ahead of recovery here in the intervening months?\nEd Bastian: Well, I prefer to think of it not to pick it up before recovery. But, we will have a need to revisit some of the things that we've done. If you take a look, David, at what we are pointing to in terms of incremental cost as we leverage the network, it does look different than what we saw in the second half of 2020. And one of the reasons is we do expect to have pressure in pockets. We have to be very mindful and balanced on those needs virtual realities of the business because we are determined here to turn the profit equation around and to be printing these releases with black ink this year.\nGlen Hauenstein: Hey, David, this is Glen. Let me expand on that just a bit. We are -- leveraged maintenance expenses. We have got our staffing levels back to where we need to be starting the 1st of this year. We were still to pay in terms of some of the pay cuts -- the voluntary pay cuts that our employees took last year. So, there is a meaningful step up already in the numbers we gave you for the cash burn in the first quarter to get ready for the recovery. So, I am very comfortable with where we sit. In fact, if we wanted to continue to run the same cost structure and forego some of those expenses, you would see our cash burn coming down in a relatively meaningful level in the first quarter as well. But, we have maintained the same level of cash burn to get ready for the spring.\nDavid Vernon: That's helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up, you noted in the release the amount of CapEx that's come out of the budget over the next couple of years. I'm wondering if there's been a discussion at the board level about goal posts or guideposts for profitability before we kind of go back to renewing the fleet in earnest?\nEd Bastian: David, again, I think that question is a little premature. Yes, we talked about that topic of the board. We also haven't made any determinations quite yet. The goal we have at the board is very much what we said to you, is that we get to a goal is to get to a cash breakeven position for the second quarter and return to profitability starting in the third quarter. The pace of that recovery over the next couple of years, obviously, we still have some work to do there.\nDavid Vernon: Okay, thanks.\nJill Greer: Cathy, we're going to have time for one more question from the analysts, if you can see that.\nOperator: Certainly, and that question will come from Joe Caiado of Credit Suisse.\nJoe Caiado: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time, Ed, Glen just a quick clarification question regarding your annual corporate travel survey, 40% percent of respondents say fully recovered by 2022. Are they referring to their businesses being fully recovered by 2022, or their corporate travel budgets being fully recovered by then? Or do they see everyone in the same?\nEd Bastian: Yes, corporate travel being back.\nJoe Caiado: Got it, okay. Understood, it's helpful. And my second question, just it's clear that you're not seeing any elongation of the booking curve yet at this stage. But what about clicks or looks, stopping short of actual bookings? But is there any data like that, that you're tracking analytics on the Web site, something like that, that provide the basis for your recovery outlook on Q1 and sort of saying that you have a good shot of P&L break even in Q3? Or you just, hopeful that that's going to be the case? Are there any analytics that you can share with us, that maybe give you a better indication, thank you for the time.\nEd Bastian: Absolutely corporate, looks are actually doing quite well were 40% up quarter-over-quarter where we were last quarter in terms of looks, and look to book is very low. So people are looking, they're aspiring to travel. And they're just not ready to commit yet. And I think that's what really gives us that sense that there will be a time in which people feel comfortable again to travel. And that will turn into a click, turn into a booking. And so we're monitoring that very, very carefully. And we're looking forward to the opportunity to serve these customers as they come back.\nJoe Caiado: Thanks for that color.\nOperator: That's going to wrap-up the analyst's portion of the call. I will turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer.\nTim Mapes: Well, good morning, everybody. I want to thank all the members of the media who have gathered on the call today, your interest in Delta is not only appreciated, it's never been greater. And we're very pleased today to provide you with an expanded period of time to make sure that we address your questions. I'd also like to thank Ed and Glen and the members of the Delta Leadership Committee, all of whom are on this call for their involvement as we turn the Page on 2020 and optimistically look at 2021. So, Cathy, if you could please review the instructions and mention to everyone how they go about asking a question?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Alison Sider of the Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the operational issues we saw around the holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas. And what looking back and think were kind of the root causes of that. And, what if any changes you've made prevent the same sort of thing from happening again?\nEd Bastian: Sure, Ali, we certainly had a much better Christmas holiday than the Thanksgiving break. There were a number of factors going on in the staffing levels of the company with a lot of changes that we had implemented. And you couple that with COVID and some of the exposures into everyone seeing the No Fly capability to some of our staffing, which came in. We learned from that for Thanksgiving. We made some pretty aggressive changes in December in terms of getting the schedule fine tuned to anticipate that. And we were really, really good shape. And then we got hit with a massive storm in Minneapolis on the 23rd of December, which cost us probably a couple of 100 cancels, incremental cancels over that next couple of day timeframe which was concerning, but unavoidable unfortunately. The most important thing in all of that is one the Delta people. And I know there were some bloggers out there wondering whether the Delta pilots weren't doing everything, the Delta pilots were amazing through the full holiday periods and showing up and getting the flights going and giving up their holidays and their time away with the families to help the company out. So it had nothing to do with pilot staffing at all. The other thing was the number of customers who may have been canceled, while which is higher than we've been expecting, the vast majority of the people back to their destination, within hours of their looking to time. So, the teams did very, very good job and that issue was pretty much over by the 26, 27.\nGary Chase: And that really manifests itself in the record Net Promoter Score we had in the December time period. So as I mentioned, despite the fact that we had to cancel some flights, our average lateness was not very late versus the original itinerary. And our customers over the holiday period were quite satisfied posting record high Net Promoter scores.\nAlison Sider: And just a follow-up, is there anything you can share about what you're seeing in terms of crew member infections at this point, I know that the pilots have said they saw some big increases in COVID infections in a late fall, I'm just wondering if you're still seeing that or if that's sort of been brought under control?\nEd Bastian: Well, we're a microcosm of the country and as the pandemic has accelerated over the course of the last few months in order to accelerate across airline employees as well. But our team's doing real job, they're not seeing it spread within the company, when they're at work, it's in community is where people are getting sick. So I tell you, every work category of the company is experiencing an increase in exposures as we're all exceeding over the last couple of months.\nAlison Sider: Thank you.\nOperator: And now we will go to Tracy Rucinski of Reuters.\nTracy Rucinski: Hi, good morning. I'm wondering if you think we'll see COVID-19 testing and being required for domestic flights?\nEd Bastian: Tracy, I don't think so.\nTracy Rucinski: Okay. And just to follow-up with a separate question, should we expect to see a deal with Boeing this year for a 737 MAX order?\nGary Chase: We're not going to speculate on that.\nTracy Rucinski: Okay, thank you.\nGary Chase: Sorry.\nOperator: Now we'll go to Claire Bushey of Financial Times.\nClaire Bushey: Hi, I know Delta has been growing its own list of people who are not able to fly in the airline, but I was wondering if the company had any visibility into whether more names are being added to that Federal No Fly list, based on last week's Capitol attacks?\nGary Chase: Sorry, your last part was real garble. Your question, are we adding increased numbers to our No Fly lists based on Federal information?\nClaire Bushey: I was asking whether Delta knows if names are being added to the Federal No Fly list based on the Capitol attacks.\nGary Chase: We certainly know that the TSA is looking very carefully at those that were in the Capitol building the writers and we're working closely with them and I do anticipate if the TSA is able to identify individuals who have people added to the No Fly List, no question about it.\nClaire Bushey: Thank you.\nOperator: And next we have Leslie Josephs of CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, good morning, everybody. You mentioned that there was a lot of pent-up demand and also the hoarding of points from the Frequent Flyer Program. What happens if a lot of people try to redeem it once? Is that something that you're expecting based on Search data and other things? And then also you mentioned a recovery in the second half of the year, where are you seeing demand? Are those sorts of outdoor social distancing destinations showing more strength than another? But where's the demand coming from? Thanks.\nEd Bastian: Well, clearly leisure destinations are at the forefront of the recovery right now. And I think it doesn't matter whether or not it's a beach or a mountain view. That's where people are headed at this point in the recovery. And then your second question was about\u2026\nLeslie Josephs: So if you're reporting, what happens if everyone, I know you're foreseeing they will or trying to redeem?\nEd Bastian: We're happy and really have are indifferent whether or not people who are booking are using points or whether or not they're using actual dollars, or whether they're using the E-credits, what we're anticipating is that all of those will increase. And we have plenty of capacity to meet that demand as we head to the second half of '21. So we're hoping that all of the above happens.\nGary Chase: From talking to American Express, good partners there, it's clear that people place great value on their loyalty points with Delta and like to see the values grow over time. And so while they've been in the pandemic, we've seen redemptions down four points, because flying levels are down. But they haven't stopped spending on the card, our Co-brand card is as good if not better than almost any other product card, AmEx has. So it has great appeal. And we expect it's not going to be, not to be run on the bank type situation that you're referring to.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay, you could just adjust in words, the availability and things like that to write.\nGary Chase: Absolutely. We're looking forward to that day.\nLeslie Josephs: Thank you.\nOperator: And now we will go to David Koenig of The Associated Press. David?\nDavid Koenig: Hi, real quick question. Unless I missed it, I have not heard an update in a while and the number of people you have banned for not wearing face masks. Is there a current figure on that? And any changes in cabin policies?\nEd Bastian: I think that number is north of 800 at this point, David.\nDavid Koenig: Okay, very good. All right and then how many of those are since last week, you know?\nEd Bastian: That number is not a huge number but a number.\nOperator: And now our question will come from Kelly Yamanouchi of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\nKelly Yamanouchi: Hi there. I wanted to ask about profit sharing with no profit sharing next month from 2020 results. So I was wondering what impact you think that may have on employees and satisfaction? And also wondering if there's if you think there's a possibility of profit sharing a year from now?\nEd Bastian: Well, I think everyone is aware why there's not profit sharing in this year. And I can tell you employee satisfaction is at a very, very high level. I mentioned during this trip, Kelly that we just were awarded as the Seventh best employer by Glassdoor. Glassdoor is an entirely employee driven acknowledgement, the company hasn't had any, any input or any insight into that. It's purely by employees talking about their employers. So if that gives you a sense for the sentiment, the sentiment is very strong. The volunteerism with the 10s of 1000s of people that have taken unpaid leaves of absence over the year indicates that, we've been mindful of the fact that there won't be a profit sharing payout. And we're providing added services and assistance around financial health and financial well being and credit counseling and other services to employees that may need it. We're going to be ramping. We have been ramping it up and talking about it. We're going to continue to talk about it on an ongoing basis going forward. We have people providing that support. And relative to next year's profit sharing, I certainly hope we'll be paying it, it's hard to speculate it now, it's just only a couple weeks into the year. But I'm hopeful that we'll be paying it.\nKelly Yamanouchi: Great. I also heard mentioned during the call so far about the value of connecting economics, but also the importance of point to point in focus cities. I was wondering if you expect how you expect the Atlanta hubs role to be different going forward in terms of size or the role in your network.\nEd Bastian: Well, clearly the size of Atlanta is relative to the size of demand in the United States. As the World's largest hub, it is a microcosm of global airline demand. So we expect it to recover as the airline continues to recover, the two things that I would say is that we're going to continue to work on average gage, which I think is something that's really important and that will be bringing more details about bigger airplanes with better products and services. And so, I think you'll see the departures get back to 2019 levels at some point in the future. But before that, you'll probably see the employments start to rise dramatically and using really the gauge lever as much as the departure level. This is as you know, our most valuable asset here in Atlanta and we're very proud to be a part of the Atlanta community, and it has led us in the rebuild of our network so far.\nKelly Yamanouchi: Great, thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ted Reed with Forbes.\nTed Reed: Thank you for taking the questions. I have two questions for Glen. First one, Glen, when you said earlier, Delta is ready when you are talking about when you come back, where you talking about in terms of capacity or something else?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think that when customers are wanting to fly on Delta, we'll be ready for them. And I know you've heard a long time and I know you remember that slogan. So it's hearkening back to a little bit of history there with topic.\nTed Reed: So you're just saying, you'll be ready though. You'll have the capacity suited to what you anticipate customers will want?\nGlen Hauenstein: Correct.\nTed Reed: All right. Secondly, we've been talking a lot about the middle seats being empty and being up, you said a powerful tool. How are you measuring what the value, how can you tell that these are so valuable to your customers?\nGlen Hauenstein: Our revenue premiums have never been higher. And so customers are valuing the Delta difference. And I think that's how we're looking at that is when you look at our revenue production versus our competitive set despite having the least amount of syllable capacity, our revenues have kept pace. So I think we're seeing not only the highest share of corporate demand we've ever had, although albeit on depressed levels, but a real differentiator when customers are shopping for that apply jobs with some of our competitors.\nTed Reed: And you think that due to middle seats being emptied longer and others?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think it's an entire Delta difference. Clearly that's a piece of it. But whether or not it's the Delta care standard, whether or not it's the Delta people, which are really at the heart of that. But this is one component of ensuring that Delta is seen as a brand you want to associate with.\nTed Reed: All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: And now we'll go to Dawn Gilbertson, USA Today.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi, good morning. I also have questions on your middle seat policy, Ed and Glen I know you both said no decision has been made yet, but Glen, your comment about the second phase is the middle seats will be a very powerful tool. It sounds to me at least like you're certainly leaning towards unblocking them. A, is that a fair assumption. B, Can you talk to us about the timing of this decision when will you decide whether they are blocked beyond March 30th? Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Dawn, as you said, no, I would not say that's a fair assumption. What we said is that when the demand returns, which is that next inflection point that will inform our decisions around what to do with the middle seat. So we've not made any decisions to unblock them post-March 30.\nDawn Gilbertson: Can you give us a sense of when and when will you make that decision, because pretty still, I know the booking curve is still short, but you're kind of optimistic about summer. So will you make that decision in the next month, the next few weeks, a couple of months, can give us any sense of that please?\nEd Bastian: Well, we continue to monitor it on a regular basis. It's not imminent. We have to have some bit of time, but it's going to be informed by customer sentiment, demand, in addition to message, we have a lot of other seats still on our planes, and confidence in travel relative to COVID and vaccine deployment. So, yes, it's not a clear line, and there is hope that has to go into that. We know that it has been important not the only, but one of the important reasons why Delta has been able to continue to earn an even higher revenue premium during this past year than we historically had. And so we want to be very careful as to how we make that decision.\nDawn Gilbertson: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And now we will go to [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, yes. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the changes in the competitive environment, American JetBlue Alliance, the Northeast, and then how that -- how, I guess, you intend to respond to that?\nEd Bastian: No. I think we're very confident in our products and services, and we compete well against both those carriers individually. And I'm sure we'll compete very well against them together. So we have a lot of confidence in our products and services in the Northeast.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then there's also been some expansion of some of your focus cities, Raleigh-Durham, Austin. This helps the plan to return there and [compete] [Ph] there as well?\nEd Bastian: Focus cities will be an important part of our portfolio moving forward. And we'll continue to work on making sure that we have the great capacity in those cities as demand returns. And so we're looking forward to demand continuing to return in all of our focus cities.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: And now we will go to Robert Silk with Travel Weekly.\nRobert Silk: Well, thanks for taking my call. Simple question, do you see, has CDC given any indication? I know that A4A had called for -- wanted testing there on you all, wanted testing to be put in place, but in exchange a rollback of travel bans. Any indication if that could be -- coming?\nEd Bastian: Your question, I'm sorry, was a big garble. Could you repeat that? We're having a hard time with some of our communications this morning.\nRobert Silk: Can you hear me a little better now?\nEd Bastian: Yes.\nRobert Silk: Okay. So the question is if there's indication or sense from the federal government or CDC that with this blanket testing requirement that there could be a rollback of travel bans, which is something that the airlines has called for? And I'll also follow, another question is any sense that vaccines ultimately could be included in the mix, if you're vaccinated it relieves testing requirements, there could be an either/or?\nEd Bastian: We're still working with the CDC on the specific testing strategy and deployment. This is something that we -- Delta endorse. I know our industry similarly endorses. We would like to see the travel restrictions lifted once the testing protocols are in place, and that will be a decision by the new administration, is my understanding, when they take office. And -- but I think by having the testing protocols in place it then gives confidence to the regulatory authorities to start to lift the bans, which is why we endorse the testing strategy. Your question relative to vaccines, yes, obviously once vaccines are at scale we would hope that the vaccination evidence would supplant the need to show a test result. But of course, we're still working with the authorities on that.\nRobert Silk: Okay, thanks. [Technical difficulty]\u2026\nTim Mapes: Cathy, we have time for one final question for the group, please.\nOperator: Certainly. And that will come from David Slotnick of Business Insider.\nDavid Slotnick: Hey, everyone, how are you? Thanks for the question. I was just wondering what the phases, the three phases that Glen outlined earlier. With that timing in mind and with the response you have gotten from the corporate travelers, is Delta still expecting a recovery to 2019 revenue travel levels in line with the rest of the industry with the, I think it was 2023 or 2024 with the IATA, and if you're able, previously forecasting or has that moved up pretty well?\nEd Bastian: Again, I'm sorry; it's hard to hear the question. Let me take a shot at it. The information that we shared on the call about corporate travel is the sentiment we're getting from our own customers. As you are aware, we are the largest carrier of corporate travel amongst the U.S. carriers, so I think we have probably some of the best info, referred to IATA or any other group that, you know, I don't know how they determine what 2023 to 2024 looks like. I wouldn't take too much confidence in that. But what our corporate travel managers are telling us is that 50% expected to be fully back by 2023. The other 50% is largely uncertain, but we expect a meaningful amount of that travel to return as well.\nDavid Slotnick: Makes sense. So, does Delta have a forecast for when they'll return to 2019 travel levels?\nEd Bastian: The numbers we're comparing are 2019 volumes, yes.\nDavid Slotnick: Okay, thanks.\nTim Mapes: Thank you, David. With that we'll turn it over to Ed to make some final comments again. Thank you, everybody, for your time this morning.\nEd Bastian: So, thanks, Tim. Just in closing, I think you can all appreciate that 2020 was a difficult year, but we're on a recovery path. We see that the start of it beginning to crystallize here, particularly with the vaccine development, and as you've heard earlier, when Glen and Gary, I'm confident that we've got the foundation in place to return Delta to revenue growth, profitability, and free cash flow generation. We're committed to keeping our culture intact and our employees engaged. We'll continue to listen to our customers and put them first in order to further enhance their experience on Delta, increase their loyalty, and drive affinity towards our brand. We're very focused on the innovations, which is allowing us not only to enhance the customer experience and drive efficiency, but also to tackle the big challenges that still lie ahead for us. We'll remain very focused on cost performance. We've talked a lot about that during the call, to ensure that leisure-led demand environment that emerges, we'll be able to respond to it. And finally, we're committed to reducing debt, strengthening our balance sheet and creating long-term shareholder value, and allowing our owners to participate in future upside without dilution. And we have the very best employees in the industry, and we're ready to see this strategy through, which gives me optimism, confidence in our ability to thrive and emerge as the industry leader. So, thanks again for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you soon.\nOperator: And that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Glen Hauenstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning everyone. As Ed mentioned, we started the December quarter seeing encouraging demand trends, but with rising COVID cases and travel advisory we began to see some weakness around Thanksgiving and into December. Despite that softness, the peak periods continue to outperform non-peak periods, and we've seen sequential improvement in total revenues, which recovered from being down 80% in the September to down 70% in the December quarter on salable capacity that was down 62%. On January 3, we had a $15 million ticket revenue day, and carried more than 250,000 customers. Both of these were the highest since the onset of the pandemic. And despite having meaningfully less inventory per sale giving our middle seat block, we outperformed on passenger revenue generation in the first nine months of the year. This is a testament to customers' willingness to pay a premium for the Delta difference. Leisure markets and sun destinations are the best performers in our network, with our approach of targeting salable capacity to match demand we are biasing restoring capacity to leisure markets. As result, roughly one-third of our domestic capacity is currently deployed into leisure destinations. Our coastal hubs, especially New York and Boston, are still some of the weakest areas in our network with demand in those hubs only 20 to 25% recovered. International demand remains weak and is limited to essential travel. That said, we continue to work towards opening additional COVID tested lanes of travel with no quarantine on arrival similar to our Atlanta and Rome -- Atlanta to Rome and Atlanta to Amsterdam flights. This will be important in restoring confidence in long haul international travel as vaccine rollouts continue. Our premium seat strategy is holding up well. Domestic premium revenues performed in line with main cabin in the quarter. A good outcome considering that we are continuing to operate in largely leisure driven environment with higher proportion of premium seats held back due to our middle seat blocks. As all of you are aware, corporate demand continues to be depressed and was only 10 to 15% restored for the quarter. Corporate revenue was about 3 points higher than the September quarter with small and medium accounts which make up half of our corporate revenue, recovering five points faster in large corporates. While the passenger revenue environment remains challenging, we are encouraged that efforts to diversify our revenue streams have paid off. Our American Empress remuneration in 2020 was nearly $3 billion, down only 30% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, American Express has shared its spending on our co-branded card portfolio has performed in line to slightly better in their overall card portfolio spend in 2020. In the December quarter, MRO revenue was down almost 30% relative to the same period last year while cargo revenue was up 10% on year-over-year basis. This marks the first quarter of cargo revenue growth since the December 2018 quarter. Our December quarter results reflect the challenges that the pandemic has brought not just to Delta but to the entire airline industry. I am incredibly grateful for the efforts of the entire Delta team in managing through the challenging year that we faced. Now that we think about 2021, we see three distinct phases to the year. And for each phase, we have levers to help us react to the emerging demand environment. In the first phase, we expect demand shopping as to continue. The booking curve to remain more compressed and results to be similar to December quarter. In response, we are focused on making sure that our sellable capacity largely aligns with the emerging demand environment. For example, our January and February domestic schedule seats will be down 3 to 6% versus the non-holiday period in November. That will result in our March quarter sellable capacity being approximately 55% lower relative to the same period in 2019 consistent with the expected 60 to 65% revenue decline. We will also continue to leverage our non-ticket revenue streams like cargo, royalty, and MRO that we believe should continue to outperform passenger revenues. In the second phase, vaccination distribution continues, travel restriction and advisory begin to ease, and customer confidence begins to grow. As that happens, we expect to see an extension of booking curve resulting in a cash-led recovery with revenue recovery to follow. We anticipate this will happen in the spring and will result in us achieving our cash burn breakeven targets. In response to the second phase, our middle seats will be a very powerful tool for us, one we can use to add capacity in a very cost-efficient way generating a meaningful margin tailwind. In the final phase, vaccinations become more widespread and offices begin to reopen. We expect that to occur in the second half of '21. And as a result -- and result in a sustained improvement in demand with progression in cash generation as the booking curve normalizes. With the recovery initially fueled by leisure demand, Delta's success will be driven by our superior connecting economics through our core hubs domestically and our partner hubs internationally. The 34 new aircraft deliveries this year will also leverage high gauge and more efficient aircraft that produce lower seat cost, more premium seats, and a better customer experience. This will allow us to capitalize on our brand affinity and upsell opportunities which are enabled by the elimination of change fees for U.S. customers and the redemption of e-credits. It will take longer for corporate demand to return, but we are encouraged by the results over a recent corporate survey. Our corporate accounts are telling us that they largely anticipate returning to their offices and travel in the June and September quarters. They are also telling us by the end of '21, half are expecting to return to 50%, to 100% of pre-COVID domestic travel, and up to 50% of pre-COVID international travel. To our corporate customers, our commitment to you remains unchanged. Delta is ready when you are. We will be ready to serve our corporate customers by leveraging the strongest domestic and international networks, rebuilding focus cities, and point-to-point flying based on customer needs and by capitalizing on our efforts to always put the customer experience at the center of what we do. We're optimistic for the future, having built the right foundation and focusing on what we can control. We are confident in our ability to successfully navigate the post-pandemic recovery. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gary. Well, I think that's dependent on how far customers are traveling. Generally, the longer they travel the longer the stay is. So, I think what we are seeing is a very good response from the closer in Caribbean and Mexico resorts, where hotels are now going to be offering that as part of the package. And so while there may be some choppiness, as there has been through this whole environment. As we start adopting those testing procedures we think in a pretty short order here that customers will adapt. And to the extent that travel does shift from short-haul international back to domestic, we'll be ready to move the airplanes back too. Hunter, if I could have just a quick follow-up on that, is there -- I guess there are two ways, as we discussed last year, to do that. One is by creating more premium seats, and the other is by running lower load factors. As we go through this fleet transition where premium seats as a percent of our total seats continue to rise, and I think that's our primary way to satisfy the demand for premium customers is to continue to provide them with a higher level of quality. I think we're taking a yield bias as we go into the peak summer, hoping that demand exceeds supply. And if that doesn't materialize we can make those adjustments later. But we have anticipated that there will be a nice recovery in demand as we get towards the summer, and we've taken a conservative approach. I hope that answers your question. Could I add something to that? I think when you think about our premium products and services, you also ought to think that these are not only filled by corporate travelers. So as a matter of fact only less than a third of the seats are actually filled by the corporate travelers, and two-thirds are filled by non-corporates, and I think it's our ability to provide the right products and services for the non-corporates as well with the right sell up opportunities, so that we can match their preferences to our products and services. And I think that's really been one of the great hallmarks of the transformation is to say this is really available to everybody at reasonable prices. And that's been one of our key successes I think. Hey, David, this is Glen. Let me expand on that just a bit. We are -- leveraged maintenance expenses. We have got our staffing levels back to where we need to be starting the 1st of this year. We were still to pay in terms of some of the pay cuts -- the voluntary pay cuts that our employees took last year. So, there is a meaningful step up already in the numbers we gave you for the cash burn in the first quarter to get ready for the recovery. So, I am very comfortable with where we sit. In fact, if we wanted to continue to run the same cost structure and forego some of those expenses, you would see our cash burn coming down in a relatively meaningful level in the first quarter as well. But, we have maintained the same level of cash burn to get ready for the spring. I think that when customers are wanting to fly on Delta, we'll be ready for them. And I know you've heard a long time and I know you remember that slogan. So it's hearkening back to a little bit of history there with topic. Correct. Our revenue premiums have never been higher. And so customers are valuing the Delta difference. And I think that's how we're looking at that is when you look at our revenue production versus our competitive set despite having the least amount of syllable capacity, our revenues have kept pace. So I think we're seeing not only the highest share of corporate demand we've ever had, although albeit on depressed levels, but a real differentiator when customers are shopping for that apply jobs with some of our competitors. I think it's an entire Delta difference. Clearly that's a piece of it. But whether or not it's the Delta care standard, whether or not it's the Delta people, which are really at the heart of that. But this is one component of ensuring that Delta is seen as a brand you want to associate with."

            "name": "Gary Chase",
            "content": "Thanks, Glenn, and good morning everyone. Let me touch on the fourth quarter in 2020, and then I'll turn to the outlook for costs in the balance sheet as we head into '21. Our December quarter pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion is about $500 million better than the September quarter, given the revenue improvement Glen just discussed combined with strong cost discipline. We reduced costs by approximately 50% from 2019 levels for the third consecutive quarter. More importantly, our costs were up just 6% from the third quarter on 30% capacity growth. And three quarters of that increase came from higher fuel. Total unit cost including fuel was down 4.5%, compared to 2019 on 44% lower flow and capacity. Our average daily cash burn for the December quarter was $12 million, half of the third quarters 24. We closed the year with $16.7 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of $18.8 billion up about $8 billion versus year-end 2019. Now, as we look into the year ahead, improving demand fundamentals will underpin a transition of our financial focus from protecting our liquidity, to positioning the company for a return to profitability and free cash flow. I will explain our approach to costs on our balance sheet as we make this transition. Let's start with costs. We need to stay flexible and maintain our discipline in order to position the company for the return to profitability Ed mentioned, as we expect continued choppiness and demand in the early part of the year. We've already taken structural steps to resize our business. Our two largest cost drivers, fleet and headcount are both 15% to 20% smaller than they were in 2019. Headcount reductions were a difficult, but necessary decision. It was hard to see 18,000 talented and dedicated co-workers leave, but it's a testament to the Delta culture that these reductions were achieved entirely through voluntary means. We accelerated our fleet transformation by retiring aircraft with relatively short remaining lives and simplified our fleet by eliminating two entire families while increasing our gauge, on a run rate basis, these changes will derive more than $400 million in annualized cost benefits. As we add capacity in '21, we will drive higher utilization of our system and we have room to rebuild our network from current levels at low incremental costs, approximately 40% to 50% of our December quarter non-fuel CASM. Our goal is to produce and sustain non-fuel unit costs below 2019 levels by the fourth quarter that cost focus will be a key driver of profitability later in the year when demand returns. Looking to the March quarter, we're preparing for stronger demand by reactivating aircraft and restoring our people to full hours, driving about $200 million in additional costs versus the December quarter. Our March quarter total operating expense will be 35% to 40% lower than March quarter '19 with a total unit cost including fuel down 5% to 10% on approximately 35% lower flown capacity. Let's move now to capital, the balance sheet and liquidity. As we begin the year, conditions are similar to where we exited 2020; a modest uplift in net sales should offset the cost investments we're making in the quarter. And as a result, we expect average daily cash burn between $10 million and $15 million similar to the December quarter. With further improvements in net sales as customers gain confidence, we expect our cash burn cease this spring. With that goal in sight, we're turning our focus to how we will balance reinvesting in the business while reducing our debt levels. Given our expectations for cash flow in '21 and proceeds from the PSP extension, we expect our current adjusted net levels to be the high watermark for that important metric. For the full-year, we're expecting $2.5 billion in gross CapEx, significant reduction from the $4 billion to $5 billion that we were spending pre-COVID. We have $1.3 billion of aircraft purchase commitments for 34 new deliveries this year, which we have the option to fully finance, and about $1 billion in non aircraft CapEx. Including retirements, we expect our fleet count at the end of 2021 will be 15% smaller than at year-end '19, with total fleet declining from about 1,350 to about 1,130. An equal priority is to work on our balance sheet by reducing our liquidity and paying down debt. We have approximately $1.8 billion of debt maturities in '21, and $2.1 billion in '22. Our debt has an average interest rate of 4.6%, which will drive approximately $350 million in quarterly interest expense. However, we will begin reducing those expenses by paying down debt this year. We do not have mandatory pension contributions until 2025 under airline relief, but we expect to make at least $500 million in voluntary contributions this year. In terms of a quarter-end outlook, with about $3 billion in PSP support expected from the government the March quarter, we project ending the period with $18 billion to $19 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of approximately $18 billion. Let me close by saying this, the Delta difference has never been more important. And I'd like to thank the Delta team for delivering for each other and for our customers amid the industry's most challenging environment ever. Because of your dedication we will emerge from the crisis stronger and more resilient than ever. With that, turn the call back over the Jill to begin the Q&A. Jamie, I think what I would say is it's obviously less than today. We need some time. We have I think some work in front of us to think through where we ultimately want that to be. But I think the important point is we're getting started, and I think you see some of that. During the quarter, we prepaid our term loan that was -- matured in April, for about $3 billion. We mentioned during the script that we do plan to make a pension contribution which, as you know, we consider part of our financial obligation. So we are getting started. We don't have more specifics, but we are getting started. And we're very focused on that $350 million number that I described, and using the liquidity that we have, where it makes sense to drive that down. Yes, Brandon, let me start with the first question, that the structural costs, the two biggest ones in our business are really headcount and fleet, as we mentioned. The fleet really determines an awful lot of the infrastructure that we need from a cost standpoint. We expect to get leverage out of all of our costs associated with assets, we look about a third of our cost structure on a monthly basis is fixed. So as we grow we'll obviously get leverage there. And we have pockets of opportunity in terms of better utilization of just the overall system. When I think about what we're doing here, and this gets to your second question, there are kind of two big things that I talk about or that we all talk about internally as we think about this effort that we're embarking on. The first is baseline aggressively, and it's -- really have a laser focus on what's in the cost structure now, and what makes sense. You see that in the 50% reductions that we've been posting now for several quarters. The second thing we say is leverage the build, and that's really where the incremental thought process comes. That's about being very thoughtful about better leveraging the system as we start to rebuild. Now I think in terms of your second question, incremental costs, it's pretty simple the way we're thinking about it. It's just change in cost divided by change in ASM. And we wanted to give some guidepost as to the leverage that we do expect going forward for the 40% to 50% of December capacity comes in. I'll just note, if you take a look at the second-half of 2020, it was quite a bit better than that. And that is why I emphasized that comment in the prepared remarks about how we scale the system, particularly in the fourth quarter. We have Katie, I'm not sure we're going to get into some of the specifics. I will say that the fleet simplification has been something actually, that we think is in our run rate. Today, you're seeing some of the benefit in the fourth quarter. But it is something that will have a much bigger impact as we move to rescale the network through '21. When I mentioned the concept of leveraging the build and maybe one of the reasons why I'm thinking through it, just as I'm thinking through it is there are a lot of things that we want to think about doing differently. One of the unique opportunities, we always want to make something good out of what has transpired. And it does give us an opportunity to start fresh. One of the reasons I think we're showing the kind of leverage as we rebuild is because we have a clean sheet of paper in some sense to start from. Yes. Joe, we too, we are providing some disclosures to those debt holders as you described. I think we agree with some of the sentiments that you have expressed over time. We see the value there. I think Glen did a good job of articulating how well it is holding up. We've been on a path to provide more information there. I think you'll have to be a little forgiving. We've had a lot on our mind and I think you can expect us to continue down that path for the reason, for the very same reason that I think you'd been asking about it, uh, because we do see the value there. And that really manifests itself in the record Net Promoter Score we had in the December time period. So as I mentioned, despite the fact that we had to cancel some flights, our average lateness was not very late versus the original itinerary. And our customers over the holiday period were quite satisfied posting record high Net Promoter scores. We're not going to speculate on that. Sorry. Sorry, your last part was real garble. Your question, are we adding increased numbers to our No Fly lists based on Federal information? We certainly know that the TSA is looking very carefully at those that were in the Capitol building the writers and we're working closely with them and I do anticipate if the TSA is able to identify individuals who have people added to the No Fly List, no question about it. From talking to American Express, good partners there, it's clear that people place great value on their loyalty points with Delta and like to see the values grow over time. And so while they've been in the pandemic, we've seen redemptions down four points, because flying levels are down. But they haven't stopped spending on the card, our Co-brand card is as good if not better than almost any other product card, AmEx has. So it has great appeal. And we expect it's not going to be, not to be run on the bank type situation that you're referring to. Absolutely. We're looking forward to that day."

This morning we reported pretax losses of $2.1 billion for the December quarter, and $9 billion for the full-year, capping the toughest year in Delta's history. We've been saying all along that this recovery wouldn't follow a straight line, with demand choppiness as COVID infections rose across the country, and government and public health officials issues travel advisories, our revenues, of $3.5 billion for the fourth quarter, was just 30% of last year's levels. And although we still have the tough winter ahead of us, we're encouraged by the progress that's been made on the vaccine front, and are confident that Delta is positioned to successfully lead our industry into recovery as the year unfolds. While 2020 was a challenging year, we delivered results for all of our stakeholders. For our employees, we prioritized protecting their health and safety, and preserving our culture. For example, throughout the past year we have offered and continue to offer an extensive employee testing program and paid protection programs for employees diagnosed, exposed, or at high risk of COVID-19. We have had remarkable volunteerism, up to 40,000 employees taking unpaid leaves throughout the summer to protect jobs and preserve cash. And in fact, we still have over 10,000 employees in the month of January out on unpaid leaves. And we have made it through this year without furloughing any employees. Our emphasis on taking care of our people is reflected in Delta's recognition this week by Glassdoor as one of the best places to work for the 5th year in a row, coming in seventh overall on a list of 100 large companies, the highest rank Delta has ever received, all in the face of a pandemic, really incredible work by our team. For our customers, we're keeping them at the center of our recovery. Our health and safety efforts on being the only major U.S. airline that continues to block middle seats, to partnering with leading names, like the Mayo Clinic, Emory Healthcare, Lysol, and Purell in developing the Delta care standard, to launching the industry's first COVID-tested transatlantic flights with no quarantine on arrival, are all targeted at restoring consumer confidence in travel, and reopening borders, which will be an important driver of revenue growth in the future. Our customers recognize the outstanding service our people provide with an all-time high December Net Promoter Score of 71, up 20 points year-over-year, and by Business Travel News naming Delta the top airline for corporate travelers for the 10th year in a row, and once again coming in first place on all 12 metrics that they measure in the survey. That customer preference and loyalty is what underlies our revenue premium, and has never been stronger. And finally, for our shareholders, we secured our liquidity position and rescaled our cost structure. We reduced liquidity risk by raising over $25 billion in capital since the pandemic began. With approximately $17 billion of liquidity our adjusted net debt however only increased $8 billion year-over-year and we don't expect that net debt will increase going forward. We've swiftly removed cost from the business with three consecutive quarters of operating expenses declining by nearly 50% or more, increasing the variable nature of our cost structure. In fact, in the December quarter, our all-in unit costs were down 4.5% year-over-year despite flown capacity being down 44%. That is a remarkable achievement, and credit to all Delta employees for making that happen. And by keeping our cost under control we've leveraged the modest increase in net sales to reduce our average daily cash burns $12 million a day for the December quarter, half of what it was in the September quarter, and a decrease of 90% since the early days of the pandemic in late March. Turning to 2021, we expect the March quarter to look similar to the December quarter, with March quarter revenues at 35% to 40% of March quarter 2019 levels, and our cash burn for the quarter holding at $10 million to $15 million per day. We expect that will be followed by an inflection point this spring as vaccine distribution continues, travel restrictions start to ease, and consumer confidence begins to grow, hopefully resulting in cash burn reaching breakeven or better by the second quarter. And as the year progresses, we expect demand will start to accelerate as vaccinations become more widespread and the virus is in a contained state, and customers gain greater confidence to make future travel commitments. This should enable a sustained recovery to begin in the second-half of 2021, with a return to profitability this summer. So, as we work through this environment, we're focused on five things. First, as always, we're committed to keeping our culture intact and our employees engaged. The Delta people are our most strategic asset. We have done a tremendous job this year, and together we'll lead our airline through the recovery. Second, we'll continue to prioritize the customer with a focus on health and safety, and the maintenance of the industry's strongest network, thereby increasing loyalty and preference for our brand. Customers have shown they are willing to pay more for the quality of our network, product, and our service. The gains we have achieved in customer satisfaction position us well to drive sustainable revenue growth in the future. Third, we'll maintain our focus on innovation, which will enable our employees improve the customer experience and drive efficiency through the business. And innovative thinking will power our ability to tackle big challenges in front of us, like our goal of achieving carbon neutrality in the next decade. Fourth, we'll drive a competitive cost structure. Given the changes we've made over the last year, our goal is to sustain our non-fuel unit cost at or below 2019 levels by the December quarter of this year, on roughly 75% of 2019 capacity levels, displaying continued agility in managing our cost. And finally, we are committed to debt reduction and creating long-term shareholder value, including continuing to protect our owners so that they can participate in future upside without dilution, because for investors while the near-term demand path is murky, industry fundamentals remain intact. Following almost a year of subdued travel customers are beginning to exhibit behavior that is indicative of pent up demand. Shopping visits across Delta's digital channels are significantly outpacing the passenger volumes we're carrying. In our most recent corporate survey, 40% of respondents expect full recovery by 2022. Our partners at American Express are also seeing encouraging signs, whether it's cardholders holding on to their points in anticipation of redeeming them for air travel, for a recent survey that suggested approximately 70% of respondents expect to take a trip in 2021 after not traveling in 2020. Although it will take time, customers want to travel again when they feel it's safe. They feel they've had a year of their life taken from them, and they're starting to get ready to reclaim. Until then, we're fortunate to have the support of the U.S. government which recognizes the importance of the airline industry, and we thank Congress and the administration for passing the COVID relief bill last month. As a result of that bill, we anticipate receiving approximately $3 billion in addition -- in additional payroll support funds, largely on terms similar to the initial CARES Act program. These funds have been critical in saving thousands of industry jobs during an unprecedented level of demand decline, and it's why the U.S. airline industry is in the best position to recover from the pandemic over any other international market. So, while 2020 was a difficult year and challenges will continue in 2021, I'm encouraged by some of the data that we're seeing, and I'm proud of the foundation that we built at Delta. This company is well positioned to emerge in a stronger competitive position from this crisis, and we'll continue to lead our industry in the years ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Glen. Savi, the vaccine deployment still is very early, and we haven't really seen much in the form of changed behaviors. And we hear a lot anecdotally, but it's also one of the weakest travel periods of the year in the current month that we're in. We've not seen the booking curve start to expand. We certainly hope to see that as we get through the quarter, and vaccines continue to become more prevalent. We're not going to comment on our competitors or speculate. We -- you know us well. You know we love competition, and I think competition makes you better. And, Jamie, I'd like to add to Glen's comment. We're still working obviously with the CDC. We endorse and support the testing requirements they've put in place. But a new feature is the inclusion of rapid testing into the mix, so it doesn't necessarily mean it only has to be a PCR test. And with the growth of antigen testing, the quality of antigen testing that's out there and the supplies in place you literally could get some of these tests done within a 10-minute interval shortly before you return. Okay, thanks, Jamie. Yes, Hunter, it is an interesting year, I'll say that. We've not made a decision beyond the end of March relative to our -- when to unblock the middle seats, but we have some time to continue to look at that. I think it's going to be very much driven by customer demand, customer input, the confidence customers have in their seats. But no question about it, we are generating a meaningful premium due to that decision. Could you speak louder, we missed your question -- the start of your question, Hunter? Or I did. We can't achieve 2019 levels without [of course] [ph] 20% of our people, no question about it. But there is that we don't need to backfill it entirely either. So there's a middle ground there. Well, Andrew, I think we're a little early yet in terms of thinking about the long-term CapEx fixture thinking that we move $5 billion of aircraft CapEx alone over there to Airbus out over the next several years. You know, to a degree to which we want to take positions and new positions coming up, we'll continue to evaluate that based on demand. But right now, I feel pretty comfortable with where we sit. Robin, we're not surprised by that. These are small business owners who need to get out to their customers who have to work hard every single day to keep their sales and their business moving. And we do see a meaningful continued improvement in small business traffic, some that we can measure, others that we can't say, they're not under contracts with us, but we know that consuming important part of overall business travel. But I do want to talk about the overall corporate travel results. As you probably know, we extensively survey our corporate customers, our large corporate customers on a quarterly basis, in addition to just being with them on a weekly basis as to their thoughts on the return of travel. And the most recent survey that we conducted, which just ended a couple of weeks ago, indicated that 40% of our big corporate customers expect they will be fully back to 2019 levels by 2022. And another 11% said that they expect to be fully back by 2023. So that's little over 50% of the customers and these are the people everyone's speculating what's going to happen to business travel, these are the customers who make those decisions, 7% said we'll never be back to 2019 levels, only 7%. And 42% said they weren't sure needed more time to figure it out. So with all the dialog and speculation around the depth of business travel, just looking at that survey, it's very interesting. If you take the 51%, that said they'll be fully backed by '23, the majority of which is in '22. And then you consider the second quadrant of 50%, who said they'll never return or they're not sure of their return. And even if you assumed only 50% of their travel returns; that gets you 75% of the way back no later than '23, and I think that's a very pessimistic view on business travel. So what we've been talking about corporate travel, business travel returning, I felt optimistic when I saw those results, we know it's going to be different going forward. As I've said many times, it could be 10% to 20%, lower over a period as it's substituted and complemented, there'll be different types of travelers, different reasons for people traveling. But I think business travel has got a very, very strong opportunity return over the next two years, and we're going to be well positioned to carry. I think that the Delta difference has never been more pronounced than it is right now. And if you look at our share of corporate travel that is traveling, we have experienced the highest levels in our history. So, demand for our products and services is incredibly high for people who want it. And I think that's where our challenge remains is to continue to provide industry leading products and services that our corporate travelers want and need. And that's been what we've been doing over the past several years. And what we'll continue to do as we get to the end of this pandemic, and I think that's going to be what differentiates us. And clearly, there's always people who would like to take that travel away from you, because it is some of the highest yielding travel in the system. But I think that's our goal. And our mission is to stay ahead of that and provide it to people who want to fly Delta. And as opposed to a push, which is, \"Hey, we can lower fares and triumphs, move to all the sides for the bottom of this.\" Yes, Katie, some of that came through a little garbled, let me say this, I think the distinction is really about timing, in the Spring, what we expect and I mentioned it a few times, we think as confidence starts to build, what you'll see is that people will start booking for further out in the booking curve, and so we will have a build in our air traffic liability, that helps us cross cash breakeven, earlier in the Spring, P&L breakeven is something that will take a little bit more, that's when you know, our revenue is going to be covering our expenses. And that is something that we expect will lag a little bit behind the building bookings. And we'll be there by the summer, as we've mentioned. And that number has been pretty consistent throughout the entire year. So we have a pretty good sense of what that's going to look like. Yes. I'd like to add to Gary's comments, I think it's remarkable, the work the team has done on the cost side to get out in the fourth quarter to the point where our all-in unit costs are 4.5% lower quarter-over-quarter despite having over 40% less capacity to work with. It speaks to the ingenuity of the team, rethinking as we speak, what not just the current environment, but the future environment is and these are not costs that we're deferring out into the future. We're making real changes, real time here. And it touches every part of our business. So it's been one of the, since the demand has been low, we've been all over costs the entire year, and the team has done really, really good, good working. Thank you. Why not? I'll take that. Listen, they're all interrelated. You need to put the revenue and the capacity out there and remind the demand of the CASM strategy, but they're certainly connected to the ability to drive costs down. But one of the things that we have been a leader for many, many years, really the last decade is on our up-gaging strategy, domestic particularly, and that will continue to be important as we move forward and while we talk about simple flying to fleet, we've taken some big steps in that direction. We're also going to be advancing the up-gaging of the domestic fleet at the same time. So that's a big contributor. We'll continue to be a contributor with both driving down costs as well as improving the customer experience in revenue including premium revenue opportunities. I said in my remarks that our goal is to get that 2019 unit cost by the end of this year on roughly 75% of 2019 capacity level. We're in this pretty good market. We hope our capacity level is higher. I'll be honest that the demand environment is driving, but that's going to be driven by demand, not by cost. No, we're not using that as a guide for capacity levels. We're using that for our own internal calculus in terms of where we need to get our cost structure down. It won't be 75% and maybe higher, and may be lower. I don't know. There is a long way to go between here and there, and we'll keep you posted as we go. Duane, we're not going back to get in monthly revenue guide, so I'm starting to have to pass. Right, comps will give you -- it will be easier. Joe, I wouldn't draw the conclusion that corporate travel is impaired at all. In fact, I've not said that, I think we may see lower corporate travel, but I also think it will be changed essentially a different mix. So I don't think we should be for either ringing alarm bells relative to the future of corporate travel. All indications is corporate travel is ready to start coming back and we'll come back pretty aggressively beginning the second half of this year. We are a smaller airline, was there 200 fewer planes today, we've already right-sized the business to be smaller, which will help protect the premium revenue sources and the margins of the business. And well, that's why we spent a lot of time on this call talking about our cost performance that's going to be the key to make sure that we protect the margins in an environment where corporate travel will be down for the foreseeable future. Maybe it's permanently down by a little bit of lower amount that I'm not ready to declare that call yet. Joe, I'll let Gary take that because he was closer to the financial disclosure as well say. Well, the law department is a very important asset, our most important asset are people, Gary? Well, I think there is always opportunity to be above where we were in 2019. That's clearly our goal, if it could be your short-term goal would be better. I think it's more medium to a long-term goal, but I think we are going to come out with a higher preference than we've ever had and that higher preference it will drive a higher demand. So -- which should enable us to work on yields as we come out the back end of this, so I think it goes back to how did people react to the pandemic and how to Delta's brand come through to us, and I think from all the research we've done from all the data that we see that our brand has never been stronger and demand for our products and services has never been stronger on a relative basis. And we're planning on capitalizing on that on the back end of this. Are you referring to the third party sales is that what you are asking? The phenomenon that you're seeing in the third party sales is anything we produce and do not exchange for jet fuel. We sell to third parties, obviously with our jet consumption being weighed down, we've had a lot more of those sales to third parties. So that is going to likely trend with how we rebuild our network and how much jet fuel were consuming. I do think it's important to point out that those sales have no margin. If you look in some of the reconciliations in the back of the release, you'll see that those are offset dollar for dollar rather on the cost side. So they're all wrapped into the economics of the refinery, but you should expect those to start trending down as our consumption picks back up and we're exchanging more for our own use. Hey, Mike. It's Ed. We are still working through the guidance from the CDC. While we have mentioned - I've personally have had a number of conversations with Dr. Wakefield around this. We've mentioned the need to consider some waivers in unusual circumstances where, for example, COVID testing resources are not available, or if they are some relatively short term as you mentioned air travel. So, we are working through the implementation details. I think it's absolutely right thing to do for the long term for our industry. But, it's going to create some short-term hiccups. Well, there will be some, David. We expect, for example, to have reactivation expenses around maintenance in aircraft through the remainder of the year. So, we expect that pace to continue. I am not sure I quite heard the non -- was it discretionary or non-discretionary expenses that you were asking? Well, I prefer to think of it not to pick it up before recovery. But, we will have a need to revisit some of the things that we've done. If you take a look, David, at what we are pointing to in terms of incremental cost as we leverage the network, it does look different than what we saw in the second half of 2020. And one of the reasons is we do expect to have pressure in pockets. We have to be very mindful and balanced on those needs virtual realities of the business because we are determined here to turn the profit equation around and to be printing these releases with black ink this year. David, again, I think that question is a little premature. Yes, we talked about that topic of the board. We also haven't made any determinations quite yet. The goal we have at the board is very much what we said to you, is that we get to a goal is to get to a cash breakeven position for the second quarter and return to profitability starting in the third quarter. The pace of that recovery over the next couple of years, obviously, we still have some work to do there. Yes, corporate travel being back. Absolutely corporate, looks are actually doing quite well were 40% up quarter-over-quarter where we were last quarter in terms of looks, and look to book is very low. So people are looking, they're aspiring to travel. And they're just not ready to commit yet. And I think that's what really gives us that sense that there will be a time in which people feel comfortable again to travel. And that will turn into a click, turn into a booking. And so we're monitoring that very, very carefully. And we're looking forward to the opportunity to serve these customers as they come back. Sure, Ali, we certainly had a much better Christmas holiday than the Thanksgiving break. There were a number of factors going on in the staffing levels of the company with a lot of changes that we had implemented. And you couple that with COVID and some of the exposures into everyone seeing the No Fly capability to some of our staffing, which came in. We learned from that for Thanksgiving. We made some pretty aggressive changes in December in terms of getting the schedule fine tuned to anticipate that. And we were really, really good shape. And then we got hit with a massive storm in Minneapolis on the 23rd of December, which cost us probably a couple of 100 cancels, incremental cancels over that next couple of day timeframe which was concerning, but unavoidable unfortunately. The most important thing in all of that is one the Delta people. And I know there were some bloggers out there wondering whether the Delta pilots weren't doing everything, the Delta pilots were amazing through the full holiday periods and showing up and getting the flights going and giving up their holidays and their time away with the families to help the company out. So it had nothing to do with pilot staffing at all. The other thing was the number of customers who may have been canceled, while which is higher than we've been expecting, the vast majority of the people back to their destination, within hours of their looking to time. So, the teams did very, very good job and that issue was pretty much over by the 26, 27. Well, we're a microcosm of the country and as the pandemic has accelerated over the course of the last few months in order to accelerate across airline employees as well. But our team's doing real job, they're not seeing it spread within the company, when they're at work, it's in community is where people are getting sick. So I tell you, every work category of the company is experiencing an increase in exposures as we're all exceeding over the last couple of months. Tracy, I don't think so. Well, clearly leisure destinations are at the forefront of the recovery right now. And I think it doesn't matter whether or not it's a beach or a mountain view. That's where people are headed at this point in the recovery. And then your second question was about... We're happy and really have are indifferent whether or not people who are booking are using points or whether or not they're using actual dollars, or whether they're using the E-credits, what we're anticipating is that all of those will increase. And we have plenty of capacity to meet that demand as we head to the second half of '21. So we're hoping that all of the above happens. I think that number is north of 800 at this point, David. That number is not a huge number but a number. Well, I think everyone is aware why there's not profit sharing in this year. And I can tell you employee satisfaction is at a very, very high level. I mentioned during this trip, Kelly that we just were awarded as the Seventh best employer by Glassdoor. Glassdoor is an entirely employee driven acknowledgement, the company hasn't had any, any input or any insight into that. It's purely by employees talking about their employers. So if that gives you a sense for the sentiment, the sentiment is very strong. The volunteerism with the 10s of 1000s of people that have taken unpaid leaves of absence over the year indicates that, we've been mindful of the fact that there won't be a profit sharing payout. And we're providing added services and assistance around financial health and financial well being and credit counseling and other services to employees that may need it. We're going to be ramping. We have been ramping it up and talking about it. We're going to continue to talk about it on an ongoing basis going forward. We have people providing that support. And relative to next year's profit sharing, I certainly hope we'll be paying it, it's hard to speculate it now, it's just only a couple weeks into the year. But I'm hopeful that we'll be paying it. Well, clearly the size of Atlanta is relative to the size of demand in the United States. As the World's largest hub, it is a microcosm of global airline demand. So we expect it to recover as the airline continues to recover, the two things that I would say is that we're going to continue to work on average gage, which I think is something that's really important and that will be bringing more details about bigger airplanes with better products and services. And so, I think you'll see the departures get back to 2019 levels at some point in the future. But before that, you'll probably see the employments start to rise dramatically and using really the gauge lever as much as the departure level. This is as you know, our most valuable asset here in Atlanta and we're very proud to be a part of the Atlanta community, and it has led us in the rebuild of our network so far. Dawn, as you said, no, I would not say that's a fair assumption. What we said is that when the demand returns, which is that next inflection point that will inform our decisions around what to do with the middle seat. So we've not made any decisions to unblock them post-March 30. Well, we continue to monitor it on a regular basis. It's not imminent. We have to have some bit of time, but it's going to be informed by customer sentiment, demand, in addition to message, we have a lot of other seats still on our planes, and confidence in travel relative to COVID and vaccine deployment. So, yes, it's not a clear line, and there is hope that has to go into that. We know that it has been important not the only, but one of the important reasons why Delta has been able to continue to earn an even higher revenue premium during this past year than we historically had. And so we want to be very careful as to how we make that decision. No. I think we're very confident in our products and services, and we compete well against both those carriers individually. And I'm sure we'll compete very well against them together. So we have a lot of confidence in our products and services in the Northeast. Focus cities will be an important part of our portfolio moving forward. And we'll continue to work on making sure that we have the great capacity in those cities as demand returns. And so we're looking forward to demand continuing to return in all of our focus cities. Your question, I'm sorry, was a big garble. Could you repeat that? We're having a hard time with some of our communications this morning. Yes. We're still working with the CDC on the specific testing strategy and deployment. This is something that we -- Delta endorse. I know our industry similarly endorses. We would like to see the travel restrictions lifted once the testing protocols are in place, and that will be a decision by the new administration, is my understanding, when they take office. And -- but I think by having the testing protocols in place it then gives confidence to the regulatory authorities to start to lift the bans, which is why we endorse the testing strategy. Your question relative to vaccines, yes, obviously once vaccines are at scale we would hope that the vaccination evidence would supplant the need to show a test result. But of course, we're still working with the authorities on that. Again, I'm sorry; it's hard to hear the question. Let me take a shot at it. The information that we shared on the call about corporate travel is the sentiment we're getting from our own customers. As you are aware, we are the largest carrier of corporate travel amongst the U.S. carriers, so I think we have probably some of the best info, referred to IATA or any other group that, you know, I don't know how they determine what 2023 to 2024 looks like. I wouldn't take too much confidence in that. But what our corporate travel managers are telling us is that 50% expected to be fully back by 2023. The other 50% is largely uncertain, but we expect a meaningful amount of that travel to return as well. The numbers we're comparing are 2019 volumes, yes. So, thanks, Tim. Just in closing, I think you can all appreciate that 2020 was a difficult year, but we're on a recovery path. We see that the start of it beginning to crystallize here, particularly with the vaccine development, and as you've heard earlier, when Glen and Gary, I'm confident that we've got the foundation in place to return Delta to revenue growth, profitability, and free cash flow generation. We're committed to keeping our culture intact and our employees engaged. We'll continue to listen to our customers and put them first in order to further enhance their experience on Delta, increase their loyalty, and drive affinity towards our brand. We're very focused on the innovations, which is allowing us not only to enhance the customer experience and drive efficiency, but also to tackle the big challenges that still lie ahead for us. We'll remain very focused on cost performance. We've talked a lot about that during the call, to ensure that leisure-led demand environment that emerges, we'll be able to respond to it. And finally, we're committed to reducing debt, strengthening our balance sheet and creating long-term shareholder value, and allowing our owners to participate in future upside without dilution. And we have the very best employees in the industry, and we're ready to see this strategy through, which gives me optimism, confidence in our ability to thrive and emerge as the industry leader. So, thanks again for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you soon."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Delta Air Lines September Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Cassidy and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJill Greer: Thanks, Cassidy. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for our September quarter earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is available for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta\u2019s performance and strategy, Glenn will provide an update on the revenue environment and Paul will discuss cost liquidity in our balance sheet. We will then go to our Q&A and ask you to limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so we can get to as many analysts as possible. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Bastian: Well, thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining us today. This morning, we reported a $2.6 billion adjusted pre-tax loss on a 79% decline in revenues for the September quarter. We ended the quarter with over $21 billion in liquidity, having brought our cash burn down to $18 million per day in the month of September. And while we still have a long road ahead of us when you look through the large toll that the pandemic has taken, we are showing progressive improvement across the business, performing well on factors within our control and ensuring the company is well positioned as demand starts to return. And there are signs that customers are becoming increasingly confident in returning to air travel, with TSA counts growing each week. But we are still running at a fraction of our normal capacity and expect that our December quarter revenues will be 30% to 35% of what we saw a year ago. Put that improvement in context, our revenues bottomed out in the second quarter at only 10% of prior year levels. We are at 21% of prior year levels in the third quarter and we expect them to be roughly one-third of prior year levels in the fourth quarter. Steady improvement, as Q4 is expected to generate 3x the revenue of Q2, but still a long way to go. To see a meaningful step up in demand from here, we will need business travel to further improve, local quarantines to end, and international restrictions to lift, that will only come with widespread advances by the medical community and offices reopening, which many expect will start to happen in the first half of next year. As we all know, the path to revenue recovery is dependent on demand returning at scale. Until then, our focus is on doing a great job at what we can control, taking great care of our people and our customers, protecting our liquidity and managing our cost performance. For our customers, we continue to emphasize safety and health with the Delta CareStandard, our multi-layered approach that includes intense cleaning protocols, blocking middle seats, and requiring masks onboard our planes. According to IATA, with over 1 billion air travelers worldwide in 2020, there have only been 44 documented cases of suspected COVID transmission onboard an aircraft and virtually all of them were in the early months of the pandemic before masks and revised safety protocols came into existence. We carry at Delta over 1 million people a week and have had no documented transmission onboard any of our aircraft. The Delta CareStandard works and it\u2019s keeping our customers and our employees safe. And as a result, customers are increasingly becoming comfortable returning to the [air] [ph]. Our customer-focused approach is producing record net promoter scores, which reached 75 in September, which is up a staggering 22 points over the prior year levels. This is a testament to the Delta people who have continued to shine throughout this historic crisis, by restoring customers\u2019 confidence in travel and investing in their long-term loyalty and trust, we are creating a path to sustainable revenue growth in the future, but we do believe it could still be 2 years or more until we achieve a normalized revenue environment. Until then, we will be smaller in the short-term, but also more agile and more efficient. Today, we are already 20% smaller than we were at the start of this year, having reduced our fleet, our headcount and our overhead. These were difficult, but essential decisions that positioned Delta to emerge as a more resilient airline. We have resized our ground and flight attendant workforces by 20%. I am grateful to all those employees for the sacrifices from those taking early retirement decisions to the 40,000 staff who took unpaid voluntary leaves throughout the pandemic and thus reducing our labor cost for non-pilot groups by more than 40% over the past 6 months. This was the driving factor that allowed us to avoid furloughs and protect their jobs. We are still working with ALPA and hopefully we can achieve that same result with our pilots, but if not, we will be furloughing roughly 1,700 pilots on the 1st of November. We have reduced our fleet by retiring more than 200 aircraft this year and accelerated our fleet simplification to retire nearly 30% of our fleet or 400 aircraft by 2025 along with our revised Airbus order book. This cuts years off the timeline to achieving a higher engaged fleet with lower seat cost and a better customer experience. By making these structural changes to our cost base in this constrained environment, we will have significant cost and margin tailwind ahead of us as higher yielding business travel does return and our load factor [CAS] [ph] begin to ease and we are seeing early signs of our cost efficiency steps paying off as our fourth quarter all-in CASM is projected to be roughly flat despite a 40% reduction in capacity year-over-year, some incredible results and creates nice momentum heading into \u201821. The challenges of this year have reinforced our belief in the importance of investment grade balance sheet and our top financial priority will be to regain that as soon as possible. The first step in that process is getting back to breakeven cash flow. We had initially helped to be there by the end of this year, but as the virus has had greater impact on our business than expected that goal has shifted a few months. We expect to average a daily cash burn rate of $10 million per day in the December month with good line of sight to positive cash flow by the spring. Once we achieve that milestone, we will have a heightened focused on paying down debt. Putting all this good work into perspective, it\u2019s been about positioning Delta to accelerate into a post-COVID recovery. Do we know exactly when that recovery will happen or what it will look like? No. But by taking out complexity, simplifying our cost structure, improving our products and service levels now and maintaining strong employee morale in the face of this challenging time, we do know that we will be even more customer focused with a stronger brand and a solid financial foundation. And with that, we will be well-positioned to adapt and to win. Now, I will turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. Since we last spoke in July, we have seen a steady progression in demand. This has resulted in our net cash sales improving from $5 million to $10 million per day at the beginning of the quarter to approximately $25 million to $30 million per day at the end of the quarter. That said, demand strength varied in different regions and segments of our business. Corporate demand has shown signs of modest improvement. And while the volume of corporate travel at the end of the quarter was 15% of last year\u2019s levels, corporate volumes are trending upward across all industries and we expect this to continue into 2021. Apart from the Caribbean and Mexico, international demand remains weak. This is largely due to government imposed restrictions in key markets. In the U.S., we have seen demand recover to 35% to 40% of pre-pandemic levels, with strength in leisure markets like Florida, the Mountain West and the beach destinations. However, cities that are under quarantine requirements like New York and Boston are recovering more slowly and are now just above 20% of pre-pandemic levels. As we approach the holiday travel period, we have been pleased with the recent booking trends for Thanksgiving and Christmas, which show that customers continue to gain confidence in booking further out. Our non-ticket businesses had held up relatively well during the quarter with both loyalty revenue and cargo outperforming passenger revenues. The strength in our loyalty revenue stream is in large part due to the spend on the Delta co-brand card. American Express has stated that the spend on our co-branded card has held better than other AmEx cards. We recently launched a card acquisition campaign after putting those efforts on hold and have had excellent response to this offering. This, in combination with spend trends that AmEx has seen suggests that our customers\u2019 aspirations to travel remain intact. As Ed mentioned, we focused on making sure Delta is well-positioned for a future recovery. We have been accelerating redevelopment projects in our airports and we were excited to open Concourse 8 in Salt Lake City. This was the first new U.S. hub airport to open in 20 years. In New York and Los Angeles, we are taking years out of our construction timelines, getting our customers a faster path to a better terminal experience, while also lowering our construction costs. I would like to call out our properties and facilities team for the excellent work they have been doing across the network on accelerating all of our airport projects. We have made it easier for customers to do business with Delta, eliminating most domestic change fees, extending Medallion and SkyClub benefits and refunding approximately $2.8 billion back to our customers so far this year. We are also rebuilding the network by leveraging our strength, focusing on connecting customers through our core hubs and adding capacity to coastal hubs only as demand returns. In the domestic network, 80% of our current capacity is on our core hubs of Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis and Salt Lake City. And in those subs, we are using our most cost efficient, highest gauge equipment as we retire less efficient aircraft. Internationally, a majority of our long-haul capacity is in our JV partner hubs where we are able to efficiently connect traffic. Similar to the domestic entity we are moving towards using our most cost efficient wide-body aircraft in our international operations by leveraging the A330s and the A350s and eliminating the subscale 777 fleets and sun-setting the 767-300 ERs. While the longer network rebuild is underway, we are also technically managing the network in the near-term. We are increasing capacity around the peak leisure holiday periods like Thanksgiving and Christmas, while reducing it during off-peak periods like Halloween and the election week. This approach will result in our December quarter capacity being 40% to 45% lower year-on-year or approximately 60% lower when you factor in our block seats. By doing so, we are aligning capacity with the emerging demand environment and our expectations that December quarter revenue will be down 65% to 70% versus last year. Before I turn the call to Paul, I would like to just thank our entire commercial team for all they have done in managing through these extraordinary times. We all know it\u2019s been a difficult 6 months, but we feel like we are very well-positioned for where we stand and where the pandemic is. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to my good friend, Paul.\nPaul Jacobson: Thank you, Glenn. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. This morning, we reported an adjusted pre-tax loss of $2.6 billion on revenue of $2.6 billion. This quarter\u2019s results exclude one-time charges that are due to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including $2.2 billion in fleet-related charges, a $3.1 billion charge from the voluntary separation and early retirement packages, and a $1.3 billion benefit from the CARES Act grant funds. Our results this quarter were underpinned by a strong focus on costs as we reduced operating expenses by $5.5 billion or 52% similar to the decline achieved in the June quarter despite flying 23 points more capacity. We also expect our December quarter operating expenses to be approximately 50% lower year-over-year, producing a December quarter consolidated CASM that is flat to down on 40% to 45% lower capacity, a truly remarkable outcome. We have gotten here by resizing the airline by 20%. First, we had approximately 18,000 of our co-workers opt to take either a voluntary separation or early retirement package earlier this summer. In addition, we still have over 12,000 employees on a voluntary unpaid leave of absence, who will return at various times over the next 12 months. In total, the voluntary exits, the voluntary leaves, hour reductions and other employee initiatives have saved Delta over $1.9 billion in salary costs so far this year. Second, we accelerated our fleet simplification with our intention to retire our CRJ-200 fleet by 2023 and our 717 and 767-300 ER fleets by 2025. We have also reached agreement with Airbus on the restructuring of our order book. This restructuring reduces our aircraft purchase commitments by more than $2 billion in 2020 and by more than $5 billion through 2022. Our fleet actions will result in the retirement of almost 400 aircraft by 2025, including more than 200 this year alone. This will eliminate four fleet families, reducing complexity and driving meaningful cost savings in areas like maintenance and pilot training, while also producing a far better customer experience. So, while some of the cost actions we have taken this year are temporary and will come back as we rebuild the business, the changes we have made on headcount and fleet are structural. Those actions and the eventual easing of our load factor caps will allow us to bring capacity back in a measured way and it lower incremental costs providing future margin tailwinds for the business. Our strong cost focus has also allowed the increase we have seen in net sales, which is tickets purchased versus tickets refunded, to flow directly into an improvement in our daily cash burn, which improved from $27 million per day in June to $18 million per day in the month of September. Looking forward, we expect to see a progressive trend in our daily cash burn and currently expect to exit the year with an average daily cash burn of $10 million to $12 million for the December quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the September quarter with $21.6 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of only $17 billion, up $6.5 billion since the end of the December quarter 2019. During the quarter, we raised $9 billion backed by the cash flows and IP of our SkyMiles program. The financing was nearly 6x oversubscribed and priced at a blended rate of 4.75%, an amazing outcome for the largest debt offering ever by an airline. Really, really great work and amazing execution by our finance SkyMiles and legal teams all working together to get that done. With our cash burn trajectory on track to achieve breakeven by spring and a solid liquidity position, our balance sheet work has already begun. Last week, we repaid the $3 billion outstanding under our 364-day term loan due in March of next year. We also paid down $2.6 billion we had drawn on our revolvers earlier in the year and that capacity remains available in the future. We have now flattened our near-term debt maturities with $2.3 billion of obligations due through the end of 2021. Our actions also freed up more than $3 billion in collateral tied to the term loan. As a result, we now have $9 billion to $10 billion of unencumbered assets, including newer vintage aircraft. We are on track to end the year with more than $16 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of approximately $19 billion. In closing, we made significant strides over the last 6 months. However, more hard work is still ahead to ensure that we build the foundation for Delta\u2019s recovery. I am confident that with the Delta spirit and values that our employees exhibit every single day, the airline will pull through and emerge stronger and more resilient. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A.\nJill Greer: Thanks, Paul. Cassidy, we are ready for the analyst question period if you could give the instructions on how to get into the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe DeNardi of Stifel.\nJoe DeNardi: Good morning. Paul, you talked about all-in CASM being in line with 4Q \u201819 despite the lower capacity. Can you talk about what level of ASM, do you think you need to fly for ex-fuel unit costs to be in line with 2019 levels? Is it 70% of 2019 capacity? Is it 90%, is it 105%, what\u2019s the right way to think about that?\nPaul Jacobson: Yes, Joe. So we are looking at everything obviously on an all-in cost basis going forward. And I think it\u2019s important to note that we have managed to keep our total operating expenses flat - reductions flat over the last few quarters as we continue to ramp up capacity of the airline. As I mentioned in my comments, I think it\u2019s important to note that some of what we have done is obviously temporary and the balance here is making sure that we are bringing costs back at the same pace or at a measured pace with demand returning in our capacity decisions as well. Fuel price is going to be an important part of that. But as we look at where we are positioned today, fuel matters and we have got to make sure that we take that into account and the important thing is that we are flying as we said with capacity down, roughly 40% to 50% in the fourth quarter, but we don\u2019t have all of that available for sale even though we are absorbing all the costs of it. So, as we think going forward, we are positioning the airline to make sure we are all-in CASM at a reasonable level that can be absorbed as we grow capacity. And I think the team has done a good job of that.\nJoe DeNardi: Okay. And then Ed, along with the SkyMiles transaction, you provided revenue and profitability disclosures for the loyalty program, which highlighted how profitable and durable that portion of your business is, I am not seeing any of those disclosures being provided today that\u2019s something you alluded to doing at your June Investor Day pre-COVID. So my question is will you commit to starting in 2021 begin disclosing those same metrics revenue, EBITDA, cash proceeds for the loyalty program on a quarterly basis?\nEd Bastian: Well, thanks, Joe. Yes, we are continuing to improve our disclosures. I frankly haven\u2019t gotten to the 2021 disclosure list yet. We are trying to get through 2020 first, but yes, you are right, when we \u2013 when you look at the transaction and you start to get a sense for the importance of the loyalty program to not just our balance sheet, but our overall future. It\u2019s a strategic competitive advantage, one of the most important ones we have and we will do, I think continue to do a better job of giving our investor base an appreciation for that, but at the same time, we also have to be mindful of the other sensitivities around that data.\nJoe DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Hi. Good morning, everybody.\nEd Bastian: Good morning, Hunter.\nHunter Keay: Paul on the \u2013 good morning, in the fourth quarter CASM ex to flat CASM ex, how much do we need to strip out for third-party refinery sales and what\u2019s been driving that line up so much over the last couple of quarters? And then more broadly, how do we think about the overall ancillary business expense on the P&L into 2021?\nPaul Jacobson: Yes, sure. Thanks for that question, Hunter. The refinery sales, as you know, we had managed a lot of that through exchanges for jet fuel. Obviously, with jet consumption down, we have had more volatility and just the fear of third-party sales is we are not able to exchange that. So, we are managing through that going forward and we expect that will be a little bit noisy as we continue through our recovery before things normalize both in terms of capacity at the airline and then as well as production and normalization at the refinery as well. As third-party expenses go obviously, we continue to see improvement on the horizon in our MRO business we have talked about that before with the opportunities ahead of us with the Pratt and Rolls Royce agreements going forward. Obviously, there has been some noise around that in the midst of the COVID pandemic, but we will continue to see expenses related to those go up as volumes increase, but that should be really be viewed as a separate kind of independent business as we think from the cost base of the airline itself.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And then how many aircraft deliveries do you have now planned in relation to the 383 that you have coming out over that same time horizon?\nPaul Jacobson: Well, we reduced with the deal that has been announced today and the numbers in our fleet tables. We have taken out about 77 aircraft through the end of 2021 and kind of redistributed that over time as we continue to work through the impact of the pandemic.\nHunter Keay: Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. Paul, just a quick clarification, I think you said you want to end the year with about $16 billion in the liquidity, but I think you ended 3Q at about $21 billion. Can you just help us bridge that? And then maybe off that last question like how are you thinking about CapEx into 2021, please?\nPaul Jacobson: Hey, thanks, Brandon. So, the obviously the two sort of impacts here are the cash burn, which we are reducing to $10 million to $12 million a day, which is roughly a $1 billion for the quarter. We also had $3 billion that we paid down the term loan and then there is some of the residual one-time payments to employees who are under the voluntary early retirement separation programs, etcetera that will continue to pay out into the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s the reconciliation.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. And then, any view on CapEx next year?\nPaul Jacobson: I think it\u2019s too soon to tell at this point. I think what you heard in Ed\u2019s comments is that we are going to continue to focus on paying down debt as soon as we get to cash breakeven. And I think you are going to see similar discipline to what you have seen in the past that led to the balance sheet strength that we had pre-COVID. I think that\u2019s reinforced by this pandemic and we will manage CapEx accordingly.\nBrandon Oglenski: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Our\u2026\nPaul Jacobson: And just one quick follow-up, Brandon, I also failed to mention apologies, the $450 million maturity in December is also a cash reduction.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. A couple of questions for Glen. Can you remind us pre-pandemic what the top three or four types of businesses were that make up your corporate demand and maybe what percentage of total revenue they represent?\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure, sure, banking of course financial services and manufacturing and transportation.\nJamie Baker: And roughly what percentage of total revenue does that account for?\nGlen Hauenstein: Did that account for?\nJamie Baker: Yes, would that account for? Yes.\nGlen Hauenstein: This is an off the cuff number because I don\u2019t have that in my head. So, let\u2019s get back to you on that.\nJamie Baker: Okay, fair enough. And second, can you discuss the sort of the evolution of the booking curve since March? And more importantly, what do you think has to happen to the curve in order to bring Delta closer to cash breakeven and do you see any structurally permanent changes in the curve post vaccine?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think it\u2019s too early to tell what permanent changes there are in the booking curve, what we saw of course at the beginning of the pack down, there was no bookings at all and cancellations to new bookings were like 100 to 1 in favor of cancellations. And as we move through this, we saw net positive in terms of bookings that was the first gate we had to get through in the early parts and then to positive booking in the second quarter, where we are actually generating positive cash flows. And now in the third quarter, I think we are still seeing a very condensed curve, but people really willing to look further out. So, we are seeing good booking momentum for Thanksgiving and Christmas and really even into the off-peak periods in December and into early January, we are seeing more activity than we had in the last month. So, every month we move through this, we see more and more customers with more confidence booking both close in and further out and that\u2019s what we continue to need to see that development and confidence. And I think when you think of what we have done with the brand and what we have done with the seating and the cleanliness and all the protocols we have put in place, it\u2019s all about building consumer confidence, because without consumers being competent, we can\u2019t do that. So, I think we have made a lot of great progress as an industry certainly more to go. We are on a good path. And hopefully we are \u2013 while we know we are closer to the end of the pandemic than we are to the beginning, but we don\u2019t know exactly how it\u2019s going to evolve from here to the end, so stay nimble.\nJamie Baker: And if I can just squeeze in the third what stat are you looking at to determine when you lift the load factor gap or set of statistics I suppose?\nEd Bastian: Jamie, this is Ed. We haven\u2019t made that decision yet. We continue to watch it. Obviously, it\u2019s going to be conditioned on consumer sentiment and confidence in air travel. I think as each week goes by, as Glen said that confidence is improving. A lot of studies coming out from experts about the safety of air travel and sometime in the first half of next year, I have no doubt we will be lifting those gaps, but we haven\u2019t picked a date yet and I would say, we will continue to start the new year with the caps in place.\nJamie Baker: Thank you, gentlemen. Take care.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Thanks. Good morning. I think, Ed, you have said that it\u2019s not about building back to what was the building for the future although you probably put it a lot more eloquently than that. So, I was just wondering have your teams had substantial conversations with corporate customers to kind of get an idea of what the makeup and size of business travel may look like once kind of pandemic fears are behind us, especially now that customers have had a chance to see both like videoconferencing technology can and cannot deliver?\nEd Bastian: Hi, Savi. Yes, we are in frequent daily conversation with all of our corporate customers and a couple of interesting stats. Today, we have roughly 90% of our primary corporate customers who do have travelers who are traveling small numbers in many of those, but they are getting their own sense for what the new travel experiences and anecdotally they are coming back to us with really strong reviews of safety and confidence in restoring their travel spent, how video technology is going to impact long-term business travel, I am of the view that it will have some impact, but it\u2019s not going to be a substitute, it will be a complement to business travel, it won\u2019t be a substitute for business travel. I don\u2019t think anybody knows. There is lots of experts out there that put states out as to when the new normal will be achieved. My sense is that we could be looking at anywhere from 10% to 20% reduction in the next couple of years when we get to that new normal of business travel. But the one thing I will also tell you, Savi, having been in this business for a long time, every crisis that I have been part of \u2013 and it\u2019s been a lot of crises over that 20 plus years. This was the first thing that people always talked about is that business travel was the death knell to business travel and technology was going to replace the need for travel and every single time business travel has come back stronger than anyone anticipated. So, I think we are going to see that same consumer behavior, it will undoubtedly be different, but I think it\u2019s going to come stronger than most of the pundits\u2019 view.\nSavi Syth: Helpful. And then if I might ask a clarification question on the cash burn, is the kind of the improvement from what you saw in September to what you are kind of thinking that you will see in the fourth quarter is that just is that from \u2013 has to come from our revenue given most of the retirements happened in August or are there some other drivers in that improvement?\nEd Bastian: It\u2019s principally revenue.\nSavi Syth: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks for the time. So just on Savi\u2019s question there, maybe some longer term perspective from Ed or whomever, because I think you guys have been fairly thoughtful about the potential for longer term impairment in corporate and my question is, if that does play out, how will Delta offset that and work to restore its earnings power? Is this strictly a cost challenge and obviously, we have got some good news on that front in terms of what you have given us for the fourth quarter, is this strictly a cost challenge or do you think the industry can think about how it prices leisure travel differently than it has in the past?\nEd Bastian: Well, there is a lot of speculation in that question, Duane. Today, we are 20% smaller as an airline and that certainly gives us a chance to resize the demand set. What impact that will have on international is still an open question. We are very well positioned with our help structure. We feel good about that base of travel, we are really getting great comments and compliments back from our corporate customers about the travel they are doing. So share is \u2013 while small share is very, very strong and we will see I wouldn\u2019t go out to try to suggest what kind of changes certainly there will be some interesting opportunities to look at the new business around pricing and in competitive markets, but we are doing what we do here, we are playing the long game. And over the long-term I am confident that the strength of our service levels, the focus of our people on taking good care of our customers will be the most important thing of anything out there.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And maybe if I could sneak in a shorter term one just on the down 40 capacity in the fourth quarter, would you be willing to talk about the cadence by months and any early look into the first quarter? Appreciate you taking the questions.\nEd Bastian: Duane, we don\u2019t have a good enough crystal ball in this environment.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, but it does feel like it implies a bit of a pickup into November and December.\nEd Bastian: Modest, again, very, very small.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. Hey, good morning. Two quick ones here. Paul, just on CapEx \u201821 and \u201822, I think you have said at least through \u201821 you are going to take 77 more airplanes at least on a gross basis, could you give us what CapEx what a rough forecast is for at least next year?\nPaul Jacobson: I think a little bit premature to give total numbers for next year. We talked about a $5 billion reduction, but it\u2019s important to note in this environment, all of the aircraft are going to come with financing in place for that.\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nPaul Jacobson: We need to make sure obviously, we will have decisions to make as we go into 2021 depending on the balance sheet, the pace of recovery, cash, etcetera, but we have got facilities in place to be able to backstop finance those aircraft if needed.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, fair enough. And then just my second question, the headline out recently where it looks like the Brazilian regulators are going to put the Delta LatAm deal on trial. And that\u2019s of course after they approved it can you still proceed and move forward regardless of an ongoing trial, does that prevent you from doing what you want to do?\nPeter Carter: Hey, Mich, it\u2019s Peter. Good morning.\nMike Linenberg: Good morning.\nPeter Carter: A couple of things, one is our joint venture is under review with the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nPeter Carter: For that to go forward, we will need those approvals. Of course, we do have code share agreements with them, which are ongoing. And we do expect, we do anticipate that the Brazilian tribunal will approve the transaction. This is just the second look.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, very good. Thanks for that, Peter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker of Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks. Thank you very much, operator. Hi, everybody and thank you for the time. It\u2019s completely unrelated to things that we have been talking about. You guys had an open pilot contract prior to COVID starting and I am just wondering if the negotiations that you are undertaking prior to November 1 include a stage to that contract or if that\u2019s just on hold?\nEd Bastian: Helane, we are not going to talk about negotiations publicly. But what I can tell you is that the focus is trying to find a way to eliminate the need to furlough 1,700 junior pilots, and we have given ALPHA, the union a lot of different options. And I am hopeful we can reach resolution, but I am not trying to suggest or forecast that.\nHelane Becker: I understand that, just understanding that the main part of the contract is on hold until we get through this part. Is that right?\nEd Bastian: I would say that\u2019s a fair observation.\nHelane Becker: Okay, good. And then my other completely unrelated question is on the airport construction acceleration and all the other stuff that you are doing, which obviously will help improve customer experience as we come out of this? Can you just talk about some of those things? Are there thermal camera imaging going into place? Are there testing centers for COVID or other things? How is the airport going to look going forward and how should we think about the cost associated with landing fees changing next year if you are smaller and everyone else was smaller I guess we should think landing fees going up, is that true?\nEd Bastian: Well, you asked a lot of questions in there. Our main focus is to take advantage of the reduced volume of travel to accelerate progress and getting our new facilities filled in LaGuardia, LAX Seattle, which has opened up to brand new Salt Lake City airport, which is magnificent. Hopefully, you all get a chance to get out there and see it sometime soon. And that\u2019s been the single biggest focus, yes, we are working on particularly for international travel pilots by which we can start to open up lanes of international travel, which I believe will testing will be an important ingredient to getting there and working with airport authorities as to how we would administer that we are working both there and here in the U.S. as well as overseas working with those authorities, working with the CDC in very close contact. So, I don\u2019t foresee them having big structural changes. I don\u2019t see testing being conducted, for example, on a U.S. basis before people fly, it could see it for international. Relative to thermal and temp screening, we have asked TSA repeatedly to take that over as part of their screening services and right now we have been unable to convince them of that. So, I know a few airports are working on that, but again, I don\u2019t see that being a meaningful change to the airport infrastructure.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nEd Bastian: And your question on landing fees, I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I think our airports have done a very good job of minimizing their own cost and taking advantage of where they have received some government support using that to reduce cost, but \u201821 is an open question.\nHelane Becker: Got it. Okay, thanks for your help.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Vernon of Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. So, Paul, first question on the balance sheet, can you tell us kind of what the maturities look like over the next 24 months? If we end the year at $15 billion, $16 billion, is there anything that\u2019s going to be coming due and is there any flexibility in renegotiating?\nPaul Jacobson: Yes, we \u2013 thanks, David. We have done a lot of that work today. So the biggest maturities that we have we will get a $450 million unsecured maturity in December that I referenced earlier. We have a $600 million unsecured maturity in April. Previously, we had already pushed out our revolver into 2022 and we have got primarily just beyond those two amortization payments now that we have paid off that bridge loan. So, I think it\u2019s very manageable under $2 billion over the next kind of 15 to 18 months.\nDavid Vernon: Alright, thank you for that. And then, Ed, maybe on the topic of testing, we have been looking at that quite a bit. And I am wondering what your perspective is on timing for when you think either through testing with partners or testing with international other \u2013 international entities when you might start to think that the quarters of international travel may start to open up? Is that something that we should be thinking about in the next sort of 3 months, 6 months, 9 months like how are you thinking about that in general?\nEd Bastian: Well, we are laying down that we are laying the tracks to create the testing environment obviously the advancement in the development of rapid tests are key to that, not only in terms of a fairly quick turnaround, but also a relatively low cost. As you know, the U.S. government has already acquired large supplies in advance of that. So, we are talking to the government about that. But I think when you try to put a timeline on it, one of the big wildcards is how the virus is doing both here in the U.S. as well as in other countries, because the goal in all this is to eliminate the need to quarantine when you get to your destination. And as we see going on in Europe right now we are seeing another wave of the virus starting to spike across Europe and that is of concern to the local authorities. Certainly, they are concerned likewise here as to seeing rising case counts in the U.S. So, I\u2019d say that your timing has more to do with the state of the virus and the medical containment of it than it does any specific strategy that we could deploy to make certain to everybody stay safe, because the goal in this is that we want to eliminate quarantines.\nDavid Vernon: And would there be some work you would need to do to kind of integrate some of the rapid tests and the QR codes and things like that into the boarding process or is that stuff you guys have already figured out?\nEd Bastian: We are looking at how you could deploy rapid testing as part of the check-in and boarding process, yes.\nDavid Vernon: Thanks very much, guys.\nEd Bastian: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Caiado of Credit Suisse.\nJoe Caiado: Hey, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick one first, can you comment on the trends in American Express card spend in the third quarter, just how that compared with the second quarter? And to the extent you can comment on it, how that\u2019s trending here in the fourth quarter month-to-date?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, we don\u2019t give specifics on it. I would say the trends have been improving. I think we disclosed that we were down about 20%. And so we have seen that 20% come back up and most encouragingly, we have watched the T&E lines within the card and their progression. And at the worst of the crisis, the airline spend was actually a negative number, it was minus 103% and we have seen that consistently move up and now we are down in the low 70s. So, that\u2019s another exciting sign for us. Not only is the total spend improving, but the spend on airlines itself is improving dramatically. So, I think that\u2019s about all the color we can share.\nJoe Caiado: That\u2019s great. I appreciate that, Glen. And then just maybe another quick one, for Paul, I think you have previously talked about sort of the base level of investment just to maintain the business. So maintenance non-aircraft CapEx is being maybe $500 million to $700 million a year. Obviously, you took that pretty much to zero this year, but that\u2019s obviously not sustainable long-term. My question is just given all the structural cost reduction efforts across the enterprise, is that still roughly the ballpark for run-rate maintenance CapEx 2 or 3 years out or is that run rate number now lower as well?\nPaul Jacobson: Well, I think certainly we are 20% smaller than we were before. So, I would argue that it\u2019s probably a little bit lower than what it\u2019s been, but a lot of this is going to be timing and we see this in terms of what we are doing across the fleet and really kind of optimizing, but we are not missing out on the opportunity to accelerate where we can, particularly in technology and that space and the facilities that we have already mentioned. So, I think that probably $500 million is a good range, but I expect that we are going to want to drive the airline to better cash performance to enable us to invest more. And that\u2019s really the message here is that, we have got to continue to invest within our means, while we have the additional goal now of paying down a substantial amount of debt over the coming years and through the recovery.\nJoe Caiado: Understood. Thanks, Paul. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Didora of Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. Paul, as you get through the crisis and you implement your fleet simplification plan, what kind of unit cost savings can this give you say versus 2019? And is there anything that you are willing to share about where you would like your unit cost structure to be as the industry returns to a more normalized trend?\nPaul Jacobson: Yes, thanks for that question, Andrew and we haven\u2019t given any specifics on the unit costs around that. But when you look at the gauging potential, the fuel efficiency, the simplification of all overhead functions, around training, around maintenance, tooling etcetera, we have previously said as part of our Investor Day that it was worth billions of dollars a year as we complete that. What we have been able to do is as to-date probably accelerate that timeline by more than 5 years against where we thought we were going to be pre-COVID. So, I think as we position the airline going forward, there is no doubt that we are very, very focused on keeping CASM below pre-COVID levels. I think the jury is out as to how effective we can do that based on how demand returns and how CASM come or how capacity comes back. But I think the early returns based on what we are able to \u2013 what we think we are going to be able to do in the December quarter is going to be a pretty good early indication of our focus working in the right direction.\nAndrew Didora: That\u2019s great. Thank you. And then, just sort of a near-term modeling question, when I just look at your peer salaries and wages line item, it\u2019s been at about $2 billion in the last two quarters. Do you think that\u2019s a good baseline to work off of going forward here or can you get that down a little bit more with some further workforce actions? Thanks.\nPaul Jacobson: Well, I think, Andrew, as we have talked about, we are currently not anticipating any furloughs of ground and flight attendant employees. And with the leads that we have taken, we are approaching a pretty good run rate on where we would expect to be going forward. So beyond the actions that we have already announced and potentially a transaction with the pilots or managing to get that cost out, there\u2019s a little bit more to go. But I think largely, we have done what we needed to do to date.\nAndrew Didora: Okay, great. Thank you.\nJill Greer: And Cassidy, we are going to have time for one more question from the analysts.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Myles Walton of UBS.\nMyles Walton: I know probably a little premature question, but thinking about the long game, Ed, with the Airbus delivery schedule cleaned up, retirement plans set through \u201825, is now the right time for opportunistic overtures to Boeing for thinking about an order, given the pro forma fleet in that out-year still 40% Boeing, but obviously, your order book there is still essentially zero?\nEd Bastian: Hey, Myles, I get asked that question by the press all the time. And I will give you my standard response is that we talk to the OEMs about all aircraft all the time and always looking for opportunities. So I don\u2019t have anything to report on that, but you can be rest assured that we are always looking for opportunities where we are able to advance Delta.\nMyles Walton: Is there a reason for the 2025 dating of the retirement plan for the 67 and 17s in particular?\nEd Bastian: No, it\u2019s just a convenient 5-year interval. Obviously, there will be more retirements, post \u201825, but it\u2019s \u2013 we figured 5 years is a pretty long look given what we have been through this year.\nMyles Walton: Okay, thanks.\nEd Bastian: Sure.\nJill Greer: And that\u2019s going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer.\nTim Mapes: In addition to welcoming all the members of the media to the call in the few moments that we have here, Cassidy, if you wouldn\u2019t mind just reiterating the instructions for each of them to enter the queue.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Tracy Rucinski from Reuters.\nTracy Rucinski: [Technical Difficulty] that was repaid by GOL and how much\u2026\nOperator: And Ms. Rucinski, if you don\u2019t mind just repeating yourself, we are now able to hear you.\nTracy Rucinski: Sure. So about the Brazil GOL\u2019s loan that was refinanced last month, can you tell us how much was repaid by GOL and how much is outstanding and refinanced?\nPaul Jacobson: Hey, good morning, Tracy, this is Paul. So we had a \u2013 we didn\u2019t actually have a loan to GOL. We had a $300 million guarantee. And what we did was restructured that guarantee and lent them $250 million. And we have got amortization payments that are required, and they are current with that loan. So that\u2019s where it currently sits.\nTracy Rucinski: Okay. And then, just given your strong liquidity position now, are you planning to inject any cash into LatAm or Aeromexico?\nEd Bastian: We have no plans at the present, Tracy. We need to get through our own crisis here first.\nTracy Rucinski: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: Hi, thank you, and I was wondering if you could just tell us anything about kind of what you are seeing or where things may stand in Washington over Atox. We have seen a lot of your peers, other top airline executives spending a lot of time in Washington and pushing for more aid and at least publicly, haven\u2019t seen you there as much and wondering why that is?\nEd Bastian: Well, we certainly support the extension of the CARES Act 2 as it\u2019s been labeled for PSP for airline workers. And I certainly hope given the strong bipartisan support that exists that a vehicle for that extension can be found here soon to be able to bring 32,000 airline industry employees back to work. We are fortunate we haven\u2019t had to furlough anyone yet to this juncture. I do want to acknowledge the great work of the Delta team in making a real difference. We are not facing furloughs in any work group with the lone exception of the pilots. We still have an overstaff situation where we are trying to work with the union on, but every other workgroup within Delta, we have been able to manage to mitigate it through all the voluntary leaves, 40,000 people taking unpaid leaves throughout the summer. 20% of our employees have opted to early retire. We have had reduced hours and work schedules, shared jobs. It\u2019s been incredible. And excluding the pilots for the moment out of the labor cost, we have been able to save 40% of our employee costs over the last 6 months as a result, which is eliminate the need to undergo furlough. So, that\u2019s my view on that. Where this goes, I have no idea. It seems to change by the day, if not many times within the day. We are still hopeful something will happen.\nAlison Sider: Okay. I guess you see it as less of a priority for Delta then sort of given your success getting labor costs down in other ways?\nEd Bastian: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s less of a priority for Delta. I think that with the large numbers of furloughs that are at other airlines, it\u2019s a heightened priority there, but we would be pleased to see that extension given to all the industry. However, the industry and everyone within the industry has managed the crisis a bit differently. The reality is the virus is not at the level of containment that we all thought it would be when the first grant was issued and we will all need additional time to get our businesses in a better spot over to get ready for next year.\nAlison Sider: Thanks.\nTim Mapes: Cassidy, we need to get Ed and the members of the leadership team to an employee town hall, but we have time for one final question, please.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Leslie Josephs of CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Good morning, everybody. Just a quick question on the loyalty program, you said you are seeing spending \u2013 you expect spending to increase in the fourth quarter. Do you have any detail about where you expect spending to go in the first and second quarter and how that could contribute to you breaking even or you can go into cash flow positive?\nEd Bastian: Well, clearly, the loyalty program and the American Express deal have been great advantages for us through this pandemic. We have seen continued spend improvement through the second, third and now fourth quarter. And I think it\u2019s too early for us to go out and say that what Christmas will be like or what the post-Christmas spend will be, but the trends that we have seen today are very encouraging. I think a lot of that also has to do with does a stimulus bill gets passed either in November or in January. So, there are a lot of factors that weigh into how people spend on those cards, but I would say we have been very encouraged by the trends we have seen.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. And would that contribute to you going cash flow breakeven or cash flow positive? Do you know as to what degree or what the market is on it?\nEd Bastian: No, we are not going to disclose that, but it\u2019s a significant contribution.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. Thanks very much.\nTim Mapes: Great, Cassidy. Thank you very much, everyone. Appreciate everyone\u2019s time. We will look forward to speaking with everyone in January.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Glen Hauenstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. Since we last spoke in July, we have seen a steady progression in demand. This has resulted in our net cash sales improving from $5 million to $10 million per day at the beginning of the quarter to approximately $25 million to $30 million per day at the end of the quarter. That said, demand strength varied in different regions and segments of our business. Corporate demand has shown signs of modest improvement. And while the volume of corporate travel at the end of the quarter was 15% of last year's levels, corporate volumes are trending upward across all industries and we expect this to continue into 2021. Apart from the Caribbean and Mexico, international demand remains weak. This is largely due to government imposed restrictions in key markets. In the U.S., we have seen demand recover to 35% to 40% of pre-pandemic levels, with strength in leisure markets like Florida, the Mountain West and the beach destinations. However, cities that are under quarantine requirements like New York and Boston are recovering more slowly and are now just above 20% of pre-pandemic levels. As we approach the holiday travel period, we have been pleased with the recent booking trends for Thanksgiving and Christmas, which show that customers continue to gain confidence in booking further out. Our non-ticket businesses had held up relatively well during the quarter with both loyalty revenue and cargo outperforming passenger revenues. The strength in our loyalty revenue stream is in large part due to the spend on the Delta co-brand card. American Express has stated that the spend on our co-branded card has held better than other AmEx cards. We recently launched a card acquisition campaign after putting those efforts on hold and have had excellent response to this offering. This, in combination with spend trends that AmEx has seen suggests that our customers' aspirations to travel remain intact. As Ed mentioned, we focused on making sure Delta is well-positioned for a future recovery. We have been accelerating redevelopment projects in our airports and we were excited to open Concourse 8 in Salt Lake City. This was the first new U.S. hub airport to open in 20 years. In New York and Los Angeles, we are taking years out of our construction timelines, getting our customers a faster path to a better terminal experience, while also lowering our construction costs. I would like to call out our properties and facilities team for the excellent work they have been doing across the network on accelerating all of our airport projects. We have made it easier for customers to do business with Delta, eliminating most domestic change fees, extending Medallion and SkyClub benefits and refunding approximately $2.8 billion back to our customers so far this year. We are also rebuilding the network by leveraging our strength, focusing on connecting customers through our core hubs and adding capacity to coastal hubs only as demand returns. In the domestic network, 80% of our current capacity is on our core hubs of Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis and Salt Lake City. And in those subs, we are using our most cost efficient, highest gauge equipment as we retire less efficient aircraft. Internationally, a majority of our long-haul capacity is in our JV partner hubs where we are able to efficiently connect traffic. Similar to the domestic entity we are moving towards using our most cost efficient wide-body aircraft in our international operations by leveraging the A330s and the A350s and eliminating the subscale 777 fleets and sun-setting the 767-300 ERs. While the longer network rebuild is underway, we are also technically managing the network in the near-term. We are increasing capacity around the peak leisure holiday periods like Thanksgiving and Christmas, while reducing it during off-peak periods like Halloween and the election week. This approach will result in our December quarter capacity being 40% to 45% lower year-on-year or approximately 60% lower when you factor in our block seats. By doing so, we are aligning capacity with the emerging demand environment and our expectations that December quarter revenue will be down 65% to 70% versus last year. Before I turn the call to Paul, I would like to just thank our entire commercial team for all they have done in managing through these extraordinary times. We all know it's been a difficult 6 months, but we feel like we are very well-positioned for where we stand and where the pandemic is. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to my good friend, Paul. Sure, sure, banking of course financial services and manufacturing and transportation. Did that account for? This is an off the cuff number because I don't have that in my head. So, let's get back to you on that. I think it's too early to tell what permanent changes there are in the booking curve, what we saw of course at the beginning of the pack down, there was no bookings at all and cancellations to new bookings were like 100 to 1 in favor of cancellations. And as we move through this, we saw net positive in terms of bookings that was the first gate we had to get through in the early parts and then to positive booking in the second quarter, where we are actually generating positive cash flows. And now in the third quarter, I think we are still seeing a very condensed curve, but people really willing to look further out. So, we are seeing good booking momentum for Thanksgiving and Christmas and really even into the off-peak periods in December and into early January, we are seeing more activity than we had in the last month. So, every month we move through this, we see more and more customers with more confidence booking both close in and further out and that's what we continue to need to see that development and confidence. And I think when you think of what we have done with the brand and what we have done with the seating and the cleanliness and all the protocols we have put in place, it's all about building consumer confidence, because without consumers being competent, we can't do that. So, I think we have made a lot of great progress as an industry certainly more to go. We are on a good path. And hopefully we are \u2013 while we know we are closer to the end of the pandemic than we are to the beginning, but we don't know exactly how it's going to evolve from here to the end, so stay nimble. Well, we don't give specifics on it. I would say the trends have been improving. I think we disclosed that we were down about 20%. And so we have seen that 20% come back up and most encouragingly, we have watched the T&E lines within the card and their progression. And at the worst of the crisis, the airline spend was actually a negative number, it was minus 103% and we have seen that consistently move up and now we are down in the low 70s. So, that's another exciting sign for us. Not only is the total spend improving, but the spend on airlines itself is improving dramatically. So, I think that's about all the color we can share."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Paul Jacobson",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. This morning, we reported an adjusted pre-tax loss of $2.6 billion on revenue of $2.6 billion. This quarter's results exclude one-time charges that are due to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including $2.2 billion in fleet-related charges, a $3.1 billion charge from the voluntary separation and early retirement packages, and a $1.3 billion benefit from the CARES Act grant funds. Our results this quarter were underpinned by a strong focus on costs as we reduced operating expenses by $5.5 billion or 52% similar to the decline achieved in the June quarter despite flying 23 points more capacity. We also expect our December quarter operating expenses to be approximately 50% lower year-over-year, producing a December quarter consolidated CASM that is flat to down on 40% to 45% lower capacity, a truly remarkable outcome. We have gotten here by resizing the airline by 20%. First, we had approximately 18,000 of our co-workers opt to take either a voluntary separation or early retirement package earlier this summer. In addition, we still have over 12,000 employees on a voluntary unpaid leave of absence, who will return at various times over the next 12 months. In total, the voluntary exits, the voluntary leaves, hour reductions and other employee initiatives have saved Delta over $1.9 billion in salary costs so far this year. Second, we accelerated our fleet simplification with our intention to retire our CRJ-200 fleet by 2023 and our 717 and 767-300 ER fleets by 2025. We have also reached agreement with Airbus on the restructuring of our order book. This restructuring reduces our aircraft purchase commitments by more than $2 billion in 2020 and by more than $5 billion through 2022. Our fleet actions will result in the retirement of almost 400 aircraft by 2025, including more than 200 this year alone. This will eliminate four fleet families, reducing complexity and driving meaningful cost savings in areas like maintenance and pilot training, while also producing a far better customer experience. So, while some of the cost actions we have taken this year are temporary and will come back as we rebuild the business, the changes we have made on headcount and fleet are structural. Those actions and the eventual easing of our load factor caps will allow us to bring capacity back in a measured way and it lower incremental costs providing future margin tailwinds for the business. Our strong cost focus has also allowed the increase we have seen in net sales, which is tickets purchased versus tickets refunded, to flow directly into an improvement in our daily cash burn, which improved from $27 million per day in June to $18 million per day in the month of September. Looking forward, we expect to see a progressive trend in our daily cash burn and currently expect to exit the year with an average daily cash burn of $10 million to $12 million for the December quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the September quarter with $21.6 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of only $17 billion, up $6.5 billion since the end of the December quarter 2019. During the quarter, we raised $9 billion backed by the cash flows and IP of our SkyMiles program. The financing was nearly 6x oversubscribed and priced at a blended rate of 4.75%, an amazing outcome for the largest debt offering ever by an airline. Really, really great work and amazing execution by our finance SkyMiles and legal teams all working together to get that done. With our cash burn trajectory on track to achieve breakeven by spring and a solid liquidity position, our balance sheet work has already begun. Last week, we repaid the $3 billion outstanding under our 364-day term loan due in March of next year. We also paid down $2.6 billion we had drawn on our revolvers earlier in the year and that capacity remains available in the future. We have now flattened our near-term debt maturities with $2.3 billion of obligations due through the end of 2021. Our actions also freed up more than $3 billion in collateral tied to the term loan. As a result, we now have $9 billion to $10 billion of unencumbered assets, including newer vintage aircraft. We are on track to end the year with more than $16 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of approximately $19 billion. In closing, we made significant strides over the last 6 months. However, more hard work is still ahead to ensure that we build the foundation for Delta's recovery. I am confident that with the Delta spirit and values that our employees exhibit every single day, the airline will pull through and emerge stronger and more resilient. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Yes, Joe. So we are looking at everything obviously on an all-in cost basis going forward. And I think it's important to note that we have managed to keep our total operating expenses flat - reductions flat over the last few quarters as we continue to ramp up capacity of the airline. As I mentioned in my comments, I think it's important to note that some of what we have done is obviously temporary and the balance here is making sure that we are bringing costs back at the same pace or at a measured pace with demand returning in our capacity decisions as well. Fuel price is going to be an important part of that. But as we look at where we are positioned today, fuel matters and we have got to make sure that we take that into account and the important thing is that we are flying as we said with capacity down, roughly 40% to 50% in the fourth quarter, but we don't have all of that available for sale even though we are absorbing all the costs of it. So, as we think going forward, we are positioning the airline to make sure we are all-in CASM at a reasonable level that can be absorbed as we grow capacity. And I think the team has done a good job of that. Yes, sure. Thanks for that question, Hunter. The refinery sales, as you know, we had managed a lot of that through exchanges for jet fuel. Obviously, with jet consumption down, we have had more volatility and just the fear of third-party sales is we are not able to exchange that. So, we are managing through that going forward and we expect that will be a little bit noisy as we continue through our recovery before things normalize both in terms of capacity at the airline and then as well as production and normalization at the refinery as well. As third-party expenses go obviously, we continue to see improvement on the horizon in our MRO business we have talked about that before with the opportunities ahead of us with the Pratt and Rolls Royce agreements going forward. Obviously, there has been some noise around that in the midst of the COVID pandemic, but we will continue to see expenses related to those go up as volumes increase, but that should be really be viewed as a separate kind of independent business as we think from the cost base of the airline itself. Well, we reduced with the deal that has been announced today and the numbers in our fleet tables. We have taken out about 77 aircraft through the end of 2021 and kind of redistributed that over time as we continue to work through the impact of the pandemic. Hey, thanks, Brandon. So, the obviously the two sort of impacts here are the cash burn, which we are reducing to $10 million to $12 million a day, which is roughly a $1 billion for the quarter. We also had $3 billion that we paid down the term loan and then there is some of the residual one-time payments to employees who are under the voluntary early retirement separation programs, etcetera that will continue to pay out into the fourth quarter. So, that's the reconciliation. I think it's too soon to tell at this point. I think what you heard in Ed's comments is that we are going to continue to focus on paying down debt as soon as we get to cash breakeven. And I think you are going to see similar discipline to what you have seen in the past that led to the balance sheet strength that we had pre-COVID. I think that's reinforced by this pandemic and we will manage CapEx accordingly. And just one quick follow-up, Brandon, I also failed to mention apologies, the $450 million maturity in December is also a cash reduction. I think a little bit premature to give total numbers for next year. We talked about a $5 billion reduction, but it's important to note in this environment, all of the aircraft are going to come with financing in place for that. We need to make sure obviously, we will have decisions to make as we go into 2021 depending on the balance sheet, the pace of recovery, cash, etcetera, but we have got facilities in place to be able to backstop finance those aircraft if needed. Yes, we \u2013 thanks, David. We have done a lot of that work today. So the biggest maturities that we have we will get a $450 million unsecured maturity in December that I referenced earlier. We have a $600 million unsecured maturity in April. Previously, we had already pushed out our revolver into 2022 and we have got primarily just beyond those two amortization payments now that we have paid off that bridge loan. So, I think it's very manageable under $2 billion over the next kind of 15 to 18 months. Well, I think certainly we are 20% smaller than we were before. So, I would argue that it's probably a little bit lower than what it's been, but a lot of this is going to be timing and we see this in terms of what we are doing across the fleet and really kind of optimizing, but we are not missing out on the opportunity to accelerate where we can, particularly in technology and that space and the facilities that we have already mentioned. So, I think that probably $500 million is a good range, but I expect that we are going to want to drive the airline to better cash performance to enable us to invest more. And that's really the message here is that, we have got to continue to invest within our means, while we have the additional goal now of paying down a substantial amount of debt over the coming years and through the recovery. Yes, thanks for that question, Andrew and we haven't given any specifics on the unit costs around that. But when you look at the gauging potential, the fuel efficiency, the simplification of all overhead functions, around training, around maintenance, tooling etcetera, we have previously said as part of our Investor Day that it was worth billions of dollars a year as we complete that. What we have been able to do is as to-date probably accelerate that timeline by more than 5 years against where we thought we were going to be pre-COVID. So, I think as we position the airline going forward, there is no doubt that we are very, very focused on keeping CASM below pre-COVID levels. I think the jury is out as to how effective we can do that based on how demand returns and how CASM come or how capacity comes back. But I think the early returns based on what we are able to \u2013 what we think we are going to be able to do in the December quarter is going to be a pretty good early indication of our focus working in the right direction. Well, I think, Andrew, as we have talked about, we are currently not anticipating any furloughs of ground and flight attendant employees. And with the leads that we have taken, we are approaching a pretty good run rate on where we would expect to be going forward. So beyond the actions that we have already announced and potentially a transaction with the pilots or managing to get that cost out, there's a little bit more to go. But I think largely, we have done what we needed to do to date. Hey, good morning, Tracy, this is Paul. So we had a \u2013 we didn't actually have a loan to GOL. We had a $300 million guarantee. And what we did was restructured that guarantee and lent them $250 million. And we have got amortization payments that are required, and they are current with that loan. So that's where it currently sits."

            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining us today. This morning, we reported a $2.6 billion adjusted pre-tax loss on a 79% decline in revenues for the September quarter. We ended the quarter with over $21 billion in liquidity, having brought our cash burn down to $18 million per day in the month of September. And while we still have a long road ahead of us when you look through the large toll that the pandemic has taken, we are showing progressive improvement across the business, performing well on factors within our control and ensuring the company is well positioned as demand starts to return. And there are signs that customers are becoming increasingly confident in returning to air travel, with TSA counts growing each week. But we are still running at a fraction of our normal capacity and expect that our December quarter revenues will be 30% to 35% of what we saw a year ago. Put that improvement in context, our revenues bottomed out in the second quarter at only 10% of prior year levels. We are at 21% of prior year levels in the third quarter and we expect them to be roughly one-third of prior year levels in the fourth quarter. Steady improvement, as Q4 is expected to generate 3x the revenue of Q2, but still a long way to go. To see a meaningful step up in demand from here, we will need business travel to further improve, local quarantines to end, and international restrictions to lift, that will only come with widespread advances by the medical community and offices reopening, which many expect will start to happen in the first half of next year. As we all know, the path to revenue recovery is dependent on demand returning at scale. Until then, our focus is on doing a great job at what we can control, taking great care of our people and our customers, protecting our liquidity and managing our cost performance. For our customers, we continue to emphasize safety and health with the Delta CareStandard, our multi-layered approach that includes intense cleaning protocols, blocking middle seats, and requiring masks onboard our planes. According to IATA, with over 1 billion air travelers worldwide in 2020, there have only been 44 documented cases of suspected COVID transmission onboard an aircraft and virtually all of them were in the early months of the pandemic before masks and revised safety protocols came into existence. We carry at Delta over 1 million people a week and have had no documented transmission onboard any of our aircraft. The Delta CareStandard works and it's keeping our customers and our employees safe. And as a result, customers are increasingly becoming comfortable returning to the [air] [ph]. Our customer-focused approach is producing record net promoter scores, which reached 75 in September, which is up a staggering 22 points over the prior year levels. This is a testament to the Delta people who have continued to shine throughout this historic crisis, by restoring customers' confidence in travel and investing in their long-term loyalty and trust, we are creating a path to sustainable revenue growth in the future, but we do believe it could still be 2 years or more until we achieve a normalized revenue environment. Until then, we will be smaller in the short-term, but also more agile and more efficient. Today, we are already 20% smaller than we were at the start of this year, having reduced our fleet, our headcount and our overhead. These were difficult, but essential decisions that positioned Delta to emerge as a more resilient airline. We have resized our ground and flight attendant workforces by 20%. I am grateful to all those employees for the sacrifices from those taking early retirement decisions to the 40,000 staff who took unpaid voluntary leaves throughout the pandemic and thus reducing our labor cost for non-pilot groups by more than 40% over the past 6 months. This was the driving factor that allowed us to avoid furloughs and protect their jobs. We are still working with ALPA and hopefully we can achieve that same result with our pilots, but if not, we will be furloughing roughly 1,700 pilots on the 1st of November. We have reduced our fleet by retiring more than 200 aircraft this year and accelerated our fleet simplification to retire nearly 30% of our fleet or 400 aircraft by 2025 along with our revised Airbus order book. This cuts years off the timeline to achieving a higher engaged fleet with lower seat cost and a better customer experience. By making these structural changes to our cost base in this constrained environment, we will have significant cost and margin tailwind ahead of us as higher yielding business travel does return and our load factor [CAS] [ph] begin to ease and we are seeing early signs of our cost efficiency steps paying off as our fourth quarter all-in CASM is projected to be roughly flat despite a 40% reduction in capacity year-over-year, some incredible results and creates nice momentum heading into \u201821. The challenges of this year have reinforced our belief in the importance of investment grade balance sheet and our top financial priority will be to regain that as soon as possible. The first step in that process is getting back to breakeven cash flow. We had initially helped to be there by the end of this year, but as the virus has had greater impact on our business than expected that goal has shifted a few months. We expect to average a daily cash burn rate of $10 million per day in the December month with good line of sight to positive cash flow by the spring. Once we achieve that milestone, we will have a heightened focused on paying down debt. Putting all this good work into perspective, it's been about positioning Delta to accelerate into a post-COVID recovery. Do we know exactly when that recovery will happen or what it will look like? No. But by taking out complexity, simplifying our cost structure, improving our products and service levels now and maintaining strong employee morale in the face of this challenging time, we do know that we will be even more customer focused with a stronger brand and a solid financial foundation. And with that, we will be well-positioned to adapt and to win. Now, I will turn the call over to Glenn. Well, thanks, Joe. Yes, we are continuing to improve our disclosures. I frankly haven't gotten to the 2021 disclosure list yet. We are trying to get through 2020 first, but yes, you are right, when we \u2013 when you look at the transaction and you start to get a sense for the importance of the loyalty program to not just our balance sheet, but our overall future. It's a strategic competitive advantage, one of the most important ones we have and we will do, I think continue to do a better job of giving our investor base an appreciation for that, but at the same time, we also have to be mindful of the other sensitivities around that data. Good morning, Hunter. Jamie, this is Ed. We haven't made that decision yet. We continue to watch it. Obviously, it's going to be conditioned on consumer sentiment and confidence in air travel. I think as each week goes by, as Glen said that confidence is improving. A lot of studies coming out from experts about the safety of air travel and sometime in the first half of next year, I have no doubt we will be lifting those gaps, but we haven't picked a date yet and I would say, we will continue to start the new year with the caps in place. Hi, Savi. Yes, we are in frequent daily conversation with all of our corporate customers and a couple of interesting stats. Today, we have roughly 90% of our primary corporate customers who do have travelers who are traveling small numbers in many of those, but they are getting their own sense for what the new travel experiences and anecdotally they are coming back to us with really strong reviews of safety and confidence in restoring their travel spent, how video technology is going to impact long-term business travel, I am of the view that it will have some impact, but it's not going to be a substitute, it will be a complement to business travel, it won't be a substitute for business travel. I don't think anybody knows. There is lots of experts out there that put states out as to when the new normal will be achieved. My sense is that we could be looking at anywhere from 10% to 20% reduction in the next couple of years when we get to that new normal of business travel. But the one thing I will also tell you, Savi, having been in this business for a long time, every crisis that I have been part of \u2013 and it's been a lot of crises over that 20 plus years. This was the first thing that people always talked about is that business travel was the death knell to business travel and technology was going to replace the need for travel and every single time business travel has come back stronger than anyone anticipated. So, I think we are going to see that same consumer behavior, it will undoubtedly be different, but I think it's going to come stronger than most of the pundits' view. It's principally revenue. Well, there is a lot of speculation in that question, Duane. Today, we are 20% smaller as an airline and that certainly gives us a chance to resize the demand set. What impact that will have on international is still an open question. We are very well positioned with our help structure. We feel good about that base of travel, we are really getting great comments and compliments back from our corporate customers about the travel they are doing. So share is \u2013 while small share is very, very strong and we will see I wouldn't go out to try to suggest what kind of changes certainly there will be some interesting opportunities to look at the new business around pricing and in competitive markets, but we are doing what we do here, we are playing the long game. And over the long-term I am confident that the strength of our service levels, the focus of our people on taking good care of our customers will be the most important thing of anything out there. Duane, we don't have a good enough crystal ball in this environment. Modest, again, very, very small. Helane, we are not going to talk about negotiations publicly. But what I can tell you is that the focus is trying to find a way to eliminate the need to furlough 1,700 junior pilots, and we have given ALPHA, the union a lot of different options. And I am hopeful we can reach resolution, but I am not trying to suggest or forecast that. I would say that's a fair observation. Well, you asked a lot of questions in there. Our main focus is to take advantage of the reduced volume of travel to accelerate progress and getting our new facilities filled in LaGuardia, LAX Seattle, which has opened up to brand new Salt Lake City airport, which is magnificent. Hopefully, you all get a chance to get out there and see it sometime soon. And that's been the single biggest focus, yes, we are working on particularly for international travel pilots by which we can start to open up lanes of international travel, which I believe will testing will be an important ingredient to getting there and working with airport authorities as to how we would administer that we are working both there and here in the U.S. as well as overseas working with those authorities, working with the CDC in very close contact. So, I don't foresee them having big structural changes. I don't see testing being conducted, for example, on a U.S. basis before people fly, it could see it for international. Relative to thermal and temp screening, we have asked TSA repeatedly to take that over as part of their screening services and right now we have been unable to convince them of that. So, I know a few airports are working on that, but again, I don't see that being a meaningful change to the airport infrastructure. And your question on landing fees, I can't \u2013 I don't know, I think our airports have done a very good job of minimizing their own cost and taking advantage of where they have received some government support using that to reduce cost, but \u201821 is an open question. Well, we are laying down that we are laying the tracks to create the testing environment obviously the advancement in the development of rapid tests are key to that, not only in terms of a fairly quick turnaround, but also a relatively low cost. As you know, the U.S. government has already acquired large supplies in advance of that. So, we are talking to the government about that. But I think when you try to put a timeline on it, one of the big wildcards is how the virus is doing both here in the U.S. as well as in other countries, because the goal in all this is to eliminate the need to quarantine when you get to your destination. And as we see going on in Europe right now we are seeing another wave of the virus starting to spike across Europe and that is of concern to the local authorities. Certainly, they are concerned likewise here as to seeing rising case counts in the U.S. So, I'd say that your timing has more to do with the state of the virus and the medical containment of it than it does any specific strategy that we could deploy to make certain to everybody stay safe, because the goal in this is that we want to eliminate quarantines. We are looking at how you could deploy rapid testing as part of the check-in and boarding process, yes. Thanks, David. Hey, Myles, I get asked that question by the press all the time. And I will give you my standard response is that we talk to the OEMs about all aircraft all the time and always looking for opportunities. So I don't have anything to report on that, but you can be rest assured that we are always looking for opportunities where we are able to advance Delta. No, it's just a convenient 5-year interval. Obviously, there will be more retirements, post \u201825, but it's \u2013 we figured 5 years is a pretty long look given what we have been through this year. Sure. We have no plans at the present, Tracy. We need to get through our own crisis here first. Well, we certainly support the extension of the CARES Act 2 as it's been labeled for PSP for airline workers. And I certainly hope given the strong bipartisan support that exists that a vehicle for that extension can be found here soon to be able to bring 32,000 airline industry employees back to work. We are fortunate we haven't had to furlough anyone yet to this juncture. I do want to acknowledge the great work of the Delta team in making a real difference. We are not facing furloughs in any work group with the lone exception of the pilots. We still have an overstaff situation where we are trying to work with the union on, but every other workgroup within Delta, we have been able to manage to mitigate it through all the voluntary leaves, 40,000 people taking unpaid leaves throughout the summer. 20% of our employees have opted to early retire. We have had reduced hours and work schedules, shared jobs. It's been incredible. And excluding the pilots for the moment out of the labor cost, we have been able to save 40% of our employee costs over the last 6 months as a result, which is eliminate the need to undergo furlough. So, that's my view on that. Where this goes, I have no idea. It seems to change by the day, if not many times within the day. We are still hopeful something will happen. I don't think it's less of a priority for Delta. I think that with the large numbers of furloughs that are at other airlines, it's a heightened priority there, but we would be pleased to see that extension given to all the industry. However, the industry and everyone within the industry has managed the crisis a bit differently. The reality is the virus is not at the level of containment that we all thought it would be when the first grant was issued and we will all need additional time to get our businesses in a better spot over to get ready for next year. Well, clearly, the loyalty program and the American Express deal have been great advantages for us through this pandemic. We have seen continued spend improvement through the second, third and now fourth quarter. And I think it's too early for us to go out and say that what Christmas will be like or what the post-Christmas spend will be, but the trends that we have seen today are very encouraging. I think a lot of that also has to do with does a stimulus bill gets passed either in November or in January. So, there are a lot of factors that weigh into how people spend on those cards, but I would say we have been very encouraged by the trends we have seen. No, we are not going to disclose that, but it's a significant contribution."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session, following the presentation. As a reminder today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJill Greer: Thanks, Cecilia. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us for our June quarter earnings call. Speaking today on the call will be our CEO; Ed Bastian and our CFO; Paul Jacobson. We also have our President, Glen Hauenstein and our entire leadership team here with us for the Q&A. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.

Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today. We are now four months into the pandemic, and the nearly $4 billion pre-tax loss that we just posted, reflects the severe impact that COVID-19 is having on our company and our industry. The June quarter was remarkable for a confluence of crisis that rocked our nation. In addition to the pandemic and its impact on public health and the economy, the issue of inequality and social injustice for Black Americans has been front and centered. In this environment, our number one focus is taking care of our people. This includes not only protecting the health and safety of our employees, but also maintaining our commitment to supporting the fight for equality and social justice. We are committed to listening and understanding. We must be a stronger advocate for justice and equality across our business, from our operating procedures to the programs that we offer our people, the support for policy change. Our people are the heart and soul of Delta, and I am incredibly proud of their perseverance and resiliency through these trying times, and forever grateful for the sacrifices that they are making for our company. Since demand bottomed in mid-April at less than 5% of our normal traffic, we've seen a small but welcome uptick in passenger volume, being driven almost entirely by domestic leisure travelers or those flying for essential reasons. And while it's encouraging to see customers start to return, the revenue environment remains challenging. We have thought from the start that the recovery will be choppy and the past few weeks have shown that to be true. We're expecting our overall revenue for the September quarter will be only 20% to 25% of what we saw last summer. And we've seen demand growth flattened recently with the rise in COVID-19 cases. We're watching trends closely and have pared back our capacity plans for August. Business travel, which typically provides 50% of our revenue is not yet returned in any meaningful way. With corporate offices slow to reopen, quarantine restrictions in markets like New York and Chicago, and states in the Sunbelt reversing or pausing reopening plans. We remain cautious on the pace of recovery through the balance of the year. In addition, there isn't a clear timeline when international borders will open for U.S. travelers. So it's against that uncertain backdrop that we are taking the industry's most conservative approach to capacity. For the September quarter, we expect our seats available for sale, which accounts for 60% load factor cap will be 20% to 25% of last year's level, up from 10% in the June quarter. Given how dynamic the current environment is, we are maintaining our flexibility, and we'll adjust our capacity plans as needed based on changes in demand. Since the crisis began, we have taken decisive actions to protect our people and our customers, increased our liquidity, and importantly, preserved our ability to respond in the future. Customer employee safety remain our top priority and restoring consumer confidence in travel is at the forefront of our recovery plan. We have taken extensive and proactive measures to implement a multilayer approach to protect customers and employees. Additionally, all of our aircraft are equipped with HEPA filters, generating high quality, hospital grade air quality onboard. Restoring consumer confidence to travel on Delta is the driving force behind our Delta Care standard, which includes requiring customers and employees to wear masks, enhancing clean protocols for aircraft, electrostatic spraying before every departure, blocking middle seats and capping load factors at 60% to provide more space onboard. We're committed to blocking middle seats through September and expect to continue our policy beyond that date as well. We've also created a Delta Global Cleanliness Organization and are collaborating with two of the world's best health organizations, the Mayo Clinic and Quest Diagnostics. The Mayo Clinic is helping to assess our safety protocols, consulting on how to improve safeguards, as well as designing COVID-19 testing for our full workforce, both for the active virus and the presence of antibodies. The added layers of protection are having an impact. Since implementing these changes as of the 1st May, the infection rate among our customer facing employees, those who spend their days working onboard our aircraft and in our airports, is well below the national average, providing another solid data point on the safety of air travel. In addition, our net promoter scores have never been higher, as customers recognize our health and safety efforts onboard and on the ground. Our top financial priority has been to protect our liquidity. Paul and the team moved quickly and decisively to raise capital, ending the quarter with $15.7 billion in liquidity. Entering this crisis with a strong balance sheet allowed us to access nearly $15 billion in new capital, on top of the $5.4 billion from the CARES Act without issuing equity. And while accessing capital is critical, the most important liquidity action we can take is reducing our cash burn. In June, our daily cash burn for the month averaged $27 million a day, a substantial improvement from the $100 million per day that we were experiencing in late March. The major force in that improvement is our cost performance which has been remarkable, as we\u2019ll take out over 50% of our total operating expenses for both the June and September quarters. That's due in large part to the more than 40,000 Delta people who have volunteered to take short-term unpaid leaves. Our crews who have seen their hours reduced as flying has been cut back, and the sacrifices made by our hourly and myriad ground employees, whose work schedules have been similarly reduced by 25%. I want to thank all the Delta people who volunteered for an unpaid leave. They're making a real difference in helping us navigate this crisis. We also want to thank all our colleagues who have been serving our customers in the face of this pandemic. The spirit and team work of our people is the difference has never shined brighter. With demand growth stalled at present, we expect July's daily cash burn to be similar to what we saw in June. As we go through the summer and into the fall, we'll continue to move quickly to balance what we're seeing in the revenue environment with our ability to get cost out of the business and keep us on the path to achieve our goal of breakeven cash burn by the end of the year. Given the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we continue to believe it could be two years or more before we see a sustainable recovery. So to succeed in this environment we are building resilience across the company in creating a new stronger Delta, albeit one that will need to be smaller for the next several years. That means accelerating strategies to streamline our company, simplify our fleet, and reduce our fixed cost base in ways not possible in the past. We have made the decision to permanently retire more than 100 aircraft this year, including the entire MD-88, MD-90, 777 and 737, 700 fleets. We have the most flexible fleet in the U.S. and are pulling for these and additional fleet simplification initiatives, which we believe will provide a lasting benefit to our cost structure. The difficult reality of resizing the airline is that we need a smaller work force until we see demand return. We'll be wrapping up our voluntary departure and early retirement programs this month, and as of last night, we already had over 17,000 employees voluntarily sign up to depart the company. We also have thousands more signed up for voluntary unpaid leave of absence into the fall. We are hopeful that we can accomplish the vast majority of the headcount changes we need through these programs, minimizing if not eliminating the need for involuntary furloughs. This will require creativity and collaboration across all of our work groups, and I'm hopeful that we can get there. And as we navigate this difficult environment, we're also working closely with our airline partners around the world, who are facing even more significant financial challenges. During the quarter both LATAM and AeroMexico filed for bankruptcy here in the U.S. under Chapter 11. And Virgin Atlantic is working through an out of court re-capitalization. While each of these is disappointing, none of our partners' home countries were prepared to provide governmental financial support, similar to what the U.S. treasury did with the CARES Act, which necessitated their decisions to restructure. We have the utmost confidence in all of our partners and remain firmly committed to our partnerships, which will be important when we rebuild a much more resilient international network in the recovery. In closing, we remain grounded in the strengths that are core to Delta's business, our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability. These strengths and the shared values of the Delta family guide every decision we make, differentiating Delta with our customers and positioning us to succeed when demand returns. I want to thank everyone who's contributing to Delta\u2019s support and recovery efforts, through the most challenging time in the company's history. Our customers, partners, suppliers, owners, community leaders, government officials, their support has been overwhelming. And a special thank you to the finance group of airline professionals ever assembled, our Delta people for managing this difficult environment with grace, employees determined to return Delta to our position of leadership in our industry, and in our world. And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul to go through our financials. Paul?\nPaul Jacobson: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everybody. This June quarter results we reported this morning illustrate the truly staggering impact of this pandemic on our business. Revenues declined 91%, and we reported a $3.9 billion pre-tax loss, one of the largest in Delta's history. Results exclude several items directly related to the impact from COVID-19 and our response, including $2.5 billion in impairment charges from fleet-related decisions, $2.1 billion in write-downs related to equity partners and a $1.3 billion benefit from the CARES Act grant recognized during the quarter. During this quarter, our total operating expenses declined $5.5 billion or 53%. The June quarter cost performance was more than $400 million better than our original expectations, in part due to the incredible contributions of more than 40,000 employees, who have elected to take voluntary unpaid leaves. With substantially reduced flying, fuel expense was nearly $2 billion lower compared to the prior year quarter, and we generated over $250 million of savings from parking more than 700 aircrafts. We were also able to reduce facilities expense by consolidating concourses and temporarily closing sky clubs, while eliminating nearly all discretionary spending. In the September quarter, we expect to achieve a similar 50% year-over-year reduction in operating expenses, despite a sequential increase in capacity. This reflects the increased variability we've achieved in our cost structure and what we've been discussing, since the COVID epidemic. As Ed said, our top financial priority remains to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to whether whatever comes at us. To this end, we've taken decisive action to bolster our liquidity position, ending the quarter with $15.7 billion of liquidity. Daily cash burn also improved sequentially each month during the quarter to average $27 million in the month of June. This outperformed our initial expectation of $50 million cash burn per day during the month of June. One-third of that improvement came from better cost performance with two-thirds from an improvement in net sales, which inflected positive in early June and remained there. It's worth noting that approximately $10 million of our cash burn is attributable to our international business, so our domestic business is only burning $17 million a day, which is a testament to the efficiency of the reduced operation. As Ed mentioned, we are staying agile to balance what we're seeing in the revenue environment with our ability to get costs out of the business. This approach improves our cash burn trajectory, which helps us to preserve our balance sheet capacity for the future. The strength of our balance sheet has been evident during the pandemic, as we have raised $15 billion in new liquidity at a blended average rate of 5.5%. When combined with funds received under the CARES Act Payroll Support Program, we ended the June quarter with this $15.7 billion of liquidity. Even with no improvement in our cash burn rate, this equates to 19 months of liquidity. This is more than sufficient to address our upcoming maturities. But if needed, we have the ability to continue to raise additional capital through either our own efforts by leveraging our unencumbered assets, or electing to participate in the CARES Act Secured Loan Program. In an effort to ensure compliance and flexibility throughout the recovery, we also amended all of our bank credit facilities to permanently replace the fixed charge coverage covenant with the $2 billion minimum liquidity covenant. So in spite of the significant amount of debt we have raised, our adjusted net debt has only increased by $3.4 billion since the start of the year to $13.9 billion. Reducing our daily cash burn is critical to keeping the net debt down, and that is why we remain uniquely focused on it. In closing, while we have a long road ahead of us, we've made tremendous progress in just the last four months. By raising cash early and aggressively managing costs, we are prepared to navigate what will be a volatile revenue period, while making decisions to position Delta well for the eventual recovery. Our people have acted quickly and decisively to protect our customers and our company. And I'm so proud of what the people of Delta have accomplished with that grace, professionalism and determination that Ed mentioned. They are the reason I'm confident, we will emerge from this crisis as a stronger, more resilient Delta as our customers return. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A.\nJill Greer: Thanks, Paul. Cecilia, we are ready for questions from the analysts, if you could give them instructions on how to get in the queue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Hunter Keay, Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Hey, good morning, everybody. Ed, you mentioned, you recently said you expect some amount of business travel. I think you said 20% will turn out to be unproductive in retrospect and suggesting obviously it's not going to return. So what are some of the specific characteristics of the business travelers that do come back, that might be different from the ones who don't? Like for example, maybe they fly more per year, but to fewer cities, or these are the people that use lounges more often, things like that. So what do these people look like? And how do you win them or keep them?\nEd Bastian: Well, first of all, Hunter, I think fundamentally, business travel is going to come back and it's going to come back at scale. I'm not the one that thinks that we are in a permanently depressed level of business travel for the foreseeable future. I do think there's a lot of inefficiency, which we can all appreciate in business travel. The number of trips that the average rogue warrior takes, I'm sure is going to come down. In certain cases, the international trips that we've all been on where we've flown over to Europe for a two hour meeting and flown back that does nothing but beat you up, and you'd certainly be much easily better accommodated over a video call. But it's going to be trips that are focused on relationship building, interacting, whether it's with your customers, conventions, new contacts, reviewing performance on a global scale. Those are going to stay. I just don't see there's a substitute for that over time. It will take some time to get back. I don't think we'll ever get back entirely to where we were in 2019 on the volume of business traffic. But the resiliency of the business traffic that we are going to now bake into our business model going forward, I think will be a better way to measure the sustainability of the recovery.\nHunter Keay: And then another one for you, Ed. When was the last time you talked to Steve Squeri? And what is your single biggest shared commercial concern right now? And what is it that he tells you is most important to preserve the relationship and the economics that your company share?\nEd Bastian: I talk to Steve all the time. He's not just a great business partner, he's a great friend. And we share our thoughts and strategies together. We are their biggest and most important business partner and American Express is ours in turn. And we're navigating this crisis together in a way that you would expect. I mean, they've seen some meaningful recovery over the course of the quarter in volumes on the card, which is certainly one of our bright spots in a dark quarter, the revenue recovery we're seeing on spend. But they provide a great lens into customer behaviors and the types of things that are going to be very important for Delta to maintain the position we have with the company. So, I continue as Steve does, to be optimistic of the future. We're both realistic, we realize the T&E spend is not going to be at the levels we saw in the prior years. But we're going to both do our very best to build a better future for our respective stakeholders.\nHunter Keay: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. Paul, question on labor. So, as I see it there are sort of four moving parts here. We've got the voluntary unpaid leaves, which has already dropped off the P&L for now, but some level phase back in, in the future. We've got the early retirement, which will completely drop out. We've got what might happen after October 1st. And then I assume in the event of furloughs, you have some severance expenses. So what I'm trying to reconcile with these various flows is whether the net is that they temporarily give you labor costs relief in the fourth quarter. And that's what gets you to cash breakeven. But then labor costs potentially rise after that. I guess another way of asking is, in what quarter do you think your labor expense line will truly be reflective of the cost structure going forward?\nPaul Jacobson: Good morning, Jamie. There's a lot in that question. I think we're still really assessing the overlap right now between the early retirement and the voluntary leave program. So there's a sense of duplication there. But what it does do at an absolute minimum is it puts permanence around what were short-term leaves and volatility. So, we expect that in addition to the leaves that Ed mentioned -- I'm sorry, the separations that Ed mentioned voluntarily. We also have leaves that will continue on top of that. So we're going to continue to assess and see where we stand on the salaries and related line. There's no doubt that that's been a big driver of how we've gotten our cash burn down in quick action. And as we continue to shape the airline for how we think it's going to be sized next summer and into the future, we've got to be able to manage all of that agility and flexibility. And the voluntary leaves are going to continue to be an important piece of that puzzle going forward. So as we think about salaries and related, we should get to that kind of trend line I would think in that fourth quarter, first quarter, but then we'll see as demand shapes back, customers are ultimately going to determine how big the airline is.\nEd Bastian: Hey Jamie, if I could add a couple thoughts. For the second quarter and the third quarter, we are reducing our total operating expenses by a bit over 50%, which is enormous. And that will continue to be our goal as we progress through the fourth quarter as well. And while the composition of the savings will be more sustainable given the size of the early out, so we have 20% of the company will be exiting. And as you can appreciate it's the senior most 20% of the company as well, which is going to give us an added benefit on top. So there's a lot of creativity and collaboration with our work groups, about reducing work, trying to protect jobs and everyone pitching in to work fewer hours, but to save more jobs. And that's across the company, there's a real spirit of doing that. So, whether I guess in the fourth quarter or first quarter, at some point the labor savings here are sustainable. But to answer your question more specifically, it's really going to be on the commercial side of the business. It's going to be much more important to getting us down to that breakeven level, as demand hopefully starts to grow, picks up once again, as we look into the late summer and fall. And that'll be the more important contributor to getting to a breakeven cash flow position.\nJamie Baker: Okay, that's very helpful. A second multipart question. How do we think of loyalty in the remaining unencumbered asset pool? Does Delta have that flexibility to do what United did with loyalty in terms of sort of a quasi-securitization of both third party sales and intercompany cash flows? Or did you pledge SkyMiles as part of the loan?\nPaul Jacobson: So Jamie, we\u2019re an infinitely competitive business, but hats off to United for that execution, I thought they did a very good job with that. And it's one that I think is available to a multitude of carriers. That is not included in the most recent guidance that we've given of $6 billion to $7 billion of unencumbered assets. And we're looking at all of our options and we\u2019ll continue to keep them open. We have advanced the ball with the government by signing the term sheet, which they announced a couple of weeks ago. And we continue to move along that process, but we have not decided to take a government loan. And we're assessing really all of our options, as well as the environment that we're in.\nJamie Baker: Thanks for indulging the questions. Take care.\nOperator: We'll go next to Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Totally agree with the perspective that Delta's been careful with capacity and how you brought it back. Just from an industry perspective, it looked like the industry has guessed wrong on July, at least so far. So schedules indicate your capacity is up about 90%, from June to July yet demand has stalled. So I'm just curious how cash burn can be similar in July versus June? Was it just that we had a good July 4th on the books before demand rolled over? Or is there something going on with debt payments and CapEx?\nPaul Jacobson: Well, I'll start with that Duane. First of all, good morning. The trajectory that we've been on and what we articulated through June was that we had seen steadily increasing net sales, that was coming really from both variables. Sales were going up and trending higher, while at the same time refunds have been trending down, which put us from a -- I think at the beginning we said $20 million to $30 million a day, we were burning in March to turning positive and staying there in June. So while we've seen that that sales growth level off in the wake of the latest rise in infections, and has remained relatively stable in that area. So, as we see the continued trajectory of reducing our operating expenses 50%, and keeping those net sales numbers relatively flat, that's where July comes out flat to June.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thanks Paul, and maybe I'll stick with you. Just high level, how is your budget for aircraft rent change for this year, as we think about the net impact of a sale leaseback activity versus aircraft retirements? The only reason I bring it up is it looked like the op lease liabilities didn't really change much sequentially. So maybe you can help us understand what's going on under the covers? Thank you.\nPaul Jacobson: Yes. I think Duane, we'll take that offline and it'll be more apparent when the Q comes out later today of just the breakdown between financing leases and operating leases, under all the new accounting guidelines. So it's all there, but it has a little bit of a different geography to it, depending on the transactions.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. I'll keep it there. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Helane Becker of Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thank you very much, operator. I appreciate the time. Hi. So, I have two questions. One is your comments on international and the 777s that are leaving the fleet and some of the 767s. It seemed like you might have to do more pruning there. So, do you like retired enough aircraft do you think? Or do we expect to see more during rest of the year?\nEd Bastian: Hi, Helane, it's Ed. International is going to lag domestic. I think we have some time to watch how it recovers. The 777 fleet for us was the sub-fleet that made the most sense to sit down. We certainly have additional international capable aircraft that we have a very large 767 fleet with opportunities to early retire, as we get a better sense for where the recovery is. But some of those decisions we have a little bit of time to take it. As I indicated in my remarks, there's more to be done. And we're not investing any money in that fleet, and we can see how international recovery is shaped before we make those final decisions.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up question really has to do with changes in booking patterns because of increased refunds, or because of more flexibility to people who book and then maybe cancel. So could you just address people booking and then actually showing up for the flights, especially in July? Are you seeing people booking and then canceling at the last instance?\nGlen Hauenstein: Helane, hi. It's Glenn. How are you doing? We've seen the no show rate -- good. Hope your summer is going well. We see no show rates grow from about 3% historically to about high-single digits. And most people at day of departure who have reservations are showing up for the flight. But the higher no show rates also makes it a little bit harder to revenue manage with the caps. So we've been managing through that. And we hope we can get better and better at that as we move through the fall. But clearly giving people more flexibility is where we need to be as there's so much uncertainty in the virus right now.\nHelane Becker: Got you. Thanks very much. Since I'm still in paradise prison, my summer is not going as well as I would like. But, thank you for asking.\nGlen Hauenstein: Right, we're ready to release you, Helane.\nHelane Becker: Not soon enough. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Joe Caiado of Credit Suisse.\nJoe Caiado: Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question relates to your fleet and actually your order book. Any update on your discussions with Airbus regarding your order book there? And can you describe for us maybe what it is that that you're hoping to achieve there? Do you just want to sort of adjust the timeline for deliveries? Are you looking to restructure sort of the composition of the aircraft in the order book, just any detail there? Thanks.\nEd Bastian: We are working with Airbus, as you can appreciate, and they've been very good partners with us managing the crisis. Clearly, we're in a situation where we don't need any aircraft. So we have a lot of aircraft on the ground, and doing our best to manage through the next 18 to 24 months to minimize deliveries. We're not ready to make any announcements yet. I can assure you there will be no cash CapEx on any aircraft at Delta for some period of time, certainly through the end of this year. And Airbus has been a very good partner.\nJoe Caiado: Got it. That's very clear on the CapEx. But I was curious, just especially as it relates to your comments on the expected timelines for recovery of domestic versus international. If you'd also be looking to adjust the actual composition of the aircraft that in your order book as opposed to just actually delaying or revising the timeline for the deliveries. And if I could just throw up my second actual follow-up, which is just a quick clarification for Paul. On the stalled demand recovery, did you say the July net bookings are flat with June, so they are positive month-to-date? Can you just describe in a little bit more detail the evolution in those net bookings trend over the last few weeks?\nEd Bastian: No, that's okay, Joe. On your question Airbus again, we are not providing any specifics at this point, you can rest assured everything that we are doing is pushing a lot of the deliveries to the right. And when we are ready to -- we haven\u2019t reached the final plan with Airbus, when we do reach that plan, we\u2019ll be sure to let you know.\nPaul Jacobson: And Joe, on the cash burn, so we had seen a pretty steady progression upwards of sales and slight decline in refunds, really kind of from May to early mid-June. And that\u2019s when we started to see it stabilize. So the data that we have seen so far in July is pretty consistent with what we saw at the end of June, which is really reflective of what we've seen in this latest wave of infection throughout the country. And that\u2019s why we have got the confidence that it's somewhat stabilized here at these levels. And hopefully, if things start to improve we can see improvements of those levels as we get later into the quarter.\nJoe Caiado: Thank you very much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey Paul, just back to how you are thinking about the ATL as we progress through the quarter? I mean normally under a normal year, the seasonal impact is that as we get to the latter part of the quarter, we tend to see it become a drag on cash, and I realize that this is not a normal year. So, are you sort of expecting that as we get into the latter part of the quarter that we will see it become a drag on the ATL? Or where is your thinking around that right now?\nPaul Jacobson: Good morning, Mike. That\u2019s a bit of a doocey [ph] of a question, because I think the one thing we all know is that the historical air traffic liability models have broken right now. It's not behaving in any way that a normalized seasonality pattern would have. As evidence, we have actually refunded now over $2 billion of that ATLs since the beginning of year, which the bulk of that has been done in the post-COVID, post-March 1, timeframe. So, we actually think that a lot of that refund activity particularly in the Trans-Atlantic and International destinations which were already booked pre-COVID heading into the summer, we have refunded a lot of that activity in it. So a little bit of a -- it\u2019s a big contributor to the international cash burn that I gave that comp position in my prepared remarks. So, we can actually see things stabilizing and we would expect that refunds will continue to trend down in the status quo. Obviously, it's going to be choppy, but any new sales data that come in, any new demand should be accretive to the ATL in a way that seasonally you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect. So, we\u2019re prepared for that. I think the one given is that there is a lot of uncertainty here, which is why we have gone the route of really looking to raise as much liquidity as we can.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just maybe this is an easier one, you talked earlier about upcoming maturities and I'll throw CapEx in there as well. As we look to the second part of the year, what is CapEx? I am sure it's probably close to zero now based on everything that you have cut back or deferred. And you did allude or mentioned upcoming maturities, what are the big maturities for the second-half of 2020? Thanks for taking my questions.\nPaul Jacobson: Yes, sure. So, we didn\u2019t give any formal CapEx guidance, because it's really the same as we gave immediately after the COVID epidemic, which is we have essentially eliminated all CapEx. There is some technology spend on projects that are already in process and some small purchases here and there, but it\u2019s not material to the overall story. As far as debt maturities go, the biggest one we have is the $450 million maturity in December. When you combine that with a $600 million unsecured in April of '21, that\u2019s the unsecured deal that we just took out. So we\u2019ve already successfully refinanced that. And then we have the $3 billion bridge loan that is due in March, that has collateral attached to it that we haven't decided exactly what to do with that. As part of the amendment to the credit facilities, we also extended by one year a $1.3 billion maturity in April of our revolver. So that's pushed out to 2022. So we've actually gotten a very, very good handle on all of the maturities really for the next 18 months.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. Thanks for that.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions on the cash burn. If we don't get much of an improvement on the commercial side, what do you think you can kind of get the cash burn by the fourth quarter with some of the incremental things that are happening on the cost side?\nPaul Jacobson: Hey, good morning, Savi. I think, as we've mentioned in our comments, we're kind of on this trajectory right now as things have stabilized. And we're continuing to assess what the second-half looks like. So as we continue to monitor capacity and demand that'll affect what we do on the cost input side as well. But, I think we're really counting on some continued improvement in demand, however gradual and however choppy that might be. We are 90 days into this and we already know a lot more about the virus. And that's giving a little bit more confidence in the longer and intermediate-term demand profile. But we've got to continue to be agile. So, I think we'll kind of be in this mid-20s level, as we continue to assess. And if we need to take further actions, we will.\nEd Bastian: Hey, Savi. This is Ed. I don't want anyone to get a sense that we've got a gloomy forecast on revenue or demand growth, not at all. This is expected. We said at the start of this pandemic, that this is going to be choppy. It's going to be unpredictable. It's going to be driven by factors outside of our control. It's really advances on the medical front in containing the virus, it's advances by general public about wearing masks and doing their very best to be cautious and restoring confidence in air travel. I'm optimistic as we get through the late summer in the fall, we're going to see some real improvements here. We need to see improvements. And I think the sensitivity and the caution you hear in our voice for the current month is the fact that we're in the south and we're obviously under -- going back into a more of a closed setting in our local economy then opening. But at the same time, that's for the goal of reopening later this summer and fall to a bit of a better standpoint. So, I do think you're going to see continued improvement in cash burn. Cost on the margin could improve. But when you get more than 50% of your costs out, it's hard to see much more coming out. I think it's going to be the same type of momentum that we saw in June, hopefully reemerging in the latter part of the summer and early fall. That's going to make another material debt in bringing us down to that flat breakeven level.\nSavi Syth: That makes sense and helpful. And my other follow-up question is just on the business travel commentary. It looks like a lot of probably business travel might not happen until 2021, but just based on your surveys and things like that, is there any level of expectation of what we might see in the fourth quarter here? And kind of tied to that, I mean, there's kind of the block middle seats get removed when demand is stronger, or when the virus is a little bit more contained? What drives those positions?\nEd Bastian: We're talking to our corporates all the time. As you can appreciate, we're doing a lot of work with them to get them more confident. They are starting to come back. They're in small numbers, but they're starting. And what we've been doing is taking them out with us on tours and seeing the airport. It's interesting for travelers that they spent their life as road warriors, the first time back in this environment it feels very different. And they need to refamiliarize themselves with what it's like and the benefits of air travel. And, I'd say the most significant observation that they give us is that it is actually not only safe, it's significantly better than what their view of air travel was pre-pandemic. So, there is confidence that's returning. I think you're going to see it improve as businesses start to reopen, I'd say post-Labor Day. Businesses start to open up as international operations start to slowly open up. You'll see that will be another driver for business travel. But business travel is going to clearly be at a 12 to 18 months lag, waiting for advances on the medical front, vaccines, therapeutics, reasons to think that it's safe, that companies can safely put their cut -- their employees back out in the road. The other thing, and I mentioned this in one of the interviews I did this morning, is that while the corporations may not be traveling, we know the individuals are traveling. And we see it in the SkyMiles data and our frequent flyer information. So people are learning about the new way of travel and they're telling us it's actually better than it was previous.\nSavi Syth: And does the block middle seat, is that kind of tied to COVID? Or is that tied to demand levels there?\nEd Bastian: I'm sorry, I didn't hear that Savi.\nSavi Syth: Sorry. You mentioned that middle seating block probably continues beyond September. Just wondering what drives that decision?\nEd Bastian: Well, that's going to be consumer confidence. We're going to hear from customers as to their comfort in travel. We've got a lot of flights that we have to add back yet and opportunities to add flights back before we have to worry about pulling up the middle seats. And, we\u2019ll get there over the course of the end of the year and into early next year. But, right now, I don't see a push to do that. Customers aren't pushing us to do it. And we've got -- I'd rather add more flights back and more seats into the market in the safe way than trying to maximize the number of people you can put on an individual airplane. And I think that would be in consistent with the brand that Delta represents.\nSavi Syth: It makes sense. Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning everyone, and thanks for taking my question. So, I guess following up on that line of question, if business demand is going to lag here and you have some competitors out there they're going to come out of this without a lot of an incremental debt. What's going to be a competitive landscape? And how do you reposition your network to be more leisure-focused, maybe lower costs? And does that impact the kind of strategy you\u2019re really focusing on the branded products and everything onboard?\nEd Bastian: Brandon, this is Ed. I'm not sure who you're referring to. Our incremental net debt is $3.5 billion at this point, so I wouldn't suggest that we have added a tremendous amount of increased debt burden on the company. Obviously, there\u2019s a large amount of money that we raised, but we also have a significant amount of cash that we can use to hopefully retire that, once we get through the other side. We're not changing our long-term goal for this company, this brand. We are a business oriented airline. We are a premium oriented airline. And there's nothing that I see from what we've been through the last four months that suggest customers aren't going to value premium, value the quality of the experience, the health of the experience. But we're going to be more resilient, because there's a portion of that trouble that will go away and we'll size our business accordingly. So, I don't see anything that gives me pause. Of course, there's going to be a lot of dislocation, disruption that always happens in this industry during times of crisis, but I think we're pretty well-positioned to come out of this in a relatively stronger competitive position than we were pre-pandemic.\nBrandon Oglenski: Well, I appreciate that response. And I know that looking forward as anyone's guess here but can you give us any clarity on what and I think maybe Paul alluded to what level of demand you\u2019re expecting to get to cash breakeven by the end of the year? And maybe even more importantly, where you're seeing the sizing of the network for 2021 as you make any difficult decisions?\nPaul Jacobson: So, at a really high level Brandon, if you look at our cash burn in June as well as in July and that $27 million a day number, virtually all of that needs to come through improvement in net cash sales. It's going to come in two ways, so one, the refund activity will continue to wind down. That will be a contributor in that and that's probably in the plus or minus $5 million a day improvement by the time we get to the end of the year, and which leaves about $20 million of cash sales improvement. And that's if you think of a company our size is about a 20% improvement in our overall business volume that will get us there. So, we'll probably need to see that $25 million come from the commercial side of the business, but that's still is the roadmap to get to breakeven.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nJill Greer: Cecilia, we're going to have time for one more question from the analysts.\nOperator: Thank you. That question will come from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Good morning. Ed, I think over the last few years you and your larger peers have been of the view that the DOJ had kind of put a red light on additional consolidation. I'm wondering if you think that has changed or that it needs the change? And whether the calculus around how much liquidity you think you need takes into account that maybe consolidation is eventually part of the strategy?\nEd Bastian: Joe, you know we can't speculate on that. Not to be [indiscernible] but that would be a really, really inappropriate response I'd have to give on that.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, fair enough. Paul, can you give us where you guys are year-to-date on mileage sales, cash proceeds? I think you did about $4.2 billion last year. Where are you guys year-to-date?\nPaul Jacobson: Yes, we've seen Joe about a 50% reduction in the last quarter. I think if you look at some of American Express's commentary, it's in line to even slightly better than some of the cards in their portfolio, which I think is encouraging. That means that that people remain attached to the brand and they see value in the miles program. So we're going to continue to see that, but it obviously has been far more resilient than the demand for tickets and for travel itself, which is what we expected.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nPaul Jacobson: Thank you.\nJill Greer: And that's going to wrap the analyst portion of the call. I will turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer for the immediate portion.\nTim Mapes: Good morning, everybody. We have about 10 minutes of questions from members of the media. I'd just remind everyone please, just a question and maybe a brief follow-up. We'll try to get through as many as we can.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Robert Silk of Travel Weekly.\nRobert Silk: Yes, good morning. In the Virgin Atlantic announcement day, they mentioned for their restructuring plan that they're doing this with the support of shareholders, Virgin Group and Delta, as well as some new investors. So I was wondering if there's any color or detail in the matter which Delta is supporting this effort?\nEd Bastian: Not other than what's already been disclosed, which is that we are contributing through deferral of brand fees, as well as certain other joint venture fees that we would typically earn. We were excited to see the recapitalization come about. It's been an extraordinarily difficult few months holding that together. And all stakeholders have made some meaningful contributions to enable Virgin to fly again. And we're excited about that.\nRobert Silk: Thanks, Ed.\nOperator: We'll next to Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to see if you could breakdown for us how much of your second quarter revenue and possibly revenue going forward is from newly purchased tickets versus how much is from what rescheduled flying?\nEd Bastian: Sure. We have about two-thirds of the revenue coming in from newly purchased tickets and about a third coming in from reissues and credits from postponed journey. So, getting a significant number of new journeys coming in, which is a good sign.\nMary Schlangenstein: And I assume that the new ticket purchasing fell in this recent sort of slump as well as the reschedule. Is that right?\nEd Bastian: If I could recharacterize it from a slump to really a much slower growth rate is that the industry had an awful lot of capacity going from June into July. And so what we've seen is in June, we were growing at about 20% every week, week-over-week. And I think maybe in some ways that capacity is going to take a little bit longer to get absorbed, because the growth rates are -- if you take 4th of July out, they're coming in between 5% and 10%, now. So the growth is at a much slower rate. As we look forward, it has slowed but it hasn't stalled. I mean, it's very flattish to up slightly, but it's not a slump.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dawn Gilbertson of USA Today.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi, good morning. I think you mentioned employee coronavirus infections being down, because of all the measures you've put in place. Can we talk about passenger infections? We had the case, the recent case was Endeavor on the flight from Atlanta to Albany. How many instances is Delta seeing, hearing back from passengers after a flight about coronavirus infections and can someone put that into perspective for me? Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Hi, Dawn. It's really minimal. The flight last week was an Endeavor flight as you mentioned and that was after the fact that those three customers found out. So there's no question that in the general population, there's a virus. And when we do find out, we go back and contact trace with anyone that would have been in the immediate vicinity of a customer. But I can tell you those instances are really, really small. And certainly, no instances that we've been aware of where there's been any transmission on board our planes.\nOperator: And did that answer your question, ma'am?\nDawn Gilbertson: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Tracy Rucinski of Reuters.\nTracy Rucinski: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about the outlook for the trainer refinery. Do you have any plans to divest it or stop operations?\nPaul Jacobson: Good morning, Tracy. This is Paul. So, the trainer refinery in the quarter we had about $100 million loss in the quarter, which was almost entirely focused in the month of April. So the refinery is continuing to produce economics at breakeven levels on the current trends. And as with everything in the business we're looking at everything. But our plans have not changed with respect to the refinery right now.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Claire Bushey of Financial Times.\nClaire Bushey: Hi. I wanted to ask whether federal government needs to pass a law requiring mask on airplanes? Or do your flight crews have enough leverage with passengers since they can be banned from flying with the airline?\nEd Bastian: Hi Claire, this is Ed. I don't know that it needs to pass a law. But I certainly see the opportunity to reinforce the work that the airlines are doing to ensure that customers wear their masks both in the airports as well as onboard our planes is helpful. The airlines are I think are doing a very good job of reinforcing that, as well as candidly customers on board planes. If someone's not wearing a mask, they quickly get pointed out and discussion with our flight attendants occur quickly. So, it's really important that we as a nation comply with mask policy or an industry that's got a lot of regulation. I don't know that we need another regulation around mask wearing, but it'd be helpful but stronger that our federal government can reinforce the need to wear masks, the better. Not just on air travel, but in life, in general.\nClaire Bushey: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Leslie Joseph of CNBC.\nLeslie Joseph: Hi, good morning. Do you have any idea of how many pilots need to be retrained on different aircraft, given the retirements and then also potential furloughs and just kind of rejiggering of what they're going to be flying and what the cost might be of that?\nEd Bastian: Leslie, it's really premature. The pilot retirement plan still has almost a week yet to run. So we'll be in a better position to assess that over the next month. And we're continuing to work with Alpha to identify ways to mitigate the need to displace pilots and furlough.\nLeslie Joseph: Thank you.\nTim Mapes: Cecilia, we have time for one final question, please?\nOperator: The final question comes from David Slotnick of Business Insider.\nDavid Slotnick: Hi, how are you? I'm wondering about blocking the middle seat. Have you gotten a sense from passengers or from surveys or anything that people are willing to pay a higher fare to fly a less full airplane?\nEd Bastian: We have received a lot of customer feedback, and in fact, I would say when we surveyed customers today, about reasons you're purchasing a ticket on Delta, the space onboard the plane, the block middle seats has gone to the number one reason why customers are choosing Delta. They see it consistent with our brand. Everyone appreciates, it's not going to last forever. But in the face of a health crisis, that space onboard really matters and customers are telling that. We're seeing it in our net promoter scores, which have gone up considerably on a year-over-year basis, up 20 points in the month of June over last June, which last year was already a good number. And, we hear it from our corporates, we hear anecdotally from many of our travelers.\nDavid Slotnick: And are you looking at charging more of a premium or raising your fares or anything? Or is this more like a brand and marketing investment for later when things stabilize?\nEd Bastian: It's not a brand or marketing investment, and no, we're not raising our fares to block the middle seat. This is, to us, a really important safety feature and it's a health crisis that we're in our country. By being the most disciplined and put it in terms of the amount of supply and capacity that we're offering, that's benefiting our pricing and yield of course. And that's helping us to have a better price onboard the overall cabin, so indirectly, that is coming through in price. But this is not -- that's not the objective. The objective here is to make certain that we're restoring consumer confidence in air travel and being true to our brand promises.\nDavid Slotnick: Thank you.\nTim Mapes: That will complete the June quarter earnings call. Thank you to everyone for your time and your questions today. Have a great day.\nOperator: Again, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Thanks, Jill. Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today. We are now four months into the pandemic, and the nearly $4 billion pre-tax loss that we just posted, reflects the severe impact that COVID-19 is having on our company and our industry. The June quarter was remarkable for a confluence of crisis that rocked our nation. In addition to the pandemic and its impact on public health and the economy, the issue of inequality and social injustice for Black Americans has been front and centered. In this environment, our number one focus is taking care of our people. This includes not only protecting the health and safety of our employees, but also maintaining our commitment to supporting the fight for equality and social justice. We are committed to listening and understanding. We must be a stronger advocate for justice and equality across our business, from our operating procedures to the programs that we offer our people, the support for policy change. Our people are the heart and soul of Delta, and I am incredibly proud of their perseverance and resiliency through these trying times, and forever grateful for the sacrifices that they are making for our company. Since demand bottomed in mid-April at less than 5% of our normal traffic, we've seen a small but welcome uptick in passenger volume, being driven almost entirely by domestic leisure travelers or those flying for essential reasons. And while it's encouraging to see customers start to return, the revenue environment remains challenging. We have thought from the start that the recovery will be choppy and the past few weeks have shown that to be true. We're expecting our overall revenue for the September quarter will be only 20% to 25% of what we saw last summer. And we've seen demand growth flattened recently with the rise in COVID-19 cases. We're watching trends closely and have pared back our capacity plans for August. Business travel, which typically provides 50% of our revenue is not yet returned in any meaningful way. With corporate offices slow to reopen, quarantine restrictions in markets like New York and Chicago, and states in the Sunbelt reversing or pausing reopening plans. We remain cautious on the pace of recovery through the balance of the year. In addition, there isn't a clear timeline when international borders will open for U.S. travelers. So it's against that uncertain backdrop that we are taking the industry's most conservative approach to capacity. For the September quarter, we expect our seats available for sale, which accounts for 60% load factor cap will be 20% to 25% of last year's level, up from 10% in the June quarter. Given how dynamic the current environment is, we are maintaining our flexibility, and we'll adjust our capacity plans as needed based on changes in demand. Since the crisis began, we have taken decisive actions to protect our people and our customers, increased our liquidity, and importantly, preserved our ability to respond in the future. Customer employee safety remain our top priority and restoring consumer confidence in travel is at the forefront of our recovery plan. We have taken extensive and proactive measures to implement a multilayer approach to protect customers and employees. Additionally, all of our aircraft are equipped with HEPA filters, generating high quality, hospital grade air quality onboard. Restoring consumer confidence to travel on Delta is the driving force behind our Delta Care standard, which includes requiring customers and employees to wear masks, enhancing clean protocols for aircraft, electrostatic spraying before every departure, blocking middle seats and capping load factors at 60% to provide more space onboard. We're committed to blocking middle seats through September and expect to continue our policy beyond that date as well. We've also created a Delta Global Cleanliness Organization and are collaborating with two of the world's best health organizations, the Mayo Clinic and Quest Diagnostics. The Mayo Clinic is helping to assess our safety protocols, consulting on how to improve safeguards, as well as designing COVID-19 testing for our full workforce, both for the active virus and the presence of antibodies. The added layers of protection are having an impact. Since implementing these changes as of the 1st May, the infection rate among our customer facing employees, those who spend their days working onboard our aircraft and in our airports, is well below the national average, providing another solid data point on the safety of air travel. In addition, our net promoter scores have never been higher, as customers recognize our health and safety efforts onboard and on the ground. Our top financial priority has been to protect our liquidity. Paul and the team moved quickly and decisively to raise capital, ending the quarter with $15.7 billion in liquidity. Entering this crisis with a strong balance sheet allowed us to access nearly $15 billion in new capital, on top of the $5.4 billion from the CARES Act without issuing equity. And while accessing capital is critical, the most important liquidity action we can take is reducing our cash burn. In June, our daily cash burn for the month averaged $27 million a day, a substantial improvement from the $100 million per day that we were experiencing in late March. The major force in that improvement is our cost performance which has been remarkable, as we'll take out over 50% of our total operating expenses for both the June and September quarters. That's due in large part to the more than 40,000 Delta people who have volunteered to take short-term unpaid leaves. Our crews who have seen their hours reduced as flying has been cut back, and the sacrifices made by our hourly and myriad ground employees, whose work schedules have been similarly reduced by 25%. I want to thank all the Delta people who volunteered for an unpaid leave. They're making a real difference in helping us navigate this crisis. We also want to thank all our colleagues who have been serving our customers in the face of this pandemic. The spirit and team work of our people is the difference has never shined brighter. With demand growth stalled at present, we expect July's daily cash burn to be similar to what we saw in June. As we go through the summer and into the fall, we'll continue to move quickly to balance what we're seeing in the revenue environment with our ability to get cost out of the business and keep us on the path to achieve our goal of breakeven cash burn by the end of the year. Given the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we continue to believe it could be two years or more before we see a sustainable recovery. So to succeed in this environment we are building resilience across the company in creating a new stronger Delta, albeit one that will need to be smaller for the next several years. That means accelerating strategies to streamline our company, simplify our fleet, and reduce our fixed cost base in ways not possible in the past. We have made the decision to permanently retire more than 100 aircraft this year, including the entire MD-88, MD-90, 777 and 737, 700 fleets. We have the most flexible fleet in the U.S. and are pulling for these and additional fleet simplification initiatives, which we believe will provide a lasting benefit to our cost structure. The difficult reality of resizing the airline is that we need a smaller work force until we see demand return. We'll be wrapping up our voluntary departure and early retirement programs this month, and as of last night, we already had over 17,000 employees voluntarily sign up to depart the company. We also have thousands more signed up for voluntary unpaid leave of absence into the fall. We are hopeful that we can accomplish the vast majority of the headcount changes we need through these programs, minimizing if not eliminating the need for involuntary furloughs. This will require creativity and collaboration across all of our work groups, and I'm hopeful that we can get there. And as we navigate this difficult environment, we're also working closely with our airline partners around the world, who are facing even more significant financial challenges. During the quarter both LATAM and AeroMexico filed for bankruptcy here in the U.S. under Chapter 11. And Virgin Atlantic is working through an out of court re-capitalization. While each of these is disappointing, none of our partners' home countries were prepared to provide governmental financial support, similar to what the U.S. treasury did with the CARES Act, which necessitated their decisions to restructure. We have the utmost confidence in all of our partners and remain firmly committed to our partnerships, which will be important when we rebuild a much more resilient international network in the recovery. In closing, we remain grounded in the strengths that are core to Delta's business, our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability. These strengths and the shared values of the Delta family guide every decision we make, differentiating Delta with our customers and positioning us to succeed when demand returns. I want to thank everyone who's contributing to Delta's support and recovery efforts, through the most challenging time in the company's history. Our customers, partners, suppliers, owners, community leaders, government officials, their support has been overwhelming. And a special thank you to the finance group of airline professionals ever assembled, our Delta people for managing this difficult environment with grace, employees determined to return Delta to our position of leadership in our industry, and in our world. And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul to go through our financials. Paul? Well, first of all, Hunter, I think fundamentally, business travel is going to come back and it's going to come back at scale. I'm not the one that thinks that we are in a permanently depressed level of business travel for the foreseeable future. I do think there's a lot of inefficiency, which we can all appreciate in business travel. The number of trips that the average rogue warrior takes, I'm sure is going to come down. In certain cases, the international trips that we've all been on where we've flown over to Europe for a two hour meeting and flown back that does nothing but beat you up, and you'd certainly be much easily better accommodated over a video call. But it's going to be trips that are focused on relationship building, interacting, whether it's with your customers, conventions, new contacts, reviewing performance on a global scale. Those are going to stay. I just don't see there's a substitute for that over time. It will take some time to get back. I don't think we'll ever get back entirely to where we were in 2019 on the volume of business traffic. But the resiliency of the business traffic that we are going to now bake into our business model going forward, I think will be a better way to measure the sustainability of the recovery. I talk to Steve all the time. He's not just a great business partner, he's a great friend. And we share our thoughts and strategies together. We are their biggest and most important business partner and American Express is ours in turn. And we're navigating this crisis together in a way that you would expect. I mean, they've seen some meaningful recovery over the course of the quarter in volumes on the card, which is certainly one of our bright spots in a dark quarter, the revenue recovery we're seeing on spend. But they provide a great lens into customer behaviors and the types of things that are going to be very important for Delta to maintain the position we have with the company. So, I continue as Steve does, to be optimistic of the future. We're both realistic, we realize the T&E spend is not going to be at the levels we saw in the prior years. But we're going to both do our very best to build a better future for our respective stakeholders. Hey Jamie, if I could add a couple thoughts. For the second quarter and the third quarter, we are reducing our total operating expenses by a bit over 50%, which is enormous. And that will continue to be our goal as we progress through the fourth quarter as well. And while the composition of the savings will be more sustainable given the size of the early out, so we have 20% of the company will be exiting. And as you can appreciate it's the senior most 20% of the company as well, which is going to give us an added benefit on top. So there's a lot of creativity and collaboration with our work groups, about reducing work, trying to protect jobs and everyone pitching in to work fewer hours, but to save more jobs. And that's across the company, there's a real spirit of doing that. So, whether I guess in the fourth quarter or first quarter, at some point the labor savings here are sustainable. But to answer your question more specifically, it's really going to be on the commercial side of the business. It's going to be much more important to getting us down to that breakeven level, as demand hopefully starts to grow, picks up once again, as we look into the late summer and fall. And that'll be the more important contributor to getting to a breakeven cash flow position. Hi, Helane, it's Ed. International is going to lag domestic. I think we have some time to watch how it recovers. The 777 fleet for us was the sub-fleet that made the most sense to sit down. We certainly have additional international capable aircraft that we have a very large 767 fleet with opportunities to early retire, as we get a better sense for where the recovery is. But some of those decisions we have a little bit of time to take it. As I indicated in my remarks, there's more to be done. And we're not investing any money in that fleet, and we can see how international recovery is shaped before we make those final decisions. We are working with Airbus, as you can appreciate, and they've been very good partners with us managing the crisis. Clearly, we're in a situation where we don't need any aircraft. So we have a lot of aircraft on the ground, and doing our best to manage through the next 18 to 24 months to minimize deliveries. We're not ready to make any announcements yet. I can assure you there will be no cash CapEx on any aircraft at Delta for some period of time, certainly through the end of this year. And Airbus has been a very good partner. No, that's okay, Joe. On your question Airbus again, we are not providing any specifics at this point, you can rest assured everything that we are doing is pushing a lot of the deliveries to the right. And when we are ready to -- we haven't reached the final plan with Airbus, when we do reach that plan, we'll be sure to let you know. Hey, Savi. This is Ed. I don't want anyone to get a sense that we've got a gloomy forecast on revenue or demand growth, not at all. This is expected. We said at the start of this pandemic, that this is going to be choppy. It's going to be unpredictable. It's going to be driven by factors outside of our control. It's really advances on the medical front in containing the virus, it's advances by general public about wearing masks and doing their very best to be cautious and restoring confidence in air travel. I'm optimistic as we get through the late summer in the fall, we're going to see some real improvements here. We need to see improvements. And I think the sensitivity and the caution you hear in our voice for the current month is the fact that we're in the south and we're obviously under -- going back into a more of a closed setting in our local economy then opening. But at the same time, that's for the goal of reopening later this summer and fall to a bit of a better standpoint. So, I do think you're going to see continued improvement in cash burn. Cost on the margin could improve. But when you get more than 50% of your costs out, it's hard to see much more coming out. I think it's going to be the same type of momentum that we saw in June, hopefully reemerging in the latter part of the summer and early fall. That's going to make another material debt in bringing us down to that flat breakeven level. We're talking to our corporates all the time. As you can appreciate, we're doing a lot of work with them to get them more confident. They are starting to come back. They're in small numbers, but they're starting. And what we've been doing is taking them out with us on tours and seeing the airport. It's interesting for travelers that they spent their life as road warriors, the first time back in this environment it feels very different. And they need to refamiliarize themselves with what it's like and the benefits of air travel. And, I'd say the most significant observation that they give us is that it is actually not only safe, it's significantly better than what their view of air travel was pre-pandemic. So, there is confidence that's returning. I think you're going to see it improve as businesses start to reopen, I'd say post-Labor Day. Businesses start to open up as international operations start to slowly open up. You'll see that will be another driver for business travel. But business travel is going to clearly be at a 12 to 18 months lag, waiting for advances on the medical front, vaccines, therapeutics, reasons to think that it's safe, that companies can safely put their cut -- their employees back out in the road. The other thing, and I mentioned this in one of the interviews I did this morning, is that while the corporations may not be traveling, we know the individuals are traveling. And we see it in the SkyMiles data and our frequent flyer information. So people are learning about the new way of travel and they're telling us it's actually better than it was previous. I'm sorry, I didn't hear that Savi. Well, that's going to be consumer confidence. We're going to hear from customers as to their comfort in travel. We've got a lot of flights that we have to add back yet and opportunities to add flights back before we have to worry about pulling up the middle seats. And, we'll get there over the course of the end of the year and into early next year. But, right now, I don't see a push to do that. Customers aren't pushing us to do it. And we've got -- I'd rather add more flights back and more seats into the market in the safe way than trying to maximize the number of people you can put on an individual airplane. And I think that would be in consistent with the brand that Delta represents. Brandon, this is Ed. I'm not sure who you're referring to. Our incremental net debt is $3.5 billion at this point, so I wouldn't suggest that we have added a tremendous amount of increased debt burden on the company. Obviously, there's a large amount of money that we raised, but we also have a significant amount of cash that we can use to hopefully retire that, once we get through the other side. We're not changing our long-term goal for this company, this brand. We are a business oriented airline. We are a premium oriented airline. And there's nothing that I see from what we've been through the last four months that suggest customers aren't going to value premium, value the quality of the experience, the health of the experience. But we're going to be more resilient, because there's a portion of that trouble that will go away and we'll size our business accordingly. So, I don't see anything that gives me pause. Of course, there's going to be a lot of dislocation, disruption that always happens in this industry during times of crisis, but I think we're pretty well-positioned to come out of this in a relatively stronger competitive position than we were pre-pandemic. Joe, you know we can't speculate on that. Not to be [indiscernible] but that would be a really, really inappropriate response I'd have to give on that. Not other than what's already been disclosed, which is that we are contributing through deferral of brand fees, as well as certain other joint venture fees that we would typically earn. We were excited to see the recapitalization come about. It's been an extraordinarily difficult few months holding that together. And all stakeholders have made some meaningful contributions to enable Virgin to fly again. And we're excited about that. Sure. We have about two-thirds of the revenue coming in from newly purchased tickets and about a third coming in from reissues and credits from postponed journey. So, getting a significant number of new journeys coming in, which is a good sign. If I could recharacterize it from a slump to really a much slower growth rate is that the industry had an awful lot of capacity going from June into July. And so what we've seen is in June, we were growing at about 20% every week, week-over-week. And I think maybe in some ways that capacity is going to take a little bit longer to get absorbed, because the growth rates are -- if you take 4th of July out, they're coming in between 5% and 10%, now. So the growth is at a much slower rate. As we look forward, it has slowed but it hasn't stalled. I mean, it's very flattish to up slightly, but it's not a slump. Hi, Dawn. It's really minimal. The flight last week was an Endeavor flight as you mentioned and that was after the fact that those three customers found out. So there's no question that in the general population, there's a virus. And when we do find out, we go back and contact trace with anyone that would have been in the immediate vicinity of a customer. But I can tell you those instances are really, really small. And certainly, no instances that we've been aware of where there's been any transmission on board our planes. Hi Claire, this is Ed. I don't know that it needs to pass a law. But I certainly see the opportunity to reinforce the work that the airlines are doing to ensure that customers wear their masks both in the airports as well as onboard our planes is helpful. The airlines are I think are doing a very good job of reinforcing that, as well as candidly customers on board planes. If someone's not wearing a mask, they quickly get pointed out and discussion with our flight attendants occur quickly. So, it's really important that we as a nation comply with mask policy or an industry that's got a lot of regulation. I don't know that we need another regulation around mask wearing, but it'd be helpful but stronger that our federal government can reinforce the need to wear masks, the better. Not just on air travel, but in life, in general. Leslie, it's really premature. The pilot retirement plan still has almost a week yet to run. So we'll be in a better position to assess that over the next month. And we're continuing to work with Alpha to identify ways to mitigate the need to displace pilots and furlough. We have received a lot of customer feedback, and in fact, I would say when we surveyed customers today, about reasons you're purchasing a ticket on Delta, the space onboard the plane, the block middle seats has gone to the number one reason why customers are choosing Delta. They see it consistent with our brand. Everyone appreciates, it's not going to last forever. But in the face of a health crisis, that space onboard really matters and customers are telling that. We're seeing it in our net promoter scores, which have gone up considerably on a year-over-year basis, up 20 points in the month of June over last June, which last year was already a good number. And, we hear it from our corporates, we hear anecdotally from many of our travelers. It's not a brand or marketing investment, and no, we're not raising our fares to block the middle seat. This is, to us, a really important safety feature and it's a health crisis that we're in our country. By being the most disciplined and put it in terms of the amount of supply and capacity that we're offering, that's benefiting our pricing and yield of course. And that's helping us to have a better price onboard the overall cabin, so indirectly, that is coming through in price. But this is not -- that's not the objective. The objective here is to make certain that we're restoring consumer confidence in air travel and being true to our brand promises."

            "name": "Paul Jacobson",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everybody. This June quarter results we reported this morning illustrate the truly staggering impact of this pandemic on our business. Revenues declined 91%, and we reported a $3.9 billion pre-tax loss, one of the largest in Delta's history. Results exclude several items directly related to the impact from COVID-19 and our response, including $2.5 billion in impairment charges from fleet-related decisions, $2.1 billion in write-downs related to equity partners and a $1.3 billion benefit from the CARES Act grant recognized during the quarter. During this quarter, our total operating expenses declined $5.5 billion or 53%. The June quarter cost performance was more than $400 million better than our original expectations, in part due to the incredible contributions of more than 40,000 employees, who have elected to take voluntary unpaid leaves. With substantially reduced flying, fuel expense was nearly $2 billion lower compared to the prior year quarter, and we generated over $250 million of savings from parking more than 700 aircrafts. We were also able to reduce facilities expense by consolidating concourses and temporarily closing sky clubs, while eliminating nearly all discretionary spending. In the September quarter, we expect to achieve a similar 50% year-over-year reduction in operating expenses, despite a sequential increase in capacity. This reflects the increased variability we've achieved in our cost structure and what we've been discussing, since the COVID epidemic. As Ed said, our top financial priority remains to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to whether whatever comes at us. To this end, we've taken decisive action to bolster our liquidity position, ending the quarter with $15.7 billion of liquidity. Daily cash burn also improved sequentially each month during the quarter to average $27 million in the month of June. This outperformed our initial expectation of $50 million cash burn per day during the month of June. One-third of that improvement came from better cost performance with two-thirds from an improvement in net sales, which inflected positive in early June and remained there. It's worth noting that approximately $10 million of our cash burn is attributable to our international business, so our domestic business is only burning $17 million a day, which is a testament to the efficiency of the reduced operation. As Ed mentioned, we are staying agile to balance what we're seeing in the revenue environment with our ability to get costs out of the business. This approach improves our cash burn trajectory, which helps us to preserve our balance sheet capacity for the future. The strength of our balance sheet has been evident during the pandemic, as we have raised $15 billion in new liquidity at a blended average rate of 5.5%. When combined with funds received under the CARES Act Payroll Support Program, we ended the June quarter with this $15.7 billion of liquidity. Even with no improvement in our cash burn rate, this equates to 19 months of liquidity. This is more than sufficient to address our upcoming maturities. But if needed, we have the ability to continue to raise additional capital through either our own efforts by leveraging our unencumbered assets, or electing to participate in the CARES Act Secured Loan Program. In an effort to ensure compliance and flexibility throughout the recovery, we also amended all of our bank credit facilities to permanently replace the fixed charge coverage covenant with the $2 billion minimum liquidity covenant. So in spite of the significant amount of debt we have raised, our adjusted net debt has only increased by $3.4 billion since the start of the year to $13.9 billion. Reducing our daily cash burn is critical to keeping the net debt down, and that is why we remain uniquely focused on it. In closing, while we have a long road ahead of us, we've made tremendous progress in just the last four months. By raising cash early and aggressively managing costs, we are prepared to navigate what will be a volatile revenue period, while making decisions to position Delta well for the eventual recovery. Our people have acted quickly and decisively to protect our customers and our company. And I'm so proud of what the people of Delta have accomplished with that grace, professionalism and determination that Ed mentioned. They are the reason I'm confident, we will emerge from this crisis as a stronger, more resilient Delta as our customers return. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Good morning, Jamie. There's a lot in that question. I think we're still really assessing the overlap right now between the early retirement and the voluntary leave program. So there's a sense of duplication there. But what it does do at an absolute minimum is it puts permanence around what were short-term leaves and volatility. So, we expect that in addition to the leaves that Ed mentioned -- I'm sorry, the separations that Ed mentioned voluntarily. We also have leaves that will continue on top of that. So we're going to continue to assess and see where we stand on the salaries and related line. There's no doubt that that's been a big driver of how we've gotten our cash burn down in quick action. And as we continue to shape the airline for how we think it's going to be sized next summer and into the future, we've got to be able to manage all of that agility and flexibility. And the voluntary leaves are going to continue to be an important piece of that puzzle going forward. So as we think about salaries and related, we should get to that kind of trend line I would think in that fourth quarter, first quarter, but then we'll see as demand shapes back, customers are ultimately going to determine how big the airline is. So Jamie, we're an infinitely competitive business, but hats off to United for that execution, I thought they did a very good job with that. And it's one that I think is available to a multitude of carriers. That is not included in the most recent guidance that we've given of $6 billion to $7 billion of unencumbered assets. And we're looking at all of our options and we'll continue to keep them open. We have advanced the ball with the government by signing the term sheet, which they announced a couple of weeks ago. And we continue to move along that process, but we have not decided to take a government loan. And we're assessing really all of our options, as well as the environment that we're in. Well, I'll start with that Duane. First of all, good morning. The trajectory that we've been on and what we articulated through June was that we had seen steadily increasing net sales, that was coming really from both variables. Sales were going up and trending higher, while at the same time refunds have been trending down, which put us from a -- I think at the beginning we said $20 million to $30 million a day, we were burning in March to turning positive and staying there in June. So while we've seen that that sales growth level off in the wake of the latest rise in infections, and has remained relatively stable in that area. So, as we see the continued trajectory of reducing our operating expenses 50%, and keeping those net sales numbers relatively flat, that's where July comes out flat to June. Yes. I think Duane, we'll take that offline and it'll be more apparent when the Q comes out later today of just the breakdown between financing leases and operating leases, under all the new accounting guidelines. So it's all there, but it has a little bit of a different geography to it, depending on the transactions. And Joe, on the cash burn, so we had seen a pretty steady progression upwards of sales and slight decline in refunds, really kind of from May to early mid-June. And that's when we started to see it stabilize. So the data that we have seen so far in July is pretty consistent with what we saw at the end of June, which is really reflective of what we've seen in this latest wave of infection throughout the country. And that's why we have got the confidence that it's somewhat stabilized here at these levels. And hopefully, if things start to improve we can see improvements of those levels as we get later into the quarter. Good morning, Mike. That's a bit of a doocey [ph] of a question, because I think the one thing we all know is that the historical air traffic liability models have broken right now. It's not behaving in any way that a normalized seasonality pattern would have. As evidence, we have actually refunded now over $2 billion of that ATLs since the beginning of year, which the bulk of that has been done in the post-COVID, post-March 1, timeframe. So, we actually think that a lot of that refund activity particularly in the Trans-Atlantic and International destinations which were already booked pre-COVID heading into the summer, we have refunded a lot of that activity in it. So a little bit of a -- it's a big contributor to the international cash burn that I gave that comp position in my prepared remarks. So, we can actually see things stabilizing and we would expect that refunds will continue to trend down in the status quo. Obviously, it's going to be choppy, but any new sales data that come in, any new demand should be accretive to the ATL in a way that seasonally you wouldn't necessarily expect. So, we're prepared for that. I think the one given is that there is a lot of uncertainty here, which is why we have gone the route of really looking to raise as much liquidity as we can. Yes, sure. So, we didn't give any formal CapEx guidance, because it's really the same as we gave immediately after the COVID epidemic, which is we have essentially eliminated all CapEx. There is some technology spend on projects that are already in process and some small purchases here and there, but it's not material to the overall story. As far as debt maturities go, the biggest one we have is the $450 million maturity in December. When you combine that with a $600 million unsecured in April of '21, that's the unsecured deal that we just took out. So we've already successfully refinanced that. And then we have the $3 billion bridge loan that is due in March, that has collateral attached to it that we haven't decided exactly what to do with that. As part of the amendment to the credit facilities, we also extended by one year a $1.3 billion maturity in April of our revolver. So that's pushed out to 2022. So we've actually gotten a very, very good handle on all of the maturities really for the next 18 months. Hey, good morning, Savi. I think, as we've mentioned in our comments, we're kind of on this trajectory right now as things have stabilized. And we're continuing to assess what the second-half looks like. So as we continue to monitor capacity and demand that'll affect what we do on the cost input side as well. But, I think we're really counting on some continued improvement in demand, however gradual and however choppy that might be. We are 90 days into this and we already know a lot more about the virus. And that's giving a little bit more confidence in the longer and intermediate-term demand profile. But we've got to continue to be agile. So, I think we'll kind of be in this mid-20s level, as we continue to assess. And if we need to take further actions, we will. So, at a really high level Brandon, if you look at our cash burn in June as well as in July and that $27 million a day number, virtually all of that needs to come through improvement in net cash sales. It's going to come in two ways, so one, the refund activity will continue to wind down. That will be a contributor in that and that's probably in the plus or minus $5 million a day improvement by the time we get to the end of the year, and which leaves about $20 million of cash sales improvement. And that's if you think of a company our size is about a 20% improvement in our overall business volume that will get us there. So, we'll probably need to see that $25 million come from the commercial side of the business, but that's still is the roadmap to get to breakeven. Yes, we've seen Joe about a 50% reduction in the last quarter. I think if you look at some of American Express's commentary, it's in line to even slightly better than some of the cards in their portfolio, which I think is encouraging. That means that that people remain attached to the brand and they see value in the miles program. So we're going to continue to see that, but it obviously has been far more resilient than the demand for tickets and for travel itself, which is what we expected. Thank you. Good morning, Tracy. This is Paul. So, the trainer refinery in the quarter we had about $100 million loss in the quarter, which was almost entirely focused in the month of April. So the refinery is continuing to produce economics at breakeven levels on the current trends. And as with everything in the business we're looking at everything. But our plans have not changed with respect to the refinery right now."

We see no show rates grow from about 3% historically to about high-single digits. And most people at day of departure who have reservations are showing up for the flight. But the higher no show rates also makes it a little bit harder to revenue manage with the caps. So we've been managing through that. And we hope we can get better and better at that as we move through the fall. But clearly giving people more flexibility is where we need to be as there's so much uncertainty in the virus right now.

        "content": "Operator: Good morning everyone and welcome to the Delta Air Lines March Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Lauren and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJill Greer: Thanks. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. We have a small team here in the room today including our CEO, Ed Bastian. Our President, Glen Hauenstein and our CFO Paul Jacobson. The rest of our leadership team is on the line for the Q&A. The call today will focus on our response to COVID-19 with Ed giving an overview of our priorities and Paul giving an expense and liquidity update. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question in every follow up. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com and with that I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Bastian: Thanks Jill. Good morning everyone. We appreciate you taking time to join us today. The first quarter of 2020 has truly been like no other in our history. The hearts and prayers of the entire Delta family are with the thousands worldwide who have lost loved ones to this pandemic. None of us could possibly have anticipated the speed with which COVID-19 has affected the health of the world's people and slowed economies across the globe. This has led to an unprecedented situation where demand for near-term air travel dropped to almost zero in a matter of weeks. Our response has been focused on three priorities; first, protecting the health and the safety of our employees and our customers. Second, preserving our financial liquidity to work through this crisis and third, ensuring we're well positioned to recover once the virus is contained and building a plan to accelerate our progress through this period of recovery. Nothing is more important than the health and the safety of our people and our customers and we have substantially increased our investment in cleanliness across the organization. These include a wide range of safety and cleaning measures on our planes, at the airports and across our facilities. And these actions won't end when the virus abates. We're taking steps to help our employees and customers practice social distancing. They include blocking middle seats, pausing automatic upgrades, modifying our boarding process and reducing meal service and other touch points. I've always said we have the best team in the industry. I want to thank all 90,000 of them for the incredible work that they are doing. Our employees are on the frontlines in the fight against the virus keeping our nation's airways open for essential travel even as they worry about their own health. Our nation has a lot of heroes in this battle against the virus and I'm proud of the men and women of Delta serving our nation in this time of need. The CARES Act Payroll Support Program recognizes the important role our employees to play in supporting the U.S. economy and we are grateful to the President, members of Congress and the administration and particularly secretary Mnuchin for their support and their leadership. On Monday, we received $2.7 billion of the $5.4 billion that's expected over the next few months. $3.8 billion of this is direct aid with $1.6 billion in a low-interest unsecured 10-year loan. When you combine this relief with our actions in the capital markets and our aggressive cost management, we expect to have at least $10 billion in liquidity at the end of the June quarter. Since early March, we've raised $5.4 billion in new financing and will likely raise several billion more this quarter. A strong indication of the confidence that the capital markets have in Delta. And while this will help ensure we have liquidity to weather the crisis with a more than 90% expected reduction in revenue this quarter we needed to quickly address costs to stem cash burn. We have taken actions to reduce our total cost base by over 50% in the June quarter. This amounts to $5 billion reduction over the prior year, which is impressive given the very short timeframe with which we had to get this done. And it was the great spirit of the Delta people that were a big part of making that happen. Right now 37,000 employees more than one third of our workforce have elected to take voluntary unpaid leaves ranging from 30 days to one year; a significant personal sacrifice that I will forever be grateful for. This is helping reduce our daily cash burn which started at $100 million per day in March down to $50 million a day starting next month in May. Paul will go into more detail on these cost reductions and the cash burn trajectory that we are seeing. After taking care of the safety of our customers and our people and protecting the financial liquidity of our enterprise, the third priority we have is starting to build our recovery plan. These are truly unprecedented times and the path to recovery is uncertain and will likely be choppy and while we all wish we could predict the pace of the recovery, the truth is our recovery will be dictated by our customers feeling safe both physically and financially to begin to travel at scale. Given the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we believe that it could be up to three years before we see a sustainable recovery and to succeed throughout that environment we will likely need to resize our business in the near term to protect it in the long term. And while the resizing business over the short term is painful it will also be an opportunity to accelerate strategies to streamline our company, simplify our fleet and reduce our fixed cost base in ways not possible in the past. It will allow us to advance the timelines as some of our critical airport infrastructure projects as we don't have the same constraints that limited progress and drove higher cost to construct. We will be focused on what it takes to regain consumer confidence to travel and we are enlisting the very best medical advisors to help us navigate the journey from testing through to vaccines and helping translate those solutions to our business model. Safety will no longer be limited to flight safety but personal safety as well. And while we may have more questions than answers about our path forward at present one thing that is certain it is that the strengths that are core to Delta's business our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability are enduring. These advantages will continue to differentiate Delta and position us to succeed. In short, we have the same aspirations for our company today that we had a short 60 days ago and while the path to recovery may take several years there are many aspects to this crisis that will make us a better, stronger and more resilient airline. In fact, I believe that the customer of tomorrow will place a higher premium on the quality of service than ever before and that is our calling card, the strength of our brand, our reliability and the service excellence of our people redefining personal safety for our customers and serving as the bedrock not just for our recovery but our acceleration into the future. So that is how we're navigating this crisis, taking the very best care of our customers and our people, preserving the financial liquidity of the enterprise and building a plan to not just rescale the business over the recovery period but to streamline it and accelerate progress on our long-term strategy. I would like to thank all of our employees, our partners, our community and government leaders, our suppliers, our banks, our owners everyone who is helping to contribute to protect Delta's long-term success. Our customers continue to send thousands of strong messages of support on a daily basis which I greatly appreciate and I'd also appreciate the great work of our leadership team in navigating a core in which we know we will prevail. Thank you all for that. And before I turn the call over to Paul, I have some good news that I hope you have all heard. As you know Paul had announced his plans to retire on February 28 but he never left the office and I personally asked him to reconsider and he's graciously agreed. Paul is an incredibly important part of our team and we're fortunate that he will remain as Delta CFO. Paul?\nPaul Jacobson: Thank you Ed and good morning everybody. Thank you all for joining us. It is great to be here and thank you for that Ed. Our March quarter pre-tax loss of $422 million, $1.3 billion lower than last year was Delta's first quarterly loss in almost decade. As revenues rapidly deteriorated through the month of March we took decisive action to reduce our cost base and preserve liquidity ending the quarter with $6 billion in cash. Our ability to move the needle on costs in the month of March was limited as schedules and bid periods were largely set. Starting this month however, our cost structure has taken a big step down with the adjustments we have made. These actions include strategically parking more than 650 aircrafts to get optimal maintenance savings and reducing our facilities expense by consolidating concourses and temporarily closing Sky Clubs. We've eliminated the majority of our discretionary spend for things like contractors and advertising as well. We also instituted a hiring freeze and reduced work hours across the business and as Ed mentioned 37,000 of our employees have volunteered to take an unpaid leave of absence. Together these actions result in savings of approximately $550 million in the June quarter alone. With such a large capacity pull down we needed to go beyond what we normally would consider volume related costs. Because of our aggressive cost management we were able to swiftly make 60% of our total operating expenses variable in this environment. These efforts have offset more than $200 million of unplanned expenditures associated with new cleaning procedures and the recent debt raises that we've accomplished. Combined with $2 billion in lower fuel expense from reduced flying and lower fuel prices we expect a $5 billion reduction in total operating expense for the June quarter. Our ability to achieve these savings simply would not be possible without the dedication, spirit and commitment of the Delta people. With the immediate needs of the June quarter addressed, we're now beginning to think about how we reset the cost structure of the company for the longer term. Glen and his team are developing scenario views of what the revenue environment might look like for the next several years. This will underpin not only how our network should adapt but how our cost structure will need to as well. In the current environment, we can take a fresh zero-based look at our cost structure. Especially where we spend money on overhead like facilities, advertising and third-party contract providers. And as Ed mentioned accelerating work on initiatives like fleet simplification will have a lasting benefit to our cost structure going forward because ultimately cost reductions are the biggest lever to mitigate cash burn in an uncertain revenue environment. At the end of March a cash burn was running approximately $100 million per day. You can think of this in two parts; roughly $10 million to $20 million in negative net sales as refunds outpaced bookings and the difference in expense burn. As we move through the June quarter we expect net sales to remain slightly negative as we work down our refund backlog and take additional capacity actions. When closed in demand returns cash will recover as corporate customers purchase new tickets and leisure travelers are utilizing their travel credits over a multi-year period. In addition to our work on expenses we've had good success negotiating deferred payments to airports, vendors and lessors. During this time we've also moved quickly to reduce capital outflows cutting more than $3 billion of our planned 2020 CapEx, suspending all shareholder returns and deferring elective voluntary pension funding. Putting this together, we expect cash burn should come down to $50 million per day beginning in May, a 50% reduction from where we were just a few short weeks ago. That moderation should continue in the back half of the year as revenue recovers modestly but we are prepared for cash flow to remain negative through the end of the year. To make it through this period we have been actively and aggressively raising liquidity. The work we put into the balance sheet over the last decade has made a tremendous difference as we went into this crisis with more than $20 billion in unencumbered assets and low debt levels. Since early March, we've raised $5.4 billion of new financing at an average rate of just under 4% encumbering approximately $6.5 billion of collateral. For the remainder of the year we have an exhaustive list of potential initiatives that we could action if needed to further bolster liquidity. Among other things this list includes raising additional debt against our remaining unencumbered assets. We are also eligible for a $4.6 billion secured loan under the CARES Act. While we plan to apply for that loan later this month to reserve our place we have several months to determine if we will take those funds and accept the loan. In closing, Delta has experienced shocks before perhaps not this big but in many ways we spent the last decade preparing for this next disruption. Our people have acted quickly and decisively to protect the financial health of the organization and I'm proud of what the team has accomplished in just a short period of time. This environment remains fluid and anything but predictable. But we will continue to plan for every eventuality and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure that Delta is positioned to help lead the industry and the economy out of this crisis. And with that I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A.\nJill Greer: Thanks Paul. Lauren if you could give the analysts the instructions to get into the call queue.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Good morning everyone. Can you hear me okay?\nEd Bastian: We can.\nPaul Jacobson: Good morning Andrew.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you for the time. Ed or Paul, Paul you gave a little bit of color around this but can you maybe, provide a bit more granularity on how you get from $100 million of cash burn at the end of March as $50 million run rates kind of in the back half of the second quarter? What's the biggest drivers here? Is it CapEx? What are some of your assumptions around the air traffic liability, draw down, any opportunities at the refinery, etc? So any color here would be helpful.\nPaul Jacobson: Sure. Thanks. First of all thanks Andrew for being here and for your question. It really is the across the board effort, across the expense base obviously certain volume based costs like passenger commissions, passenger service items have come down commensurate with the loss of travel demand. We've seen 80% to 90% reductions in some of those line items. We mentioned briefly in early march that we were taking actions across our maintenance program and Jill and our technical operations team has done an amazing job of stripping out over 80% of our maintenance costs in the June quarter year-over-year. That's largely as a function of the fact that the performing fleet today doesn't need nearly as much inventory of serviceable parts and components that we had planned. So we've been able to shift our focus to those critical items reducing over 80% from that. We mentioned all the salaries and related across-the-board that has been a collective effort coming forward. The suspension of CapEx, obviously a big piece of that, we had done a good bit of that even in the second half of March but really it's across the operational side that's driving a lot of that incremental benefit.\nEd Bastian: The other thing Andrew is all the leaves, over 30,000 employees have taken voluntary leaves many of them in April, the current month were in on an unpaid basis and are extending those throughout not just the quarter but some into the full year and those are monumental and they're really helpful.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Thank you for that. And then just second question here maybe Ed, a bigger picture question here for you on your fleets given some of your comments on what you see kind of a whole long recovery process here? So when you look at the other side of this crisis what do you think will be the biggest changes for the Delta fleet? Do you think it will be a little bit more weighted towards newer aircraft with varying economics and how are you thinking about that and especially as you speak with the OEMs right now? Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Well, certainly anything that was scheduled to retire over the next five years as an accelerated path towards retirement just to be very-very simple and straightforward. If the MD 80s were already retiring this year so that's on the MD 90s. We'll probably be making that decision soon in a similar vein. We got 767, 757 there's some of the older models that we operate. We will certainly be looking at the a RJ's with smaller RJ's that we operate. But we'll be taking the time to, as they say accelerate into the future and fast-forwarding many of these decisions with simplification and streamlining of our entire business model at the core of the new normal for Delta. Many of things that we're on a path to do. I think we shorten that pathway considerably as a result of this crisis.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you for that.\nEd Bastian: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey good morning everybody. Paul the best news of today is that you're with us on the call and we'll be going forward. I'm sure you're going to hear that from others but I did want to add my voice after Ed's comments. Now when you spoke at our conference a month ago, a month and a half whatever at that time it was $20 billion unencumbered asset pool. You said the recent deals drew that down by about $6.5 billion. Does that mean the current pool is $13.5 billion or have any of the underlying assets been revalued and as a clarification on that have you yet identified what collateral you might post as part of a government loan and whether a treasury could take equity in SkyMiles? \nPaul Jacobson: Well first of all Jamie, thank you for your kind comments. It's really good to be here too. The simple math is the right one, the way we're looking at it we have constantly updated the market values of the collateral and where we look. So yes, against what we just disclosed we've got about $13.5 billion that we continue to review and we have a list against those assets. So we're going to continue to move forward on raising liquidity, making sure that we shore up that balance sheet and keeping all options on the table. As for the government loan program we haven't had any specific conversations as I mentioned in my comments. We have worked out with them that we are going to apply for the grant, I'm sorry for the loan by April 30, but the provisions of that program give us until September 30 to decide whether we will actually action and structure and take that loan going forward.\nJamie Baker: That helps. Sorry go ahead.\nPaul Jacobson: No, I was going to say no conversations about any specific collateral at this point in time. We have shared with them that we are committed as is the -- not just the language but the spirit of the program to access it if there are no reasonable capital markets opportunities available and we still feel pretty good about what's available to us in the market. \nJamie Baker: Got it. And second question, you also made reference to aircraft CapEx essentially going down to zero. Looking to clarify that, does that mean that you're simply not sending any cash to Telus or you\u2019re saying that there's full financing already in place. To put differently if we do see an aircraft delivered this year should we assume that it is fully financed?\nEd Bastian: Hi Jamie. It's Ed.\nJamie Baker: Hi Ed.\nEd Bastian: Hi. The situation with Airbus is one that obviously we've got a great relationship. We're having constructive dialogue but the reality is as I've shared with gentlemen and he shares our pain. We've got 600 aircrafts on the ground. We don't need any more aircraft to be putting on the ground and we'll work through this issue. We don't have any plans to expend cash to your point over the balance of this year on new aircraft, whether eventually over the course of the year we wind up taking some fully financed aircraft. It's an open question right now but the reality is is that they're, they're good partners and they're working with us on it.\nJamie Baker: I appreciate it. Thank you both.\nEd Bastian: Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Paul, glad you never left. So two questions here when we think about the Payroll Support Program and as you [indiscernible] how are you going to account for that? How does that run P&L? I understand that the loan fees will show up as interest expense. That'd be like an extraordinary item?\nPaul Jacobson: So Mike good morning. The grant peace net of the loan will actually flow through as a contra expense item essentially offsetting the requirements that are in there for maintaining workforce, etc. So it'll show up as an offset to salaries and related or other operating. We're still working through that but it will flow through the P&L. The loan piece of it will obviously be capitalized on the balance sheet as a debt instrument. Interest expense will flow through that and the warrant will be reflected as equity.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay then just to be clear then just the $100 million going to $50 million it's not reflecting that as an offset coming from the P&L later or at least impacting the cash? \nPaul Jacobson: No. It's in all the cash numbers that we've talked about in terms of ending above $10 billion in June.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. [indiscernible].\nMichael Linenberg: Great. And then just secondly as we think about the Amex program. We were at a number around 4.5 on its way to call it 7 billion as we think about the components, rate doesn't change, it will probably be down in 2020 and maybe acquisition doesn't grow much or moderates is that a fair way to think about the trajectory in 2020?\nPaul Jacobson: I think so Mike. I know Amex has their call later in the week on earnings and they'll probably discuss how they're doing, how they're referring to the crisis. Clearly given the fact that passenger demand is falling also dramatically, our carts think has not fallen off nearly as dramatically but it's down in numbers in the short term and it's one of the things that's enabling us to keep, we got 10% revenue target in the current quarter compared to our current plan. That's one of the contributing factors is the spend on the card.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Mike, I think when Amex talks on Friday, I think you will probably have some better, I don't want to I am close to Steve and I know the numbers. I don't want to share anything but I think when you hear their perspective it will better answer your questions than I can.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey good morning. I wonder if you could help me as abridge the liquidity kind of getting from $6 billion to $10 billion? It appears the cash spend will be around $5.5 billion in quarter, you have the -- kind of maybe most or all of those $5.4 billion in TSP, and I think based on the disclosure you have the sale leaseback of one to two and there's kind of aircraft mortgages and perhaps some term loans there and I think that leaves a gap about $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Is that financing that you need yet to do to reach that 10 billion or am I missing something there?\nPaul Jacobson: Savi, it's Paul. I would simply say that you're good at math. That works pretty well.\nSavi Syth: I guess that math degree works out well for me.\nPaul Jacobson: You are using it well.\nSavi Syth: Just a follow up on that. As you think about your financing opportunities, I know you talked about having unencumbered assets but you think about like unencumbered assets, miles, equity or maybe even like doing something with trainer. How would you prioritize that? Or is it kind of see kind of the best fit for kind of financing going forward?\nPaul Jacobson: Well Savi, I think we have as I mentioned in exhaustive list of potential opportunities that range across the board including secured debt, equity convertible, the government loan program SkyMiles lots of different things on it. What I would say is that, we're looking to optimize two things. Number one which is availability and an ease of financing and two is just availability of the markets in general. We have found great success in both the secured debt markets as well as the sale-leaseback markets that have done particularly well for us and we would certainly put that at a higher priority than we would be thinking about equity down the road. So well, the uncertainty means that we can't rule anything out we're certainly prioritizing use of our unencumbered assets.\nEd Bastian: And I would share Savi, I would share Paul's thoughts on the financing prioritization but don't forget the most important liquidity we raised is it\u2019s cost savings, in this environment where revenue wasn't coming in the door and while it's great that we have access to the capital markets. My team is doing a very good job. The fact that we're able to save 50% of our total operating costs that we had in our forecast just 30 days ago in the current quarter that's $5 billion as well. So that's a meaningful statement of liquidity that will obviously continue to build off of.\nSavi Syth: Very good point. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. So I guess just to follow up on that, in terms of equity funding, I guess one up maybe potentially be a bit more aggressive here because if you need the equity financing in the future obviously that's not guaranteed to be there. Can you give us your thoughts there?\nEd Bastian: Brandon, you weren't real clear. Was your question about a potential equity raise? Is that what you're asking us?\nBrandon Oglenski: Sorry my phone's cutting out Ed. The question is if you need equity financing in the future it could be harder to get, so I guess why not potentially be more aggressive on that part of the balance sheet right now?\nEd Bastian: Yes. Well we're not in a position to take any options off the table. We're looking at, at all options. We have no plan for that at the moment. We've got a pretty good list of opportunities to raise liquidity from before executing that option but we're not going to exclude any option going forward until we have a better view when the recovery is going to come.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate that and then Paul, on the unencumbered assets I think around $13 billion or $14 billion you disclosed, how much of that is aircraft and what should investors expect you could get LTVs on that asset base?\nPaul Jacobson: Well, Brandon it varies. I would say that about half of that is aircraft of various ages and vintages. Some of the newer airplanes that we have been doing sale leasebacks on, we've been getting a 100% sometimes even marginally a little bit more than what we had appraised for on that basis. Some of the older airplanes as we are looking at that are going to have let's say leaseback content more secure debt type content that would have a lower loan-to-value going forward. So it really varies across the pool but we've taken that pool. We've assigned value to what we think is doable and we're marching along that plan.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the time. First question for you on the approach towards taking gross holdings and global partners obviously there's going to be quite a few markdown to those assets as we go through the next couple of months here. Would you think about that asset as a potential source of liquidity on the way back up or would you continue to think that those investments are kind of strategic and core to the Delta in the future as well?\nEd Bastian: David again you broke up a bit on the phone. Your question is about our investments in our international partners using that to raise our cash, monetizing them.\nDavid Vernon: Yes, well on the way back up yes. I'm just wondering if you may be thinking about that strategy across differently.\nEd Bastian: Those are all strategic partnerships and they'll all go through and they are all going through a very similar situation is that they arguably even more stressed than the domestic U.S. airlines are given that the international business across the board is pretty much down to very-very small numbers. We are in constant contact with them. We'll continue to provide our insight, our expertise. We're not in the position to be making any financial commitments to any of them and they are aware of that and we will work with them as the recovery takes hold. This recovery is going to be choppy. It's going to take some time. My expectation, I think our expectation is domestic will come back faster than international but international will come back and there's a path to getting there and we're very proud of those partnerships and I have no interest in trying to sell them or monetizing them at this point or any time in the future candidly.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Appreciate that color and then maybe a longer term question for Glen or Ed maybe you could comment on how investors should be thinking about the range of reasonable margins assuming demand it does take a couple of years to recover? Should we be expecting the margin profile of the business to be dependent on getting back to 2019 levels or would you expect to be able to maybe come out of this at a better margin level with less volume than you had in the past?\nGlen Hauenstein: Hey, so that's a really open-ended speculative question. How I'm looking at this from myself and we're all of 40 days into this right, is that there is a big, there's a crisis that we're in the midst of we're going to need to navigate the crisis. We're prepared at Delta to go through for whatever time it takes. We've got the liquidity. We've got the balance sheet strength. We've got the resiliency of our people in our brand. We'll get through this. It may take, take several years to get to it but we will get through it. But once we're able to demonstrate to our customers\u2019 confidence and the safety of air travel, just like we do today and play safety there's a personal safety, travel will continue. It may not continue in all of its current form. There will be some impact maybe telecommuting or some sort of things if everyone's enjoying being on Zoom videos, I personally don't but maybe some people do, maybe that'll change the nature of travel a bit but business is done face-to-face. People enjoy experiences. All the things we've seen over the last year period of years actually has, in my opinion caused people to miss travel more than ever before in this lockdown phase and we'll get back whether it means our margins are going to be at the same level. I would hope so. That's certainly going to be our goal and we'll be a smaller industry coming through this. I have no doubt and that there will be opportunities to be streamlined and I think people will pay a premium for service excellence like never before. Those are my views in the question.\nDavid Vernon: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Ed, that's so funny you just said that I was literally going to ask you about that comment you made. In the prepared remarks you said a customer of tomorrow will place a higher premium on quality of service. You seem to emphasize that in the script and I want to know what you mean by that and how are you going to position Delta to capitalize on it from a product perspectives?\nEd Bastian: Well, I think it's premature to be speculating on product per se Hunter, but I firmly agree to believe that even when you ask people what's the most important thing to get them to start traveling and it's going to be confidence in their safety, their personal safety not just their physical safety and we are, at Delta we have years and years and years of expertise in flight safety expertise and we've got rigor and analytical tools. We are the safest form of transportation in the world of any form of transportation in the U.S. aviation system. And by applying that same level of analytical rigor and insight working with the medical community and I'm not trying to be a healthcare professional here but we do have medical expertise and advisers that we are working with and will continue to work with the help translate the return of business to where people feel safe and an accommodate that. We will make whatever changes to the business model that will be necessary. If it turns out to be immunity passports will be a new form, you think about everything that came out of 9/11 with TSA and homeland security and new public agencies. Could there be a new public health agency coming out that requires a new passport to travel and I don't know but we'll be on the forefront of all those advances but I do believe people will value not just the experience but who's providing the experience and the reliability and the service excellence of that and that's our calling card, that's our brand. That's what Delta stands for.\nHunter Keay: Right. That's all fair, but yes I mean you were kind of there before too. So what I'm trying to parse out is what you expect to actually change; is one of those things it's ironic I actually about lower load factors three months ago on this call, is one of these things that maybe you think about running a lower load factor sort of permanently and having less variability in pricing. So maybe it's a 65%- 75% load factor you guys run all the time so people feel a bit more spaced out or the seats themselves are further apart. I mean like what kind of stuff are you talking about changing here that's different.\nEd Bastian: I think all those are fair observations Hunter. I don't know what the answer is. We're going to spend the time in these next few months to as we build the company that we want for the future not necessarily rebuild what we had and we'll be asking ourselves to that question. We'll be asking consumers those questions. We will be, we will have a chance to test as we move forward, as we walk through. This recovery is going to take several years. It's going to be a multi-phase. It's going to be choppy along the way. We'll have opportunities to test all those species and see what it takes. Ultimately, it's going to be what it take to inspire confidence in air travel and the safety of that maybe it's vaccine in two years on a widespread. I don't know but there's a host of ideas and options and alternatives that we are exploring and we'll do whatever it takes to make sure that we get our business model not to back to where it was but improved and more resilient for the future. Our margins whether our low factors come down or not it's possible. They certainly will be in the short to medium term. Whether they eventually get back to 90% who knows but we'll figure it out as we go. The other thing I do know is that there will be fewer airplanes flying in the skies for an extended period of time and that's going to be an opportunity for us to focus more on a more premium experience and getting paid for what we deliver.\nHunter Keay: Ed, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey thanks and thank you for doing this call. I just had a question on your international JV partners. What are the potential capital needs to keep some of them going if they are unable to get stimulus funding?\nEd Bastian: Well, I think all of our international partners are working with their local governments as to what's required to provide backstop and support similar to how we work with our government here in the U.S. I'd say the thing that's a little different in most of the international marketplace is that they're talking about loans as compared to grants and we were very successful and I give the U.S. airline aviation industry some real kudos for getting out in front of this working with A for A working with all the CEOs across our space to understand that this is not just about putting more debt on airlines balance sheets but keeping people in their jobs for a period of time to give us a chance to understand what the other side of this looks like in six months. I don't know that you'll see that on an international scale. I think there will be a lot of loans. You may see some international airlines nationalized. I think there's going to be an array of alternatives. You will see some international airlines go away. You will see some international airlines not on our specifically this is probably go through administrative and bankruptcy processes. So I think as we look at the trajectory of the recovery it's going to be slower internationally than domestically and as a result that we're going to stay really close to our partners and help provide them not the financial support but certainly the commercial support and the strategic savvy to navigate a very uncertain recovery.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks and then just for my follow-up had a couple of questions this morning on trainer. Interesting times with negative crude prices and is this something that you're in the process of winding down and to the extent you are, is there any potential working capital tailwind, if you were to wind trainer down and thanks for taking the questions.\nPaul Jacobson: Sure Duane and before I answer that I want to go back to one thing that David had asked and just to clarify for the avoidance of any doubt that the partner investments that he asked about monetizing that Ed said we're not interested, are not included in our unencumbered assets calculations just in case there was doubt about that. And as we think about trainer Duane obviously we've made some adjustments both in terms of where the market sit but also in terms of our own declines in jet fuel production, our jet fuel consumption which have been significant. We have cut production at trainer. We're operating about just a little over half of what we were and blending all that jet fuel into diesel and trainer is covering its variable costs and contributing to fixed costs in the short term. That being said we do expect it to produce a loss in the second quarter and as we think about trainer obviously we are thinking about what does the airline look like afterwards and we will assess all that. It remains an important part of our overall fuel strategy but that's obviously somewhat muted in the current environment today.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Would there be a working capital tailwind if you were to kind of wind it down?\nPaul Jacobson: Nothing significant as we have a lot of that working capital already securitized and we managed to keep that relatively constant throughout all the operation.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi everybody. And thank you very much for the time. So here are my two questions. One is, do you think this will be a demand led recovery? How are you thinking about recovery in that regard? And second, Ed you talked a lot about what you can do once people get on your planes and certainly at the gate there's a lot you can do there's probably a lot you can do in the check-in process but what about in the airport? How are you working with your airport, your various airports about how you can ensure customer, I don't know what the right word is because it's not safety but I really don't know what word is.\nEd Bastian: It is safety Helane. No, it is safety. It's personal hygiene. It's personal safety and the answer to your second question I'll take first is yes we are. We've got a lot of staff in the airport environment and not a lot of departures. So we've reallocated a lot of our team members to ensuring not just the cleanliness and the hygiene aboard our aircraft. You would probably not be surprised to know that as we continue to survey our customers even though we have fewer traveling we still continue to survey them that our cleanliness scores are through the ceiling, 3, 4X times improvements on board to planes and if you want to go check it out for yourself I'd encourage you to the travel on us. You can, you can see that. But working through the airport the facilities, working with TSA, all the things that we have to do to reduce touchpoints and allow customers the same level of safety on board to planes as they, they transit through our facilities. So we are looking through all of that. What will return through the recovery I don't know. I simply classified as a demand, I mean certainly I think demand will be there when it's safe to travel, when people feel confident that they feel through both the medical progress we make through the medical community, through government leadership when people indicate that it's safe to travel and that's when the recovery will take shape. This is very unlike anything we have ever encountered. We have encountered a lot of crisis in our industry. This one where people physically do not feel safe to venture out of their homes is unique to us and we got to inspire the confidence they have to start traveling again.\nHelane Becker: That's very helpful and if it helps I'm pretty sick of parades present. I love my house but I miss traveling.\nEd Bastian: Good. We miss seeing you Helane.\nHelane Becker: Have a day. Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Just two straightforward questions for you Paul on the marketing company the loyalty program. Is there a scenario where you could do a pre-sale with Amex and use it as collateral for government money? And then what is the value of that asset worth as you see it? I think it's a pretty big moat that's protecting shareholders from dilution at this point. So can you just talk about what would you think the assets worth?\nPaul Jacobson: Joe, I think you've done a lot more work on that than we have necessarily but I would say that we have not contemplated securitizing it or monetizing it in any way and the asset base that we have and the permitted liens under our agreements, we think ultimately would make a pretty good package if we decided to take a government loans. So I don't think we need to look to loyalty for that. As for the opportunity to do a pre-sale up, not going to get into any details. That's obviously a conversation that we would have with American Express and Ed speaks to them very regularly and that's that's borne out of the partnership mentality. It's not anything that we would comment on here publicly.\nEd Bastian: Joe. The only thing \u2013\nJoseph DeNardi: Do you have to do an equity issuance or a pre-sale in order to qualify for the government that money?\nEd Bastian: No. Joe. No, we don't. Yes, I just wanted to add on to what Paul was saying about Amex. They're great partners. We've been through thick and thin with them. We've done pre-sales in the past. If we come to the point where we feel that's an important source of liquidity, we will have good constructive conversations but we are not having conversations unlike publicly reported [documents] indicate we are not and but we're staying close to our good partners in that at some point we very well made but not, there's nothing imminent to announce it now.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. That's helpful and then I don't know if Glen is on the call or Ed, you'd like to talk about it. Can you just talk about demand. What sort of booking look like and what may be the mix of corporate versus user tells you at this point in terms of which is holding up, just any commentary you feel comfortable talking about. Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Well, I categorize this with we're bumping along the bottom here and bookings are down. Traffic is down about 95% and that's where we're sitting and it's a mix of people who need to get there that's essential people traveling as I said before. So people who need to get to see sick people, people who are first responders, people whose work goes on and it's required for them to travel. So it's really people who are needing to travel and I think as it said before as people perceive it as being safer we will see the larger volumes come back but with everybody having stay at home orders, it's hard to envision when you can't leave your house, how you would go to travel at this point.\nPaul Jacobson: Yes. It\u2019s the demand questions are hard to answer because there's not a lot of data right now but one data point which is progress is that where cash sales are now starting to equal the refunds going out the door. So that wasn't the case, 30 days ago. We are being overwhelmed by the amount of cash refunds relative to the new cash sales coming in. So that's going to take some time. We're prepared for the duration and we know we've got a good product and good service and a good brand that will be there when people go set to travel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS.\nMyles Walton: [indiscernible] comments. First, on the government assistance for payroll protection beyond September 30, as you think about it is that something you think is necessary for the industry -- the industry would ask for? \nEd Bastian: Additional government support beyond September 30 is that your question Myles?\nMyles Walton: It is. Yes.\nEd Bastian: I wouldn't speculate. My sense is the appetite for additional relief beyond that will be challenging and I think the combination of the PSP together with the loans to provide us with liquidity we need to get through this crisis. That'd be my view.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And then secondarily kind of post crisis, I know you said it would take a few years but just a business model to run an airline, do you think that now airlines are effectively going to have to sit on six months of cash expenses in cash to satisfy whatever criteria there is to weather the next pandemic should have come along?\nEd Bastian: I don't know. That would be a difficult financial burden to carry. I don't think we can build our business models to sustain once-in-a-century pandemics and we'll learn a lot from this. We will be a lot more resilient about this. This will take us a bit of time as an industry to dig out. They have got plenty of time to ask those questions in the future but for now we're very focused on weathering this storm and getting through over the next several years and then we'll have time to think about that.\nMyles Walton: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. I hope you all are safe and healthy. So two fairly quick ones. If you're not expecting any aircraft deliveries for the medium term or perhaps not even through the end of this year, is that $1.2 billion cash inflows in the sale-leaseback transaction you just closed today on aircraft already in your fleet? And then if so do you have any aircraft remaining in your fleet that might be attractive to put into a future sale-leaseback deals?\nPaul Jacobson: Good morning Katie. So the answer to your first question is absolutely those are all sale leasebacks on the existing fleet and I didn't catch the second question. Apologies.\nCatherine O'Brien: Sorry. I said are there any other remaining aircraft that would maybe be attractive to put into the future sell leaseback deals that are currently in your fleet?\nPaul Jacobson: Yes. We still have some as I mentioned in my earlier comments about half of the remaining is aircraft which includes some newer vintage models that we think are good candidates for sale leasebacks and some older aircrafts that at the end of the day probably are not that would be more in line for a secure deathbed transaction. But we still have some, yes.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Got it. Appreciate that and then maybe just for my follow-up, the rate at which you've been able to get cost out of the system is impressive. Should we expect those cost savings to increase through year-end and potentially further lower that June Q exit rate cash burns or are there any items where you've been granted deferrals in the short term that maybe come back online towards year end? Thanks.\nEd Bastian: Well, thanks Katie. We are going to do our best to continue with the programs we've got in place working through voluntary measures with our employees. They're doing a great job of taking leaves and reducing work hours and finding ways to preserve cash, our maintenance program we're doing the same thing. I think we'll have that same goal into Q3 certainly and hopefully Q4 and give us time to start building demand over the balance of the year to where the revenue can start to catch up with the level of cost savings that we're having and use that to reduce the cash burn but in the short term teams on a massive effort and I think you're going to see that continue. There\u2019s always been a lot of dialogue in our business as to what our true variable cost structure is. We're seeing that we've got a lot of variability that we've built into the cost structure and it's proving to be an important source of resiliency for us in our strategy here.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Thanks. Appreciate that.\nJill Greer: Hey Lauren, we are going to do one more question from the analysts. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Trent with Citi.\nStephen Trent: Thank you very much everybody and appreciate you taking my question. Hope everybody and your families are okay. Quick ones from me. I was wondering if you could just give us a little color on how you might pivot a little to perhaps take opportunities more air cargo flow with passenger flow depressed at the moment?\nEd Bastian: Thanks Stephen. I hope your family is well as well. We're doing that. We have a lot of work going on in the cargo space. We probably should have mentioned that during the call more. We've instituted charters going over to China as we're bringing medical supplies, PPE back to the workers on the front line of this crisis. We're working with a number of different companies to do that through. We have looked at and we're taking some of the main deck seats off our \u2013 a few of our international planes to facilitate taking greater lift in the short term and we'll continue to use those resources where it makes sense for certainly for some time to come. Team in cargo, Shawn Cole, is doing a really-really nice job and we've got a lot of people supporting in the broader community what we can do with relief efforts. Really proud. The other thing we've done, we didn't talk about is that we've repatriated over 5,000 people working with the State Department from markets that we don't even fly to historically or going into India and bringing tons of people back to their families safely and we continue to do some of those missions going forward. \nStephen Trent: Very helpful and just one last follow-up actually a follow-up to the gentleman from Stifle\u2019s questions. When we think about the credit-card side of the business, longer term, it's fair to say that a lot of that consumer oriented card activity should continue to spool up in line with your expectations. Is that fair to say?\nEd Bastian: Absolutely. Again there's nothing in this crisis that shows us any individual part of our business model. It doesn't work over time, but as long as people feel safe, everything's going to work. So spending will work, travel will work, experience will continue to be important and our partnership with American Express is incredibly strategic and important to us in the future.\nStephen Trent: Thank you very much everybody and be safe.\nEd Bastian: Thank you. You too.\nPaul Jacobson: Thanks Steve.\nJill Greer: That's going to wrap the analyst portion of the call. We're actually having some technical difficulties on the call control. So I'm going to turn it over to our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Tim Mapes to address the media.\nTim Mapes: Well, I just wanted to thank everybody for your patience and your participation today. It's unfortunate that we're having this technical issue because Ed and the executive management team had actually asked for and expressed an interest in additional time to handle questions. So I think we will follow up with the varying members of my team to get these questions answered and get them into. We had 10 reporters queued up for this. So if you don't mind we'll follow up.\nJill Greer: We will work to set up a separate call for that. Hold on just a minute.\nTim Mapes: Again thank you for your patience. We are going to follow up, the members of my team will follow up with each of the reporters that we know were in the queue today. We will get varying ways of following up on your questions but I just wanted to thank you for your time and your participation today and know that we do know who was queued up and we will followup with each of you with different members of my team. So our apologies.\nJill Greer: Thanks Lauren.\nOperator: Thank you and that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Thanks Jill. Good morning everyone. We appreciate you taking time to join us today. The first quarter of 2020 has truly been like no other in our history. The hearts and prayers of the entire Delta family are with the thousands worldwide who have lost loved ones to this pandemic. None of us could possibly have anticipated the speed with which COVID-19 has affected the health of the world's people and slowed economies across the globe. This has led to an unprecedented situation where demand for near-term air travel dropped to almost zero in a matter of weeks. Our response has been focused on three priorities; first, protecting the health and the safety of our employees and our customers. Second, preserving our financial liquidity to work through this crisis and third, ensuring we're well positioned to recover once the virus is contained and building a plan to accelerate our progress through this period of recovery. Nothing is more important than the health and the safety of our people and our customers and we have substantially increased our investment in cleanliness across the organization. These include a wide range of safety and cleaning measures on our planes, at the airports and across our facilities. And these actions won't end when the virus abates. We're taking steps to help our employees and customers practice social distancing. They include blocking middle seats, pausing automatic upgrades, modifying our boarding process and reducing meal service and other touch points. I've always said we have the best team in the industry. I want to thank all 90,000 of them for the incredible work that they are doing. Our employees are on the frontlines in the fight against the virus keeping our nation's airways open for essential travel even as they worry about their own health. Our nation has a lot of heroes in this battle against the virus and I'm proud of the men and women of Delta serving our nation in this time of need. The CARES Act Payroll Support Program recognizes the important role our employees to play in supporting the U.S. economy and we are grateful to the President, members of Congress and the administration and particularly secretary Mnuchin for their support and their leadership. On Monday, we received $2.7 billion of the $5.4 billion that's expected over the next few months. $3.8 billion of this is direct aid with $1.6 billion in a low-interest unsecured 10-year loan. When you combine this relief with our actions in the capital markets and our aggressive cost management, we expect to have at least $10 billion in liquidity at the end of the June quarter. Since early March, we've raised $5.4 billion in new financing and will likely raise several billion more this quarter. A strong indication of the confidence that the capital markets have in Delta. And while this will help ensure we have liquidity to weather the crisis with a more than 90% expected reduction in revenue this quarter we needed to quickly address costs to stem cash burn. We have taken actions to reduce our total cost base by over 50% in the June quarter. This amounts to $5 billion reduction over the prior year, which is impressive given the very short timeframe with which we had to get this done. And it was the great spirit of the Delta people that were a big part of making that happen. Right now 37,000 employees more than one third of our workforce have elected to take voluntary unpaid leaves ranging from 30 days to one year; a significant personal sacrifice that I will forever be grateful for. This is helping reduce our daily cash burn which started at $100 million per day in March down to $50 million a day starting next month in May. Paul will go into more detail on these cost reductions and the cash burn trajectory that we are seeing. After taking care of the safety of our customers and our people and protecting the financial liquidity of our enterprise, the third priority we have is starting to build our recovery plan. These are truly unprecedented times and the path to recovery is uncertain and will likely be choppy and while we all wish we could predict the pace of the recovery, the truth is our recovery will be dictated by our customers feeling safe both physically and financially to begin to travel at scale. Given the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we believe that it could be up to three years before we see a sustainable recovery and to succeed throughout that environment we will likely need to resize our business in the near term to protect it in the long term. And while the resizing business over the short term is painful it will also be an opportunity to accelerate strategies to streamline our company, simplify our fleet and reduce our fixed cost base in ways not possible in the past. It will allow us to advance the timelines as some of our critical airport infrastructure projects as we don't have the same constraints that limited progress and drove higher cost to construct. We will be focused on what it takes to regain consumer confidence to travel and we are enlisting the very best medical advisors to help us navigate the journey from testing through to vaccines and helping translate those solutions to our business model. Safety will no longer be limited to flight safety but personal safety as well. And while we may have more questions than answers about our path forward at present one thing that is certain it is that the strengths that are core to Delta's business our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability are enduring. These advantages will continue to differentiate Delta and position us to succeed. In short, we have the same aspirations for our company today that we had a short 60 days ago and while the path to recovery may take several years there are many aspects to this crisis that will make us a better, stronger and more resilient airline. In fact, I believe that the customer of tomorrow will place a higher premium on the quality of service than ever before and that is our calling card, the strength of our brand, our reliability and the service excellence of our people redefining personal safety for our customers and serving as the bedrock not just for our recovery but our acceleration into the future. So that is how we're navigating this crisis, taking the very best care of our customers and our people, preserving the financial liquidity of the enterprise and building a plan to not just rescale the business over the recovery period but to streamline it and accelerate progress on our long-term strategy. I would like to thank all of our employees, our partners, our community and government leaders, our suppliers, our banks, our owners everyone who is helping to contribute to protect Delta's long-term success. Our customers continue to send thousands of strong messages of support on a daily basis which I greatly appreciate and I'd also appreciate the great work of our leadership team in navigating a core in which we know we will prevail. Thank you all for that. And before I turn the call over to Paul, I have some good news that I hope you have all heard. As you know Paul had announced his plans to retire on February 28 but he never left the office and I personally asked him to reconsider and he's graciously agreed. Paul is an incredibly important part of our team and we're fortunate that he will remain as Delta CFO. Paul? We can. The other thing Andrew is all the leaves, over 30,000 employees have taken voluntary leaves many of them in April, the current month were in on an unpaid basis and are extending those throughout not just the quarter but some into the full year and those are monumental and they're really helpful. Well, certainly anything that was scheduled to retire over the next five years as an accelerated path towards retirement just to be very-very simple and straightforward. If the MD 80s were already retiring this year so that's on the MD 90s. We'll probably be making that decision soon in a similar vein. We got 767, 757 there's some of the older models that we operate. We will certainly be looking at the a RJ's with smaller RJ's that we operate. But we'll be taking the time to, as they say accelerate into the future and fast-forwarding many of these decisions with simplification and streamlining of our entire business model at the core of the new normal for Delta. Many of things that we're on a path to do. I think we shorten that pathway considerably as a result of this crisis. Sure. Hi Jamie. It's Ed. Hi. The situation with Airbus is one that obviously we've got a great relationship. We're having constructive dialogue but the reality is as I've shared with gentlemen and he shares our pain. We've got 600 aircrafts on the ground. We don't need any more aircraft to be putting on the ground and we'll work through this issue. We don't have any plans to expend cash to your point over the balance of this year on new aircraft, whether eventually over the course of the year we wind up taking some fully financed aircraft. It's an open question right now but the reality is is that they're, they're good partners and they're working with us on it. Thanks. Mike, I think when Amex talks on Friday, I think you will probably have some better, I don't want to I am close to Steve and I know the numbers. I don't want to share anything but I think when you hear their perspective it will better answer your questions than I can. And I would share Savi, I would share Paul's thoughts on the financing prioritization but don't forget the most important liquidity we raised is it's cost savings, in this environment where revenue wasn't coming in the door and while it's great that we have access to the capital markets. My team is doing a very good job. The fact that we're able to save 50% of our total operating costs that we had in our forecast just 30 days ago in the current quarter that's $5 billion as well. So that's a meaningful statement of liquidity that will obviously continue to build off of. Brandon, you weren't real clear. Was your question about a potential equity raise? Is that what you're asking us? Yes. Well we're not in a position to take any options off the table. We're looking at, at all options. We have no plan for that at the moment. We've got a pretty good list of opportunities to raise liquidity from before executing that option but we're not going to exclude any option going forward until we have a better view when the recovery is going to come. David again you broke up a bit on the phone. Your question is about our investments in our international partners using that to raise our cash, monetizing them. Those are all strategic partnerships and they'll all go through and they are all going through a very similar situation is that they arguably even more stressed than the domestic U.S. airlines are given that the international business across the board is pretty much down to very-very small numbers. We are in constant contact with them. We'll continue to provide our insight, our expertise. We're not in the position to be making any financial commitments to any of them and they are aware of that and we will work with them as the recovery takes hold. This recovery is going to be choppy. It's going to take some time. My expectation, I think our expectation is domestic will come back faster than international but international will come back and there's a path to getting there and we're very proud of those partnerships and I have no interest in trying to sell them or monetizing them at this point or any time in the future candidly. Well, I think it's premature to be speculating on product per se Hunter, but I firmly agree to believe that even when you ask people what's the most important thing to get them to start traveling and it's going to be confidence in their safety, their personal safety not just their physical safety and we are, at Delta we have years and years and years of expertise in flight safety expertise and we've got rigor and analytical tools. We are the safest form of transportation in the world of any form of transportation in the U.S. aviation system. And by applying that same level of analytical rigor and insight working with the medical community and I'm not trying to be a healthcare professional here but we do have medical expertise and advisers that we are working with and will continue to work with the help translate the return of business to where people feel safe and an accommodate that. We will make whatever changes to the business model that will be necessary. If it turns out to be immunity passports will be a new form, you think about everything that came out of 9/11 with TSA and homeland security and new public agencies. Could there be a new public health agency coming out that requires a new passport to travel and I don't know but we'll be on the forefront of all those advances but I do believe people will value not just the experience but who's providing the experience and the reliability and the service excellence of that and that's our calling card, that's our brand. That's what Delta stands for. I think all those are fair observations Hunter. I don't know what the answer is. We're going to spend the time in these next few months to as we build the company that we want for the future not necessarily rebuild what we had and we'll be asking ourselves to that question. We'll be asking consumers those questions. We will be, we will have a chance to test as we move forward, as we walk through. This recovery is going to take several years. It's going to be a multi-phase. It's going to be choppy along the way. We'll have opportunities to test all those species and see what it takes. Ultimately, it's going to be what it take to inspire confidence in air travel and the safety of that maybe it's vaccine in two years on a widespread. I don't know but there's a host of ideas and options and alternatives that we are exploring and we'll do whatever it takes to make sure that we get our business model not to back to where it was but improved and more resilient for the future. Our margins whether our low factors come down or not it's possible. They certainly will be in the short to medium term. Whether they eventually get back to 90% who knows but we'll figure it out as we go. The other thing I do know is that there will be fewer airplanes flying in the skies for an extended period of time and that's going to be an opportunity for us to focus more on a more premium experience and getting paid for what we deliver. Well, I think all of our international partners are working with their local governments as to what's required to provide backstop and support similar to how we work with our government here in the U.S. I'd say the thing that's a little different in most of the international marketplace is that they're talking about loans as compared to grants and we were very successful and I give the U.S. airline aviation industry some real kudos for getting out in front of this working with A for A working with all the CEOs across our space to understand that this is not just about putting more debt on airlines balance sheets but keeping people in their jobs for a period of time to give us a chance to understand what the other side of this looks like in six months. I don't know that you'll see that on an international scale. I think there will be a lot of loans. You may see some international airlines nationalized. I think there's going to be an array of alternatives. You will see some international airlines go away. You will see some international airlines not on our specifically this is probably go through administrative and bankruptcy processes. So I think as we look at the trajectory of the recovery it's going to be slower internationally than domestically and as a result that we're going to stay really close to our partners and help provide them not the financial support but certainly the commercial support and the strategic savvy to navigate a very uncertain recovery. It is safety Helane. No, it is safety. It's personal hygiene. It's personal safety and the answer to your second question I'll take first is yes we are. We've got a lot of staff in the airport environment and not a lot of departures. So we've reallocated a lot of our team members to ensuring not just the cleanliness and the hygiene aboard our aircraft. You would probably not be surprised to know that as we continue to survey our customers even though we have fewer traveling we still continue to survey them that our cleanliness scores are through the ceiling, 3, 4X times improvements on board to planes and if you want to go check it out for yourself I'd encourage you to the travel on us. You can, you can see that. But working through the airport the facilities, working with TSA, all the things that we have to do to reduce touchpoints and allow customers the same level of safety on board to planes as they, they transit through our facilities. So we are looking through all of that. What will return through the recovery I don't know. I simply classified as a demand, I mean certainly I think demand will be there when it's safe to travel, when people feel confident that they feel through both the medical progress we make through the medical community, through government leadership when people indicate that it's safe to travel and that's when the recovery will take shape. This is very unlike anything we have ever encountered. We have encountered a lot of crisis in our industry. This one where people physically do not feel safe to venture out of their homes is unique to us and we got to inspire the confidence they have to start traveling again. Good. We miss seeing you Helane. Thank you. Joe. The only thing \u2013 No. Joe. No, we don't. Yes, I just wanted to add on to what Paul was saying about Amex. They're great partners. We've been through thick and thin with them. We've done pre-sales in the past. If we come to the point where we feel that's an important source of liquidity, we will have good constructive conversations but we are not having conversations unlike publicly reported [documents] indicate we are not and but we're staying close to our good partners in that at some point we very well made but not, there's nothing imminent to announce it now. Well, I categorize this with we're bumping along the bottom here and bookings are down. Traffic is down about 95% and that's where we're sitting and it's a mix of people who need to get there that's essential people traveling as I said before. So people who need to get to see sick people, people who are first responders, people whose work goes on and it's required for them to travel. So it's really people who are needing to travel and I think as it said before as people perceive it as being safer we will see the larger volumes come back but with everybody having stay at home orders, it's hard to envision when you can't leave your house, how you would go to travel at this point. Additional government support beyond September 30 is that your question Myles? I wouldn't speculate. My sense is the appetite for additional relief beyond that will be challenging and I think the combination of the PSP together with the loans to provide us with liquidity we need to get through this crisis. That'd be my view. I don't know. That would be a difficult financial burden to carry. I don't think we can build our business models to sustain once-in-a-century pandemics and we'll learn a lot from this. We will be a lot more resilient about this. This will take us a bit of time as an industry to dig out. They have got plenty of time to ask those questions in the future but for now we're very focused on weathering this storm and getting through over the next several years and then we'll have time to think about that. Well, thanks Katie. We are going to do our best to continue with the programs we've got in place working through voluntary measures with our employees. They're doing a great job of taking leaves and reducing work hours and finding ways to preserve cash, our maintenance program we're doing the same thing. I think we'll have that same goal into Q3 certainly and hopefully Q4 and give us time to start building demand over the balance of the year to where the revenue can start to catch up with the level of cost savings that we're having and use that to reduce the cash burn but in the short term teams on a massive effort and I think you're going to see that continue. There's always been a lot of dialogue in our business as to what our true variable cost structure is. We're seeing that we've got a lot of variability that we've built into the cost structure and it's proving to be an important source of resiliency for us in our strategy here. Thanks Stephen. I hope your family is well as well. We're doing that. We have a lot of work going on in the cargo space. We probably should have mentioned that during the call more. We've instituted charters going over to China as we're bringing medical supplies, PPE back to the workers on the front line of this crisis. We're working with a number of different companies to do that through. We have looked at and we're taking some of the main deck seats off our \u2013 a few of our international planes to facilitate taking greater lift in the short term and we'll continue to use those resources where it makes sense for certainly for some time to come. Team in cargo, Shawn Cole, is doing a really-really nice job and we've got a lot of people supporting in the broader community what we can do with relief efforts. Really proud. The other thing we've done, we didn't talk about is that we've repatriated over 5,000 people working with the State Department from markets that we don't even fly to historically or going into India and bringing tons of people back to their families safely and we continue to do some of those missions going forward. Absolutely. Again there's nothing in this crisis that shows us any individual part of our business model. It doesn't work over time, but as long as people feel safe, everything's going to work. So spending will work, travel will work, experience will continue to be important and our partnership with American Express is incredibly strategic and important to us in the future. Thank you. You too."

            "name": "Paul Jacobson",
            "content": "Thank you Ed and good morning everybody. Thank you all for joining us. It is great to be here and thank you for that Ed. Our March quarter pre-tax loss of $422 million, $1.3 billion lower than last year was Delta's first quarterly loss in almost decade. As revenues rapidly deteriorated through the month of March we took decisive action to reduce our cost base and preserve liquidity ending the quarter with $6 billion in cash. Our ability to move the needle on costs in the month of March was limited as schedules and bid periods were largely set. Starting this month however, our cost structure has taken a big step down with the adjustments we have made. These actions include strategically parking more than 650 aircrafts to get optimal maintenance savings and reducing our facilities expense by consolidating concourses and temporarily closing Sky Clubs. We've eliminated the majority of our discretionary spend for things like contractors and advertising as well. We also instituted a hiring freeze and reduced work hours across the business and as Ed mentioned 37,000 of our employees have volunteered to take an unpaid leave of absence. Together these actions result in savings of approximately $550 million in the June quarter alone. With such a large capacity pull down we needed to go beyond what we normally would consider volume related costs. Because of our aggressive cost management we were able to swiftly make 60% of our total operating expenses variable in this environment. These efforts have offset more than $200 million of unplanned expenditures associated with new cleaning procedures and the recent debt raises that we've accomplished. Combined with $2 billion in lower fuel expense from reduced flying and lower fuel prices we expect a $5 billion reduction in total operating expense for the June quarter. Our ability to achieve these savings simply would not be possible without the dedication, spirit and commitment of the Delta people. With the immediate needs of the June quarter addressed, we're now beginning to think about how we reset the cost structure of the company for the longer term. Glen and his team are developing scenario views of what the revenue environment might look like for the next several years. This will underpin not only how our network should adapt but how our cost structure will need to as well. In the current environment, we can take a fresh zero-based look at our cost structure. Especially where we spend money on overhead like facilities, advertising and third-party contract providers. And as Ed mentioned accelerating work on initiatives like fleet simplification will have a lasting benefit to our cost structure going forward because ultimately cost reductions are the biggest lever to mitigate cash burn in an uncertain revenue environment. At the end of March a cash burn was running approximately $100 million per day. You can think of this in two parts; roughly $10 million to $20 million in negative net sales as refunds outpaced bookings and the difference in expense burn. As we move through the June quarter we expect net sales to remain slightly negative as we work down our refund backlog and take additional capacity actions. When closed in demand returns cash will recover as corporate customers purchase new tickets and leisure travelers are utilizing their travel credits over a multi-year period. In addition to our work on expenses we've had good success negotiating deferred payments to airports, vendors and lessors. During this time we've also moved quickly to reduce capital outflows cutting more than $3 billion of our planned 2020 CapEx, suspending all shareholder returns and deferring elective voluntary pension funding. Putting this together, we expect cash burn should come down to $50 million per day beginning in May, a 50% reduction from where we were just a few short weeks ago. That moderation should continue in the back half of the year as revenue recovers modestly but we are prepared for cash flow to remain negative through the end of the year. To make it through this period we have been actively and aggressively raising liquidity. The work we put into the balance sheet over the last decade has made a tremendous difference as we went into this crisis with more than $20 billion in unencumbered assets and low debt levels. Since early March, we've raised $5.4 billion of new financing at an average rate of just under 4% encumbering approximately $6.5 billion of collateral. For the remainder of the year we have an exhaustive list of potential initiatives that we could action if needed to further bolster liquidity. Among other things this list includes raising additional debt against our remaining unencumbered assets. We are also eligible for a $4.6 billion secured loan under the CARES Act. While we plan to apply for that loan later this month to reserve our place we have several months to determine if we will take those funds and accept the loan. In closing, Delta has experienced shocks before perhaps not this big but in many ways we spent the last decade preparing for this next disruption. Our people have acted quickly and decisively to protect the financial health of the organization and I'm proud of what the team has accomplished in just a short period of time. This environment remains fluid and anything but predictable. But we will continue to plan for every eventuality and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure that Delta is positioned to help lead the industry and the economy out of this crisis. And with that I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Good morning Andrew. Sure. Thanks. First of all thanks Andrew for being here and for your question. It really is the across the board effort, across the expense base obviously certain volume based costs like passenger commissions, passenger service items have come down commensurate with the loss of travel demand. We've seen 80% to 90% reductions in some of those line items. We mentioned briefly in early march that we were taking actions across our maintenance program and Jill and our technical operations team has done an amazing job of stripping out over 80% of our maintenance costs in the June quarter year-over-year. That's largely as a function of the fact that the performing fleet today doesn't need nearly as much inventory of serviceable parts and components that we had planned. So we've been able to shift our focus to those critical items reducing over 80% from that. We mentioned all the salaries and related across-the-board that has been a collective effort coming forward. The suspension of CapEx, obviously a big piece of that, we had done a good bit of that even in the second half of March but really it's across the operational side that's driving a lot of that incremental benefit. Well first of all Jamie, thank you for your kind comments. It's really good to be here too. The simple math is the right one, the way we're looking at it we have constantly updated the market values of the collateral and where we look. So yes, against what we just disclosed we've got about $13.5 billion that we continue to review and we have a list against those assets. So we're going to continue to move forward on raising liquidity, making sure that we shore up that balance sheet and keeping all options on the table. As for the government loan program we haven't had any specific conversations as I mentioned in my comments. We have worked out with them that we are going to apply for the grant, I'm sorry for the loan by April 30, but the provisions of that program give us until September 30 to decide whether we will actually action and structure and take that loan going forward. No, I was going to say no conversations about any specific collateral at this point in time. We have shared with them that we are committed as is the -- not just the language but the spirit of the program to access it if there are no reasonable capital markets opportunities available and we still feel pretty good about what's available to us in the market. So Mike good morning. The grant peace net of the loan will actually flow through as a contra expense item essentially offsetting the requirements that are in there for maintaining workforce, etc. So it'll show up as an offset to salaries and related or other operating. We're still working through that but it will flow through the P&L. The loan piece of it will obviously be capitalized on the balance sheet as a debt instrument. Interest expense will flow through that and the warrant will be reflected as equity. No. It's in all the cash numbers that we've talked about in terms of ending above $10 billion in June. I think so Mike. I know Amex has their call later in the week on earnings and they'll probably discuss how they're doing, how they're referring to the crisis. Clearly given the fact that passenger demand is falling also dramatically, our carts think has not fallen off nearly as dramatically but it's down in numbers in the short term and it's one of the things that's enabling us to keep, we got 10% revenue target in the current quarter compared to our current plan. That's one of the contributing factors is the spend on the card. Savi, it's Paul. I would simply say that you're good at math. That works pretty well. You are using it well. Well Savi, I think we have as I mentioned in exhaustive list of potential opportunities that range across the board including secured debt, equity convertible, the government loan program SkyMiles lots of different things on it. What I would say is that, we're looking to optimize two things. Number one which is availability and an ease of financing and two is just availability of the markets in general. We have found great success in both the secured debt markets as well as the sale-leaseback markets that have done particularly well for us and we would certainly put that at a higher priority than we would be thinking about equity down the road. So well, the uncertainty means that we can't rule anything out we're certainly prioritizing use of our unencumbered assets. Well, Brandon it varies. I would say that about half of that is aircraft of various ages and vintages. Some of the newer airplanes that we have been doing sale leasebacks on, we've been getting a 100% sometimes even marginally a little bit more than what we had appraised for on that basis. Some of the older airplanes as we are looking at that are going to have let's say leaseback content more secure debt type content that would have a lower loan-to-value going forward. So it really varies across the pool but we've taken that pool. We've assigned value to what we think is doable and we're marching along that plan. Sure Duane and before I answer that I want to go back to one thing that David had asked and just to clarify for the avoidance of any doubt that the partner investments that he asked about monetizing that Ed said we're not interested, are not included in our unencumbered assets calculations just in case there was doubt about that. And as we think about trainer Duane obviously we've made some adjustments both in terms of where the market sit but also in terms of our own declines in jet fuel production, our jet fuel consumption which have been significant. We have cut production at trainer. We're operating about just a little over half of what we were and blending all that jet fuel into diesel and trainer is covering its variable costs and contributing to fixed costs in the short term. That being said we do expect it to produce a loss in the second quarter and as we think about trainer obviously we are thinking about what does the airline look like afterwards and we will assess all that. It remains an important part of our overall fuel strategy but that's obviously somewhat muted in the current environment today. Nothing significant as we have a lot of that working capital already securitized and we managed to keep that relatively constant throughout all the operation. Joe, I think you've done a lot more work on that than we have necessarily but I would say that we have not contemplated securitizing it or monetizing it in any way and the asset base that we have and the permitted liens under our agreements, we think ultimately would make a pretty good package if we decided to take a government loans. So I don't think we need to look to loyalty for that. As for the opportunity to do a pre-sale up, not going to get into any details. That's obviously a conversation that we would have with American Express and Ed speaks to them very regularly and that's that's borne out of the partnership mentality. It's not anything that we would comment on here publicly. Yes. It's the demand questions are hard to answer because there's not a lot of data right now but one data point which is progress is that where cash sales are now starting to equal the refunds going out the door. So that wasn't the case, 30 days ago. We are being overwhelmed by the amount of cash refunds relative to the new cash sales coming in. So that's going to take some time. We're prepared for the duration and we know we've got a good product and good service and a good brand that will be there when people go set to travel. Good morning Katie. So the answer to your first question is absolutely those are all sale leasebacks on the existing fleet and I didn't catch the second question. Apologies. Yes. We still have some as I mentioned in my earlier comments about half of the remaining is aircraft which includes some newer vintage models that we think are good candidates for sale leasebacks and some older aircrafts that at the end of the day probably are not that would be more in line for a secure deathbed transaction. But we still have some, yes. Thanks Steve."

            "content": "Hey, so that's a really open-ended speculative question. How I'm looking at this from myself and we're all of 40 days into this right, is that there is a big, there's a crisis that we're in the midst of we're going to need to navigate the crisis. We're prepared at Delta to go through for whatever time it takes. We've got the liquidity. We've got the balance sheet strength. We've got the resiliency of our people in our brand. We'll get through this. It may take, take several years to get to it but we will get through it. But once we're able to demonstrate to our customers' confidence and the safety of air travel, just like we do today and play safety there's a personal safety, travel will continue. It may not continue in all of its current form. There will be some impact maybe telecommuting or some sort of things if everyone's enjoying being on Zoom videos, I personally don't but maybe some people do, maybe that'll change the nature of travel a bit but business is done face-to-face. People enjoy experiences. All the things we've seen over the last year period of years actually has, in my opinion caused people to miss travel more than ever before in this lockdown phase and we'll get back whether it means our margins are going to be at the same level. I would hope so. That's certainly going to be our goal and we'll be a smaller industry coming through this. I have no doubt and that there will be opportunities to be streamlined and I think people will pay a premium for service excellence like never before. Those are my views in the question."

My name is Cody, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Cody. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our December quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. Joining us today from Atlanta are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta\u2019s performance and strategy and Glen will provide an update on revenue and Dan will discuss cost and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we will take analyst questions and we ask you please limit yourself to one question with a brief follow-up so we can get to as many of you as possible. And after the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Bastian: Well, thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. I really appreciate you joining us today. Before getting into the December quarter results and outlook, I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing the current environment. As everyone is aware, the Omicron variant has significantly impacted our people, our customers, and our operation as well as most parts of society over the last three weeks. The combination of the rapid spread of the variant at the peak of a strong holiday demand period and in the face of extreme winter condition in parts of the country, created some of the most difficult travel conditions that we ever remember experiencing. I am incredibly appreciative of the great work that our frontline team has done and continue to do to help our customers get to where they need to be as safely and quickly as possible, no matter the circumstances. Our teams have faced these difficulties head on, while also managing the impact of the virus in their own lives. And I want to thank every member of the Delta team for your work during a very challenging period. To our customers who have been affected, we appreciate your patience and your understanding. The good news is that over the past seven days, our operation has stabilized with Omicron-related cancellations impacting only about 1% of our flights. And since Sunday, the number of Omicron-affected cancellations are around 20 a day, out of nearly 4,000 daily flights. And in fact, yesterday, we only had two Omicron-related mainline cancellations. So, while the new variant is not done, it appears that the worst maybe behind us. Based on how quickly the case counts have risen, our medical team expects cases to peak in the U.S. over the next few days, followed by a steep decline in cases. And we are already starting to see that happen amongst our own staff. Given the high transmissibility and lower severity of Omicron, this variant is likely to mark the shift in COVID-19 from being a pandemic to a manageable and ordinary seasonal virus, which should accelerate the path to a normalized environment. When we spoke last month about Omicron as a risk at Capital Markets Day, a lot was unknown. Today, we know a lot more. And while the first 60 days of the year will be impacted, we are confident that the pace of travel recovery will resume its December trajectory as we move into President\u2019s Day weekend and a strong spring and summer travel season are ahead of us. So as we reflect on 2021, it was a year like no other for Delta. While challenging, we made significant progress in our recovery. At Capital Markets Day, we highlighted that our competitive strengths have deepened through the course of the past two years and I am extremely proud of our entire team for all their efforts. Full year revenue of $27 billion in 2021 improved nearly $11 billion or 67% from 2020, with the rate of recovery accelerating from only 25%, as measured against 2019 at the start of the year to a close of the year of nearly 80% as we exited December. This resulted in a full year 2021 pre-tax loss of $3.4 billion. And while we obviously have still much work ahead of us, our pre-tax results improved by $5.5 billion versus 2020 and included a profit of around $400 million for the second half of this year. This performance positions Delta as the only major U.S. airline to achieve second half profitability and demonstrates that we have significant momentum in the continued restoration of our financial foundation. Sharing our success is one of the pillars of Delta\u2019s culture, which is why we are happy to announce this morning a special profit sharing payment for all global employees. On February 14, the vast majority of our people will receive a payment of $1,250. This is a well-earned recognition for the incredible work they have done over the past year to move our airline through the crisis and position us for recovery. Turning to December quarter highlights and our March outlook. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a pre-tax profit of $170 million. Excluding the impact of Omicron disruptions, we estimate our profitability would have been approximately $250 million in the quarter. This was on revenue that was 74% recover to 2019 levels, up 8 points from the September quarter. We started the quarter with lingering impacts to the prior variant, but encouraged by the significant improvement in demand and pricing that we saw throughout the quarter in each of our passenger segments. Turning to the March outlook, we expect to incur pre-tax losses in the months of January and February before returning to solid profitability in the month of March. The Omicron case surge is impacting business travel and international recovery the most. As meetings are canceled, planned office reopenings are postponed and countries put restrictions back in place. On the consumer side, we are seeing some near-term hesitation and booking behavior given the prominence of COVID in our daily lives. And that, combined with operational challenges that the industry is facing, consumers are delaying travel until case counts subside and the industry operational reliability is restored. So as a result, we are seeing the rate of recovery step down in the months of January and February to approximately 70% versus \u201819 levels from nearly 80% where we were in December. And while the downturn in demand has been quick, we expect an equally rapid improvement once U.S. case counts begin to decline. We remain confident in a strong spring and summer travel season, with significant pent-up demand for consumer and business travel, both domestically and internationally. We expect the month of March to return to the recovery trajectory that we were on in December, resulting in revenue recovery of 72% to 76% for the full quarter. Glen will talk in greater detail about the revenue environment and Dan will walk through our costs shortly. Based on our current outlook, we expect first quarter to be the only loss-making quarter for the year. And we are confident that we will generate a meaningful profit for the full year of 2022 as the recovery resumes and accelerates in the spring and the summer. Despite the challenges of the current environment, the multi-year recovery plan that we laid out last month at Capital Markets Day is unchanged. No one is better positioned than Delta to lead the recovery as business travelers return to the skies. Delta is also uniquely prepared to benefit from the reopening of international markets, which we are optimistic we will start seeing this spring as restrictions lift. Our three core priorities discussed last month remain unchanged: fortifying our trusted consumer brand; restoring financial performance and foundation; and building a better future for our people and our planet. As part of this, we remain firmly committed to our values and ESG goals, including our commitment to fighting climate change and moving forward towards the future of net zero aviation. We recently announced the hiring of our new Chief Sustainability Officer, Pam Fletcher, the industry\u2019s only C-level CSO. Pam established an impressive track record as a senior leader at General Motors and has an extensive history of putting the customer first and developing products that help to enable a world free of emissions. So, as we move past the final phase of the pandemic, I am confident that we will continue our trajectory to not only emerge stronger than before, but to expand our lead in the industry and strengthen our position as the premium airline of choice in the years ahead. Our ambition is to transcend the industry and create significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Everything we have done during this long crisis puts us closer to achieving that ambition. Thank you again. And with that, I will turn the call over to Glen.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. Like Ed, I couldn\u2019t be prouder of what the Delta people accomplished during 2021. And I want to congratulate our people on their much deserved special profit sharing payout they will be receiving later next month. During the December quarter, we generated $8.4 billion of revenue. This was above our expectations at the onset of the quarter, driven by strong consumer demand over the holidays. Total RASM was up 6% from the September quarter on a 7% improvement in yield. For the quarter, capacity was 79% restored versus 2019, 5 points below the industry as we maintained a disciplined approach to restoring our capacity. The strengths we have talked about last month at Capital Markets Day are evident in our December quarter results. First, we saw a very strong demand during the holiday period. Domestic results were particularly strong, with holiday PRASM finishing up 8% versus 2019 and with passenger revenue more than 90% recovered. Second, long-haul international trends were positive in October and November as borders reopened and restrictions lifted. This momentum stalled in the second half of December as the Omicron variant resulted in more stringent restrictions and impacted our bookings. Third, we saw continued progression of business travel, with domestic volumes approaching 60% restored during the December quarter. Fourth, our premium products continued to perform well. Domestic premium revenue was 84% recovered versus December quarter \u201819, 9 points better than Main Cabin. Fifth, our diverse revenue streams remain resilient. Amex remuneration during the quarter was more than 110% restored and cargo revenue was more than 160% of 2019 levels. We also continued to see very strong consumer engagement with another record quarter for Fly Delta app downloads and sign-ups for our loyalty program. In the December quarter, we added 1.5 million new SkyMiles members, up 5% from 2019 levels. For all of \u201821, we added 5.5 million new SkyMiles members. This growing engagement demonstrates strong brand preference and our customers\u2019 desire to travel on Delta in 2022. As Ed discussed, the recent rise in COVID cases is having an impact on near-term demand and bookings. Omicron has been different than previous waves. While infections are thankfully less severe in most cases, its high transmissibility is resulting in a swift increase in case counts and impacting short-term demand. With U.S. case counts expected to peak within the next few days, we expect booking levels to rebound quickly. Once case counts begin to decline, we expect revenues to rebound within 30 to 45 days. Additionally, we expect some of the January and February demand decline to be recaptured in future as customers make up for canceled trips. Consistent with our approach all along, we are remaining nimble and agile in how we fly our network. For the March quarter, we expect our capacity between \u2013 to be between 83% and 85% restored a few points below our initial expectation. This includes a more conservative approach to long-haul international flying that we expect to be and we expect to be 15 to 20 points lower than the industry. We have also actioned our regional capacity to ensure labor constraints at regional providers do not impact our operational integrity. We expect these constraints will ease in the second half of the year. For 2022, we still expect our full year capacity to be approximately 90% recovered versus 2019, with the progression weighted to the back half of the year, but this will ultimately be determined by demand. As we outlined at Capital Markets Day last month, Delta is well-positioned for the next phase of the recovery. The Delta people have proven time and time again why Delta is the global airline of choice. We remain focused on improving our competitive position and extending our commercial advantages by investing in premium products, growing our loyalty ecosystem and increasing our revenue diversification. We are confident that the demand recovery will accelerate as the variant subsides, keeping us on a path to exceed 2019 financial performance by 2024. And with that, I will turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Janki: Great. Glen, thank you. The Delta team executed well in 2021 in an environment that remains very dynamic, I want to thank our people for their hard work, congratulate them on a well-earned special profit sharing payment. So, let me start with the highlights from the December quarter. We delivered a profitable fourth quarter, reporting earnings of $0.22 per share, representing a pre-tax income of $170 million and a 2% margin on total revenue of $8.4 billion. While it was a strong close to the year, operational disruptions during the last 2 weeks of the quarter impacted our pre-tax results by $80 million. Total fourth quarter operating expenses were $8.1 billion, a 3% increase from the third quarter, driven by both fuel and non-fuel costs from the continued restoration of the airline. Fuel expense of $1.6 billion increased 4% sequentially as fuel prices per gallon increased to $2.10. Total fuel expense included a $0.24 per gallon benefit from the refinery. Embedded in fuel cost is a continued benefit from our fleet renewal, which supported a 4.3% improvement in fuel efficiency compared to 2019. Non-fuel CASM was up 8.3% compared to 2019. This included a 1.2% impact primarily due to lower capacity from cancellations during the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Now, turning to cash flows and the balance sheet, we generated operating cash flow of $518 million. We invested $948 million into the business and we repaid $1.1 billion of debt in the December quarter. We ended the year with $14.2 billion of liquidity and adjusted net debt of $20.6 billion. Now, on to the current environment and the March quarter outlook, as Ed and Glen noted, the variant is magnifying normal seasonality in the March quarter, which is our seasonally weakest of the year. The operational challenges has reduced our capacity outlook and we now expect first quarter ASMs to be between 83% and 85% recovered to 2019. This reduction is a few points from our previously expected capacity recovery. In this environment, we are also paying higher crew premiums over time and COVID-related costs as we work through staffing challenges, mitigation of cancellations and protect our people. We estimate that this will impact first quarter by $60 million to $70 million. The disruptions are impacting our first quarter non-fuel CASM comparison to 2019 by 3 points, with the majority of that driven by fewer ASMs. Absent the Omicron disruption, our March quarter non-fuel CASM is 12% higher than 2019 as our network remains 15% smaller. The sequential step up in non-fuel CASM from December to March quarter is due to maintenance normalizing to 2019 levels. As we talked about last month, when comparing non-fuel CASM to 2019, there was a 7 point benefit related to maintenance in 2021 total year due to depressed flying. This inflects to a 1 point headwind in 2022 as flying is restored. Our quarterly progression basis, the maintenance tailwind was about 5 points specifically in the fourth quarter of 2021 and there will be no benefit in the first quarter of 2022. Additionally, with the ASM sequentially \u2013 essentially flat sequentially, we are not yet benefiting from the scale and efficiency. As the ASM restoration progresses and we exit 2022 close to fully restored, we will realize the scale and efficiency benefit and our comparisons to 2019 will improve. This is consistent with the framework and guidance we laid out last month at Capital Markets Day. Underlying our 7 to 10 full year cost guidance, we expect non-fuel CASM versus \u201819 for the first half of the year to be up in the low to mid-teens, while in the second half of the year, averaging mid single-digits as that scale and efficiency are restored and transition costs subside. While we did not previously expect Omicron-related operational disruptions, there is still a lot of the year to unfold as it equates to both the capacity and demand. And we remain confident in our non-fuel CASM framework and the guidance we laid out last month. For the March quarter, adjusted fuel price per gallon is expected to be between $2.35 to $2.50. Fuel efficiency is estimated to be approximately 6% better than the same period in 2019. When combined with our revenue outlook Glen provided, we expect a loss in January and February months and a return to profitability in the month of March. Now, looking beyond the March quarter, even with the challenging start of the year, we remain positioned to generate a healthy profit in June, September and December quarters, resulting in a meaningful profit for 2022. At this point in the year, we are not providing additional full year guidance beyond the metrics given last month at Capital Markets Day. This includes capacity at 90% resort to 2019, non-fuel CASM up 7% to 10% and gross CapEx of $6 billion. The $6 billion compares to $2.9 billion in 2021 and includes $4.7 billion of aircraft CapEx, including delivery of approximately 70 aircraft and $350 million of modification costs. The remainder is related to ground and technology projects. The March quarter will be our largest delivery quarter with 22 deliveries, resulting in March CapEx of $1.6 billion. Now, reducing debt remains a top financial priority. During 2021, we reduced gross debt by $6 billion, fully funded our pension on a Pension Protection Act basis, with a $1.5 billion contribution and a 16% return on our planned assets. In 2022, we have $1.8 billion in debt maturities, with $1.2 billion in the current quarter. With a heavier CapEx quarter, we expected adjusted net debt to increase to $22 billion in the first quarter. As we achieve sustained cash generation over the next 12 to 18 months, we will continue to opportunistically manage our balance sheet, reducing debt to return to investment grade metrics and making progress towards that $15 billion adjusted net debt target by the end of 2024. So, in closing, at our recent Capital Markets Day, we outlined our financial priorities and our recovery path over the next 3 years. The power of the brand, the strength of the competitive advantage give us strong conviction in the trajectory and the path to full financial recovery. So with that, let me turn it back to Julie for Q&A.\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Dan. Cody, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for a question and go to our first question?\nOperator: Absolutely. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning, everyone. And maybe it is for Glen just early January is a fairly important time for booking into the rest of the year. I was curious if there is an \u2013 the impact on some of the forward-looking trends, Omicron is just maybe only impacting kind of close-in bookings. And also, just if there is any color on how it\u2019s impacting kind of the different \u2013 the four different entities here?\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure. I think if we could pick a period of time for an Omicron variant to surge, we would probably pick this time of year, because I think it\u2019s got two components that are unique to this time of the year. One is these five weeks that it\u2019s impacting are five of the lightest weeks in terms of business travel. And two, as you indicated, it has really impacted more the close-in demand than the further out demand. And we believe we have plenty of time to recover those deferral of vacation bookings for summer. If they don\u2019t come in the third or fourth week of January, it\u2019s easy for them to come in sometime in February, March, so really not concerned yet about spring or summer. We feel that we will have a very, very robust demand profile for spring and summer. And while some of the bookings have been slightly delayed, we are still seeing much \u2013 the biggest magnitude of the impact impacting the next few weeks here. On a regional perspective, for all intents and purposes, Asia remains very constrained. We expect that to continue. And our restoration of Asia through the summer is very minimal. Europe, we\u2019ve seen some countries imposing more restrictions. And at the same time, we\u2019ve seen some countries trying to lift restrictions. Of course, you saw in the UK, restrictions were added, and they were removed. We\u2019re anticipating even further loosening of those restrictions over the next few weeks to the UK. Ireland has come out with much less restrictions. So I think everybody is preparing at this point for the Omicron to be in the rearview mirror, and that travel will be much more restored for the summer than it was for any of the last two summers, and that will lead to really what we think should be very, very strong and healthy demands for transatlantic leisure travel this summer. And then Latin America has continued to be more resilient. Those restrictions have come off in a lot of those countries. And clearly, the short-haul Latin markets are performing well and long haul are continuing to improve. So hopefully, that gives you the color you need.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s super helpful, Glen. And I think you alluded to this as well that maybe kind of some of the operational issues should ease up heading into the summer. I know you\u2019ve been hiring a lot of kind of employees and especially pilot and flight attendants since kind of the second half of last year. I just wondering if you could help provide some color on just how much like Slack is being built into with these hirings as you go into the summer because your capacity levels are also coming up into the summer as well.\nGlen Hauenstein: How much Slack? What do you mean by Slack, Savi?\nSavi Syth: In the sense that, I guess, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like employee per aircraft or just like \u2013 you are hiring, but you\u2019re also increasing your capacity. So just curious if we come into the summer and if we get another variant or something like that, if we will have a little bit more kind of, I guess, reserve ratios or something like that to handle kind of the next peak period.\nGlen Hauenstein: So we\u2019re getting better positioned on staffing. We did hire a lot of people in \u201821 because we had a lot of people leave in \u201820. We\u2019re looking at hiring several thousand people in \u201822. A lot of those are more longer term flight attendants. Pilots take a while to get in the pipeline and include the airline over time. But I think I\u2019m very comfortable with our staffing levels. Yes, there is \u2013 you can\u2019t plan in advance for something that comes up overnight like Omicron there, where the world decides to shut down for 60 days. And we\u2019re going to get through this really quick. And we\u2019re going to be glad we have the staffing in place because I think it\u2019s going to be in the bookings. Your earlier question, the bookings look very good post President\u2019s Day looking forward and really haven\u2019t seen a major impact at all relative to \u201819 expectations in that. So we think it\u2019s going to be a quick rebound.\nSavi Syth: Make sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. And maybe as a follow-up to Savi\u2019s hiring question, I guess we\u2019re beginning to hear a little chatter from the regional airlines that it\u2019s becoming a bit more difficult to attract and hire new pilots. I know these airlines often feed pilots into your airline and others. But can you maybe give a little bit of color on how many pilots you need to hire over, say, the next three years to kind of hit your capacity plans? And if regionals start to have a hard time finding new pilots in 2022, when do you think it would start to impact your and your other mainline carriers ability to hire, if at all?\nGlen Hauenstein: Thanks, Andrew. We\u2019re hiring at the mainline somewhere between 100 to 200 a month presently and we expect that pace to continue for some period of time, certainly through \u201822 and into \u201823. We don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but that\u2019s the pace that we\u2019re hiring at. And everyone else in the industry is hiring, too. So it\u2019s not just Delta. We are not having any problem at all at Delta hiring and getting great pools of candidates. That\u2019s viewed as the premium airline that employees in general, but particularly pilots want to come work for, which we\u2019re thrilled about. But it is having the impact at the regionals, as you mentioned. We are down flying in the first half of the year on some of the regional carriers given some of the staffing challenges we\u2019re facing, primarily because of pilot hiring. The largest regional is our own that we work with, which is Endeavor. So we\u2019re working closely with them to help to mitigate some of the disruption and the churn that\u2019s going on through the process. But I think this is a normal period of time. It\u2019s \u2013 the next order of the crisis that we\u2019ve all been through is pulling through, and it\u2019s actually going to be good. It\u2019s going to enable us to make sure that we pay good attention to the regional carriers and meet their needs. But at the same time, I\u2019d much rather have the issue down there than at the mainline.\nAndrew Didora: Understood. And then just one other question for me, I just wanted to \u2013 you mentioned a little bit, you talked a little bit about this at the Capital Markets Day. But back in December, you did announce that you were putting about $1 billion of new equity capital into three of your international partners. Just wanted to get your thoughts, why do you \u2013 why is it so important to Delta to have such a large equity investment as opposed to maybe a smaller one or none at all? Why is there such a focus there? Just curious on why you think other airlines don\u2019t follow a similar strategy. Thanks.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I can\u2019t speak for other airlines. You\u2019d have to ask them that question. But I know for us, it\u2019s the right strategy. Long-term, our opportunity is international. And when you think about growth, when you think about expansion, when you think about the natural opportunities that Delta has for the future, it\u2019s going to sit in the international arena, and working very closely with that. International is hard. International, the competitive set is very difficult. And it\u2019s hard to do it on your own, to go out there and try to advance a U.S. airline in international borders unless you had some really good, strong partners in the international marketplace. We\u2019re fortunate we have great partners in the international marketplace, The Virgin Atlantic, and Air France, KLM, and AeroMexico, LATAM, Korean Air, et cetera. But we also know that those airlines have their own objectives and they have their own desires. And we have found over time that it\u2019s very, very difficult through solely joint ventures or contractual means to try to enhance the customer experience and provide the very best quality of service if you\u2019re just trying to do it as \u2013 through a contract as compared to being in the room, a seat inside the head of the company, if you will, influencing the decision to ensure that we\u2019re putting our customer interest at the center of what \u2013 because it\u2019s on \u2013 the growth is going to be based on customer preference. And just as you\u2019ve seen, everything that we\u2019ve done here domestically to grow customer preference, big opportunities for us to grow customer preference now sit in the international market. So we\u2019re thrilled with the investments we\u2019re making. We\u2019ve made certain that each one of those investments pencil out on paper. If they are good financial investments as well, we expect to generate significant returns. And candidly, given the fact that we\u2019ve already made significant investments in the past, it\u2019s going to actually allow us to recoup some of that past investment easier by staying invested in the companies.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you for that, Ed.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Hi, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Happy New Year. Glen, can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing sort of sequentially in terms of yields on the business in the leisure front as you kind of moved through the quarter and into the first quarter? And then specifically, kind of you look out past Presidents\u2019 Day, how booking activities shaping up there?\nGlen Hauenstein: We usually don\u2019t comment on future yields, but I can say that through the past quarter, while the bottom of the business yield was about minus 25, which was in the September time frame, and then that moved up to being down low single digits. And I think we talked about that at our Investor Day, and we were pleased with where the structure was sitting as we move forward, and I don\u2019t think anything has really changed since then. So I think that\u2019s the outlook I would give you, is that we think the structure is fine now. We need the traffic back.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. And then do you have any updates on discussions with business travelers about their plans for budgeting travel for the remainder of the year? Is there anything you can share on that front?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes, absolutely. As you know, we check the pulse our corporate clients very often. And we did it right before Investor Day and we did it right before this call. And what we saw was that the percentage of customers who thought in the first quarter that they would travel the same or more went down slightly. But it was still 80% of the corporate travel survey respondents thought they would travel the same or more in the first quarter than they did in fourth quarter. Office reopenings have been pushed out, as you know. But we are expecting, as Ed indicated, when we get to spring and summer, that we will see a robust demand for business travel as people get back into the regular routine and feel safe traveling. So really optimistic about those results and optimistic about where we think this is going to head in the not-too-distant future.\nEd Bastian: David, this is Ed. The business travel, I\u2019d say the best way to characterize I read is kind of a wait and see. They are trying to understand what\u2019s going on with Omicron. They are trying to understand when their offices \u2013 if they are not back, when they are going to open. And they are all making those decisions here. And the good news is that, as we\u2019re watching the case counts start to crest and peak here in our country and declining in certain early parts of the country that had the variant hit first, that\u2019s giving them encouragement to realize that they are going to be able to get back and get their people in, open their offices sooner than maybe they were thinking when first news of Omicron came. So we\u2019re in a pretty good place. When you think about the trajectory we saw over the fourth quarter, we saw a really nice growth in business, both small business as well as big corporates. And small businesses, as we pointed out at the Investor Day, is something we haven\u2019t talked as much about historically, but it\u2019s just a big pool as the corporate space is for us. And then when those offices open starting in the spring, we think it\u2019s going to pick up where we left off in December and grow from there.\nDavid Vernon: Great. Thanks, Ed.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So just to kind of pick up on that last point. I mean, hopefully, the next few weeks is the last real disruption from the pandemic, especially with kind of availability of boosters and therapeutics and herd immunity and everything else. So if there is like genuinely like light \u2013 like real light at the end of the tunnel, are you having conversations with the regulators on when we can fly without masks on planes and time line, like full service being restored in the aircraft? Do you have a \u2013 has a big guess on kind of the timing of that?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I think it\u2019s premature, Ravi, to speculate on masks on planes. Obviously, that\u2019s going to be driven by the medical experts and not by the airlines. And we will follow their guidance. But in terms of restoring service on planes, yes, we\u2019re doing that pretty aggressively. And over the course of the next 2 to 3 months, you\u2019re going to see our service patterns largely restored from where we were in 2019 and continue to make the improvements. And when I say restored, restored is not the right word, it\u2019s going to be improved from where we were in \u201819. And we\u2019ve taken the opportunity during the pandemic to make substantial changes to the whole catering spec, who\u2019s providing it. Took ownership positions in terms of kitchens and really big change that customers are going to be delighted when they start traveling again back in the springtime, particularly internationally. It\u2019s going to be good. The thing you were mentioning about the rapid move of the variant, I agree with you. I think that there is a real silver lining here, is that since this thing is moving so fast, it\u2019s so infectious, so many people are getting it, it\u2019s going to push the pandemic into us \u2013 into all of a normalized environment here sooner than we would have liked. So while we were together at Capital Markets Day, we talked about the uncertainty that Omicron presents. Good news is that the uncertainty is going to be short-lived. And the path to normalization, I think we\u2019re even more confident in it when we think about our \u201822 numbers and travel patterns. So it\u2019s not all negative. That\u2019s for sure.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. And just a follow-up, forgive me if I missed this, but is there an update on what premium cabin would look like relative to main cabin in the fourth quarter? I think in the past, you\u2019ve said it was running 10 percentage points ahead. And how do you expect that to trend through the year, especially as COVID and the national come back? Thanks.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, yes. So we\u2019re very excited about the fourth quarter results. I think it was in the comments that it was 9 points ahead of main cabin for the entire fourth quarter, and we see those trends continuing. We \u2013 the headline for us is that premium leisure, we believe, is here to stay. And that\u2019s something that we want to continue to exploit as we think about we service our customers moving forward and how we lay out the plans and what products and services we offer.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, just two quick \u2013 one quick one for Glen. On the refinery, the revenue piece for the March quarter. I know normally you don\u2019t give guidance there, but it is \u2013 it\u2019s been a big number. It was $1 billion this last quarter. Should we assume, just given where crack spreads are, that March quarter refinery sales will maybe be of a similar magnitude?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes, I think that\u2019s the right way to think about it. Our jet consumption will be about the same in the refinery output. So keep it consistent, yes.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Very good. And then second question to Ed here. Ed, I think if you look across the industry right now, I think most airlines, their pilot contracts have now been opened. They are at an amendable point. Yours included. I think one of your competitors is trying to do a quick sort of 2-year type extension. Can you just give us an update of where you are? And I guess, within the context, I mean, you didn\u2019t furlough anybody during the pandemic, so you\u2019re sort of maybe approaching this from a different perspective. Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Thanks, Mike. We did not furlough any employee during the pandemic. Pilots included. Yes, we\u2019re in a similar position, I guess, and some of our large competitors are as well, particularly relative to the pilot contract. During the pandemic, it was very difficult for any of the airlines to \u2013 or the union for that matter to feel confident in projecting the future. So I think all talks across the industry have probably put on hold. But we\u2019re now getting ready to reengage, and we will see where that goes. But no, we\u2019re not trying to do an expedited anything. We\u2019re trying to get a real contract with our people.\nMike Linenberg: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning. First question for Glen, could you expand on your answer to Savi\u2019s question that you anticipate transborder testing impediments to ease during the quarter? For example, as a move from a 1-day back to a 3-day testing requirement for U.S. reentering, is that specifically in your forecast? Is the guidance assume that we get back to November eight levels of sort of testing impediments? I\u2019m only asking because as these headlines do improve, we\u2019re going to be asked whether that\u2019s incremental to the guide or not?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I think what we\u2019ve seen and \u2013 a little more color on that is we\u2019ve seen that initially, everybody reacted by putting in some pretty onerous testing requirements. Since countries that are further along with us like the UK, who\u2019s now on the backside of the Omicron, has now started relaxing those restrictions, and we\u2019ve seen other countries like Ireland relax. We\u2019ve seen Israel relax on the margin. So I think that\u2019s what we would expect. I don\u2019t think for a customer who\u2019s traveling that the 1-day testing requirement that the U.S. has imposed is that all. It\u2019s pretty easy to take a proctored test with you when you travel overseas. So I couldn\u2019t speak to whether the U.S. government was going to go back to the previous policy. But in general, I think once governments feel comfortable that they have a handle on the variant, that they have backed off and started easing the restrictions again, I think that would be something that the whole world is looking towards as we move forward here.\nJamie Baker: Okay. And then for Dan, the flat air traffic liability from third quarter to fourth quarter, that\u2019s pretty unusual. Ordinarily, there is about a $700 million sequential decline even in 2020. We saw a few hundred million of decline. What should we read into that other than strong bookings? I mean has there been any change in how you are accounting for travel credits? And on a side note, having recently bought a Delta ticket and having forgotten to apply some existing credits, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m the only passenger to experience this. I\u2019m just trying to think through any implications of credit travel breakage and how that might influence the ATL going forward? Any color there?\nDan Janki: Well, one, no change, right? But I think we talked about this a little bit in the third quarter call that the \u2013 remind you that maybe historical seasonalities won\u2019t apply as you\u2019re restoring travel and the airline. And that proved to be the case in fourth quarter and what we saw. I think you\u2019re going to see a similar dynamic in first quarter. Normally, that air traffic liability will grow. You\u2019ve got to account for the additional restoration that you see as you progress towards second quarter that would \u2013 that changes of seasonal impacts. So just take that into consideration. I think fourth quarter is a good proof point that you just can\u2019t take historical practices, but it\u2019s not due to the underlying change in practice. It\u2019s really just the dynamic that\u2019s going on with the restoration of the airline and the growth.\nJamie Baker: Okay, okay, it\u2019s perfect.\nEd Bastian: And to your question on \u2013 Jamie, this is Ed on \u2013 the question on credit. I don\u2019t know if we announced it this week or not.\nDan Janki: Yes, we did.\nEd Bastian: We did. Good news. So we extended the expiration date through the end of \u201823. So you\u2019ll be fine.\nDan Janki: You can use it, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: Okay. I wasn\u2019t particularly worried about it. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. Maybe just to continue on Jamie\u2019s line of questioning there, can you tell us what breakage as a percent of revenue was in the fourth quarter and kind of how those trends have changed over time?\nDan Janki: Yes. The trends haven\u2019t changed and they are consistent, but we don\u2019t actually give breakage to report that.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then just a broader question, as you look back at the business travel recovery you started to see in 4Q, do you think that return to office is as meaningful of a guidepost relative to your initial thinking? Have you seen any decoupling between return to office and business travel recovery? And it\u2019s not a \u2013 that\u2019s not a January 13 question. That\u2019s a \u2013 the recovery you were seeing in the fourth quarter.\nEd Bastian: Yes. I think there is a correlation. A lot of business travel is triggered by going to visit companies. And the companies are closed, it makes it a little more difficult to do that. It\u2019s not a one for one. But the fact that particularly the big corporates, the fact that our overall level of corporate demand, the volume return is actually fairly closely correlated, and maybe it\u2019s coincidence or not, I don\u2019t know, but the numbers are pretty tightly correlated to the amount of reopenings we\u2019ve seen indicates there is a real cause and effect there, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. I just wondered if we found travel has a higher utility than going back to an office, but I appreciate the thoughts.\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes. No. We do have \u2013 office is not the only thing. We have a lot of people traveling that aren\u2019t back into office yet. So we have a lot of noise probably in the numbers, and there is a lot of choppiness. As you \u2013 as we navigated the course, it felt like two or three pandemics over the course of 2021 with the various variants. But we are continuing to make good progress. The good news is that all of our corporates are saying they just can\u2019t wait to get back to be with people and be with their own people, be with their customers, visit new opportunities and invest for the future. And I think this is going to be a strong spring and summer. They are just waiting for the all clear sign that you don\u2019t have to worry about a variant as you are traveling.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: It makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning guys. Thank you for your time. So, you talked about Q1 international capacity being 15 points to 20 points lower than the industry. Maybe can you talk about what metrics you would like to see for that path to ramp capacity back up, how your fleet plays into it and how you think about international capacity as we progress through the year?\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure. I think we get a \u2013 gave a pretty good outline of how we expect international restoration to occur. And what I would say is we haven\u2019t changed from where we think we will be in the summer yet. What we have changed is the low season, this \u2013 the winter IATA, the remainder of the winter IATA. We had some seasonal services starting up earlier than we would have otherwise done because we thought demand might be back early. And now we are taking that bed off and moving those start dates to later in the year. And I think we still remain very, very confident that once \u2013 as Ed said, once people feel that it\u2019s safe to travel, that they will. And as we said in today\u2019s comments and in all previous is we will remain agile. And if we don\u2019t see that developing, we will pull it down. And if we see it coming faster, we have the ability to accelerate to a certain extent, some growth in international. So really, it\u2019s a \u2013 we are still very optimistic about the summer. And we expect to be 85% to 90% restored in the transatlantic, probably less than 50% in the Pacific and largely restored in Latin America. And that\u2019s what we outlined previously. We really haven\u2019t deviated from that yet.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. And maybe just a follow-on for that. In the domestic market, you are seeing additional capacity come on with a recent order from a low-cost carrier. How do you think about the risks of supply coming into the U.S. market?\nGlen Hauenstein: We have competed with ULCCs for many, many years. And I think that\u2019s really where we came to a couple of different strategies, including our premium strategy. And I would like to say that some of our highest return markets historically have been straight up against LCCs and ULCCs. So, I think we are really not afraid to compete in those markets. And we think our products stand on their own. And it is a very different product and a very different customer than they are going after.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will hear next from Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners.\nConor Cunningham: Hi everyone. Thanks for the time. One point from your Capital Markets Day that I found interesting was just the domestic share gains on the corporate side during the pandemic. In the past, those gains have been somewhat minimal year-over-year, but you clearly used the pandemic advantage. I was just curious, is there a gating factor to you growing share from here? And if there isn\u2019t, what\u2019s your expectations over the next couple of years for your share there? Thanks.\nEd Bastian: Conor, this is Ed. Yes, you are right. We did have a meaningful and an outsized share gain. And that\u2019s amongst the big corporates as our corporates really focused on premium. They appreciated the work we did around blocking the middle seats for the entire length of the pandemic while it was quite active. And what we find is when companies come to Delta or customers come to Delta, they tend not to leave, which is a good thing. And so the share tends to be sticky, and we work really hard to ensure that we maintain that. We have had good share gains in the past. Don\u2019t get me wrong. We have it. We kind of had plateaued at a level pre-pandemic. And we are significantly higher in share than our natural seat share is in those markets. So, I think we are going to work hard to make sure we maintain. And if we can grow it, we will. But I wouldn\u2019t expect you to see additional growth, not at that level for the next couple of years.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Great. That was a big move. And then just maybe to take the other side of Ravi\u2019s question. I assume that there is actually going to be another wave of cases at some point. Each wave has been different. But could you just speak to lessons learned during this current wave? The reason why I ask is it just seems like your ability to work directly with your workforce actually benefited your operation relative to some of your competitors as you turned around pretty quickly. Thanks again for the time.\nEd Bastian: Yes. Thanks, Conor. I am proud of our team, and it was hellacious three weeks that \u2013 so yes, there are definitely some learnings in there. But the good news is we recovered quickly. We got the operational integrity of the airline back to where it needs to be. It was not easy to do. But the fact that we have a very, very direct and strong and flexible workforce that will do whatever they need to do to ensure customers are being well taken care of and served was important, and that\u2019s shown through. One of the things that to me was really interesting about the last few weeks of this Omicron surge is that demand was really strong. I mean of course, it was built prior to that as it was going into the holidays, but we didn\u2019t see cancellations. Cancellations were taking is because we couldn\u2019t staff the planes. But \u2013 so the resilience of customers and their willingness and interest in getting into travel once things clear, I think is going to be that much stronger. And each \u2013 as each successive wave occurs, I think people are getting more used to, the fact that we are having \u2013 this is the virus we are going to have to manage and live with over time, and it\u2019s going to be a seasonal virus. It\u2019s not going to be a pandemic. And that\u2019s what the doctors all believe and that\u2019s what I think we are going to wind up seeing here. And we have got all the tools and the technologies, and the capability and the confidence that we can manage just that.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Thanks, Ed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I was just wondering, maybe Ed, how do you think the zero COVID case policy in China plays out through the course of the year with respect to your business? I know it\u2019s a smaller piece. But just curious what you think can make them move to endemic because clearly zero COVID case policy would still be in the pandemic mode?\nEd Bastian: That\u2019s a question, Myles, is way above my pay grade, national policy in China. It\u2019s been interesting as we have watched a lot of the nations around the world all manage it seemingly somewhat differently. As it relates to us, you are right. China is not a big part of our network. We would like it to be a bigger part, but it historically hasn\u2019t been. It\u2019s going to be a pretty small part of our network at least for the next couple of years and we will see beyond that. One of the things we do is we look at where we put our metal is demand. And there is not strong demand going up between the U.S. and China now. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a situation that\u2019s alarming to us. But hopefully, Asia and it\u2019s not just Japan, but it\u2019s \u2013 or China, but Japan and other office, Hong Kong and Singapore, they are all going to need to figure out how to move to that seasonal virus that I just talked about. And they got the tools and the technologies to manage it. I think it\u2019s just going to be a longer road. We have a very downward feel as to growth rates in Asia for some time here. And fortunately, we have got a great partner in Korea that can do that flying in the meantime for us.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And just follow-up, Dan, on the other expense, non-operating other expense for 2022. Anything to throw out there space, whether it\u2019s interest or pension moving parts?\nDan Janki: No. I think you \u2013 when you look at the total year for 2021, it was just around $900 million when you take the interest expense with the pension. It\u2019s going to be about that level, slightly above actually. You are going to have a little less pension income. And then that interest expense line will start to really move down in \u201823 and \u201824 as you see that adjusted net debt coming down to our $15 billion target.\nMyles Walton: Okay. Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: Cody, we have time for one more analyst question before then moving to media Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. I will take our final question on the analyst side from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Hey. Good morning. Thank you. A couple for me. Glen, I think it for Glen. I know you had a need, obviously, with Sandeep leaving. But how can Scott Laurence help your team? And what is it about him that you like the most when you interviewed him?\nGlen Hauenstein: Listen, we don\u2019t comment on individual performance or individual reasons. But I think Scott is a very well seasoned industry executive. And I think he is going to bring us some additional value over time. We will see when he gets here, starting next week, I believe.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And then do your capacity planners talk to Dr. Tang when you plan the schedule?\nEd Bastian: Every day. Every schedule is now Tang approved.\nHunter Keay: Got it. Thank you very much.\nEd Bastian: Thank you, Hunter.\nJulie Stewart: That will wrap the analyst portion of the call. I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, to start the media questions.\nTim Mapes: Julie, we have about 12 minutes for conversations with members of the media. If you would, please remind everyone the process to get in the queue for that. And I would remind everybody that we are going to try to keep this moving and do one question with one follow-up and end about 10 minutes after the hour, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I will take our first question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to see if you could comment of the passengers who had canceled flights during December, how many of those \u2013 what percentage of those were able to actually complete that travel, rebook or whatever, and complete that travel during the holidays? Can you talk about that percentage?\nEd Bastian: Hi Mary, this is Ed. I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me. But the vast majority of the customers that had to be rebooked, we had space that we were able to accommodate on other flights to get them to their destinations. So, it\u2019s not something that we enjoy doing, but we were able to get people to where they need to be for the holidays.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. So, no notable or noteworthy amount of lost revenue through that?\nEd Bastian: Well, there was flying, and some customers decided not to travel. So, that\u2019s \u2013 at least we estimated there was a $70 million hit for that. But no, there is not a substantial. If customers wanted to travel on Delta, we may certainly, we got them there.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: Hi. Thanks so much. You talked about sort of pandemic entering this new phase where it\u2019s becoming more seasonal, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily impact people\u2019s willingness to travel all that much. How does that change kind of the way you plan and staff for peak periods? If there is going to be a future brief, but dramatic flare up like we just saw, would you have a smaller peak holiday schedule, or how does that change kind of your planning process?\nEd Bastian: Well, our goal, Ali, is to ensure that we are meeting customer demand. And so I don\u2019t know that we can change customers\u2019 demand and interest in traveling during peak periods or holidays. And that\u2019s when they go, and we need to make sure we are there to serve them. There are learnings from Omicron, as I mentioned on the analyst call. But probably the most important learning that I saw was that, even with Omicron being the headline throughout the country and the disruption that the airline industry was experiencing from people getting sick from Omicron, travelers are still traveling. And they were determined to travel. They were resilient. We didn\u2019t see mass cancellations. We didn\u2019t see people deciding it wasn\u2019t \u2013 didn\u2019t feel right. And so I think that this was another phase that we have passed through. And who knows, is there going to be another pandemic type virus awaiting us, there is no \u2013 we don\u2019t know what it is, but we are also humbled by the fact we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know yet in this environment. But we do really believe that we are going to enter a nice period of being able to manage and create a set of normalcy around travel behaviors, particularly, but hopefully, life in general. And this virus will become very similar to what we have with the flu right now and move into a seasonal category with tools and technologies to manage. Flu is a pretty significant cause of death historically. In our country, I think we are seeing a lot less of that over the last couple of years because of the new tools and mitigations that we have learned to live with. And I think you are going to see people may be wearing masks and then doing different things and having technologies and antivirals that they can take to help manage to \u2013 in order to keep themselves moving. We are getting to a point where I think, Ali, we are going to focus our efforts on the small percent of people that are immunocompromised that are at most at risk. But the general population is learning and willing and exhibiting an interest to live with this risk.\nAlison Sider: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We will hear next from Leslie Josephs with CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, good morning everyone. Just a question on hiring, can you just update us on the number of people that you want to hire? And is there any detail on perks or increased salaries that you are offering to attract workers? And if there is anywhere that you are having problems attracting workers, either work group or geography, I would love to hear that. Thanks.\nEd Bastian: Yes. Leslie, as you know, we hired a substantial number of people in the past year. I think it was around 9,000. We are going to be hiring less people this year. But this number is still in the, say, 3,000 to 5,000 range depending on how demand shapes and comes back. We are not having any meaningful impact in terms of difficulty getting people to come work for this company. Regionally, yes, there are some pressure points in some of the higher cost markets, particularly in the Northeast. But no, we are doing a very, very good job of bringing the team together. And we are not having to put any unusual perks out there in order to attract talent.\nLeslie Josephs: Thanks.\nEd Bastian: The ability to travel free is a great perk and we have always had that at Delta.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Edward Russell with Skift.\nEdward Russell: Hi. Thank you. Following on what Leslie asked, in terms of the regional flying reductions that you are doing in the first half, what is Delta doing to mitigate that?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, we have taken about 20% to 25% of our regional flying down in the first part of the year. And that is \u2013 it stems really from flow-through pilots to the mainline as well as getting the right people and the right training seat at the regional carriers. And I think those are the two things that we are counting on as we get to the back half of the year to resolve themselves. So, I think one of the things is how many hours you have in seat, can you get trained, and can you get moved, we are working through all the details of how those transactions or transitions actually happen. And we are really pretty confident now that by the second half of this year, that the pipelines will be more full and we will be able to restore a lot of the small and medium-sized communities that we have had to pull down during the shortage in the first half of the year. So, we are meeting on this really daily and weekly to make sure that this actually can materialize. But right now, we feel very confident that we can catch back up again as we get to the back half of the year.\nEdward Russell: Okay. Thank you. And one follow-on. Have you had to park any regional aircraft as a result or exit any markets?\nGlen Hauenstein: We have had to exit a handful of markets. Mostly those are on per seat. So, they weren\u2019t directly scheduled by Delta. So, as of now, things that Delta had scheduled control over, we have not closed any stations, although our partners have. And what was the second part of that question?\nEdward Russell: Have you had to park any regional aircraft as a result?\nGlen Hauenstein: There are parked regional airplanes right now. But we expect those to return back into the sky, as I said earlier, in the second half of the year.\nEdward Russell: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from David Slotnick with TPG.\nDavid Slotnick: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk a little bit more about premium leisure, which you mentioned at the Capital Markets Day and again today. What does that look like in the long-haul market particularly? Is that people who are able to pay for Delta One? Is that more affordable Delta One take? Is that a more widespread premium economy or something else?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, we have got big plans for our long-haul premium leisure sector. This year, we will be ubiquitous in introducing a new product, Delta Premium Select, to the transatlantic marketplace. And that is really designed specifically for higher-end leisure as well as corporate travelers whose travel policies don\u2019t include the flatbed Delta One product. So, early returns on that are phenomenal, far above our expectations. And as we get to ubiquity, we will monitor that closely, and we will report back to you. But we are excited about that. We are excited about the enhancements that Ed talked about as we get to spring and summer on the existing premium products in the long haul. And we think we have over the years developed a great suite of products that fit a lot of needs for customers, whether or not it\u2019s just basic transportation and getting there safely and on time, to really more of the luxury products, with the flatbed seats and the luxurious amenities that come with that. So, a wide spectrum. And if you think of where we started, we started with just a flatbed and a coach product. So, now we have a full suite of five products that we can offer in the transatlantic marketplace. And that will extend to all of our internationals by \u201823.\nTim Mapes: Cody, we have time for one final question, please, before we have Ed wrap it up.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our final question from Robert Silk with Travel Weekly.\nRobert Silk: Good morning guys. So, I think you said you expect the pilot shortage, or I guess the flow-through to sort of resolve itself as the year progresses. Explain to me how you expect that to happen to get more people just to get more pilots coming back into the system.\nGlen Hauenstein: Really, there are no shortage of pilots wanting to come to us or really to our regional partners. It\u2019s a matter of them getting through the training and getting into the right seat with the right number of hours. So, that\u2019s what we are working through as we look to resolve the current staffing issues there, is how long does that take to really catch up and when we will be in a position to start growing those regional players again.\nRobert Silk: Okay. So, I guess that answers my question. Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Well, thank you, everyone. I want to wrap up here and appreciate your time this morning. Thank you for joining us. I particularly want to thank once again the Delta employees for the amazing work they have done over this course of this last year. Congratulate them on this special profit sharing payment, which we are thrilled to be able to award them with, and realize that we are making really good progress. Omicron has been a challenging period of time, but we have learned from it. There is new findings. And one of the most important findings is that we are going to move through this thing fastly \u2013 quickly and get to a point of stabilization in our views. So with that, being that we are in the State of Georgia, we have to over the \u2013 close of the go dogs, and congratulate them our employees, national champions. And thank you all for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. I really appreciate you joining us today. Before getting into the December quarter results and outlook, I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing the current environment. As everyone is aware, the Omicron variant has significantly impacted our people, our customers, and our operation as well as most parts of society over the last three weeks. The combination of the rapid spread of the variant at the peak of a strong holiday demand period and in the face of extreme winter condition in parts of the country, created some of the most difficult travel conditions that we ever remember experiencing. I am incredibly appreciative of the great work that our frontline team has done and continue to do to help our customers get to where they need to be as safely and quickly as possible, no matter the circumstances. Our teams have faced these difficulties head on, while also managing the impact of the virus in their own lives. And I want to thank every member of the Delta team for your work during a very challenging period. To our customers who have been affected, we appreciate your patience and your understanding. The good news is that over the past seven days, our operation has stabilized with Omicron-related cancellations impacting only about 1% of our flights. And since Sunday, the number of Omicron-affected cancellations are around 20 a day, out of nearly 4,000 daily flights. And in fact, yesterday, we only had two Omicron-related mainline cancellations. So, while the new variant is not done, it appears that the worst maybe behind us. Based on how quickly the case counts have risen, our medical team expects cases to peak in the U.S. over the next few days, followed by a steep decline in cases. And we are already starting to see that happen amongst our own staff. Given the high transmissibility and lower severity of Omicron, this variant is likely to mark the shift in COVID-19 from being a pandemic to a manageable and ordinary seasonal virus, which should accelerate the path to a normalized environment. When we spoke last month about Omicron as a risk at Capital Markets Day, a lot was unknown. Today, we know a lot more. And while the first 60 days of the year will be impacted, we are confident that the pace of travel recovery will resume its December trajectory as we move into President's Day weekend and a strong spring and summer travel season are ahead of us. So as we reflect on 2021, it was a year like no other for Delta. While challenging, we made significant progress in our recovery. At Capital Markets Day, we highlighted that our competitive strengths have deepened through the course of the past two years and I am extremely proud of our entire team for all their efforts. Full year revenue of $27 billion in 2021 improved nearly $11 billion or 67% from 2020, with the rate of recovery accelerating from only 25%, as measured against 2019 at the start of the year to a close of the year of nearly 80% as we exited December. This resulted in a full year 2021 pre-tax loss of $3.4 billion. And while we obviously have still much work ahead of us, our pre-tax results improved by $5.5 billion versus 2020 and included a profit of around $400 million for the second half of this year. This performance positions Delta as the only major U.S. airline to achieve second half profitability and demonstrates that we have significant momentum in the continued restoration of our financial foundation. Sharing our success is one of the pillars of Delta's culture, which is why we are happy to announce this morning a special profit sharing payment for all global employees. On February 14, the vast majority of our people will receive a payment of $1,250. This is a well-earned recognition for the incredible work they have done over the past year to move our airline through the crisis and position us for recovery. Turning to December quarter highlights and our March outlook. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a pre-tax profit of $170 million. Excluding the impact of Omicron disruptions, we estimate our profitability would have been approximately $250 million in the quarter. This was on revenue that was 74% recover to 2019 levels, up 8 points from the September quarter. We started the quarter with lingering impacts to the prior variant, but encouraged by the significant improvement in demand and pricing that we saw throughout the quarter in each of our passenger segments. Turning to the March outlook, we expect to incur pre-tax losses in the months of January and February before returning to solid profitability in the month of March. The Omicron case surge is impacting business travel and international recovery the most. As meetings are canceled, planned office reopenings are postponed and countries put restrictions back in place. On the consumer side, we are seeing some near-term hesitation and booking behavior given the prominence of COVID in our daily lives. And that, combined with operational challenges that the industry is facing, consumers are delaying travel until case counts subside and the industry operational reliability is restored. So as a result, we are seeing the rate of recovery step down in the months of January and February to approximately 70% versus \u201819 levels from nearly 80% where we were in December. And while the downturn in demand has been quick, we expect an equally rapid improvement once U.S. case counts begin to decline. We remain confident in a strong spring and summer travel season, with significant pent-up demand for consumer and business travel, both domestically and internationally. We expect the month of March to return to the recovery trajectory that we were on in December, resulting in revenue recovery of 72% to 76% for the full quarter. Glen will talk in greater detail about the revenue environment and Dan will walk through our costs shortly. Based on our current outlook, we expect first quarter to be the only loss-making quarter for the year. And we are confident that we will generate a meaningful profit for the full year of 2022 as the recovery resumes and accelerates in the spring and the summer. Despite the challenges of the current environment, the multi-year recovery plan that we laid out last month at Capital Markets Day is unchanged. No one is better positioned than Delta to lead the recovery as business travelers return to the skies. Delta is also uniquely prepared to benefit from the reopening of international markets, which we are optimistic we will start seeing this spring as restrictions lift. Our three core priorities discussed last month remain unchanged: fortifying our trusted consumer brand; restoring financial performance and foundation; and building a better future for our people and our planet. As part of this, we remain firmly committed to our values and ESG goals, including our commitment to fighting climate change and moving forward towards the future of net zero aviation. We recently announced the hiring of our new Chief Sustainability Officer, Pam Fletcher, the industry's only C-level CSO. Pam established an impressive track record as a senior leader at General Motors and has an extensive history of putting the customer first and developing products that help to enable a world free of emissions. So, as we move past the final phase of the pandemic, I am confident that we will continue our trajectory to not only emerge stronger than before, but to expand our lead in the industry and strengthen our position as the premium airline of choice in the years ahead. Our ambition is to transcend the industry and create significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Everything we have done during this long crisis puts us closer to achieving that ambition. Thank you again. And with that, I will turn the call over to Glen. David, this is Ed. The business travel, I'd say the best way to characterize I read is kind of a wait and see. They are trying to understand what's going on with Omicron. They are trying to understand when their offices \u2013 if they are not back, when they are going to open. And they are all making those decisions here. And the good news is that, as we're watching the case counts start to crest and peak here in our country and declining in certain early parts of the country that had the variant hit first, that's giving them encouragement to realize that they are going to be able to get back and get their people in, open their offices sooner than maybe they were thinking when first news of Omicron came. So we're in a pretty good place. When you think about the trajectory we saw over the fourth quarter, we saw a really nice growth in business, both small business as well as big corporates. And small businesses, as we pointed out at the Investor Day, is something we haven't talked as much about historically, but it's just a big pool as the corporate space is for us. And then when those offices open starting in the spring, we think it's going to pick up where we left off in December and grow from there. Thanks, Mike. We did not furlough any employee during the pandemic. Pilots included. Yes, we're in a similar position, I guess, and some of our large competitors are as well, particularly relative to the pilot contract. During the pandemic, it was very difficult for any of the airlines to \u2013 or the union for that matter to feel confident in projecting the future. So I think all talks across the industry have probably put on hold. But we're now getting ready to reengage, and we will see where that goes. But no, we're not trying to do an expedited anything. We're trying to get a real contract with our people. And to your question on \u2013 Jamie, this is Ed on \u2013 the question on credit. I don't know if we announced it this week or not. We did. Good news. So we extended the expiration date through the end of \u201823. So you'll be fine. Yes. I think there is a correlation. A lot of business travel is triggered by going to visit companies. And the companies are closed, it makes it a little more difficult to do that. It's not a one for one. But the fact that particularly the big corporates, the fact that our overall level of corporate demand, the volume return is actually fairly closely correlated, and maybe it's coincidence or not, I don't know, but the numbers are pretty tightly correlated to the amount of reopenings we've seen indicates there is a real cause and effect there, Duane. Conor, this is Ed. Yes, you are right. We did have a meaningful and an outsized share gain. And that's amongst the big corporates as our corporates really focused on premium. They appreciated the work we did around blocking the middle seats for the entire length of the pandemic while it was quite active. And what we find is when companies come to Delta or customers come to Delta, they tend not to leave, which is a good thing. And so the share tends to be sticky, and we work really hard to ensure that we maintain that. We have had good share gains in the past. Don't get me wrong. We have it. We kind of had plateaued at a level pre-pandemic. And we are significantly higher in share than our natural seat share is in those markets. So, I think we are going to work hard to make sure we maintain. And if we can grow it, we will. But I wouldn't expect you to see additional growth, not at that level for the next couple of years. Yes. Thanks, Conor. I am proud of our team, and it was hellacious three weeks that \u2013 so yes, there are definitely some learnings in there. But the good news is we recovered quickly. We got the operational integrity of the airline back to where it needs to be. It was not easy to do. But the fact that we have a very, very direct and strong and flexible workforce that will do whatever they need to do to ensure customers are being well taken care of and served was important, and that's shown through. One of the things that to me was really interesting about the last few weeks of this Omicron surge is that demand was really strong. I mean of course, it was built prior to that as it was going into the holidays, but we didn't see cancellations. Cancellations were taking is because we couldn't staff the planes. But \u2013 so the resilience of customers and their willingness and interest in getting into travel once things clear, I think is going to be that much stronger. And each \u2013 as each successive wave occurs, I think people are getting more used to, the fact that we are having \u2013 this is the virus we are going to have to manage and live with over time, and it's going to be a seasonal virus. It's not going to be a pandemic. And that's what the doctors all believe and that's what I think we are going to wind up seeing here. And we have got all the tools and the technologies, and the capability and the confidence that we can manage just that. That's a question, Myles, is way above my pay grade, national policy in China. It's been interesting as we have watched a lot of the nations around the world all manage it seemingly somewhat differently. As it relates to us, you are right. China is not a big part of our network. We would like it to be a bigger part, but it historically hasn't been. It's going to be a pretty small part of our network at least for the next couple of years and we will see beyond that. One of the things we do is we look at where we put our metal is demand. And there is not strong demand going up between the U.S. and China now. So, I don't think it's a situation that's alarming to us. But hopefully, Asia and it's not just Japan, but it's \u2013 or China, but Japan and other office, Hong Kong and Singapore, they are all going to need to figure out how to move to that seasonal virus that I just talked about. And they got the tools and the technologies to manage it. I think it's just going to be a longer road. We have a very downward feel as to growth rates in Asia for some time here. And fortunately, we have got a great partner in Korea that can do that flying in the meantime for us. Every day. Every schedule is now Tang approved. Thank you, Hunter. Hi Mary, this is Ed. I don't have the numbers in front of me. But the vast majority of the customers that had to be rebooked, we had space that we were able to accommodate on other flights to get them to their destinations. So, it's not something that we enjoy doing, but we were able to get people to where they need to be for the holidays. Well, there was flying, and some customers decided not to travel. So, that's \u2013 at least we estimated there was a $70 million hit for that. But no, there is not a substantial. If customers wanted to travel on Delta, we may certainly, we got them there. Well, our goal, Ali, is to ensure that we are meeting customer demand. And so I don't know that we can change customers' demand and interest in traveling during peak periods or holidays. And that's when they go, and we need to make sure we are there to serve them. There are learnings from Omicron, as I mentioned on the analyst call. But probably the most important learning that I saw was that, even with Omicron being the headline throughout the country and the disruption that the airline industry was experiencing from people getting sick from Omicron, travelers are still traveling. And they were determined to travel. They were resilient. We didn't see mass cancellations. We didn't see people deciding it wasn't \u2013 didn't feel right. And so I think that this was another phase that we have passed through. And who knows, is there going to be another pandemic type virus awaiting us, there is no \u2013 we don't know what it is, but we are also humbled by the fact we don't know what we don't know yet in this environment. But we do really believe that we are going to enter a nice period of being able to manage and create a set of normalcy around travel behaviors, particularly, but hopefully, life in general. And this virus will become very similar to what we have with the flu right now and move into a seasonal category with tools and technologies to manage. Flu is a pretty significant cause of death historically. In our country, I think we are seeing a lot less of that over the last couple of years because of the new tools and mitigations that we have learned to live with. And I think you are going to see people may be wearing masks and then doing different things and having technologies and antivirals that they can take to help manage to \u2013 in order to keep themselves moving. We are getting to a point where I think, Ali, we are going to focus our efforts on the small percent of people that are immunocompromised that are at most at risk. But the general population is learning and willing and exhibiting an interest to live with this risk. Yes. Leslie, as you know, we hired a substantial number of people in the past year. I think it was around 9,000. We are going to be hiring less people this year. But this number is still in the, say, 3,000 to 5,000 range depending on how demand shapes and comes back. We are not having any meaningful impact in terms of difficulty getting people to come work for this company. Regionally, yes, there are some pressure points in some of the higher cost markets, particularly in the Northeast. But no, we are doing a very, very good job of bringing the team together. And we are not having to put any unusual perks out there in order to attract talent. The ability to travel free is a great perk and we have always had that at Delta. Well, thank you, everyone. I want to wrap up here and appreciate your time this morning. Thank you for joining us. I particularly want to thank once again the Delta employees for the amazing work they have done over this course of this last year. Congratulate them on this special profit sharing payment, which we are thrilled to be able to award them with, and realize that we are making really good progress. Omicron has been a challenging period of time, but we have learned from it. There is new findings. And one of the most important findings is that we are going to move through this thing fastly \u2013 quickly and get to a point of stabilization in our views. So with that, being that we are in the State of Georgia, we have to over the \u2013 close of the go dogs, and congratulate them our employees, national champions. And thank you all for joining us today."

            "name": "Glen Hauenstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. Like Ed, I couldn't be prouder of what the Delta people accomplished during 2021. And I want to congratulate our people on their much deserved special profit sharing payout they will be receiving later next month. During the December quarter, we generated $8.4 billion of revenue. This was above our expectations at the onset of the quarter, driven by strong consumer demand over the holidays. Total RASM was up 6% from the September quarter on a 7% improvement in yield. For the quarter, capacity was 79% restored versus 2019, 5 points below the industry as we maintained a disciplined approach to restoring our capacity. The strengths we have talked about last month at Capital Markets Day are evident in our December quarter results. First, we saw a very strong demand during the holiday period. Domestic results were particularly strong, with holiday PRASM finishing up 8% versus 2019 and with passenger revenue more than 90% recovered. Second, long-haul international trends were positive in October and November as borders reopened and restrictions lifted. This momentum stalled in the second half of December as the Omicron variant resulted in more stringent restrictions and impacted our bookings. Third, we saw continued progression of business travel, with domestic volumes approaching 60% restored during the December quarter. Fourth, our premium products continued to perform well. Domestic premium revenue was 84% recovered versus December quarter \u201819, 9 points better than Main Cabin. Fifth, our diverse revenue streams remain resilient. Amex remuneration during the quarter was more than 110% restored and cargo revenue was more than 160% of 2019 levels. We also continued to see very strong consumer engagement with another record quarter for Fly Delta app downloads and sign-ups for our loyalty program. In the December quarter, we added 1.5 million new SkyMiles members, up 5% from 2019 levels. For all of \u201821, we added 5.5 million new SkyMiles members. This growing engagement demonstrates strong brand preference and our customers' desire to travel on Delta in 2022. As Ed discussed, the recent rise in COVID cases is having an impact on near-term demand and bookings. Omicron has been different than previous waves. While infections are thankfully less severe in most cases, its high transmissibility is resulting in a swift increase in case counts and impacting short-term demand. With U.S. case counts expected to peak within the next few days, we expect booking levels to rebound quickly. Once case counts begin to decline, we expect revenues to rebound within 30 to 45 days. Additionally, we expect some of the January and February demand decline to be recaptured in future as customers make up for canceled trips. Consistent with our approach all along, we are remaining nimble and agile in how we fly our network. For the March quarter, we expect our capacity between \u2013 to be between 83% and 85% restored a few points below our initial expectation. This includes a more conservative approach to long-haul international flying that we expect to be and we expect to be 15 to 20 points lower than the industry. We have also actioned our regional capacity to ensure labor constraints at regional providers do not impact our operational integrity. We expect these constraints will ease in the second half of the year. For 2022, we still expect our full year capacity to be approximately 90% recovered versus 2019, with the progression weighted to the back half of the year, but this will ultimately be determined by demand. As we outlined at Capital Markets Day last month, Delta is well-positioned for the next phase of the recovery. The Delta people have proven time and time again why Delta is the global airline of choice. We remain focused on improving our competitive position and extending our commercial advantages by investing in premium products, growing our loyalty ecosystem and increasing our revenue diversification. We are confident that the demand recovery will accelerate as the variant subsides, keeping us on a path to exceed 2019 financial performance by 2024. And with that, I will turn the call over to Dan. Sure. I think if we could pick a period of time for an Omicron variant to surge, we would probably pick this time of year, because I think it's got two components that are unique to this time of the year. One is these five weeks that it's impacting are five of the lightest weeks in terms of business travel. And two, as you indicated, it has really impacted more the close-in demand than the further out demand. And we believe we have plenty of time to recover those deferral of vacation bookings for summer. If they don't come in the third or fourth week of January, it's easy for them to come in sometime in February, March, so really not concerned yet about spring or summer. We feel that we will have a very, very robust demand profile for spring and summer. And while some of the bookings have been slightly delayed, we are still seeing much \u2013 the biggest magnitude of the impact impacting the next few weeks here. On a regional perspective, for all intents and purposes, Asia remains very constrained. We expect that to continue. And our restoration of Asia through the summer is very minimal. Europe, we've seen some countries imposing more restrictions. And at the same time, we've seen some countries trying to lift restrictions. Of course, you saw in the UK, restrictions were added, and they were removed. We're anticipating even further loosening of those restrictions over the next few weeks to the UK. Ireland has come out with much less restrictions. So I think everybody is preparing at this point for the Omicron to be in the rearview mirror, and that travel will be much more restored for the summer than it was for any of the last two summers, and that will lead to really what we think should be very, very strong and healthy demands for transatlantic leisure travel this summer. And then Latin America has continued to be more resilient. Those restrictions have come off in a lot of those countries. And clearly, the short-haul Latin markets are performing well and long haul are continuing to improve. So hopefully, that gives you the color you need. How much Slack? What do you mean by Slack, Savi? So we're getting better positioned on staffing. We did hire a lot of people in \u201821 because we had a lot of people leave in \u201820. We're looking at hiring several thousand people in \u201822. A lot of those are more longer term flight attendants. Pilots take a while to get in the pipeline and include the airline over time. But I think I'm very comfortable with our staffing levels. Yes, there is \u2013 you can't plan in advance for something that comes up overnight like Omicron there, where the world decides to shut down for 60 days. And we're going to get through this really quick. And we're going to be glad we have the staffing in place because I think it's going to be in the bookings. Your earlier question, the bookings look very good post President's Day looking forward and really haven't seen a major impact at all relative to \u201819 expectations in that. So we think it's going to be a quick rebound. Thanks, Andrew. We're hiring at the mainline somewhere between 100 to 200 a month presently and we expect that pace to continue for some period of time, certainly through \u201822 and into \u201823. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but that's the pace that we're hiring at. And everyone else in the industry is hiring, too. So it's not just Delta. We are not having any problem at all at Delta hiring and getting great pools of candidates. That's viewed as the premium airline that employees in general, but particularly pilots want to come work for, which we're thrilled about. But it is having the impact at the regionals, as you mentioned. We are down flying in the first half of the year on some of the regional carriers given some of the staffing challenges we're facing, primarily because of pilot hiring. The largest regional is our own that we work with, which is Endeavor. So we're working closely with them to help to mitigate some of the disruption and the churn that's going on through the process. But I think this is a normal period of time. It's \u2013 the next order of the crisis that we've all been through is pulling through, and it's actually going to be good. It's going to enable us to make sure that we pay good attention to the regional carriers and meet their needs. But at the same time, I'd much rather have the issue down there than at the mainline. Well, I can't speak for other airlines. You'd have to ask them that question. But I know for us, it's the right strategy. Long-term, our opportunity is international. And when you think about growth, when you think about expansion, when you think about the natural opportunities that Delta has for the future, it's going to sit in the international arena, and working very closely with that. International is hard. International, the competitive set is very difficult. And it's hard to do it on your own, to go out there and try to advance a U.S. airline in international borders unless you had some really good, strong partners in the international marketplace. We're fortunate we have great partners in the international marketplace, The Virgin Atlantic, and Air France, KLM, and AeroMexico, LATAM, Korean Air, et cetera. But we also know that those airlines have their own objectives and they have their own desires. And we have found over time that it's very, very difficult through solely joint ventures or contractual means to try to enhance the customer experience and provide the very best quality of service if you're just trying to do it as \u2013 through a contract as compared to being in the room, a seat inside the head of the company, if you will, influencing the decision to ensure that we're putting our customer interest at the center of what \u2013 because it's on \u2013 the growth is going to be based on customer preference. And just as you've seen, everything that we've done here domestically to grow customer preference, big opportunities for us to grow customer preference now sit in the international market. So we're thrilled with the investments we're making. We've made certain that each one of those investments pencil out on paper. If they are good financial investments as well, we expect to generate significant returns. And candidly, given the fact that we've already made significant investments in the past, it's going to actually allow us to recoup some of that past investment easier by staying invested in the companies. We usually don't comment on future yields, but I can say that through the past quarter, while the bottom of the business yield was about minus 25, which was in the September time frame, and then that moved up to being down low single digits. And I think we talked about that at our Investor Day, and we were pleased with where the structure was sitting as we move forward, and I don't think anything has really changed since then. So I think that's the outlook I would give you, is that we think the structure is fine now. We need the traffic back. Yes, absolutely. As you know, we check the pulse our corporate clients very often. And we did it right before Investor Day and we did it right before this call. And what we saw was that the percentage of customers who thought in the first quarter that they would travel the same or more went down slightly. But it was still 80% of the corporate travel survey respondents thought they would travel the same or more in the first quarter than they did in fourth quarter. Office reopenings have been pushed out, as you know. But we are expecting, as Ed indicated, when we get to spring and summer, that we will see a robust demand for business travel as people get back into the regular routine and feel safe traveling. So really optimistic about those results and optimistic about where we think this is going to head in the not-too-distant future. Well, I think it's premature, Ravi, to speculate on masks on planes. Obviously, that's going to be driven by the medical experts and not by the airlines. And we will follow their guidance. But in terms of restoring service on planes, yes, we're doing that pretty aggressively. And over the course of the next 2 to 3 months, you're going to see our service patterns largely restored from where we were in 2019 and continue to make the improvements. And when I say restored, restored is not the right word, it's going to be improved from where we were in \u201819. And we've taken the opportunity during the pandemic to make substantial changes to the whole catering spec, who's providing it. Took ownership positions in terms of kitchens and really big change that customers are going to be delighted when they start traveling again back in the springtime, particularly internationally. It's going to be good. The thing you were mentioning about the rapid move of the variant, I agree with you. I think that there is a real silver lining here, is that since this thing is moving so fast, it's so infectious, so many people are getting it, it's going to push the pandemic into us \u2013 into all of a normalized environment here sooner than we would have liked. So while we were together at Capital Markets Day, we talked about the uncertainty that Omicron presents. Good news is that the uncertainty is going to be short-lived. And the path to normalization, I think we're even more confident in it when we think about our \u201822 numbers and travel patterns. So it's not all negative. That's for sure. Well, yes. So we're very excited about the fourth quarter results. I think it was in the comments that it was 9 points ahead of main cabin for the entire fourth quarter, and we see those trends continuing. We \u2013 the headline for us is that premium leisure, we believe, is here to stay. And that's something that we want to continue to exploit as we think about we service our customers moving forward and how we lay out the plans and what products and services we offer. Yes, I think that's the right way to think about it. Our jet consumption will be about the same in the refinery output. So keep it consistent, yes. Well, I think what we've seen and \u2013 a little more color on that is we've seen that initially, everybody reacted by putting in some pretty onerous testing requirements. Since countries that are further along with us like the UK, who's now on the backside of the Omicron, has now started relaxing those restrictions, and we've seen other countries like Ireland relax. We've seen Israel relax on the margin. So I think that's what we would expect. I don't think for a customer who's traveling that the 1-day testing requirement that the U.S. has imposed is that all. It's pretty easy to take a proctored test with you when you travel overseas. So I couldn't speak to whether the U.S. government was going to go back to the previous policy. But in general, I think once governments feel comfortable that they have a handle on the variant, that they have backed off and started easing the restrictions again, I think that would be something that the whole world is looking towards as we move forward here. Yes. No. We do have \u2013 office is not the only thing. We have a lot of people traveling that aren't back into office yet. So we have a lot of noise probably in the numbers, and there is a lot of choppiness. As you \u2013 as we navigated the course, it felt like two or three pandemics over the course of 2021 with the various variants. But we are continuing to make good progress. The good news is that all of our corporates are saying they just can't wait to get back to be with people and be with their own people, be with their customers, visit new opportunities and invest for the future. And I think this is going to be a strong spring and summer. They are just waiting for the all clear sign that you don't have to worry about a variant as you are traveling. Sure. I think we get a \u2013 gave a pretty good outline of how we expect international restoration to occur. And what I would say is we haven't changed from where we think we will be in the summer yet. What we have changed is the low season, this \u2013 the winter IATA, the remainder of the winter IATA. We had some seasonal services starting up earlier than we would have otherwise done because we thought demand might be back early. And now we are taking that bed off and moving those start dates to later in the year. And I think we still remain very, very confident that once \u2013 as Ed said, once people feel that it's safe to travel, that they will. And as we said in today's comments and in all previous is we will remain agile. And if we don't see that developing, we will pull it down. And if we see it coming faster, we have the ability to accelerate to a certain extent, some growth in international. So really, it's a \u2013 we are still very optimistic about the summer. And we expect to be 85% to 90% restored in the transatlantic, probably less than 50% in the Pacific and largely restored in Latin America. And that's what we outlined previously. We really haven't deviated from that yet. We have competed with ULCCs for many, many years. And I think that's really where we came to a couple of different strategies, including our premium strategy. And I would like to say that some of our highest return markets historically have been straight up against LCCs and ULCCs. So, I think we are really not afraid to compete in those markets. And we think our products stand on their own. And it is a very different product and a very different customer than they are going after. Listen, we don't comment on individual performance or individual reasons. But I think Scott is a very well seasoned industry executive. And I think he is going to bring us some additional value over time. We will see when he gets here, starting next week, I believe. Well, we have taken about 20% to 25% of our regional flying down in the first part of the year. And that is \u2013 it stems really from flow-through pilots to the mainline as well as getting the right people and the right training seat at the regional carriers. And I think those are the two things that we are counting on as we get to the back half of the year to resolve themselves. So, I think one of the things is how many hours you have in seat, can you get trained, and can you get moved, we are working through all the details of how those transactions or transitions actually happen. And we are really pretty confident now that by the second half of this year, that the pipelines will be more full and we will be able to restore a lot of the small and medium-sized communities that we have had to pull down during the shortage in the first half of the year. So, we are meeting on this really daily and weekly to make sure that this actually can materialize. But right now, we feel very confident that we can catch back up again as we get to the back half of the year. We have had to exit a handful of markets. Mostly those are on per seat. So, they weren't directly scheduled by Delta. So, as of now, things that Delta had scheduled control over, we have not closed any stations, although our partners have. And what was the second part of that question? There are parked regional airplanes right now. But we expect those to return back into the sky, as I said earlier, in the second half of the year. Well, we have got big plans for our long-haul premium leisure sector. This year, we will be ubiquitous in introducing a new product, Delta Premium Select, to the transatlantic marketplace. And that is really designed specifically for higher-end leisure as well as corporate travelers whose travel policies don't include the flatbed Delta One product. So, early returns on that are phenomenal, far above our expectations. And as we get to ubiquity, we will monitor that closely, and we will report back to you. But we are excited about that. We are excited about the enhancements that Ed talked about as we get to spring and summer on the existing premium products in the long haul. And we think we have over the years developed a great suite of products that fit a lot of needs for customers, whether or not it's just basic transportation and getting there safely and on time, to really more of the luxury products, with the flatbed seats and the luxurious amenities that come with that. So, a wide spectrum. And if you think of where we started, we started with just a flatbed and a coach product. So, now we have a full suite of five products that we can offer in the transatlantic marketplace. And that will extend to all of our internationals by \u201823. Really, there are no shortage of pilots wanting to come to us or really to our regional partners. It's a matter of them getting through the training and getting into the right seat with the right number of hours. So, that's what we are working through as we look to resolve the current staffing issues there, is how long does that take to really catch up and when we will be in a position to start growing those regional players again."

            "name": "Dan Janki",
            "content": "Great. Glen, thank you. The Delta team executed well in 2021 in an environment that remains very dynamic, I want to thank our people for their hard work, congratulate them on a well-earned special profit sharing payment. So, let me start with the highlights from the December quarter. We delivered a profitable fourth quarter, reporting earnings of $0.22 per share, representing a pre-tax income of $170 million and a 2% margin on total revenue of $8.4 billion. While it was a strong close to the year, operational disruptions during the last 2 weeks of the quarter impacted our pre-tax results by $80 million. Total fourth quarter operating expenses were $8.1 billion, a 3% increase from the third quarter, driven by both fuel and non-fuel costs from the continued restoration of the airline. Fuel expense of $1.6 billion increased 4% sequentially as fuel prices per gallon increased to $2.10. Total fuel expense included a $0.24 per gallon benefit from the refinery. Embedded in fuel cost is a continued benefit from our fleet renewal, which supported a 4.3% improvement in fuel efficiency compared to 2019. Non-fuel CASM was up 8.3% compared to 2019. This included a 1.2% impact primarily due to lower capacity from cancellations during the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Now, turning to cash flows and the balance sheet, we generated operating cash flow of $518 million. We invested $948 million into the business and we repaid $1.1 billion of debt in the December quarter. We ended the year with $14.2 billion of liquidity and adjusted net debt of $20.6 billion. Now, on to the current environment and the March quarter outlook, as Ed and Glen noted, the variant is magnifying normal seasonality in the March quarter, which is our seasonally weakest of the year. The operational challenges has reduced our capacity outlook and we now expect first quarter ASMs to be between 83% and 85% recovered to 2019. This reduction is a few points from our previously expected capacity recovery. In this environment, we are also paying higher crew premiums over time and COVID-related costs as we work through staffing challenges, mitigation of cancellations and protect our people. We estimate that this will impact first quarter by $60 million to $70 million. The disruptions are impacting our first quarter non-fuel CASM comparison to 2019 by 3 points, with the majority of that driven by fewer ASMs. Absent the Omicron disruption, our March quarter non-fuel CASM is 12% higher than 2019 as our network remains 15% smaller. The sequential step up in non-fuel CASM from December to March quarter is due to maintenance normalizing to 2019 levels. As we talked about last month, when comparing non-fuel CASM to 2019, there was a 7 point benefit related to maintenance in 2021 total year due to depressed flying. This inflects to a 1 point headwind in 2022 as flying is restored. Our quarterly progression basis, the maintenance tailwind was about 5 points specifically in the fourth quarter of 2021 and there will be no benefit in the first quarter of 2022. Additionally, with the ASM sequentially \u2013 essentially flat sequentially, we are not yet benefiting from the scale and efficiency. As the ASM restoration progresses and we exit 2022 close to fully restored, we will realize the scale and efficiency benefit and our comparisons to 2019 will improve. This is consistent with the framework and guidance we laid out last month at Capital Markets Day. Underlying our 7 to 10 full year cost guidance, we expect non-fuel CASM versus \u201819 for the first half of the year to be up in the low to mid-teens, while in the second half of the year, averaging mid single-digits as that scale and efficiency are restored and transition costs subside. While we did not previously expect Omicron-related operational disruptions, there is still a lot of the year to unfold as it equates to both the capacity and demand. And we remain confident in our non-fuel CASM framework and the guidance we laid out last month. For the March quarter, adjusted fuel price per gallon is expected to be between $2.35 to $2.50. Fuel efficiency is estimated to be approximately 6% better than the same period in 2019. When combined with our revenue outlook Glen provided, we expect a loss in January and February months and a return to profitability in the month of March. Now, looking beyond the March quarter, even with the challenging start of the year, we remain positioned to generate a healthy profit in June, September and December quarters, resulting in a meaningful profit for 2022. At this point in the year, we are not providing additional full year guidance beyond the metrics given last month at Capital Markets Day. This includes capacity at 90% resort to 2019, non-fuel CASM up 7% to 10% and gross CapEx of $6 billion. The $6 billion compares to $2.9 billion in 2021 and includes $4.7 billion of aircraft CapEx, including delivery of approximately 70 aircraft and $350 million of modification costs. The remainder is related to ground and technology projects. The March quarter will be our largest delivery quarter with 22 deliveries, resulting in March CapEx of $1.6 billion. Now, reducing debt remains a top financial priority. During 2021, we reduced gross debt by $6 billion, fully funded our pension on a Pension Protection Act basis, with a $1.5 billion contribution and a 16% return on our planned assets. In 2022, we have $1.8 billion in debt maturities, with $1.2 billion in the current quarter. With a heavier CapEx quarter, we expected adjusted net debt to increase to $22 billion in the first quarter. As we achieve sustained cash generation over the next 12 to 18 months, we will continue to opportunistically manage our balance sheet, reducing debt to return to investment grade metrics and making progress towards that $15 billion adjusted net debt target by the end of 2024. So, in closing, at our recent Capital Markets Day, we outlined our financial priorities and our recovery path over the next 3 years. The power of the brand, the strength of the competitive advantage give us strong conviction in the trajectory and the path to full financial recovery. So with that, let me turn it back to Julie for Q&A. Well, one, no change, right? But I think we talked about this a little bit in the third quarter call that the \u2013 remind you that maybe historical seasonalities won't apply as you're restoring travel and the airline. And that proved to be the case in fourth quarter and what we saw. I think you're going to see a similar dynamic in first quarter. Normally, that air traffic liability will grow. You've got to account for the additional restoration that you see as you progress towards second quarter that would \u2013 that changes of seasonal impacts. So just take that into consideration. I think fourth quarter is a good proof point that you just can't take historical practices, but it's not due to the underlying change in practice. It's really just the dynamic that's going on with the restoration of the airline and the growth. Yes, we did. You can use it, Jamie. Yes. The trends haven't changed and they are consistent, but we don't actually give breakage to report that. No. I think you \u2013 when you look at the total year for 2021, it was just around $900 million when you take the interest expense with the pension. It's going to be about that level, slightly above actually. You are going to have a little less pension income. And then that interest expense line will start to really move down in \u201823 and \u201824 as you see that adjusted net debt coming down to our $15 billion target."

And good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining us this morning. The September Quarter marked another important milestone in our recovery. We achieved our First Quarterly profit since the start of the pandemic with the pre-tax results of $216 million and a pre-tax margin of nearly 3%, despite still missing 1/3 of our revenue base compared to the same period in 2019. We saw a full return of domestic consumer travel to 2019 levels, as our customers safely returned to the skies and our people delivered industry-leading operational performance through a very busy summer once again, showing why they are the best in the business. I want to thank every member of the Delta team for your hard work and dedication during a truly historic summer where we faced the challenges of standing up our operation after such unprecedented disruption.  I'd also like to recognize the Delta teams who played a central role in transporting 10,000 Afghan refugees that were evacuated from harms way in Afghanistan over the last couple of months and delivering needed supplies. It was an amazing effort that involved everyone from Delta's flight crews to operations control, to government affairs, to our charter and fleet team. Our revenue recovery in the September quarter reached 66% of 2019 levels, progressing from 51% in the June quarter and just 25% at the start of this year. This was led by strong consumer demand, growing improvement in business and international travel, and reflected the resilience of some of our diverse revenue streams which are already back to or higher than pre-pandemic levels. While the recovery in business travel paused in August and early September as case counts increased, demand has picked up since Labor Day. Last week was our top corporate revenue booking week since the start of the pandemic. And with the announcement that U.S. borders will open in November, bookings from Europe and Brazil to the U.S. are rapidly improving. The third-quarter results reflect Delta's differentiated position in the industry, and a continued focus on executing our customer-centric strategy. The strategy is rooted in providing best-in-class service to our customers, strengthening preference for our brand, and while at the same time, creating a simpler, more efficient operation. At the heart of our brand promise, is operational reliability. Restoring our operations safely and reliable -- reliably with a strong commitment to cleanliness remains our top priority. And we're proud to be leading the industry in all key operational metrics, through the summer, as well as year-to-date. One important indicator is what we call brand-perfect days. Those days when we don't experience a single cancellation across our mainline and regional operations. I'm happy to report that we have delivered 116 brand-perfect days in 2021, which are on par with pre-pandemic levels as our people are delivering outstanding reliability. We're delivering on our commitment not just to return our service levels to pre-pandemic performance, but to exceed those levels by the end of this year. A key component is staffing, and we have added 8,000 people to the Delta team this year. This new talent is helping us build the airline of the future, which includes a focus on improving diversity and representation across all levels of our workforce.  Our culture of putting our people and our customers first, is building stronger preference for the Delta brand. At its core, the Delta brand stands for connection, creating unique relationships with our customers, driving strong engagement, higher loyalty, and a sustained revenue premium to the industry. More customers are engaging with Delta than ever before, driving record downloads of our Fly Delta app and record sign-ups for our SkyMiles Loyalty Program. Our Delta American Express co-brand program continues to show strong resilience with card acquisitions nearly 95% restored and card spend 115% recovered to 2019 levels. As a result, remuneration from American Express in the September quarter exceeded 2019 levels, totaling just over a billion dollars in the quarter. Demonstrating the durability of our brand preference as we continue to deepen our customer relationships. Our revenue premium and our customer satisfaction has not just endured, but it's strengthened through the pandemic with both above 2019 levels. These outcomes are a true validation of our customer-centric strategy, and people-first approach. Same time, we're also building a simpler, more efficient airline. As we rescale the operations and refresh our fleet, we will unlock efficiency gains while also improving our product and customer experience. Dan will speak more about our fleet strategy and cost outlook shortly. As we look ahead, it's clear that the recovery will continue to be choppy, but we see a number of encouraging trends. Restoring the remaining 1/3 of our revenue base is dependent on further business and international demand improvement. In the September Quarter, domestic corporate volume was 40% recovered, up 10 points from the June quarter. With the spiking case counts, delaying office re-openings, we did not see the progression we had expected at the start of the quarter, particularly after Labor Day. But as the variant recedes, business travel has picked up over the last month, with volumes now reaching the highest level we've seen in the recovery. In the last week our domestic business volume was close to 50% restored. We expect continued improvement as offices reopen at the start of the new year. And we anticipate meaningful acceleration in business travel starting at that point. We hear regularly from our corporate customers that they're ready to get back to travel, see their clients face-to-face, to renew business relationships and develop new ones. That sentiment is coming through loud and clear in our most recent corporate surveys. More than 90% of our respondents mentioned that they expect travel volumes in the December quarter to either be the same or outpace September quarter. Nearly 60% of our accounts are telling us that they've already reopened their offices with an additional 10% expected to open their offices before year-end. We are also seeing improving trends internationally spurred by the decision to lift 212(f). This decision marks a critical moment in our road to international recovery, And we thank the Biden administration and our supporters in Washington, for their work to reopen travel to the U.S. Thanks to this important policy change, many families are going to be reunited this holiday season for the first time in almost 2 years. Against this backdrop, we anticipate our revenue momentum to show good progress through the December quarter, finishing the month of November and December combined, had a 75% recovery. This 10 point improvement from current levels is driven by offices reopening, international restrictions easing, and our expectation that consumer strength continues into the holidays. So putting the year in context, we started at only 25% of our business restored, total business for the Company. And we'll end the year at 75% restored. While choppy, there is a clear underlying momentum in our Company that gives us optimism, as we go into '22. As those fundamentals improve, we also see fuel prices continue to rise, which will pressure our ability to remain profitable in the December quarter. At present time, we're expecting a modest loss in the fourth quarter with crude prices driving that up nearly 60% year-to-date and more than 15% just over the last month. While we operate in a volatile and uncertain environment, I have the utmost confidence in our return to sustained profitability as the recovery progresses into the new year. As we continue to restore our airline, our actions are guided by three near-term priorities. First, to deliver for our customers, providing the great service excellence they expect from Delta. We've worked hard to get our staffing levels in place, reducing wait times at our reservation centers, improved self-service options, the return of food and beverage options on board, upgraded Wi-Fi and in-flight entertainment, and the full reopening of our Delta sky club network in July of 2021. We continue to deliver on the need for flexibility with policy changes in extension of medallion status and SkyMiles benefits into 2023 to give our most loyal customers more flexibility as travel resumes. Our next priority is to re-scale our airline efficiently and reliably. We're remaining disciplined about how we're rebuilding our network, prioritizing operations, and matching our supply with demand. A measured approach to restoring capacity is critical to delivering for our customers and to managing through an environment of rising fuel prices. Finally, we're preparing for the future to position Delta for success in the next leg of the recovery and beyond. While restoring capacity in a measured way, we are growing share in key markets with high-value customers. We're making smart investments in our business to elevate the customer experience. That includes technology to enable efficiency and improve our digital capabilities while accelerating construction projects in key airports like LAX, LaGuardia, and JFK. On the balance sheet, we're focused on returning to our investment-grade metrics, having experienced firsthand just how important was to have a strong balance sheet as we entered the pandemic. We're advancing our fleet renewal and opportunistically acquiring aircraft while maintaining flexibility, try to engage an efficiency that we expect will improve our long-term cost structure and our carbon footprint. Our commitment to being a carbon-neutral airline globally differentiates us as we know, the customers are choosing brands that they believe in, and employees are looking to work for a Company that's dedicated to a sustainable future. Carbon neutrality is a fundamental part of our mission, and a meaningful step that we can take right now to protect our world for generations to come. We've recently announced our commitment to work with the Science Based Targets initiative to set a net 0 of 2050 target and an interim emissions intensity target for our airline operations in line with the Paris Agreement. This quarter, Delta also announced a 250 million gallon off-take agreement for sustainable aviation fuel on our road to a 10% SAF consumption level by 2030. We also announced plans to joined several coalitions, including The Leaf Coalition, The World Economic Forums, Clean Skies Tomorrow, and the UN led Race to Zero. You'll be hearing more about all of these efforts at our Capital Markets Day on December 16th in New York. The power of our purpose-driven brand, our people, and our strategy position Delta incredibly well for the future. We're building on a strong foundation to extend Delta 's leadership position in the years to come, and drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders, our people, our customers, our owners, and our communities where we live, work and serve. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Glen.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone. Generating a profit for the quarter, even with the third of our revenue still to come, is a great achievement and is another important milestone as we continue down the path of recovery. Over the last 18 months, we have stayed true to our core strengths in our commitment to the customer, from improving our position in key markets to growing Infinity with our high-value customers, to driving outperformance in premium products and diverse revenue streams, we are extending our competitive advantages. The September quarter started out strong and consumer demand environment remained robust throughout the quarter. We had a profitable summer in Europe as vaccinated U.S. tourists were welcome back to the continent. With the variant taking hold in early August, we saw a temporary pause in demand, especially business travel as many companies delayed office reopening plans. Despite the variance impact, we remain within our initial guidance range with revenues coming in at down 33.8% versus 2019 or 2/3 restored. This represented a 1.9 billion sequential improvement in total revenue to 8.3 billion. Total unit revenue improved 17% versus the June quarter, on an 11-point improvement in load factor and a 4% improvement in yield. Since Labor Day, we've seen improvement in demand with daily cash sales growing each week. Domestic Consumer revenue remains fully recovered to 2019 levels. And we are seeing continued improvement in domestic corporate sold revenue, which as Ed mentioned, is at the highest level we've seen during the recovery. We expect continued improvement throughout this quarter. On the international front, we continue to see positive trends led by Latin with passenger revenues 84% recovered versus 2019, a 20-point sequential improvement driven by leisure traffic to beach markets. Transatlantic recovery improved by 20 points versus the June quarter to 35% recovered versus the September quarter of 2019. With corporate sales and this entity, now nearly 30% restored. We are also encouraged by the administration's recent decision to lift to 212 F restrictions. Following the announcement, Europe point-of-sale bookings for November and December are more than six times what they had been pre this announcement. As we progress through the last few months of the year, we expect strong results for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The month of October is impacted by the lingering impact of the variant, resulting in an expectation that revenue will be approximately 65% recovered. But as we move into November and December, the sunset of 212 apps and a higher mix of consumer traffic, we are expected to support revenue recovery of the 75% range to 2019 levels. With these monthly trends, we expect a percentage of revenue recovery in the low 70's for the December quarter. Consistent with our disciplined approach on matching capacity to the emerging demand environment, we expect our December quarter capacity to be approximately 80% of 2019 levels. Balancing the restoration of our capacity with demand remains a strategic priority for Delta and is more important than ever given the uneven recovery and the increase in fuel prices. While fuel is a near-term headwind for our results, we expect to recapture higher fuel in the medium to long run as we return to a more historical correlation between fuel prices and revenue. As we look to '22, we plan to progress our network restoration in line with demand. We have the ability to achieve 2019 capacity levels by the second half of next year. In addition to this quarter's financial results, there are several other accomplishments that we're very proud of. Our premium products continue to outperform. During the quarter, premium revenue in domestic in short-haul latent outperform the main cabin by approximately 10 points, as paid load factors and comfort plus and first-class cabins exceeded 2019 levels. This is a great validation of our premium strategy, especially given the higher mix of consumer demand. Our diverse revenue streams remain resilient. Other revenue in the quarter was 91% recovered to 2019 levels. Within that category, Loyalty revenues are more than 80% restored, supported by strong card spending in acquisition trends. Cargo revenue, which we expect it will continue to grow and enhance our future international profitability, was nearly 40% higher despite flying less than half of our wide-body international flights compared to the same period of 2019. And MRO revenue was more than 90% recovered on increased engine volume. Our conservative approach to restoring capacity combined with the strength of our premium products and the resilience of our diversified revenue streams, resulted in a unit revenue premium relative to the industry throughout the pandemic. As we closed the books on September quarter, we expect that trend to continue with our unit revenue premium relative to the industry exceeding our highest 3rd quarter on record, even with business and international, less than 50% recovered. This result validates a basic but powerful premise. Putting the customer at the center of everything that we do, and pursuing diverse revenue streams translates into a sustained revenue premium. As consumers returned to the skies, we've been focused on increasing stability and trust. We're also reducing friction points by eliminating change fees, enhancing self-service options, and developing our Flex product that provides full refundability for those that value flexibility the most. We're progressing towards a fleet that is more cost-efficient and fuel-efficient and one that offers even better onboard experience with a higher mix of premium seats and enhanced Wi-Fi and IFP products. Enhancing the customer experience doesn't stop onboard our aircraft. It also extends to the experience on the ground. We're accelerating investments in our airports and continuing to innovate. In Atlanta, we're launching digital ID, allowing customers to rely on facial recognition to create a seamless airport experience from check-in to boarding. And we're investing in our sky clubs included -- including two of our largest clubs in Los Angeles and Laguardia, scheduled to open in March and April of '22. As Ed mentioned, we are seeing strong consumer engagement and growing brand preference. More customers are choosing our digital channels, which are highly effective selling and self-service platforms. For example, our Fly Delta app downloads reached a record in the September quarter, up 25% versus 2019, with monthly downloads now surpassing 1 million for the first time ever. Buyer digital engagement is fueling growth in our SkyMiles program, which secured the number one spot against all global airlines in the U.S. news ranking of all airline loyalty programs. Congratulations to our customer engagement and loyalty team on this great accomplishment. Customers are joining SkyMiles at a faster rate than the passenger recovery. For the quarter our SkyMiles acquisitions were more than 100% recovered relative to 2019. And finally, our co-brand program continues to show resilience, and drive tremendous value for both our Delta and our partner, American Express. And importantly to our highest value customers. We're seeing more demand for our premium co-brand credit cards with both new and existing cardholders, as more customers are increasing, seeing the value proposition. Our well-defined improvement strategy of focusing on the customer, positions Delta well, for many years ahead. Key to our success is the fact that we have the best people in the industry, delivering on our brand promise to our customers every single day. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Janki: Great. Thank you, Glen. The teams world-class capability and continued commitment to delivering best-in-class service and reliability certainly sets the foundation for our financial success, and this quarter was no exception. The Delta people continue to execute well through a dynamic environment. Across our teams, we are focused on preparing the operations for the next leg of the recovery, taking the steps required to position Delta for the future, where we build upon our industry leadership position in the years ahead. Let me start with a few highlights for the September quarter. Even with the pause in the pace of recovery, we achieved our goal of profitability for the current quarter with earnings-per-share of $0.30, pretax profit of 216 million, and margin nearly 3%, and revenue of 8.3 billion. Total third-quarter operating expense was $7.8 billion. That was a 12% increase from second Quarter, driven primarily by non-fuel costs from the continued restoration of the airline. Fuel expense, $1.5 billion increased 5% sequentially as lower fuel prices, partly offset by 11% increasing capacity versus second quarter. Adjusted fuel price per gallon was $1.94, was 8% lower than second quarter, driven by refinery contribution versus a loss in the second quarter. We realized 4% fuel efficiency versus same period in 2019 as we continue to capture benefits of our fleet renewal. Non-fuel costs of $6.3 billion increased 14% sequentially. That was on revenue growth of 30% driven by higher capacity, double-digit improvement in load factors. We saw a step-up in costs in the quarter to support the operational performance, higher revenue capacitor volumes while we positioned for further demand recovery. The impact of these costs combined with a network that was 30% smaller, resulted in September Quarter non-fuel CASM 15% higher than 2019. Now, moving to cash flow and the balance sheet. The September quarter operating cash flow was 151 million. We ended September with 19.3 billion of adjusted net debt. The pause in the paces are recovery along with seasonality as we transitioned out of the peak summer, resulted in a sequential decline in our air traffic liability balance of 562 million to 6.4 billion. We expect the air traffic liability will begin to build as we enter 2022 as travel restrictions ease and more customers begin to make plans for the spring and summer season. Balance sheet management remains a priority, as we chart our return to investment grade metrics in the coming years. During the September quarter, we used excess cash to reduce gross debt and interest expense, while rebuilding unencumbered assets and managing our debt maturity profile. This includes the execution of a billion-dollar tender offer, paying cash for the majority of our aircraft, and commencing $500 million of incremental debt reduction initiatives, over the last 12 months, we've reduced our financial obligations by $12 billion. These actions drive interest savings, fund our pension, and smooth our debt maturity profile. Now, turning to capital and fleet. We invested nearly 620 million of Capex in the September quarter. That was below our guidance of 800 million due to timing of used aircraft delivery. Our full-year 2021 gross Capex is unchanged at $3.2 billion. On the fleet, we continued to build on our progress to transform and gauge our fleet to be simpler and more efficient, being opportunistic while maintaining flexibility to adjust to the shape of the recovery is a priority. In 2020, we accelerated our fleet renewal with a retirement of over 200 aircraft and elimination of 2 fleet families. We also deferred deliveries worth more than $5 billion, resulting in lower planned Capex in 2020 and 2021. To capitalize on the recovery and replace retired aircraft in a capital disciplined manner. We converted a total of 55 A321 NEO options to firm orders, with delivery scheduled between 2022 and 2027, and opportunistically entered into agreements acquired 38 gently used aircraft at compelling economics, two of which we announced today. Our decisions are guided by a fleet strategy, focused on simplification, scale within our fleet types, higher gauge and sustainability. The simplification and revitalization of fleet, driving permanent change in our cost structure, with benefits estimated to be around $400 million in 2021 and around $650 million in 2022. This is compared to 2019. These savings will continue to scale in future years as we take to delivery of next-generation aircraft, restore flying volumes, and further simplify the fleet. With these actions, we are unlocking efficiency gains, while also improving the product and customer experience. By next summer, nearly half our narrow-body seats will be produced by larger gauge aircraft, our most profitable fleet category. This is an improvement of 10 points versus 2019. Our wide-body fleet next-generation aircraft will make up 25% of our fleet by next summer. The 15 point improvement versus 2019, that will drive efficiency gains, premium product enhancements, and expanded cargo capability. Now, turning to the fourth quarter, we expect the modest loss as the recent rise in fuel prices will pressure our ability to remain profitable in the current quarter. Adjusted fuel price per gallon is expected to be between $2.25 to $2.40. This represents an increase of nearly $0.40 per gallon from the September quarter, as market prices have moved up sharply. Mind you, a $0.05 movement in fuel, equates to roughly $40 million of expense. Fuel efficiency is expected to be approximately 4% better than the December quarter in 2019. Non fuel costs are expected to increase 2% to 4% sequentially, as we incur people-related costs to prepare our operations for the acceleration in demand covering in 2022. Non-fuel CASM is expected to be 6% to 8% higher to 2019 in the fourth quarter. When comparing to 2019, our Nonfuel CASM profile is impacted by the cost required to restore our operations, and how we're applying our network. As we rebuild, additional maintenance and training costs are required to prepare our fleet and our crews to fly a larger schedule next summer. These costs will continue into next year. The size of the network and the deployment of the fleet are also contributing factors from a scale perspective, our network is 20% smaller in the fourth quarter compared to 2019. Our mix that we're flying is also different. We have less long-haul international capacity, which is structurally low CASM given long stage late nature of that flying. Until we are more fully restored, we expect non-fuel CASM to be above 2019 levels. As our operations normalized. I'm confident in our ability to drive operating leverage and recognize the benefit from our fleet renewal. As we look to 2022, we are optimistic about the continued demand recovery and are prioritizing driving margins, profitability, and restoring our balance sheet. I look forward to building on team strong track record of financial discipline and balanced capital allocation and sharing more with you on a long-term expectations, and goals of our Capital Markets Day in December in New York. In closing, as I continue to spend time with the Delta people, my conviction, our future only grow stronger. During my first 90 days, I've been most impressed with the teams resounded commitment to our employees and our customers which comes through in every action I have across our operations. It's clear to me that there's something truly special about the Delta family. I want to echo Ed's and Glen's sentiment, thank all my Delta colleagues for everything that they do to carry out our mission, to bring people together and connect the world. With absolutely the best employees in the business, a clear focus on the customer and continued financial discipline, I'm confident we are positioned to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. Now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Julie to begin Q&A.\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Dan. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Jen, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [ Operator Instructions]. And we'll go first to Jamie Baker with J.P. Morgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. First question goes potentially to Glen and Dan. So pre -COVID, I had asked Paul about the amount of time that it would typically take Delta to recalibrate the higher fuel prices. I'm not staring at the transcript, but its estimate of time was 4 to 6 months, which was an improvement from historic levels. So my question I guess for Glen, is whether the booking curve is deep enough right now that you might actually be able to recapture the top-line more quickly than that? And similarly for Dan, whether there's anything we should be thinking on the costs or operations side that could accelerate the process and basically just trying to understand whether four to six months is still the right estimate for us to be using.\nGlen Hauenstein: I would just comment. I think we're a bit in uncharted territory here as the recovery continues. And well, I think it might be difficult in the very short run despite the fact that the booking curve has moved in a bit, that I would estimate that 4 to 6 months is about right because we believe that demand and capacity will fall back into very good equilibrium by next spring, which would put you inside that window.\nJamie Baker: Okay. All right, so no structural changes that you can identify that would greatly alter it one way or the other then?\nGlen Hauenstein: No. I think -- I would think that that would be where we would expect it to manifest itself in the same window.\nJamie Baker: And then second question, just as it relates to the international demand that you're seeing from Europe since the Biden announcement, can you say how skewed the improvement is to the European point-of-sale. I'm just trying to reconcile some data that we have here that largely excludes euro point-of-sale, just trying to get a feel whether it's 70-30, 60-40, 80-20 something like that.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, that time of year is actually -- the winter season has more European sales than summer season. So we're talking probably about more of a normal split if that's what you're asking, 60% U.S. origin, 40% European origin. And the interesting part about this is that we have seen an uptick in both sides, not just European sales. The assumption here is that there are a lot of Europeans in the U.S. that we're worried about getting back. So very nice uptake as we get to November and December beyond the 212(f) being lifted.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you, Glen.\nOperator: We'll go next to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks for the time. So in terms of the cost guidance, which is where we're getting a bunch of questions this morning. Can you just bridge from the early September commentary that you'd miss being down. You're over 2 by a little. And today where you see it up, 6 to 8 on a unit basis. What are the main buckets? What changed over that call in 5, 6 weeks.\nDan Janki: Let me go -- What I'd say is first number 1, capacity as we pulled down the schedule in the fourth quarter, was driver and then also the pace as it relates to the rebuild and preparing for demand for 2022. Those were the two factors that led to that.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then on fleet restoration, would you put some numbers to that, perhaps? What is that in 2021? And what do you expect that to be in 2022. And do you have a sense for when we cross over from leap restoration investment to the benefits we were hearing about a while ago from fleet simplification. And thanks for taking the questions.\nDan Janki: Yeah. The restoration when you think about bringing aircraft into service through 2021 to '22, we'll bring back into service 160 to 170 aircraft. And that's really the element that vast majority of that rebuild is focused on bringing those aircraft back. And then as we restore to more fully restored capacity levels to '19, that will dissipate and trail off and be transitory in nature from that perspective.\nEd Bastian: Duane, this is Ed, if I could add a couple of points on the overall cost outlook. We are committed to our long-term guide and we'll talk more in December at the Capital Markets Day as to where we see costs going over the next couple of years. Clearly in our business, there is a race to try to capture the available demand and standing our business back up after an unprecedented level of disruption and ensure that we are not experiencing any kind of operational limitation in our ability to get our service levels and customer expectations met. So we put the paddle down to get the staffing in place to get our service levels back, to get the quality of performance that drives the brand premium that this Company stands for, and it may take us a few extra quarters to get down to that '19 and below levels, but that's still our goal.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yeah. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. And Ed, you kind of answered it there; but I guess, Dan, is it still right to be thinking 2019 costs are the benchmark here, especially just given all the wage inflation that we're seeing across the economy?\nDan Janki: Yes, it's certainly a clear marker for us. We believe as we restore this airline will be at or better than 2019 cost levels.\nBrandon Oglenski: And so is that just literally a function of the network getting back to where you were utilizing that pre -pandemic, especially with longer-haul flying coming back?\nDan Janki: Yes, there's -- certainly as we transition through this and we restore and get through the rebuilt, that will dissipate. You bring back the capacity you get that leverage. You also get the balance between the domestic and international. And then when you think about the more structural elements, the elements related to fleet simplification start to come through and you get those benefits related to that, both in fuel and fuel efficiency and also in our operating costs.\nEd Bastian: Brendan, this is Ed. I can echo what Dan is saying. We've taken the opportunity over the last year to rebuild this airline back piece by piece. And we're learning a lot more, about what we want to keep forward and retain, and what parts of the business that we don't need to be retaining and some of the cost structure until there is efficiency, whether it's a catering, whether it's in our operational performance; literally every part of our G&A, every part of our operations. Hard to see when our capacity is still only at 80% or more below -- at 2019 levels. But we are very determined to make certain that we retain the value for the period of time we've just been through and that efficiency will show through. It's just going to take a little bit longer and that's why it will be really important in the Capital Markets Day that we show you the pathway to get there. Yeah.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe just one last follow-up on the cost outlook. So I think you guys have made the point clear that we probably going to see more of an ASM recovery, not only in total amount of capacity deploy but of course on a network allocation as well as you restore on the longer haul, widebody flying. But I guess just -- if we could talk a little bit more about pace. Do we need to get to a full restoration for that to occur or going from 90% to 100% recover do we suddenly see a real acceleration in the leverage you're going to get across the business or just any high-level comments on how to think about pacing as we approach that, thanks.\nDan Janki: We'll give you certainly more color and put a pin on it as we go to Capital Markets Day, give you the outlook and also get more into specifics around '20 to '22 guidance when we give you that. The real thing I think to look for is the 2 elements. It's going to be bringing back -- bringing down that rebuild costs related to the fleet, and when we get that restored. And that's going to really pace pretty closely with the return of capacity. And then obviously the incremental leverage. So I think on that piece you're going to get it throughout that period of time, but it's really that getting that fleet rebuild component down. And that will happen as we progress through that period.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Got it. And then maybe just one more international. So at TNBC this morning, you noted that the Company saw a tenfold increase in international bookings following the announcement on the U.S. borders a couple of weeks ago. Can you just help us frame when we'll really start to see that momentum build in revenue? It sounds like there's some of that hitting in November-December time frame driving your more optimistic outlook on those months versus October. But are there also any early indications maybe for next spring or summer? Would love to hear when you think we're going to start to really see that show up in revenue a bit more. Thanks.\nEd Bastian: Sure, Katy. Yes, we're going to see it in November and December. We're looking at a 10-point recovery improvement, just going from October to November. October, we're estimating at the 65% restoration level, which is where we've been for the last couple of months and received the jump-up in November and December. International was a piece of that, the only driver of that. Business travel is an important piece of that as we see that continuing to improve. We see in our bookings I mentioned I think on the CNBC piece this morning that just in the last week, our cash sales were up 9% week-over-week and that's a trend we've been seeing here for some period of time, steady growth.  So I think you're going to see it then. I think like we saw here in the summer, there's going to be a mad rush to -- for those that want to travel, that need to travel to get out and travel. You may see a little bit of a pause as you get into the January, February timeframe. But I think Spring and Summer is going to be another tick backup at an even higher level and I -- my view is that you're going to see, particularly for Europe, which is the biggest part of our international base, on Spring-Summer next year that look very much like the Spring-Summer which has been through here in the U.S.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Thanks for that.\nOperator: We go next to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Hey, good morning. Glen, these surveys that you say, are you asking corporate travel managers these questions or the travelers themselves? And also, how are you contingency planning if we get into late next fall and business travels up only 80% of what it was pre -COVID, what sort of contingency plans do you guys have in place?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, first of all, I'll answer the first part of the question. That is a survey that goes out to travel manager. So that's their reply.\nHunter Keay: Okay.\nGlen Hauenstein: Second, and we do other surveys that go through our SkyMiles program for frequent travelers and their return to travel. And I would say that those surveys are pretty well in sync. Clearly, consumers feeling much more confidence than business travelers in terms of their -- what they expect to fly more, but more and more, we're seeing the business component accelerate. That's pretty exciting for us. And then on contingency plans, I think we are committed to remaining incredibly flexible. We know we're not fully out of the woods yet. We know there's going to be more chop. It's not going to be a straight line out, and they'll be twists and turns. Whether it's fuel, whatever it is, that's part of our business here and we're always managing to -- the sum of all the inputs.  As it relates to business travel, what I'd say we're super excited about is the fact that we were able to report a profitable quarter despite 40 -- 60% of our business travelers still not traveling. And we know that number is greater than 60 for next year, we don't know whether it's 90 [Indiscernible]. It's somewhere between ending next year, between 80 and 100. But what -- if you look underneath the hood there, I think the point that we're trying to point out is that demand for premium products is actually exceeding our coach products with the business traveler out. So I think the big epiphany for us was there's a much broader demand for this than just business travelers. And if we have to pivot to demand sets for high-end leisure to fill those seats, that [Indiscernible] is a trade-off we'll make, and I think one that we can be quite profitable with under any scenario.\nHunter Keay: Okay.\nEd Bastian: And if I could go some of Glen 's comments there. None of us know what the -- if the classic business travel, the volume is going to come back. Obviously in our industry, we're bold, we're optimistic that it's going to come back, plus, but I think we -- it's also safe to say it's going to come back differently. And there's going to be some level of demand erosion, no question about it. Some element of behavioral change, no question about that, but there's also new opportunities to travel. Hybrid for one gives you a very different outlook in terms of where people work, how they work.  I've spoken a lot publicly over the last number of months that video technology, not just doesn't force you to stay in your home, it actually allows you take the office with you when you're out on the road and stay connected better and many, many other reasons. So we're going to talk about that in December because we know that's a big question on a lot of people's minds as to what the future of business travel is. And I see as many bright spots coming out of this recovery as some of the demand destruction elements that video technology and other things and behavioral changes has ripped during this pandemic period.\nHunter Keay: Okay. I've always thought that the lack of unions wasn't so much a cost advantage for Delta, but a service advantage. Is there a way that you can get a little bit more creative next year to push that a little bit hard to drive some favorable CASM without sacrificing the frontline morale? Could you follow me?\nEd Bastian: I'm not going to comment on the benefits or lack thereof of unions. We have a union; we have a great relationship with our pilots and we have a lot of our employees are non-union. We have great relationships and great productivity from them as well. What I would tell you about our people is that they are incredible. The reason we have the revenue premium we have is not that we're necessarily smarter than anyone else. We provide the best service, the best reliability, the best product in the sky. And it's not a cost game, it's a performance game.  And it drives better revenues, it also drives more productive cost efficiencies. And we talked a lot over the last few quarters here about the need to get our staffing levels back. I've mentioned this morning that we're bringing back 8,000 people, brought back 8,000 people this year. Don't forget, we had 17,000 that retired at this time a year ago. So we are getting significant flexibility and productivity from the team as we get out to the future. And well, our people will continue to lead the way.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners.\nConor Cunningham: Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. One issue I think people struggle with is just the baseline for capacity given the fluidity in the demand environment. You mentioned all the headwinds to revenue and higher fuel. I'm not asking for a number unless you want to give one, but how has the thought process changed towards first-half capacity over the past couple of months? I heard -- and I also heard that you made the comment about 2019 capacity being -- potential being achieved in the second half. Is that your expectation right now?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think we've remained very fluid throughout the entire crisis and that's our commitment to remain very fluid until we get to -- back to full restoration. We don't know exactly when that's going to be and we put the marker out there, right now we wanted to be bigger than we are quite honestly, we couldn't be. We could be a little bit maybe. But not much bigger, without risking operational performance issues, like we've seen at some of our other carriers. We want to stay where we are confident that we can actually fly the schedules that we put out there.  We think those and we talked about rebuild costs and getting people back and getting planes back. We're doing all that now in the background with the capability of achieving a 100% of 2019 sometime in the back half of next year. Whether or not as we get closer, we actually use that flexibility up or down, we'll give you more color on what those decision points are at Investor Day. But the name of the game for us right now is maintain flexibility. And as Dan alluded to, even in the quarter we're in, we're slightly below where we thought we'd be in terms of revenue production, just about 8 to 12 weeks ago.\nConor Cunningham: Right. Okay. And then to follow up on Hunter's question for premium products continue to perform really well. And I guess in retrospect, it makes sense of pent-up demand and just the consumer being quest for cash. But how do you, how do you think about the premium cabin as demand starts to normalize? Do you think the changes are now like structural or is it really just too early to tell in it depends on what the demand environment is later on down the road?\nGlen Hauenstein: We believe they're structural and we believe that through the pandemic, we've created kind of a new class of customer, which is the high-end consumer that wants these products that maybe didn't have as much access to them because they were given to the business customer earlier in the booking process. So that's one of the things we're wrestling through as we [Indiscernible] to does our fleet accommodate the higher levels of demand? I think these are things we'll be discussing more with you at Investor Day. But we do think that there's a higher level of demand for those products moving forward.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Thank you\nEd Bastian: Conor, I don't think it's only pent-up demand and consumers being flushed with cash. Consumers are looking at travel differently and they're looking at a lot of things differently in a post-pandemic world and the quality of their provider, the care which they're provider takes to them, it doesn't matter whether you're an airline, you are a hotel, or a restaurant, whatever you are, is continuing going to drive preference and drive influence at a higher level than ever before. And as we consider ourselves the premier provider of service in our country, we're going to continue to gain, hopefully, an outsized part of that share going forward.\nConor Cunningham: Appreciate the thoughts.\nOperator: Well, the next is Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just a quick follow-up on Conor's question to start with. As you think about the capacity restoration, is there a difference between your narrow-body and wide-body fleet ability just given the fleet changes?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well the answer is yes. There is a difference. I don't know what the question is on the difference. What I would say and we'll explain this a little bit more as we have our Investor Day, but where we sit today in the inefficiencies of our wide-body fleet, we're flying a significant number of wide-bodies at a stage length that they weren't designed to fly. So for example, if you fly between Atlanta and Salt Lake City today, all of our flights are flatbed, all of our flights have premium products and all of our flights are on planes that weren't designed to go 1200,1500 miles. Not only is it driving and the opportunity of not flying that long-haul, but it's driving a higher cost structure in the existing domestic environment, which will normalize as those plans get retrenched.  Now, if you ask why, they're there, they're there because when we were in the earlier parts and we were in the cash mode, we wanted to use the planes that didn't have maintenance requirements, that didn't have -- that had available pilots in them. So now as we work to the rebuild, these were all part of the rebuild cost that we've got to identify and explain a little better. But this should have a double-whammy impact improvement because you get better cost structure in the domestic environment and a heavier waiting for the lower-cost international. And they're really two distinct components that are synergistic with each other.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And if I might, you've announced quite a few, I think in Boston new markets out of Boston. I was just wondering if you could provide a little color on the growth out of Boston and just, are those plans going to in line with the pre-pandemic strategy, or is there something different or newer or different opportunity that you see out of Boston?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think we were clear about our intentions to be Boston's preferred airline in pre-pandemic. If you go back and listen to the calls, then it was something that was our intent and we saw some opportunities in the pandemic that availed themselves and we're believing that next summer is going to be a relatively robust demand set to Europe. So we wanted to fill out some of the big demand international markets from Boston and then some of the opportunistic markets in the pandemic for Boston business. Very happy with our -- we have a great team in Boston. They doing a phenomenal job. We have a great facility in Boston. Best in class up there. And I think when you put the suite of our products and services, it really is a winning hand for Boston.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. All right. Thanks, Glen.\nOperator: We'll go next to Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna International.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So as we look at the second half of next year and the expectation that you can recover to 2019 capacity levels, and drive the Nonfuel CASM X below 2019. Could you just help us and again, this is more of an Investor Day question, but we think about efficiency -- I think you said about a billion dollars off 2019, but we think about efficiency fuel initiatives and then also the change in the network with some of these longer haul markets that you're adding to come to mind [Indiscernible] out of Boston. Just how we could put some color around those buckets as we think about your CASM X into the second half of next year. Thanks.\nEd Bastian: Chris, this is Ed. It's way premature to be getting into 2022. CASM X and I appreciate the interest level, we're going to give you that in a couple of months in December. We need to have a better handle first on how the recovery shapes in 22. That's going to drive our plan, but I will confirm that our goal is to get at or below 2019 levels. And once we have our scale back and once, we get the operations, restored to where we want it to be.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And just a follow-up. What is the time to restart some of these international flights with the easing of, I think, it's inbound from UK, EU, and a few other areas? Is it few weeks, or is that -- should we think about that more of as a first-quarter event? Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, on the margin, we're adding back some flights into the winter schedule. But as you know, winter is never the peak season for Europe travel. So what we're really thinking is, given the lifting of these embargoes, it's going to make for a great spring and summer season next year. A lot of our rebuild costs and a lot of things we're preparing for to have our European largely intact by summer.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thank you.\nOperator: The next is Dan McKenzie with Seaport Research.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess first question is for Dan, referencing some of the balance sheet investment-grade commentary, big picture. I'm just wondering if you could put a finer point on the time frame for achieving that. In the past, Delta has been able to fix its balance sheet over a five-year period. Should we be thinking five years to get to that or could you potentially get there sooner?\nDan Janki: We're going to talk about the multi -- your outlook as we talked about at Capital Markets Day. Certainly, the balance here between investing in restoration of the Balance Sheet are going to be key priorities that will be multiyear. And I do think that you referenced Delta 's historical track record there. They've shown real discipline if you look at over that period of 2010 through '19 of paying down debt while still building and investing in the airline. And those philosophies will be true as we think about this going forward, and that will be certainly part of our outlook, how we balance both at investing and restoring the balance sheet and the pace of that as part of Capital Markets Day.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. Understood. And then, Glen, on corporate travel being nearly 80% to 100% recovered by year-end 2022, just looking at where we're at today, can you just help us connect the dots on the various buckets of spend in the fourth quarter here. How are the small and medium-sized businesses behaving versus say the large corporates. And then if you could just help us slice that a little bit differently, internationally versus domestically. So areas of corporate travel that are lagging the recovery year versus areas or segments that are in line or doing a little bit better?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, certainly on the positive side, the unmanaged travel for corporate -- for business is running between 5 and 10 points ahead of managed corporate travel. Those smaller, hungrier companies out there hitting the road sooner than maybe some of the bigger multinationals. And of course, it's more heavily weighted for domestic now, but we've seen a huge uptake with the 212(f) restrictions being lifted. Europe was about 15% restored through second and third quarter for corporates.  We've seen that double to 30% just in the last couple of weeks. So seeing a nice uptick there, as well as South -- deep South America, which was pretty much non-existent for the long-haul South America, starting to show some signs of life. And then the [Indiscernible], of course, have been the Pacific, which is still largely locked down. But we are expecting those to improve significantly as we move through here as the vaccination rates in important places for us like Korea and Japan are now approaching between 70 and 80%. So hopefully, we get some good news out of that region of the world starting in the next few months here. And that's really all the color I have at this point.\nDan McKenzie: Sure. Thanks for the time you guys.\nOperator: Well, the next to David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the time. I want to ask the cost question very differently. The capacity is supposed to be down 80% for 4Q. Can you give us a sense of where the operating resources are relative to 2019 in the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to think about how many crews and pilots and staff do we have who are working to produce [Indiscernible] schedule in relation to this capacity being down 20% level. Is it down in line with that, is it down less than that? Can you help us frame the productivity issue?\nDan Janki: The -- I'm not sure I fully understand the essence of the question in regards to are you asking where the workforce is relative --\nDavid Vernon: Yes. So productive capacity. If you had a 100 people producing a 100% last year, and now you're producing 80, do you have 85% of the resource from 2019 producing that 80. I'm trying to get -- understand the deleveraging that's happened because of the pull-down of capacity.\nDan Janki: I think as we -- the way to think about it is when you think about productivity measures by group, as you restored, you're getting those productivity levels back and moving closer or beyond 2019. So that's whether it's in the airport, whether it's with catering or other types of activities. Those progress as you bring that back. There are also situations where we're hiring ahead to ramp up. So those are the unproductive people. That's where you're training them, you're scaling them before you inject them into the operation. And that's when you call out specifics associated therewith the rebuild.\nDavid Vernon: Yeah. I was just trying to see better sense for if you could help us frame how the negative impact of the productivity loss.\nEd Bastian: Let me take a stab at this, David. We have a lot of premium pay over time. The lack of \"productivity\" given where we sit with the rapid rebuild of the airline, getting people in position, getting people ready for the future, as Dan said, just covering the operation. And so you have not only just more people than capacity relative to where we are eventually going to end up once our business is restored. But on top of that, you've got a higher level of added costs going into the current funnel to ensure that you're delivering great service and building for the future at the same time on a reduced basic capacity.  So that's a big part of it. You also have the restoration costs and maintenance, and training, and other elements that are another layer and I appreciate you can't see that in the numbers broken out as clearly. But again, these are the things we're going to talk about in December at the Capital Markets Day to show you that trend line. None of us has ever been through something like this, as disruptive as this. And as it builds back, I can appreciate the questions. But we see it maybe a little more clearly over a longer period of time than looking at it in the existing quarter.\nDavid Vernon: That's helpful. Thanks. If I could just squeeze one more in there, Glen. As you think about when we should be getting back to prior period load factors? Are you expecting the airline to get back to that high '18 level in 22 or 23. How should we think about load factor recovery?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah, I think this summer we were running load factors that we're within that couple points of 2019 levels, so I would expect by next spring and summer that the industry would be back in that zone.\nDavid Vernon: Great. Thanks very much, guys.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Well, the next to Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning, everyone. Dan, can you just walk-through kind of the primary elements on the next [Indiscernible] going from 19 billion to 22 billion subdue and to December quarter and I guess seasonality plays a role there?\nGlen Hauenstein: When you think about it, there's really three components related to it. One will be you work through -- right through the elements of free cash flow and the movements, right? Its earnings. It's ultimately the movement in working capital, which is the air traffic liability. And then it's ultimately Capex. So you have the guidance framework as it relates to the earnings framework. Capex, we've told you is 3.2, for the year gross Capex worth 2 billion year-to-date, say, implies 1.2% in the fourth quarter.  And then you also have the working capital movement, which is really the air traffic liability. And normally in a period of time like this, when you think about that, that would be -- that will -- might move in a more seasonal traditional time in the low teens. But as we've talked about throughout this goal, we're not necessarily in traditional, seasonal periods of time. So we would expect that to be slightly more muted than that, as it relates to movement from it. But those are really the drivers there.\nMike Linenberg: Great, very helpful. And then just second question to Glen. What percent of your revenue is actually tied to government contracts. I know we have craft and we have the TSA City-Pair program and then obviously you recently moved the Afghan people and I realize maybe the revenue number is a small component. when you think about some of the good press that you've gotten from some of your government services you have to weigh that as well. So a multi-prong to ask on that place in your business. Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Mike, this is Ed. I'll take a stab at that. I was just asking the same question the other day. And you've got to look at it at a 2019 level. Not necessarily at today's level, because government travel is way down, given where federal government has largely not open. When you see a lot of the offices, people aren't out on the road yet. But it's collectively in the 100s of millions of dollars for Delta on an annual basis when you consider the charters, you consider all the federal workers that do travel on Delta. We have a pretty significant share of those. When you consider the U.S. mail that we carry, it's a pretty large revenue base.\nJulie Stewart: We'll now go to our final analyst question.\nOperator: And we'll go to Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Great, thanks for putting me in. A couple of follow-ups here. The 75% recovered for November and December, I just want to understand if that's what the booking curve is telling you now, or is that a number that you are extrapolating based on the current rate of improvement? I'm sorry. If things continue to get better here in the next 68 weeks if you can end up with a better than 75% recovered number for November and December.\nGlen Hauenstein: Clearly, it's both. It's what we have on hand and what we expect to get, so it's the combination of those two.\nRavi Shanker: Okay. Got it. And just a follow-up on the strong mix that you're seeing in the premium cabin. You said that that was structural. A, do you see that evidence in the surveys you're doing with people post flying? What's the evidence of that? And B, once the -- once corporate and international fully come back, let's say this time next year, do you expect to be flying more premium seats than in 2019 if this bounce, you're seeing is truly structural?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah, I think both of those we're intending on answering it. Investor Day is to show you how we see this evolving and show you all the research behind why we're confident that more premium seats are a direction we want to hit.\nRavi Shanker: Okay. Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer to start the media questions.\nTim Mapes: Well, good morning, everybody. Thank you to the members of the media who are gathered here today. We have about 20 minutes to wrap these. If we could just remind you one question and a quick follow-up. We'll try to cover as many of these as we can. And Jen, if you could remind everyone how to access their question.\nOperator: [Operator Instruction]. And we'll go first to Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: Hi, thanks so much. Just wondering -- Just given the [Indiscernible] prescriptions coming off in they're saying early November. What do you have to do between now and then, if anything, to spool up the international operation? What sorts of preparation do you have underway?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, we have a -- a lot of the airplanes are still in the desert, so we're working on getting those already. We're also doing a lot of interior work. I think one of the exciting things that we want to talk more about next year is by next summer, all of our long-haul international will have our new premium economy. So that's another thing we're working on. That premium economy is really a new class. We started it in '19, we didn't get very far with it.  But by the time we come out of the pandemic in '22 to most, all of Europe will have the new premium economy seats, which is something along the lines of a little bit better than domestic first-class and a class that we're really excited about. So getting that configuration redone. Our airports are another key thing we've been working very hard on our airports whether or not it's Seattle with the international terminal. Whether or not it's Los Angeles, which should be largely complete by next summer. There's a lot of work going back into the rescaling and it really is, it's all across the airline.\nEd Bastian: In LA, there's obviously we have a lot of seats for sale too. There are a lot of empty seats as we've been really only carrying close to 50% loads for much of the last year across Europe. So there's a lot of work going on, as Glen mentioned, but there's also a lot of fleets that already exist in the marketplace.\nAlison Sider: How are you thinking about your pipeline of pilots, longer-term over the next year, what retirements are looking like, adding what the competitive landscape is for pilot hiring going forward.\nEd Bastian: Well, we're going to be hiring over the next several years. I think at the present time, we're looking at hiring a couple thousand pilots over the next 18 or so months, forward to that question. At the same time, we had a pretty considerable number retire a year ago, about 2,000. So we've got this mapped out pretty effectively. We obviously need to forecast where the international demand is going to go to ensure that we're able to supply it and have pilots in the right spot. But we're, I think, doing pretty good job of keeping our pilots and our staffing availability for crews in line with how demand is shaping up.\nAlison Sider: Thanks.\nOperator: The next Leslie Josephs with CMBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, good morning, everyone. Just 2 quick things on your hiring. Are you seeing lower average salaries now and do you expect that to continue compared with 2019 as you ramp up? And then on the premium -- paid premium cabin, what are those pace load factors, and is this -- is with September a record and where are things trending now?\nEd Bastian: I'll handle the first, and Glen can handle the second question, Leslie. On overall labor cost, yes, we are getting a nice juniority benefit as we bring in a whole new generation of employees at essentially every level of the Company. We had close to 20,000 people retire a year ago. So the top end of our most experienced -- many of our most experienced employees had chosen to retire and that's open up opportunities for younger people. So there is a benefit to that. We have not changed our hiring weight skills in order to bring people in. We're able to bring people in at our current scales and not having any issue locating great talent.\nGlen Hauenstein: And as it relates to the premium seats, we're selling 10 points higher than we did pre-pandemic and we always run relatively full in terms of sat load factor. But a lot of those are complimentary upgrades. But what we're seeing is people are willing to pay us for those seats. And that's why we want to create more over time. I'm not going to give away what we're going to talk about in Investor Day, but making sure that we have enough to satisfy both demands for people who are willing to pay us for them as well as having an adequate supply of complimentary upgrades for our most valuable customers.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. Thanks. Do you have any number and how many people you want to hire in 2022?\nEd Bastian: We haven't put that number out yet, but we'll certainly be hiring pilots, we'll be hiring flight attendants and mechanics. I'd say it\u2019d probably be the three main areas we will be hiring next year.\nLeslie Josephs: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instruction] We'll go next to Ted Reed with The Points Guy.\nTed Reed: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask first about Boston, your goals there. Do you have goals beyond the top 10 Atlantic and the top 20 domestic destinations? And in line with that, as for your competitors, if you're growing in Boston, don't they need to grow too, and wouldn't that be part of their case to the Justice Department that they also need to grow?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, Ted, I think you know us well enough to know we're not going to comment on what we think our competitors should or could do. But I think what we see is our products suit the Boston market quite well, being a premium carrier and having Boston be a very affluent city with a huge component of corporate travel. We think that we are best suited to deliver the best products and services to the customers of Boston. And we're going to, as I said in previous calls, we don't want to be the biggest, we just want to be the most loved and the most profitable.\nTed Reed: All right. Thank you. And I need to ask about the vaccine. Do you think you can get where you need to get in terms of vaccines without having a mandate at Delta, without threatening firing, can you get where you need to?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah, well, that's our goal, Ted. The goal here is to get people vaccinated. And we are on a plan to get people vaccinated. I think it's one of the reasons the order came out from the administration was they were uncomfortable that not enough companies had plans to get their people vaccinated. And we already have a plan. And the plan's working well. We're at 90% at the present time, vaccination. We expect to get to 95% as we get into November. And there'll be some exemption requests. So there undoubtedly will be a small number of people that will not be vaccinated. I think it's going to be in the 1% to 2% range, relatively small amount of people. And we'll have to assess that when the time comes. But right now, I think we're fully aligned with the intent of the EO.\nTed Reed: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to David Koenig with The Associated Press.\nDavid Koenig: Hi. Somebody, I think it was Les, who already asked about the pay for new hires which I was interested in. What are you seeing in terms of how many applicants you're getting per job? And how does that compare to pre-pandemic as some of your competitors have commented on that?\nGlen Hauenstein: Hey, Dave. We're getting great interest in new hires coming to Delta. The flight attendants, as an illustration, we just opened up 3,000 new jobs for flight attendants. We had I think 35,000 to 40,000 applicants. We had to turn off the application portal within a week because we had so many applicants coming in for those opportunities. So we're not having issues in terms of attracting great talent. I'd say the rate of interest is comparable. Obviously, it depends on work category. Some jobs are more technical and we're having to go deeper into some pools to locate talent. But broadly speaking we're doing a great job bringing people to the company.\nDavid Koenig: That's what I was also interested in. For some of those - the technical jobs, for example, you're not having to raise pay to attract people in this labor market?\nGlen Hauenstein: We're not. We're not.\nDavid Koenig: Okay. Thank you very much.\nTim Mapes: Thanks, Dave. Jen, we have time for one final question, please. Then we'll turn it over to Ed for closing comments.\nOperator: We'll go to Robert Silk with Travel Weekly.\nRobert Silk: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if you all have received any [Indiscernible] what's the date for the reopening of Europe and these other countries, Brazil, so forth? Have you gotten any sort of guidance on that? How important is it to get that specificity soon?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I think we have a lot of intelligence on that, and it varies by country and it varies by region. So we're monitoring that very closely, and that's clearly a key component to getting international business travel back. But what I would say is that when people are able to travel, even with the tighter protocols such as testing and documentation requirements, we are seeing significant uptake in corporate travel. And I point to Europe, which is not yet reopened, yet our corporate bookings have doubled since the announcement of reopening, and we'll see exactly how that plays out as Europe does reopen in early November, how much further recovery we see there. But very encouraging. People want to travel. And as soon as they're capable of traveling and they have some certainty around it, I think we've seen it doesn't matter whether it's business or leisure, they want to get out and travel. Just to be more specific to your question though, I think it\u2019s - we don't have an exact date as to when the 212(f) is [indiscernible] - it's early November.\nRobert Silk: Okay. Is it important to get that date?\nGlen Hauenstein: Important to get the date? Absolutely. We've been asking every day.\nRobert Silk: Okay, thanks.\nTim Mapes: Thank you. With that, we'll turn it over to Ed for final comments.\nEd Bastian: Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. A lot of questions, a lot of good questions. And we look forward to taking you through our longer term strategy as we get into the Capital Markets Day in December and outline for you where we're taking this company and this brand, and I think it's a very exciting future. Also want to thank the people of Delta for the great work and the spirit of service in terms of how you took care of customers and each other over the course of a very, very challenging summer. Our team is truly the Delta difference, and we continue to be inspired by the accomplishments of the entire Delta team in this environment.  So thanks to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you in New York at the New York Stock Exchange on December, the 16th.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie. And good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining us this morning. The September Quarter marked another important milestone in our recovery. We achieved our First Quarterly profit since the start of the pandemic with the pre-tax results of $216 million and a pre-tax margin of nearly 3%, despite still missing 1/3 of our revenue base compared to the same period in 2019. We saw a full return of domestic consumer travel to 2019 levels, as our customers safely returned to the skies and our people delivered industry-leading operational performance through a very busy summer once again, showing why they are the best in the business. I want to thank every member of the Delta team for your hard work and dedication during a truly historic summer where we faced the challenges of standing up our operation after such unprecedented disruption.  I'd also like to recognize the Delta teams who played a central role in transporting 10,000 Afghan refugees that were evacuated from harms way in Afghanistan over the last couple of months and delivering needed supplies. It was an amazing effort that involved everyone from Delta's flight crews to operations control, to government affairs, to our charter and fleet team. Our revenue recovery in the September quarter reached 66% of 2019 levels, progressing from 51% in the June quarter and just 25% at the start of this year. This was led by strong consumer demand, growing improvement in business and international travel, and reflected the resilience of some of our diverse revenue streams which are already back to or higher than pre-pandemic levels. While the recovery in business travel paused in August and early September as case counts increased, demand has picked up since Labor Day. Last week was our top corporate revenue booking week since the start of the pandemic. And with the announcement that U.S. borders will open in November, bookings from Europe and Brazil to the U.S. are rapidly improving. The third-quarter results reflect Delta's differentiated position in the industry, and a continued focus on executing our customer-centric strategy. The strategy is rooted in providing best-in-class service to our customers, strengthening preference for our brand, and while at the same time, creating a simpler, more efficient operation. At the heart of our brand promise, is operational reliability. Restoring our operations safely and reliable -- reliably with a strong commitment to cleanliness remains our top priority. And we're proud to be leading the industry in all key operational metrics, through the summer, as well as year-to-date. One important indicator is what we call brand-perfect days. Those days when we don't experience a single cancellation across our mainline and regional operations. I'm happy to report that we have delivered 116 brand-perfect days in 2021, which are on par with pre-pandemic levels as our people are delivering outstanding reliability. We're delivering on our commitment not just to return our service levels to pre-pandemic performance, but to exceed those levels by the end of this year. A key component is staffing, and we have added 8,000 people to the Delta team this year. This new talent is helping us build the airline of the future, which includes a focus on improving diversity and representation across all levels of our workforce.  Our culture of putting our people and our customers first, is building stronger preference for the Delta brand. At its core, the Delta brand stands for connection, creating unique relationships with our customers, driving strong engagement, higher loyalty, and a sustained revenue premium to the industry. More customers are engaging with Delta than ever before, driving record downloads of our Fly Delta app and record sign-ups for our SkyMiles Loyalty Program. Our Delta American Express co-brand program continues to show strong resilience with card acquisitions nearly 95% restored and card spend 115% recovered to 2019 levels. As a result, remuneration from American Express in the September quarter exceeded 2019 levels, totaling just over a billion dollars in the quarter. Demonstrating the durability of our brand preference as we continue to deepen our customer relationships. Our revenue premium and our customer satisfaction has not just endured, but it's strengthened through the pandemic with both above 2019 levels. These outcomes are a true validation of our customer-centric strategy, and people-first approach. Same time, we're also building a simpler, more efficient airline. As we rescale the operations and refresh our fleet, we will unlock efficiency gains while also improving our product and customer experience. Dan will speak more about our fleet strategy and cost outlook shortly. As we look ahead, it's clear that the recovery will continue to be choppy, but we see a number of encouraging trends. Restoring the remaining 1/3 of our revenue base is dependent on further business and international demand improvement. In the September Quarter, domestic corporate volume was 40% recovered, up 10 points from the June quarter. With the spiking case counts, delaying office re-openings, we did not see the progression we had expected at the start of the quarter, particularly after Labor Day. But as the variant recedes, business travel has picked up over the last month, with volumes now reaching the highest level we've seen in the recovery. In the last week our domestic business volume was close to 50% restored. We expect continued improvement as offices reopen at the start of the new year. And we anticipate meaningful acceleration in business travel starting at that point. We hear regularly from our corporate customers that they're ready to get back to travel, see their clients face-to-face, to renew business relationships and develop new ones. That sentiment is coming through loud and clear in our most recent corporate surveys. More than 90% of our respondents mentioned that they expect travel volumes in the December quarter to either be the same or outpace September quarter. Nearly 60% of our accounts are telling us that they've already reopened their offices with an additional 10% expected to open their offices before year-end. We are also seeing improving trends internationally spurred by the decision to lift 212(f). This decision marks a critical moment in our road to international recovery, And we thank the Biden administration and our supporters in Washington, for their work to reopen travel to the U.S. Thanks to this important policy change, many families are going to be reunited this holiday season for the first time in almost 2 years. Against this backdrop, we anticipate our revenue momentum to show good progress through the December quarter, finishing the month of November and December combined, had a 75% recovery. This 10 point improvement from current levels is driven by offices reopening, international restrictions easing, and our expectation that consumer strength continues into the holidays. So putting the year in context, we started at only 25% of our business restored, total business for the Company. And we'll end the year at 75% restored. While choppy, there is a clear underlying momentum in our Company that gives us optimism, as we go into '22. As those fundamentals improve, we also see fuel prices continue to rise, which will pressure our ability to remain profitable in the December quarter. At present time, we're expecting a modest loss in the fourth quarter with crude prices driving that up nearly 60% year-to-date and more than 15% just over the last month. While we operate in a volatile and uncertain environment, I have the utmost confidence in our return to sustained profitability as the recovery progresses into the new year. As we continue to restore our airline, our actions are guided by three near-term priorities. First, to deliver for our customers, providing the great service excellence they expect from Delta. We've worked hard to get our staffing levels in place, reducing wait times at our reservation centers, improved self-service options, the return of food and beverage options on board, upgraded Wi-Fi and in-flight entertainment, and the full reopening of our Delta sky club network in July of 2021. We continue to deliver on the need for flexibility with policy changes in extension of medallion status and SkyMiles benefits into 2023 to give our most loyal customers more flexibility as travel resumes. Our next priority is to re-scale our airline efficiently and reliably. We're remaining disciplined about how we're rebuilding our network, prioritizing operations, and matching our supply with demand. A measured approach to restoring capacity is critical to delivering for our customers and to managing through an environment of rising fuel prices. Finally, we're preparing for the future to position Delta for success in the next leg of the recovery and beyond. While restoring capacity in a measured way, we are growing share in key markets with high-value customers. We're making smart investments in our business to elevate the customer experience. That includes technology to enable efficiency and improve our digital capabilities while accelerating construction projects in key airports like LAX, LaGuardia, and JFK. On the balance sheet, we're focused on returning to our investment-grade metrics, having experienced firsthand just how important was to have a strong balance sheet as we entered the pandemic. We're advancing our fleet renewal and opportunistically acquiring aircraft while maintaining flexibility, try to engage an efficiency that we expect will improve our long-term cost structure and our carbon footprint. Our commitment to being a carbon-neutral airline globally differentiates us as we know, the customers are choosing brands that they believe in, and employees are looking to work for a Company that's dedicated to a sustainable future. Carbon neutrality is a fundamental part of our mission, and a meaningful step that we can take right now to protect our world for generations to come. We've recently announced our commitment to work with the Science Based Targets initiative to set a net 0 of 2050 target and an interim emissions intensity target for our airline operations in line with the Paris Agreement. This quarter, Delta also announced a 250 million gallon off-take agreement for sustainable aviation fuel on our road to a 10% SAF consumption level by 2030. We also announced plans to joined several coalitions, including The Leaf Coalition, The World Economic Forums, Clean Skies Tomorrow, and the UN led Race to Zero. You'll be hearing more about all of these efforts at our Capital Markets Day on December 16th in New York. The power of our purpose-driven brand, our people, and our strategy position Delta incredibly well for the future. We're building on a strong foundation to extend Delta 's leadership position in the years to come, and drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders, our people, our customers, our owners, and our communities where we live, work and serve. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Glen. Duane, this is Ed, if I could add a couple of points on the overall cost outlook. We are committed to our long-term guide and we'll talk more in December at the Capital Markets Day as to where we see costs going over the next couple of years. Clearly in our business, there is a race to try to capture the available demand and standing our business back up after an unprecedented level of disruption and ensure that we are not experiencing any kind of operational limitation in our ability to get our service levels and customer expectations met. So we put the paddle down to get the staffing in place to get our service levels back, to get the quality of performance that drives the brand premium that this Company stands for, and it may take us a few extra quarters to get down to that '19 and below levels, but that's still our goal. Brendan, this is Ed. I can echo what Dan is saying. We've taken the opportunity over the last year to rebuild this airline back piece by piece. And we're learning a lot more, about what we want to keep forward and retain, and what parts of the business that we don't need to be retaining and some of the cost structure until there is efficiency, whether it's a catering, whether it's in our operational performance; literally every part of our G&A, every part of our operations. Hard to see when our capacity is still only at 80% or more below -- at 2019 levels. But we are very determined to make certain that we retain the value for the period of time we've just been through and that efficiency will show through. It's just going to take a little bit longer and that's why it will be really important in the Capital Markets Day that we show you the pathway to get there. Yeah. Sure, Katy. Yes, we're going to see it in November and December. We're looking at a 10-point recovery improvement, just going from October to November. October, we're estimating at the 65% restoration level, which is where we've been for the last couple of months and received the jump-up in November and December. International was a piece of that, the only driver of that. Business travel is an important piece of that as we see that continuing to improve. We see in our bookings I mentioned I think on the CNBC piece this morning that just in the last week, our cash sales were up 9% week-over-week and that's a trend we've been seeing here for some period of time, steady growth.  So I think you're going to see it then. I think like we saw here in the summer, there's going to be a mad rush to -- for those that want to travel, that need to travel to get out and travel. You may see a little bit of a pause as you get into the January, February timeframe. But I think Spring and Summer is going to be another tick backup at an even higher level and I -- my view is that you're going to see, particularly for Europe, which is the biggest part of our international base, on Spring-Summer next year that look very much like the Spring-Summer which has been through here in the U.S. And if I could go some of Glen 's comments there. None of us know what the -- if the classic business travel, the volume is going to come back. Obviously in our industry, we're bold, we're optimistic that it's going to come back, plus, but I think we -- it's also safe to say it's going to come back differently. And there's going to be some level of demand erosion, no question about it. Some element of behavioral change, no question about that, but there's also new opportunities to travel. Hybrid for one gives you a very different outlook in terms of where people work, how they work.  I've spoken a lot publicly over the last number of months that video technology, not just doesn't force you to stay in your home, it actually allows you take the office with you when you're out on the road and stay connected better and many, many other reasons. So we're going to talk about that in December because we know that's a big question on a lot of people's minds as to what the future of business travel is. And I see as many bright spots coming out of this recovery as some of the demand destruction elements that video technology and other things and behavioral changes has ripped during this pandemic period. I'm not going to comment on the benefits or lack thereof of unions. We have a union; we have a great relationship with our pilots and we have a lot of our employees are non-union. We have great relationships and great productivity from them as well. What I would tell you about our people is that they are incredible. The reason we have the revenue premium we have is not that we're necessarily smarter than anyone else. We provide the best service, the best reliability, the best product in the sky. And it's not a cost game, it's a performance game.  And it drives better revenues, it also drives more productive cost efficiencies. And we talked a lot over the last few quarters here about the need to get our staffing levels back. I've mentioned this morning that we're bringing back 8,000 people, brought back 8,000 people this year. Don't forget, we had 17,000 that retired at this time a year ago. So we are getting significant flexibility and productivity from the team as we get out to the future. And well, our people will continue to lead the way. Conor, I don't think it's only pent-up demand and consumers being flushed with cash. Consumers are looking at travel differently and they're looking at a lot of things differently in a post-pandemic world and the quality of their provider, the care which they're provider takes to them, it doesn't matter whether you're an airline, you are a hotel, or a restaurant, whatever you are, is continuing going to drive preference and drive influence at a higher level than ever before. And as we consider ourselves the premier provider of service in our country, we're going to continue to gain, hopefully, an outsized part of that share going forward. Chris, this is Ed. It's way premature to be getting into 2022. CASM X and I appreciate the interest level, we're going to give you that in a couple of months in December. We need to have a better handle first on how the recovery shapes in 22. That's going to drive our plan, but I will confirm that our goal is to get at or below 2019 levels. And once we have our scale back and once, we get the operations, restored to where we want it to be. Let me take a stab at this, David. We have a lot of premium pay over time. The lack of \"productivity\" given where we sit with the rapid rebuild of the airline, getting people in position, getting people ready for the future, as Dan said, just covering the operation. And so you have not only just more people than capacity relative to where we are eventually going to end up once our business is restored. But on top of that, you've got a higher level of added costs going into the current funnel to ensure that you're delivering great service and building for the future at the same time on a reduced basic capacity.  So that's a big part of it. You also have the restoration costs and maintenance, and training, and other elements that are another layer and I appreciate you can't see that in the numbers broken out as clearly. But again, these are the things we're going to talk about in December at the Capital Markets Day to show you that trend line. None of us has ever been through something like this, as disruptive as this. And as it builds back, I can appreciate the questions. But we see it maybe a little more clearly over a longer period of time than looking at it in the existing quarter. Mike, this is Ed. I'll take a stab at that. I was just asking the same question the other day. And you've got to look at it at a 2019 level. Not necessarily at today's level, because government travel is way down, given where federal government has largely not open. When you see a lot of the offices, people aren't out on the road yet. But it's collectively in the 100s of millions of dollars for Delta on an annual basis when you consider the charters, you consider all the federal workers that do travel on Delta. We have a pretty significant share of those. When you consider the U.S. mail that we carry, it's a pretty large revenue base. In LA, there's obviously we have a lot of seats for sale too. There are a lot of empty seats as we've been really only carrying close to 50% loads for much of the last year across Europe. So there's a lot of work going on, as Glen mentioned, but there's also a lot of fleets that already exist in the marketplace. Well, we're going to be hiring over the next several years. I think at the present time, we're looking at hiring a couple thousand pilots over the next 18 or so months, forward to that question. At the same time, we had a pretty considerable number retire a year ago, about 2,000. So we've got this mapped out pretty effectively. We obviously need to forecast where the international demand is going to go to ensure that we're able to supply it and have pilots in the right spot. But we're, I think, doing pretty good job of keeping our pilots and our staffing availability for crews in line with how demand is shaping up. I'll handle the first, and Glen can handle the second question, Leslie. On overall labor cost, yes, we are getting a nice juniority benefit as we bring in a whole new generation of employees at essentially every level of the Company. We had close to 20,000 people retire a year ago. So the top end of our most experienced -- many of our most experienced employees had chosen to retire and that's open up opportunities for younger people. So there is a benefit to that. We have not changed our hiring weight skills in order to bring people in. We're able to bring people in at our current scales and not having any issue locating great talent. We haven't put that number out yet, but we'll certainly be hiring pilots, we'll be hiring flight attendants and mechanics. I'd say it'd probably be the three main areas we will be hiring next year. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. A lot of questions, a lot of good questions. And we look forward to taking you through our longer term strategy as we get into the Capital Markets Day in December and outline for you where we're taking this company and this brand, and I think it's a very exciting future. Also want to thank the people of Delta for the great work and the spirit of service in terms of how you took care of customers and each other over the course of a very, very challenging summer. Our team is truly the Delta difference, and we continue to be inspired by the accomplishments of the entire Delta team in this environment.  So thanks to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you in New York at the New York Stock Exchange on December, the 16th."

            "content": "Well, thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone. Generating a profit for the quarter, even with the third of our revenue still to come, is a great achievement and is another important milestone as we continue down the path of recovery. Over the last 18 months, we have stayed true to our core strengths in our commitment to the customer, from improving our position in key markets to growing Infinity with our high-value customers, to driving outperformance in premium products and diverse revenue streams, we are extending our competitive advantages. The September quarter started out strong and consumer demand environment remained robust throughout the quarter. We had a profitable summer in Europe as vaccinated U.S. tourists were welcome back to the continent. With the variant taking hold in early August, we saw a temporary pause in demand, especially business travel as many companies delayed office reopening plans. Despite the variance impact, we remain within our initial guidance range with revenues coming in at down 33.8% versus 2019 or 2/3 restored. This represented a 1.9 billion sequential improvement in total revenue to 8.3 billion. Total unit revenue improved 17% versus the June quarter, on an 11-point improvement in load factor and a 4% improvement in yield. Since Labor Day, we've seen improvement in demand with daily cash sales growing each week. Domestic Consumer revenue remains fully recovered to 2019 levels. And we are seeing continued improvement in domestic corporate sold revenue, which as Ed mentioned, is at the highest level we've seen during the recovery. We expect continued improvement throughout this quarter. On the international front, we continue to see positive trends led by Latin with passenger revenues 84% recovered versus 2019, a 20-point sequential improvement driven by leisure traffic to beach markets. Transatlantic recovery improved by 20 points versus the June quarter to 35% recovered versus the September quarter of 2019. With corporate sales and this entity, now nearly 30% restored. We are also encouraged by the administration's recent decision to lift to 212 F restrictions. Following the announcement, Europe point-of-sale bookings for November and December are more than six times what they had been pre this announcement. As we progress through the last few months of the year, we expect strong results for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The month of October is impacted by the lingering impact of the variant, resulting in an expectation that revenue will be approximately 65% recovered. But as we move into November and December, the sunset of 212 apps and a higher mix of consumer traffic, we are expected to support revenue recovery of the 75% range to 2019 levels. With these monthly trends, we expect a percentage of revenue recovery in the low 70's for the December quarter. Consistent with our disciplined approach on matching capacity to the emerging demand environment, we expect our December quarter capacity to be approximately 80% of 2019 levels. Balancing the restoration of our capacity with demand remains a strategic priority for Delta and is more important than ever given the uneven recovery and the increase in fuel prices. While fuel is a near-term headwind for our results, we expect to recapture higher fuel in the medium to long run as we return to a more historical correlation between fuel prices and revenue. As we look to '22, we plan to progress our network restoration in line with demand. We have the ability to achieve 2019 capacity levels by the second half of next year. In addition to this quarter's financial results, there are several other accomplishments that we're very proud of. Our premium products continue to outperform. During the quarter, premium revenue in domestic in short-haul latent outperform the main cabin by approximately 10 points, as paid load factors and comfort plus and first-class cabins exceeded 2019 levels. This is a great validation of our premium strategy, especially given the higher mix of consumer demand. Our diverse revenue streams remain resilient. Other revenue in the quarter was 91% recovered to 2019 levels. Within that category, Loyalty revenues are more than 80% restored, supported by strong card spending in acquisition trends. Cargo revenue, which we expect it will continue to grow and enhance our future international profitability, was nearly 40% higher despite flying less than half of our wide-body international flights compared to the same period of 2019. And MRO revenue was more than 90% recovered on increased engine volume. Our conservative approach to restoring capacity combined with the strength of our premium products and the resilience of our diversified revenue streams, resulted in a unit revenue premium relative to the industry throughout the pandemic. As we closed the books on September quarter, we expect that trend to continue with our unit revenue premium relative to the industry exceeding our highest 3rd quarter on record, even with business and international, less than 50% recovered. This result validates a basic but powerful premise. Putting the customer at the center of everything that we do, and pursuing diverse revenue streams translates into a sustained revenue premium. As consumers returned to the skies, we've been focused on increasing stability and trust. We're also reducing friction points by eliminating change fees, enhancing self-service options, and developing our Flex product that provides full refundability for those that value flexibility the most. We're progressing towards a fleet that is more cost-efficient and fuel-efficient and one that offers even better onboard experience with a higher mix of premium seats and enhanced Wi-Fi and IFP products. Enhancing the customer experience doesn't stop onboard our aircraft. It also extends to the experience on the ground. We're accelerating investments in our airports and continuing to innovate. In Atlanta, we're launching digital ID, allowing customers to rely on facial recognition to create a seamless airport experience from check-in to boarding. And we're investing in our sky clubs included -- including two of our largest clubs in Los Angeles and Laguardia, scheduled to open in March and April of '22. As Ed mentioned, we are seeing strong consumer engagement and growing brand preference. More customers are choosing our digital channels, which are highly effective selling and self-service platforms. For example, our Fly Delta app downloads reached a record in the September quarter, up 25% versus 2019, with monthly downloads now surpassing 1 million for the first time ever. Buyer digital engagement is fueling growth in our SkyMiles program, which secured the number one spot against all global airlines in the U.S. news ranking of all airline loyalty programs. Congratulations to our customer engagement and loyalty team on this great accomplishment. Customers are joining SkyMiles at a faster rate than the passenger recovery. For the quarter our SkyMiles acquisitions were more than 100% recovered relative to 2019. And finally, our co-brand program continues to show resilience, and drive tremendous value for both our Delta and our partner, American Express. And importantly to our highest value customers. We're seeing more demand for our premium co-brand credit cards with both new and existing cardholders, as more customers are increasing, seeing the value proposition. Our well-defined improvement strategy of focusing on the customer, positions Delta well, for many years ahead. Key to our success is the fact that we have the best people in the industry, delivering on our brand promise to our customers every single day. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan. I would just comment. I think we're a bit in uncharted territory here as the recovery continues. And well, I think it might be difficult in the very short run despite the fact that the booking curve has moved in a bit, that I would estimate that 4 to 6 months is about right because we believe that demand and capacity will fall back into very good equilibrium by next spring, which would put you inside that window. No. I think -- I would think that that would be where we would expect it to manifest itself in the same window. Well, that time of year is actually -- the winter season has more European sales than summer season. So we're talking probably about more of a normal split if that's what you're asking, 60% U.S. origin, 40% European origin. And the interesting part about this is that we have seen an uptick in both sides, not just European sales. The assumption here is that there are a lot of Europeans in the U.S. that we're worried about getting back. So very nice uptake as we get to November and December beyond the 212(f) being lifted. Well, first of all, I'll answer the first part of the question. That is a survey that goes out to travel manager. So that's their reply. Second, and we do other surveys that go through our SkyMiles program for frequent travelers and their return to travel. And I would say that those surveys are pretty well in sync. Clearly, consumers feeling much more confidence than business travelers in terms of their -- what they expect to fly more, but more and more, we're seeing the business component accelerate. That's pretty exciting for us. And then on contingency plans, I think we are committed to remaining incredibly flexible. We know we're not fully out of the woods yet. We know there's going to be more chop. It's not going to be a straight line out, and they'll be twists and turns. Whether it's fuel, whatever it is, that's part of our business here and we're always managing to -- the sum of all the inputs.  As it relates to business travel, what I'd say we're super excited about is the fact that we were able to report a profitable quarter despite 40 -- 60% of our business travelers still not traveling. And we know that number is greater than 60 for next year, we don't know whether it's 90 [Indiscernible]. It's somewhere between ending next year, between 80 and 100. But what -- if you look underneath the hood there, I think the point that we're trying to point out is that demand for premium products is actually exceeding our coach products with the business traveler out. So I think the big epiphany for us was there's a much broader demand for this than just business travelers. And if we have to pivot to demand sets for high-end leisure to fill those seats, that [Indiscernible] is a trade-off we'll make, and I think one that we can be quite profitable with under any scenario. I think we've remained very fluid throughout the entire crisis and that's our commitment to remain very fluid until we get to -- back to full restoration. We don't know exactly when that's going to be and we put the marker out there, right now we wanted to be bigger than we are quite honestly, we couldn't be. We could be a little bit maybe. But not much bigger, without risking operational performance issues, like we've seen at some of our other carriers. We want to stay where we are confident that we can actually fly the schedules that we put out there.  We think those and we talked about rebuild costs and getting people back and getting planes back. We're doing all that now in the background with the capability of achieving a 100% of 2019 sometime in the back half of next year. Whether or not as we get closer, we actually use that flexibility up or down, we'll give you more color on what those decision points are at Investor Day. But the name of the game for us right now is maintain flexibility. And as Dan alluded to, even in the quarter we're in, we're slightly below where we thought we'd be in terms of revenue production, just about 8 to 12 weeks ago. We believe they're structural and we believe that through the pandemic, we've created kind of a new class of customer, which is the high-end consumer that wants these products that maybe didn't have as much access to them because they were given to the business customer earlier in the booking process. So that's one of the things we're wrestling through as we [Indiscernible] to does our fleet accommodate the higher levels of demand? I think these are things we'll be discussing more with you at Investor Day. But we do think that there's a higher level of demand for those products moving forward. Well the answer is yes. There is a difference. I don't know what the question is on the difference. What I would say and we'll explain this a little bit more as we have our Investor Day, but where we sit today in the inefficiencies of our wide-body fleet, we're flying a significant number of wide-bodies at a stage length that they weren't designed to fly. So for example, if you fly between Atlanta and Salt Lake City today, all of our flights are flatbed, all of our flights have premium products and all of our flights are on planes that weren't designed to go 1200,1500 miles. Not only is it driving and the opportunity of not flying that long-haul, but it's driving a higher cost structure in the existing domestic environment, which will normalize as those plans get retrenched.  Now, if you ask why, they're there, they're there because when we were in the earlier parts and we were in the cash mode, we wanted to use the planes that didn't have maintenance requirements, that didn't have -- that had available pilots in them. So now as we work to the rebuild, these were all part of the rebuild cost that we've got to identify and explain a little better. But this should have a double-whammy impact improvement because you get better cost structure in the domestic environment and a heavier waiting for the lower-cost international. And they're really two distinct components that are synergistic with each other. I think we were clear about our intentions to be Boston's preferred airline in pre-pandemic. If you go back and listen to the calls, then it was something that was our intent and we saw some opportunities in the pandemic that availed themselves and we're believing that next summer is going to be a relatively robust demand set to Europe. So we wanted to fill out some of the big demand international markets from Boston and then some of the opportunistic markets in the pandemic for Boston business. Very happy with our -- we have a great team in Boston. They doing a phenomenal job. We have a great facility in Boston. Best in class up there. And I think when you put the suite of our products and services, it really is a winning hand for Boston. Well, on the margin, we're adding back some flights into the winter schedule. But as you know, winter is never the peak season for Europe travel. So what we're really thinking is, given the lifting of these embargoes, it's going to make for a great spring and summer season next year. A lot of our rebuild costs and a lot of things we're preparing for to have our European largely intact by summer. Well, certainly on the positive side, the unmanaged travel for corporate -- for business is running between 5 and 10 points ahead of managed corporate travel. Those smaller, hungrier companies out there hitting the road sooner than maybe some of the bigger multinationals. And of course, it's more heavily weighted for domestic now, but we've seen a huge uptake with the 212(f) restrictions being lifted. Europe was about 15% restored through second and third quarter for corporates.  We've seen that double to 30% just in the last couple of weeks. So seeing a nice uptick there, as well as South -- deep South America, which was pretty much non-existent for the long-haul South America, starting to show some signs of life. And then the [Indiscernible], of course, have been the Pacific, which is still largely locked down. But we are expecting those to improve significantly as we move through here as the vaccination rates in important places for us like Korea and Japan are now approaching between 70 and 80%. So hopefully, we get some good news out of that region of the world starting in the next few months here. And that's really all the color I have at this point. Yeah, I think this summer we were running load factors that we're within that couple points of 2019 levels, so I would expect by next spring and summer that the industry would be back in that zone. Thank you. When you think about it, there's really three components related to it. One will be you work through -- right through the elements of free cash flow and the movements, right? Its earnings. It's ultimately the movement in working capital, which is the air traffic liability. And then it's ultimately Capex. So you have the guidance framework as it relates to the earnings framework. Capex, we've told you is 3.2, for the year gross Capex worth 2 billion year-to-date, say, implies 1.2% in the fourth quarter.  And then you also have the working capital movement, which is really the air traffic liability. And normally in a period of time like this, when you think about that, that would be -- that will -- might move in a more seasonal traditional time in the low teens. But as we've talked about throughout this goal, we're not necessarily in traditional, seasonal periods of time. So we would expect that to be slightly more muted than that, as it relates to movement from it. But those are really the drivers there. Clearly, it's both. It's what we have on hand and what we expect to get, so it's the combination of those two. Yeah, I think both of those we're intending on answering it. Investor Day is to show you how we see this evolving and show you all the research behind why we're confident that more premium seats are a direction we want to hit. Well, we have a -- a lot of the airplanes are still in the desert, so we're working on getting those already. We're also doing a lot of interior work. I think one of the exciting things that we want to talk more about next year is by next summer, all of our long-haul international will have our new premium economy. So that's another thing we're working on. That premium economy is really a new class. We started it in '19, we didn't get very far with it.  But by the time we come out of the pandemic in '22 to most, all of Europe will have the new premium economy seats, which is something along the lines of a little bit better than domestic first-class and a class that we're really excited about. So getting that configuration redone. Our airports are another key thing we've been working very hard on our airports whether or not it's Seattle with the international terminal. Whether or not it's Los Angeles, which should be largely complete by next summer. There's a lot of work going back into the rescaling and it really is, it's all across the airline. And as it relates to the premium seats, we're selling 10 points higher than we did pre-pandemic and we always run relatively full in terms of sat load factor. But a lot of those are complimentary upgrades. But what we're seeing is people are willing to pay us for those seats. And that's why we want to create more over time. I'm not going to give away what we're going to talk about in Investor Day, but making sure that we have enough to satisfy both demands for people who are willing to pay us for them as well as having an adequate supply of complimentary upgrades for our most valuable customers. Well, Ted, I think you know us well enough to know we're not going to comment on what we think our competitors should or could do. But I think what we see is our products suit the Boston market quite well, being a premium carrier and having Boston be a very affluent city with a huge component of corporate travel. We think that we are best suited to deliver the best products and services to the customers of Boston. And we're going to, as I said in previous calls, we don't want to be the biggest, we just want to be the most loved and the most profitable. Yeah, well, that's our goal, Ted. The goal here is to get people vaccinated. And we are on a plan to get people vaccinated. I think it's one of the reasons the order came out from the administration was they were uncomfortable that not enough companies had plans to get their people vaccinated. And we already have a plan. And the plan's working well. We're at 90% at the present time, vaccination. We expect to get to 95% as we get into November. And there'll be some exemption requests. So there undoubtedly will be a small number of people that will not be vaccinated. I think it's going to be in the 1% to 2% range, relatively small amount of people. And we'll have to assess that when the time comes. But right now, I think we're fully aligned with the intent of the EO. Hey, Dave. We're getting great interest in new hires coming to Delta. The flight attendants, as an illustration, we just opened up 3,000 new jobs for flight attendants. We had I think 35,000 to 40,000 applicants. We had to turn off the application portal within a week because we had so many applicants coming in for those opportunities. So we're not having issues in terms of attracting great talent. I'd say the rate of interest is comparable. Obviously, it depends on work category. Some jobs are more technical and we're having to go deeper into some pools to locate talent. But broadly speaking we're doing a great job bringing people to the company. We're not. We're not. Well, I think we have a lot of intelligence on that, and it varies by country and it varies by region. So we're monitoring that very closely, and that's clearly a key component to getting international business travel back. But what I would say is that when people are able to travel, even with the tighter protocols such as testing and documentation requirements, we are seeing significant uptake in corporate travel. And I point to Europe, which is not yet reopened, yet our corporate bookings have doubled since the announcement of reopening, and we'll see exactly how that plays out as Europe does reopen in early November, how much further recovery we see there. But very encouraging. People want to travel. And as soon as they're capable of traveling and they have some certainty around it, I think we've seen it doesn't matter whether it's business or leisure, they want to get out and travel. Just to be more specific to your question though, I think it's - we don't have an exact date as to when the 212(f) is [indiscernible] - it's early November. Important to get the date? Absolutely. We've been asking every day."

            "content": "Great. Thank you, Glen. The teams world-class capability and continued commitment to delivering best-in-class service and reliability certainly sets the foundation for our financial success, and this quarter was no exception. The Delta people continue to execute well through a dynamic environment. Across our teams, we are focused on preparing the operations for the next leg of the recovery, taking the steps required to position Delta for the future, where we build upon our industry leadership position in the years ahead. Let me start with a few highlights for the September quarter. Even with the pause in the pace of recovery, we achieved our goal of profitability for the current quarter with earnings-per-share of $0.30, pretax profit of 216 million, and margin nearly 3%, and revenue of 8.3 billion. Total third-quarter operating expense was $7.8 billion. That was a 12% increase from second Quarter, driven primarily by non-fuel costs from the continued restoration of the airline. Fuel expense, $1.5 billion increased 5% sequentially as lower fuel prices, partly offset by 11% increasing capacity versus second quarter. Adjusted fuel price per gallon was $1.94, was 8% lower than second quarter, driven by refinery contribution versus a loss in the second quarter. We realized 4% fuel efficiency versus same period in 2019 as we continue to capture benefits of our fleet renewal. Non-fuel costs of $6.3 billion increased 14% sequentially. That was on revenue growth of 30% driven by higher capacity, double-digit improvement in load factors. We saw a step-up in costs in the quarter to support the operational performance, higher revenue capacitor volumes while we positioned for further demand recovery. The impact of these costs combined with a network that was 30% smaller, resulted in September Quarter non-fuel CASM 15% higher than 2019. Now, moving to cash flow and the balance sheet. The September quarter operating cash flow was 151 million. We ended September with 19.3 billion of adjusted net debt. The pause in the paces are recovery along with seasonality as we transitioned out of the peak summer, resulted in a sequential decline in our air traffic liability balance of 562 million to 6.4 billion. We expect the air traffic liability will begin to build as we enter 2022 as travel restrictions ease and more customers begin to make plans for the spring and summer season. Balance sheet management remains a priority, as we chart our return to investment grade metrics in the coming years. During the September quarter, we used excess cash to reduce gross debt and interest expense, while rebuilding unencumbered assets and managing our debt maturity profile. This includes the execution of a billion-dollar tender offer, paying cash for the majority of our aircraft, and commencing $500 million of incremental debt reduction initiatives, over the last 12 months, we've reduced our financial obligations by $12 billion. These actions drive interest savings, fund our pension, and smooth our debt maturity profile. Now, turning to capital and fleet. We invested nearly 620 million of Capex in the September quarter. That was below our guidance of 800 million due to timing of used aircraft delivery. Our full-year 2021 gross Capex is unchanged at $3.2 billion. On the fleet, we continued to build on our progress to transform and gauge our fleet to be simpler and more efficient, being opportunistic while maintaining flexibility to adjust to the shape of the recovery is a priority. In 2020, we accelerated our fleet renewal with a retirement of over 200 aircraft and elimination of 2 fleet families. We also deferred deliveries worth more than $5 billion, resulting in lower planned Capex in 2020 and 2021. To capitalize on the recovery and replace retired aircraft in a capital disciplined manner. We converted a total of 55 A321 NEO options to firm orders, with delivery scheduled between 2022 and 2027, and opportunistically entered into agreements acquired 38 gently used aircraft at compelling economics, two of which we announced today. Our decisions are guided by a fleet strategy, focused on simplification, scale within our fleet types, higher gauge and sustainability. The simplification and revitalization of fleet, driving permanent change in our cost structure, with benefits estimated to be around $400 million in 2021 and around $650 million in 2022. This is compared to 2019. These savings will continue to scale in future years as we take to delivery of next-generation aircraft, restore flying volumes, and further simplify the fleet. With these actions, we are unlocking efficiency gains, while also improving the product and customer experience. By next summer, nearly half our narrow-body seats will be produced by larger gauge aircraft, our most profitable fleet category. This is an improvement of 10 points versus 2019. Our wide-body fleet next-generation aircraft will make up 25% of our fleet by next summer. The 15 point improvement versus 2019, that will drive efficiency gains, premium product enhancements, and expanded cargo capability. Now, turning to the fourth quarter, we expect the modest loss as the recent rise in fuel prices will pressure our ability to remain profitable in the current quarter. Adjusted fuel price per gallon is expected to be between $2.25 to $2.40. This represents an increase of nearly $0.40 per gallon from the September quarter, as market prices have moved up sharply. Mind you, a $0.05 movement in fuel, equates to roughly $40 million of expense. Fuel efficiency is expected to be approximately 4% better than the December quarter in 2019. Non fuel costs are expected to increase 2% to 4% sequentially, as we incur people-related costs to prepare our operations for the acceleration in demand covering in 2022. Non-fuel CASM is expected to be 6% to 8% higher to 2019 in the fourth quarter. When comparing to 2019, our Nonfuel CASM profile is impacted by the cost required to restore our operations, and how we're applying our network. As we rebuild, additional maintenance and training costs are required to prepare our fleet and our crews to fly a larger schedule next summer. These costs will continue into next year. The size of the network and the deployment of the fleet are also contributing factors from a scale perspective, our network is 20% smaller in the fourth quarter compared to 2019. Our mix that we're flying is also different. We have less long-haul international capacity, which is structurally low CASM given long stage late nature of that flying. Until we are more fully restored, we expect non-fuel CASM to be above 2019 levels. As our operations normalized. I'm confident in our ability to drive operating leverage and recognize the benefit from our fleet renewal. As we look to 2022, we are optimistic about the continued demand recovery and are prioritizing driving margins, profitability, and restoring our balance sheet. I look forward to building on team strong track record of financial discipline and balanced capital allocation and sharing more with you on a long-term expectations, and goals of our Capital Markets Day in December in New York. In closing, as I continue to spend time with the Delta people, my conviction, our future only grow stronger. During my first 90 days, I've been most impressed with the teams resounded commitment to our employees and our customers which comes through in every action I have across our operations. It's clear to me that there's something truly special about the Delta family. I want to echo Ed's and Glen's sentiment, thank all my Delta colleagues for everything that they do to carry out our mission, to bring people together and connect the world. With absolutely the best employees in the business, a clear focus on the customer and continued financial discipline, I'm confident we are positioned to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. Now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Julie to begin Q&A. Let me go -- What I'd say is first number 1, capacity as we pulled down the schedule in the fourth quarter, was driver and then also the pace as it relates to the rebuild and preparing for demand for 2022. Those were the two factors that led to that. Yeah. The restoration when you think about bringing aircraft into service through 2021 to '22, we'll bring back into service 160 to 170 aircraft. And that's really the element that vast majority of that rebuild is focused on bringing those aircraft back. And then as we restore to more fully restored capacity levels to '19, that will dissipate and trail off and be transitory in nature from that perspective. Yes, it's certainly a clear marker for us. We believe as we restore this airline will be at or better than 2019 cost levels. Yes, there's -- certainly as we transition through this and we restore and get through the rebuilt, that will dissipate. You bring back the capacity you get that leverage. You also get the balance between the domestic and international. And then when you think about the more structural elements, the elements related to fleet simplification start to come through and you get those benefits related to that, both in fuel and fuel efficiency and also in our operating costs. We'll give you certainly more color and put a pin on it as we go to Capital Markets Day, give you the outlook and also get more into specifics around '20 to '22 guidance when we give you that. The real thing I think to look for is the 2 elements. It's going to be bringing back -- bringing down that rebuild costs related to the fleet, and when we get that restored. And that's going to really pace pretty closely with the return of capacity. And then obviously the incremental leverage. So I think on that piece you're going to get it throughout that period of time, but it's really that getting that fleet rebuild component down. And that will happen as we progress through that period. We're going to talk about the multi -- your outlook as we talked about at Capital Markets Day. Certainly, the balance here between investing in restoration of the Balance Sheet are going to be key priorities that will be multiyear. And I do think that you referenced Delta 's historical track record there. They've shown real discipline if you look at over that period of 2010 through '19 of paying down debt while still building and investing in the airline. And those philosophies will be true as we think about this going forward, and that will be certainly part of our outlook, how we balance both at investing and restoring the balance sheet and the pace of that as part of Capital Markets Day. The -- I'm not sure I fully understand the essence of the question in regards to are you asking where the workforce is relative -- I think as we -- the way to think about it is when you think about productivity measures by group, as you restored, you're getting those productivity levels back and moving closer or beyond 2019. So that's whether it's in the airport, whether it's with catering or other types of activities. Those progress as you bring that back. There are also situations where we're hiring ahead to ramp up. So those are the unproductive people. That's where you're training them, you're scaling them before you inject them into the operation. And that's when you call out specifics associated therewith the rebuild."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Katie and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us for our June quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining us today from Atlanta are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our Interim Co-CFO, Gary Chase, and our entire leadership team will be available for Q&A. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment and our brand momentum, and Gary will discuss cost, fleet, and our balance sheet. I would also like to welcome our incoming CFO, Dan Janki who is with us in the room today but will not be participating in Q&A. Similar to last quarter's call, we scheduled today's call for 90 minutes to make sure that we have time for plenty of questions. For analysts, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst's Q&A, we will move to our media questions, after which, Ed will provide a brief closing statement. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call to Ed.\nEd Bastian: Well thank you Julie and good morning everyone. I appreciate you joining us this morning. As we speak we are well into the summer travel season. And if you have been to the airport in recent weeks you have seen first-hand how travelers are reclaiming their lives and returning to the skies. This increase in demand drove a better than expected revenue outcome for us in the June quarter with revenues down 49% versus 2019 resulting in a 6.3 billion total revenue. This was an impressive 76% sequential improvement from the March quarter. More encouragingly momentum is continuing as we exited June with a demand environment that's accelerating. Domestic leisure demand and yields are above June quarter 2019 levels and we see clear signs of business in international demand recovery heading into the fall.  Through the crisis we've earned an unprecedented level of brand loyalty and trust, thanks to the world class service, operational reliability and innovation that drives the Delta difference, and our commitment to safety, cleanliness, and wellness is as strong as ever. The people at Delta are our strongest competitive advantage powering our resurgence and running the best operation in the industry. It is because of our people's incredible work that Delta was honored as the number one airline for 2021 by JD Power. I want to thank every member of the Delta family for the professionalism, spirit of service, and warmth you show to our customers every single day.  I'd also like to thank our crews and operations teams for continuing to put our customers and their safety first as we restore our business. We are now in active recovery of our business and the challenges of getting our airline fully back to the service level our customers expect and deserve is daunting in light of the huge surge in demand that we are experiencing. But we're taking all the right steps primarily through increased staffing levels about Delta and our contract service providers to service this demand without compromising on the standard of care and cleanliness that our customers have become accustomed to on Delta throughout the pandemic. And even with these challenges our team continues to run the very best airline in the industry leading on all key operating metrics for the month of June and year-to-date.  For the June quarter we narrowed our pretax loss to $881 million. This was meaningfully better than initial expectations driven by demand strength. Importantly we achieved significant financial milestones during the quarter, these include returning to profitability in the month of June with a pretax margin in the high single-digits despite still missing 40% of our prior revenue from June of 2019 generating 1.5 billion of free cash flow and nearly 200 million of adjusted free cash flow in the June quarter. Achieving solid profitability and generating meaningful free cash flow a little over a year from the start of the worst crisis in this industry's history is an impressive statement about the resilience of our business and the great work of our people. In showcasing the value of the commercial partnerships that we have developed leveraging the Delta brand, we have created almost $1 billion in investment value this year through our partnerships with Wheels Up and CLEAR and I want to point out that $1 billion is against a zero cost base.  I want to give a big shout out to Kenny Dichter and the Wheels Up team as their listing on the New York Stock Exchange goes live today. We are proud to be Wheels Up exclusive commercial airline partners and largest shareholder with a stake valued at over $500 million. Also congratulations to Caryn Seidman Becker and the CLEAR team on their successful IPO. Our investment in CLEAR is worth approximately $340 million. And finally I want to congratulate Sir Richard Branson and our team at Virgin Galactic for making history last weekend and completing their first fully crewed spaceflight. It was exciting to watch Richard break new barriers once again, this time commercial space travel.  I take the time to mention these relationships because of the much larger eco system that Delta operates and attracts. And these opportunities to create value will continue to be nurtured as we extend our brand beyond traditional airline boundaries. With June profitability in the books we're now in the restoration phase of recovery and focused on harnessing the power of our differentiated brand and our resilient competitive advantages to drive sustainable profitability in the second half of 2021, and enable long-term value creation. Specifically, for the September quarter we expect a mid-single-digit pretax margin as demand continues to improve with the return of corporate travel and gradual reopening of international markets. We are starting to see signs of a resurgence of business in international travel both of which are supporting the next leg of the revenue recovery. And we're well positioned to take advantage of both with leading domestic corporate chair and a strong global network.  Around the country more and more offices are opening and people are reconnecting to their businesses and to each other. With 72% of our employees vaccinated, we officially reopened our own offices last month in June. And as I interact with other CEOs I'm encouraged to hear about their own plans to accelerate their return to office. That sentiment is coming through loud and clear in our most recent corporate survey with almost 95% of our accounts indicating they'll be returning to their offices by the end of this year. Domestic corporate volume grew from 20% base in March of this year, the March month that is, to 40% recovered in the June month and we expect it to be close to 60% recovered by September based largely on these reopenings.  I'm also encouraged by the strength that we're seeing in international. While we know international demand recovery will be very choppy and uneven, we're seeing strong bookings to Europe when countries open their borders. From our experience in the U.S. we're seeing the impact that widespread vaccinations have on reopening the economy. We know the same will be true for the rest of the world over time but are mindful of the risks that new variants posed to the pace of recovery and our team will stay very disciplined in restoring international capacity. As the recovery builds steam, we are making the required investments including hiring frontline and reservations employees, in investing ahead of the full recovery of the airline in places like maintenance and training. This will allow us to continue to provide industry leading service levels and prepare the airline for success in a stronger than previously expected demand environment. These investments are key to the execution of our strategy to win which is defined by providing best in class service to our customers and leveraging the brand while creating a simpler, more efficient airline.  The power of our brand has come through the crisis stronger than ever and we're seeing evidence of this across the business. The resilience of our American Express co-brand credit card program is a great testament to the increasing brand affinity that we have. Cards spend on the Delta American Express portfolio in the month of June was 115% recovered to 2019 levels for the same month despite travel purchases still being off by 25% in that same period. We're continuing to renew and simplify our fleet and yesterday we announced that we're opportunistically adding seven Airbus 350s and twenty-nine 737-900ers that will enter service over the next 12 to 24 months. These are current vintage to the aircraft that we operate in our existing fleet and we are adding these pre-owned aircraft for substantially less than the cost of new planes. These aircraft align with our fleet strategy that\u2019s focused on simplification, scale, size, and sustainability and create optionality for future growth or replacement in a capital disciplined manner. These transactions accelerate our recovery plans which also began with the exercise of 25 Airbus A321neo options in April. The A321neos which will start to deliver in 2022, offer the lowest seat cost in our fleet and will strengthen Delta's gauge advantage relative to our competitors.  Our recent actions on fleet enhanced efficiency throughout the cost structure. Gary will talk more about this shortly and we'll highlight the progress that we're making on our balance sheet and journey back to investment grade metrics. As our recovery path becomes clear so does our future as a carbon neutral airline. In 2020, we committed to our airline\u2019s carbon neutrality and we're taking actions today that are critical to our future. This includes a reduction in emissions that we're achieving with our fleet renewal, investments in sustainable aviation fuel together with many corporate partners, and the evaluation of long-term investments in carbon reduction and removal technologies. During the quarter we released our inaugural 2020 ESG report, which expands on the corporate responsibility reports that we have issued in the past. You'll be able to hear more about our ESG commitments as well, importantly as our multi-year financial targets and vision moving forward at Delta's Capital Markets Day, which we will be holding in person in New York on December the 16th. This event will give everyone an opportunity to hear from our management team, which over the past year we've strengthened by bringing in outside perspectives and promoting our deep bench. That includes Allison Ausband, who during the quarter pleased to announce, was named our Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Experience Officer. In addition, John Laughter, who I'm also pleased we announced as our new Executive President and Chief of Operations. Alison and John are Delta veterans who bring deep experience and unmatched expertise to their roles.  In addition, our incoming CFO, Dan Janki brings extensive business and financial skills to his role, as well as a broad global perspective and operational experience that will serve us well in the recovery and beyond. Dan's background makes him the ideal leader to advance our efforts to restore Delta to our pre pandemic financial position. You'll hear from him briefly before Gary delivers the financial update. With this great team of serving leaders, we're building an airline that's positioned to drive long term value for all of our stakeholders. Our people and customers are owners in our communities where we live, work and serve. I could not be more excited about our future. And now I'd like to turn it over to Glen.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thanks Ed and good morning, everyone. 16 months after the start of the pandemic, I'm encouraged by the pace of the recovery and excited about our future. Delta is well positioned with a powerful brand, strong competitive advantages, and a differentiated customer experience, all of which are increasingly driving deeper customer engagement. During the quarter we saw consumer demand for travel return at an accelerated rate as pent up demand drove an increase for air travel. As customers returned to the skies, Delta is their airline of choice given our industry leading service that's provided by the best employees in the industry. This resulted in a more than $2.7 billion improvement in revenue from the March quarter.  Compared to 2019, revenues were 49% lower beating our initial guide on 39% less sellable capacity. Bookings in domestic and short haul Latin leisure markets recovered to nearly 90% of 2019 levels, and during the quarter we began experiencing strengthened demand to select European countries as they reopened. Domestic business travel is on an improving trajectory with corporate volumes 40% recovered in the month of June, doubling from the 20% recovery rate in March. Small and medium sized enterprise volumes continued to outperform corporates by 10 points and are now 50% recovered. I'll talk more about the encouraging trends we see in corporate in a few minutes.  From April to June passenger unit revenues improved by 25 points, with both load factors and yields strengthening through the quarter. This is a great accomplishment considering that we had the middle seat block in place for the month of April, which, when lifted on May 1st resulted in a 45% increase in sellable capacity with minimal incremental costs. So kudos to the Delta team for managing through this transition period and driving these outstanding results. I also want to congratulate our cargo team for an outstanding quarter with cargo revenues up 35% compared to the June 2019 quarter, despite running a much smaller operation. We are also seeing momentum in daily bookings and net cash sales. Our average net cash came in 20% higher than forecast, doubling relative to the March quarter. Importantly, in the month of June, our average net cash sales are 70% restored to corresponding 2019 levels that's running about 10 points ahead of revenue recovery as customers are making travel plans out into the future.  As Ed mentioned, we're exiting June with a demand environment that's much stronger than just three months ago. Since the start of the year, we've seen a sequential revenue improvement from 35% recovery versus 2019 and first quarter to 51% in the second quarter. That trajectory is continuing and we expect our September quarter total revenue to be 65% to 70% recovered on capacity at 70% to 72% recovered when compared to the same quarter in 2019. This positions us for another significant sequential improvement in unit revenues. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents another 2 billion sequential increase in revenue on approximately 10% higher capacity.  We expect strong leisure demand to continue through the fall and winter and we're starting to see the next leg of the recovery take hold with improving trends in business and international travel. Delta is well positioned to take advantage of both with leading domestic corporate share and a strong global network. Corporate travel volumes accelerated in May and June with almost 95% of our accounts booking travel in the month of June. We're also beginning to see a return of consulting and sales related travel and higher volumes in traditionally business heavy markets like New York City and Boston. Our recent corporate survey results show that over 90% of our corporate accounts anticipate travel volumes to increase in the September quarter, up from just 33% in the March quarter. In addition to these survey results our close engagement with customers give us increased confidence of the acceleration of business travel, especially as we move towards the post Labor Day period as schools and offices continue to reopen.  We expect domestic corporate volumes will recover between 55% and 60% of 2019 levels by the end of the September quarter, up from 40% at the end of the June quarter. Despite volatility in global COVID recovery trends, international travel is accelerating with capacity and load factors increasing as we head into the fall. When we spoke last quarter, only two European countries had reopened for U.S. citizens, today more than 15 European countries are open and we're seeing strong bookings follow as border closings lift. We are also hopeful that 212F restrictions prohibiting inbound travel to the U.S. will be significantly reduced in the September quarter. The recovery in short haul Latin exceeded 2019 levels, but in long haul Latin demand remains muted as many countries are still closed. Pacific demand remains low and will likely be the last region to recover.  Delta has a strong platform internationally due to the structural changes in the landscape, but more importantly because of elements unique to Delta. First, we will have the number one joint ventures in each entity, and our international partners will emerge from their restructuring efforts more competitive than before. We look forward to continuing our valuable strategic relationships with all of our global partners as they navigate through the COVID-19 crisis and as they position themselves to emerge from their restructuring processes. We are confident these strategic relationships will accelerate our international recovery in the years to come.  Second, our hubs are powerful, offering extensive and efficient global coverage. The strengths of our global hubs resemble those of our core domestic hubs, namely strong presence and local share and the ability to connect traffic efficiently. Third, our wide body fleet renewal will be instrumental in our recovery and path to higher margins. Adding the seven A350s announced yesterday builds on our long-term pre-planned efforts. Our wide body fleet renewal program improves our product offering, enhances our cargo capability, reduces our unit costs, and is more efficient -- fuel efficient, contributing to a more sustainable future.  As we rebuild the airline, we're optimizing the network for the return of business in international travel and are building on the strengths of our core and coastal hubs where we've been able to improve our local share by three points from pre-pandemic levels. We also continue to put the customer at the center of everything we do, creating an enhanced premium experience. This is successfully de-commoditizing air travel on Delta, providing customers with the products and flexibility that they value most. Premium products are demonstrating resilience where demand is strongest with domestic and short haul Latin premium revenues outpacing main cabin by 5 to 10 points. We believe this will be reflected at the system level as premium revenue and other entities improves with a return of business and international travel at scale.  We're also seeing increases in customer engagement and brand momentum. This is evident in SkyMiles acquisitions which set an all-time record in the month of June, outpacing the prior record achieved in July of 2019. These acquisitions allow us to bring new customers into the Delta ecosystem. The engagement is also coming through the performance of our co-brand credit card program as customers are increasingly seeing the value proposition and continue to aspire for travel, status, and premium experience. For the quarter, program spend was 110% recovered to 2019 levels driven by improving T&E spend indicating customer\u2019s desire to explore the world and reconnect with friends and family. We exited the quarter with program spent around 115% recovered for the month of June. [Indiscernible] brand account acquisitions improved more than 75% sequentially and were around 90% recovered to 2019 levels for the quarter. In addition we're seeing more customers moving into premium co-branded cards given the value of proposition for those products. The improving trajectory resulted in cash remuneration from American Express in the month of June exceeding 2019 levels. We expect remuneration will continue to remain at or above 2019 levels into the second half with significant growth opportunities in the years ahead.  In closing the foundational building blocks for our long-term success are in place. With the industry's best domestic and global network renewed an efficient fleet, a de-commoditized product and a highly valued brand and the industry's best employees we continue to extend our commercial and financial lead. Combining that with our efficient cost structure puts us on a path to improve on our pre-pandemic margins and generate sustainable free cash flows allowing us to reinvest in the business and restore our balance sheet strength. Delta\u2019s future is incredibly bright. And with that I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome our incoming CFO to Delta. Dan, I'm looking forward to working with you and now I'll turn the call over to you for a few minutes. \nDan Janki: Thank you Ed and Glen for the warm welcome. Certainly pleased to be here and begin working closely with Ed, Glen, and the entire executive leadership team. To ensure that we continue to establish clear priorities, deliver on our commitment, and build a more resilient valuable Delta there's no doubt it is an interesting time to join. What really drew me to this opportunity at Delta is the unique culture, industry leadership, and growing brand strength with customers. It's a combination like no other in the industry. It's really clear that there's a great deal of talent in the finance organization. I'm humbled and honored to lead this organization forward through this pivotal time.  The key guiding principle for me will be open and transparent communication with the financial community. I look forward to speaking to all of you and getting to know the key stakeholders in the coming weeks and months including many of you on the call. Now I'll turn it over to Gary for the financial update. \nGary Chase: Thank you Dan and on behalf of the entire finance team welcome to Delta. Good morning everyone on the call and thanks for joining us. Delta people shined and carried our brand to new heights during the crisis. Those efforts combined with the strong demand recovery Glen described and the benefits of operating a simpler and more efficient fleet are enabling us to cross a number of key milestones on our journey to return to and exceed 2019 performance. Let me quickly review the second quarter and then provide color on our second half cost outlook. I will wrap with a discussion of our capital outlook and balance sheet.  Starting with highlights from the quarter, we reported an adjusted pretax loss of 881 million, more than $2 billion sequential improvement and generated a solid June month profit despite revenues for the month of June still 40% below 2019. Non-fuel costs rose 6% sequentially on 21% higher capacity as the teams continued to rebuild our network efficiently. Non-fuel CASM was 9% higher than 2019. We realize savings from tax credits and third party rate reductions that were offset by rebuild expenses and maintenance and pilot training and a non-cash expense for employee flight passes awarded to our employees in recognition of winning the JD Power award.  Adjusted fuel price per gallon of $2.12 was 11% higher than the first quarter, including a $0.23 per gallon impact from refinery losses. We realized a 7.1% fuel efficiency gain versus the June quarter of 2019 with the majority driven by fleet renewal. Demand momentum field cast sales across the booking curve driving $1.5 billion of growth in our air traffic liability to nearly 7 billion, now 300 million higher than the same period in 2019. With the strength we see in the demand environment we expect our air traffic liability to remain above 2019 levels into next year. Daily cash generation was substantially positive for the full quarter. More importantly we generated nearly 200 million of free cash flow excluding our 1.5 billion pension contribution and 2.5 billion in PSP grant proceeds. We are transitioning now away from daily metrics to focus on regular free cash flow, the best measure of value creation as we turn the corner on profitability and look to restore our financial strength. As we head into the second half we are excited to shift our focus to return into profitability generating cash and restoring and exceeding our pre-COVID results and financial position. With continued recovery and limited cost growth, we expect to be profitable in both the September and December quarters at current fuel prices.  Regarding the cost outlook, I'm very happy with the team's performance in the first half as we continue to rebuild the network efficiently. We remain on a path to achieve non-fuel CASM below 2019 levels by fourth quarter though the strength of demand recovery is creating some welcome cost pressure in the form of higher rebuild and selling related expense. We have also experienced inflationary pressure from vendors and our operating teams have accelerated hiring of frontline employees to ensure we maintain excellence in operations in service levels as we rescale. Despite these pressures we will see continued leverage in key areas. For example, we expect an approximate 8% headcount growth through the end of the year on a nearly 15% increase in ASM production. We'll see our fleet utilization rise from 2Q levels approximately 15% below 2019 to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter. Our airports will also see better utilization particularly our coastal hubs as they move from 70% to more than 90% restored.  As we accelerate maintenance and training in the higher potential capacity in 2022, rebuild expenses are stepping up in both the third and fourth quarters to 5 to 6 point cost headwind versus 3 to 4 points in the first half. September quarter will see non-fuel costs grow sequentially at roughly the same rate as capacity due to the higher rebuild and revenue related expenses I mentioned. With these factors September quarter non-fuel CASM is expected to be 11% to 14% higher than 2019. We expect to close the gap to 2019 non-fuel CASM in the fourth quarter through continued volume leverage as capacity remains essentially flat from the third to fourth quarters instead of the more normal seasonal decline of approximately 15%. Adjusted fuel price per gallon for the third quarter is expected at 205 to 215. The fuel efficiency for the quarter is expected to remain better than the September quarter 2019 period by approximately 5%.  On the capital outlook, we now expect gross CAPEX of approximately 3.2 billion in 2021 up from our original guidance of 2.5 billion driven by our aircraft announcements. Hats off to our fleet and technical supply chain teams for landing these compelling opportunities that meet three key criteria. These transactions are opportunistic and take advantage of attractive economics in the used market. These aircraft types are currently active in our fleet and entirely consistent with our fleet simplification strategy. In addition, these aircraft along with the 321neo options we exercised in April will support the potential for up to 7 points of additional capacity restoration at compelling marginal economics by 2023. We have a lot of additional optionality in our fleet plan to flex capacity up or down at low cost depending on the shape of the recovery. Our 717 and 767 fleets are our largest levers. We're still flying these fleets at scale today and could retire additional units or reactivate parked aircrafts to meet higher demand scenarios.  Let me now move to the balance sheet. With improving financial performance and a strong liquidity position, we're using cash to reduce leverage and non-operating expense while rebuilding on encumbered assets and managing our debt maturity profile. During the quarter we pre-paid 450 million in aircraft related debt in addition to normal amortization of 875 million and contributed 1.5 billion to the pension plans. Additionally, we paid cash for all but three aircraft deliveries. Since October, our debt reduction initiatives have totaled 11 billion and freed up 6 billion in collateral. With the additional funding this quarter, we do not foresee the need to make any material pension contributions in the future. By year end, we expect the plans to be fully funded on a Pension Protection Act basis and 90% funded on a GAAP basis. With this level of funding and the plans frozen to new participants, we are now reducing the investment risk of the portfolio to protect our funded status. The great work of our Pension and Treasury teams over the last decade in funding this obligation frees up roughly a billion in annual free cash flow that can be used in the future to further delever or otherwise create value. Adjusted net debt is expected to be approximately 19 billion at the end of the September quarter, modestly increasing from where we ended June as we paid cash for aircraft deliveries. As we turn the corner on profitability and look to the future, we're excited to shift our focus to restoring our business and delivering long term value for our owners. Restoring our financial Foundation remains a top priority as we position for the future, and we look forward to sharing more of our long-term vision with you in December. Let me conclude by congratulating the 75,000 people who make the Delta difference a reality every day. These excellent results are your score card and a reflection of all you do to delight our customers. With that I will turn the call back over to Julie to begin the Q&A.\nJulie Stewart: Katie, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody and thanks for your time. Welcome, Dan. So here's my questions, my first question is I was wondering if you could talk about -- maybe Glen this is for you, how you expect the non-U.S. recovery to look by the different regions over the next say 6 to 12 months, if you can? And then my other question is, I think Glenn, you might have talked a little bit about this in the ATL line. Are you seeing that people are booking further out and I don't know if you can talk to, like, after Labor Day bookings or even holiday bookings, how they're comping to previous levels?\nGary Chase: So Helane, first about the entities a little bit. We're seeing a U.S. based demand recovery to the open countries in the Transatlantic, and we expect our loads to move to be close to historical levels running probably in the low to mid-80s by the August, September, October period. Again, the 212f restricts Europeans from coming to this country. So I think we focused on those countries that generally have high U.S. outbound demand. And as we move forward, we will be adding a little bit of capacity but essentially keeping our levels flat where we would normally pull down in the September October time frame and focusing on our European hubs and distributing traffic through them. So I'm pretty optimistic about how the results could play out in the Transatlantic and that's really -- we have 35% to 40% of our travel still missing with the European origin piece not open for sale, and with business really not recovering at the same level as leisure. So pretty optimistic about where we can get to on this leg but there's a lot more to come in the Transatlantic.  In Latin, it's really the tale of two markets. One is the closing U.S. point of origin leisure market as well as Mexico business. Both of these are actually exceeding 2019 levels. So short haul Latin is doing quite well and we continue to expect that to be very, very strong as we move into the more traditional leisure season in the late fall. And then the Pacific, which I think Ed has talked in the past, we expect this to be the laggard due to low vaccination rates and continuing outbreaks over and restrictions in the Pacific, and we really don't see any impetus for that to be lifted. Now, I think we're looking at 2022 at the earliest, probably significant recovery in the Pacific.  So, Atlantic clearly the furthest along, that's great for us because 65% of our international revenues are in the Transatlantic. So we're excited about what we see in terms of U.S. demand there. Domestically post Labor Day, this is every month that we look from August to September and October, clearly as you move out, you have fewer and fewer bookings. But we have about a third of our September bookings on the books now. And we have as it sits today, and we expect to give some of this back, but we have positive yield in every one of the entities. We have sequential improvements in RASM [ph]. So I think we're seeing very strong indications of demand through the post Labor Day period. Of course, those are initial indications. We have a long way to go as we move closer and closer to those departure dates.\nHelane Becker: Got you, that's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu you with Jeffries.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, everyone. And thank you for the time. Maybe just on cost related question, on CASM they're expected to remain fairly elevated in Q3. How do you think about the Delta in driving CASM from up 11% to 14% in Q3 versus 2019 levels to flat in Q4? I get about half of that is rebuild cost but maybe what's the bridge and the moving pieces and more broadly, how do you think about cost headwinds and inflationary pressures?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, we talked about the major drivers. The key is really leveraging the continued build on the network. And as I was describing in prepared remarks, generally, when we move from the third into the fourth quarter, we have a pretty big reduction in our activity levels. This year we expect that to be relatively flat. That gives us the opportunity to leverage the things that I was describing to get some good incremental leverage on our people, some good incremental leverage on our asset utilization, and it's just a natural outcome of the way the capacity progression is moving. In terms of how we see the bigger pieces, they don't change that much between the third and the fourth quarter. We expect that rebuild expenses will still be at elevated levels in that five to six-point range in both quarters. And one of the things I mentioned on the last call, from a mixed point of view, both the second and third quarters, we've got about a five-point drag from not having anywhere near as much of our long haul international flying, which is just structurally very low CASM, long stage length flying. As we move into the fourth quarter, it's still a headwind. It's not quite as much. It's about three points. So that's the color that I would add.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners.\nConor Cunningham: Hey, everyone. Thank you. It's great to hear that corporate continues to improve as people return to the office. I do have to ask, like your competitors are now pushing to replicate some of your success that you've had with large corporates. So I was curious if you could talk to the moats that you have built around that franchise and how you anticipate strengthening that segment in the face of potential competition?\nEd Bastian: Well, thanks, Connor. It's a very important segment for us, and we have one, as I think, you know, business travel news, Airline of the Year for 10 straight years and we expect to hopefully win it again this fall as well. Our team does a magnificent job of servicing the accounts, providing the technology, the access, the insights to make their job, travel on Delta as easy as possible. And that's supplemented by the great product and service that our people put forward every single day. We're the leading operational airline in the industry. So when you marry up the investments we've been making, particularly in the premium product sector, which our corporates are a main consumer of, with the great service ourselves and commercial team provide and the product and operational integrity of the business, it's a very, very strong moat. We have gained share over the pandemic, meaningful amount of share that we have gained. And the one thing that we have seen is when customers come to Delta, they don't leave. And so we're going to continue to expand upon that.\nConor Cunningham: Good to hear, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. \nHunter Keay: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I got two questions for you. The first one is for you, Ed. How do you feel about deleveraging the balance sheet if it hurts your ability to maintain market share?\nEd Bastian: Good morning Hunter, I would like to ask you first you're sitting on a rocking chair estimate or no. \nHunter Keay: Actually I am. \nEd Bastian: I will rock back in my chair as I answer to you. That's good. Deleveraging is important to us. It's something that, first of all, we're the same team that's been here for over the last 15 years. We believe in derisking our balance sheet and our then paying down debt. And we also know that we can do that while also driving a premium product and service offering in the markets that we see as being critical to Delta. We were able to do both those things over the last decade and we'll continue to do that. The level of debt that we took on over the pandemic, candidly, it's a meaningful amount but it's not an overwhelming amount. It was about $8 billion of net debt that we took on during the pandemic. And when you think about, as Gary mentioned, we're basically done funding our pension plan with no more pension contributions required. As I think you also know that we've been averaging over the last several years, close to $3 billion, $2 billion to $3 billion a year in stock repurchases, which clearly we won't be doing in the next two to three years until we get our investment grade metrics back. And another billion on top of that of dividend distributions that we've been making. There's a substantial amount of free cash that is available to us as we reclaim investment grade for Delta. And we'll be sharing our longer term metrics at the Investor Day in December and showing you the path forward. But we can do all this and have plenty of headroom to compete hard and effectively in the marketplace. \nHunter Keay: Okay, that's super helpful. Thank you. And then Gary, if you would just clarify, I think you said something about 7% capacity. Are you saying that the current plan for 23 system capacities to be 7% above 2019 but you can take that higher or lower if you need to, am I interpreting that correctly?\nGary Chase: No Hunter, that's not what I was saying. What I'm saying is that the fleet actions we've taken give us the potential to add seven points to our capacity profile by 23. But I was also noting the flexibility that we continue to have with some of the flex fleets to go up or down. And I think the teams have positioned us really well to react to what comes at us in terms of the demand environment. \nHunter Keay: I see. Okay, thank you, Gary. Thank you Ed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with J.P. Morgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning everybody. And just apologies off the bat that my colleague Mark isn\u2019t joining us, but he is on one of your aircraft on a J.P. Morgan sponsored business trip. So I guess we're all better off. Glen, is there a way to tell what portion of summer domestic revenue is driven by reallocated international demand, for example, could you look at SkyMile behavior this summer, identify what portion of those travelers would have historically been in Europe or Asia instead? \nGlen Hauenstein: I think domestically we see redistribution towards domestic from long haul international. That's a natural occurrence. I think people are ready to get out. The exact quantification I think would be difficult. But we do see that if those leisure destinations are open, there's significant demand for that and that includes the transatlantic where it is open. And if you think about running load factors in the mid to high 80s in the shoulder season, as we head to the end of the summer here just on U.S. origin travel, pretty strong demand trends that we're seeing. So if it is open people would want to get there. \nJamie Baker: Yeah, definitely. Thank you. And Gary, just a follow up on the ATL, and I haven't historically obsessed about the air traffic liability until we all sort of had to. Ordinarily, the second or third quarter sequential decline for Delta would be somewhere around $750 million to $800 million. If we continue to get the international reopening particularly for inbound U.S. could we model for something closer to a flat outcome next quarter, so staying in the $6.5 billion range, that sort of thing or would that just be too ambitious, I know you said it would be above last year's levels, but that still leaves a lot of room?\nGary Chase: Yeah, Jamie obviously, there's still a lot of uncertainty around that in our thinking right now and that's embedded in how we're thinking about net debt is for a slight decline in that, but we don't expect that you're going to see the normal seasonal pattern as we move through the remainder of this year for all the reasons you just highlighted. \nJamie Baker: Okay, perfect. Thank you, everybody. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Trent with Citi.\nStephen Trent: Hello everybody and thanks very much for taking my question. Just a quick one from me. When we think about in certain pockets in the United States that we are seeing some difficulty with new variants and low vaccination rates, do you see any scenario in which Delta could trim capacity to some of these regions or reinstate on some routes, blocking off middle seats?\nGlen Hauenstein: Good morning Steve, I don't. As we've been monitoring our bookings and clearly we're mindful of the risks around COVID and the new variants and the continued information that the CDC provides us with, we have not seen any reduction or drop in demand, looking out over the next 60 to 90 days, which is about as far as our crystal ball can go right now. We know our customers are largely vaccinated. Our people are largely vaccinated, we have over 72% of Delta people are vaccinated and the vaccines work. And they are giving people the ability to get back to their lives. So no, we do not anticipate any changes at this time.\nStephen Trent: Okay, appreciate that. And thank you. And I'm looking forward to seeing you guys in December 15th, I believe you said and thanks again. \nGlen Hauenstein: December 16th. \nStephen Trent: 16th, excuse me, thank you. Fly down and see us on the 15th if you want.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Ed, I think at the beginning you mentioned commercial partnerships and creating $1 billion of value from Wheels Up and in CLEAR from zero cost base. I'm curious of your view on the [indiscernible] given the news by American as well as United on that front and where that fits in your portfolio of investments and operations over the medium term?\nEd Bastian: Thanks Myles. As you can appreciate every one of the proposed manufacturers has been after Delta. We've heard from many of them. We're studying this space and we will continue to get good smartness space. I think it's at a very, very early stage right now and I think a lot of the plans that we see are a bit premature, candidly. But it's not anything that we are unaware of and I guarantee every one of those manufacturers would love to have Delta colors on their plane. So hard to predict timing but we're in the marketplace having lots of conversations.\nMyles Walton: Okay, and then maybe Gary just a clarification to CASM, next questions. I'm just looking in absolute dollars, it looks like sequentially 3Q. You're looking for the same unit cost, X and fourth quarter the same. And the improvement was really just about comps in 2019. Is that right and then for 2022 how much of these rebuilding costs go away and we get the tail end of those six points? Thanks.\nGary Chase: Yeah, I'm not sure I would characterize it exactly that way. But it is about having more scale relative to 2019. So, sequentially I think that what you outlined is roughly accurate and that is what we expect. As we go into 2022, your question was about the sustainability of the rebuild. \nMyles Walton: Yeah, what goes away from what you're doing? \nEd Bastian: Yeah, we definitely expect those to moderate. A lot of that is going to depend candidly on how the demand environment develops. What I would say is, what we've articulated is driving to levels below 19. We're not excluding rebuild expenses. This year they happen to be particularly high. As we get into 2022 we expect those to be more normal, and it's part of the thought process on what we've got to accomplish. \nGlen Hauenstein: Myles, if I could speak to that for a second, we at Delta our number one task is to safely get our business to back up with the service levels that our customers deserve and expect at Delta. And given the huge surge in demand that we've seen over the last 90 days, the entire industry is challenged with that. That's not a unique Delta position. And we're going to do everything we can to get ahead of it and that includes staffing levels, providing whatever support we need to the service providers and service contractors, training, maintenance, because we realize that this is about protecting our brand and our long term customer base rather than trying to manage costs for an individual quarter. We will hit the cost targets that we mentioned to you. One of the things that we learned a lot about Delta over the pandemic is our ability to manage down labor cost is really unique in this industry. And we have a whole lot more, many more tools and flexibility, I think, than we ever really appreciated. And so we shouldn't think about labor, which is the biggest part -- a big part of the rebuild cost, as a fixed costs, that's not going to stay. So the productivity, the efficiency, the ability to work closely with our people, we'll be in really good shape on the class run next year. And we'll protected our customers experience at the same time and the revenue base, which is the most important.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. \nSavanthi Syth: Good morning. Competing product is kind of good for the consumer and the industry but one of your competitors plans to grow like first class like room seats by about 10% a year through 2026. And just kind of curious if that level of growth is something we'll see at Delta because it's part of some kind of a structural trend or if that has an implication to Delta's premium kind of revenue leadership or how delta is set up to kind of compete against that? \nGlen Hauenstein: Sure. Well, I first like to say we're proud that we started the decommoditization process many, many years back and we're well along. And I think we're objectively maybe the furthest along in terms of exploiting that opportunity. There's probably more space out there for other carriers, given the appetite we've seen for these products that have been sustained through the pandemic. So I'm not going to articulate on anybody else's plan. But we think that there's continued growth in our fleet evolution, as we continue to update the airline over the next several years, our percentage of seats that are in the premium cabins continues to increase. And we think given the fact that we are still in the early stages of being able to distribute those products and services, to all of our customers through all of our channels, that there's plenty of opportunity for us to continue to grow that space in the next years, next several years.\nSavanthi Syth: That makes sense. Thanks, Glen. And maybe a quick follow up for you Glen as well. Just appreciate the color on the domestic corporate demand recovery. I know that's around volumes. Is that RPK and curious what that looks in terms of revenue, I'm guessing volumes have to recover first and then revenue comes back, but I'm just wondering if it's similar or if there's a disconnect there?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah, those are passengers and yields on domestic leisure are up. Yields on domestic corporate are down, but we see trajectory in domestic corporate and we expect that, as you say to continue as we move forward.\nSavanthi Syth: Makes sense. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning. I guess two projection related questions for Glen. On AMEX over the last year, you sort of had backpedaled on when you would get to the 7 billion of contribution, obviously, because of the pandemic. The fact that I guess, the month of June or the June quarter we were 110% and 115%, in the month of June. Glen, can you update us, are we now not on just track but maybe at a pace that we'll get to that AMEX bogey prior than the previous forecast?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah well, I think that's something you'll have to come to our December. See I don't think we're ready to disclose the exact date yet but it suffices to say that we're feeling much better about making up some ground that we lost during the pandemic today than we sat six or nine months ago.\nEd Bastian: Yeah, I would -- Mike, this is Ed. Mind if I chime in. I would say that we are thrilled with the relationship with American Express. Our team, their team, I was with Steve Squery [ph] last Friday, and I think we had the best performing card in the entire portfolio. Delta, even though we're the highest value that we create, I think we're also the best performing on top of that. So in terms of growth. So it's really been a great, great relationship and that's still without a lot of travel spend that's missing, international and business yet from the card. So we're excited.\nMike Linenberg: Great. And then just sort of a second projection question, Glen. I mean, to watch you go from 20%, of corporate volumes to 40 and 60. And yet, even recently I think we had a survey from USA, U.S. travel and even the GBTA talking about U.S. corporate travel, getting back to I don't know, 70% to 85% by 2024, it just feels very conservative. I mean, it seems like we're running well ahead of that. Is that the case, or is there just something different, tell us where you guys are outpacing the industry? \nEd Bastian: Mike, this is Ed, let me chime in on that one too. Because I've got the numbers right here in front of me. We've done our own survey, talking to our clients, the biggest the biggest companies in the world, and a very large number of them, and I couldn't make heads or tails out of what the GBTA was speaking to either. Let me give you the most recent survey and this is as of last week updated. 36% of our big corporates expect they're going to return fully to pre COVID levels no later than next year 2022 is 36%. Another 21% says fully back no later than 2023. Interestingly, only 5% of our of our big corporates say that we never returned to pre-COVID levels. 5% that had been 8% in previous surveys, it's now down 5%. While 38% indicate it's still unclear as to what their levels, not that they're not getting back, it's just the level of flying and the timing is still somewhat uncertain, which is understandable. So if you take the 2022-2023, that's 57% no later than 2023. And you assume, say 75% of those unknowns, the 43%, if you actually did 90% back over the course of the next couple of years. And frankly, I think it's going to be even better than that. So this is one of the things that as we have seen there's enormous pent up energy and demand for travel. Also in that survey, 93% of our customers said they're going to increase travel in Q3 over Q2 and many of those by meaningful amounts. So I think the surge is coming. And just as we've seen it on the consumer side, we're getting ready for it on the business side. And once you open businesses, offices, and you get international markets opened, I think it's going to be a very good run over the next 12 to 24 months. \nMike Linenberg: Great, great insight gentlemen, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Ed, you have a good Board in my opinion, lots of experience driving real value in consumer industries, maybe arguably easier consumer industries. Can you give us some insight into debate at the Board level regarding balance sheet improvement as a priority, right here and now, versus investment. Are there differing opinions on investment rate versus balance sheet improvement? And I guess longer term is investing half of your operating cash flow, how we should be thinking about 2022 and beyond or have we kind of moved away from that?\nEd Bastian: Well, thanks Duane. We do have a great Board, I agree with that, and there is a lot of good insight we garner from that Board. This is largely the same Board that's been with us over the last decade. It was the Board that was involved in and how we delevered coming out of the financial crisis in 2009. How we've the lead the industry in getting back to investment grade metrics over five years ago while delivering a premium product and service level and expanding internationally at a rate probably faster than anyone, particularly with the investments that we've made. So the Board knows the strategy that we're on, we've talked a lot at the Board level about needing to get our debt down of the balance sheet to get those investment grade metrics back. We'll give you some very specific guideposts on that when we have our capital markets day in December, so you know what to expect from us. And at the same time, we're also investing meaningfully into the business with opportunistic purchase of Airbus 350s and 737-900 that are current vintage, they'll plug and play. And we'll continue to be able to grow the business accordingly. So the strategy actually is not that different from where we've been. And I think it's going to -- we're going to stay very focused to get the investment grade back and growing the business at the same time. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, appreciate the thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Good morning. Ed, in response to Mike's question, you said, I think based on your time with Steve, that the Delta card with Amex is highest value, like what do you mean by that, are you trying to say that it's a very profitable card for Amex as well are their most profitable card?\nEd Bastian: No, I don't know if it's the most profitable. I hope we are. You'd have to ask Steve that. But what I can tell you is it creates the highest overall level of spend and growth in the portfolio. And it's been that way for some time and it continues, and we both continue to invest to keep it that way. \nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, okay. And then Gary, you said the fleet actions would allow you to add seven points to ASM by 2023. So what level of ASM production are you on track to kind of achieve in 2023, I know there's a lot of flexibility, but does the current fleet support 100% of 2019 capacity in 2023 -- where are you now with that? Thank you. \nGary Chase: Yeah, Joe we'll talk more about that and what our long term capital needs will be in December with you. What I was pointing out was the portfolio decisions that we've made gives us seven points of additional capacity that we can bring in that timeframe. And, just continue to point out that the team has positioned us with a tremendous amount of flexibility to go either up or down, depending on how we see the demand environment. But we'll have more color on that with a bigger picture about how some of the other components play into it as well. \nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna International.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. So your marginal cost per mile in 3Q was just under $0.04 and it's picking up sequentially, significantly. And I realized that, as you said, you're spooling up capacity here but I was wondering at what point whether it's in ASM or revenue where we can expect to see this operating leverage for the costs that you've taken out over the last year or so more clearly show up in results? Normalizing for the change in your marginal cost per mile, from the second to the third quarter as you spool up here, what are kind of a more accurate run rate looks like and that would also assuming corporate does return as you expect by the end of the year?\nGlen Hauenstein: Chris, on an underlying basis we still have and are experiencing a lot of leverage, even as we move into the third quarter. That will be the case for a good bit here. The guidance we have in the third quarter, we're still operating 28% to 30%, below where we were in 2019. So there are parts of the system where we were under pressure as Ed described, and we're absolutely meeting the needs there. But there are also lots of opportunities for us to drive that leverage. Some of what you're seeing in terms of the moving pieces are at least I think unrelated to that. A big cost pressure as we've moved from the second to the third quarter, at least a couple points which is selling related expense, so obviously thrilled to be seen. And it's just a function of the demand recovery that we're experiencing. Normally when we're in a typical year, we work very hard to not be maintaining aircraft during the peak summer months for obvious reasons, we want them flying and generating contributions. This year we've got a maintenance step up as we move from the second to the third quarter. In fact, I think when you look at third quarter maintenance, it'll be comparable to if not even slightly ahead of where we were in 2019 instead of the down 30ish% that you've been seeing over the last few quarters. So, it's a year with a lot of unique features in terms of how they play out on the cost side, but the fundamental leverage that we've been describing is there.\nJulie Stewart: And now we'll go to our final analyst questions. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Good morning, everyone. Just kind of wanted to go back to costs. Obviously, the labor market is very tight right now. And I think your last base pay increase was in October of 2019. To Gary, is there anything in your 3Q or 4Q CASM expectations for a wage increase? And I guess Ed, how are you thinking about the need for one right now?\nGary Chase: Thanks Andrew, we don't preannounce what we're doing on our labor strategy and cost. And obviously, our people are working really hard and delivering great value. We're still losing money. We need to get the company stabilized first before we start talking about wage increases.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. And then last one for Ed, not sure if you're going to have any comments on this. But the last thing of last week, the President issued an executive order and he just called out slot administration as one of the objectives. What do you think this means just given your position in a pretty stock constrained market here in New York, just love to hear if you have any comments on that? Thanks.\nEd Bastian: I really don't. Well, we'll study. We'll talk to the administration and Department of Transportation and Secretary [indiscernible] and many individuals about it. We have a long history of driving great value for customers. It's expensive to drive great value, and we're making the investments to drive great value. There's no question when you think about the level of service, the quality of service, the reliability, the affordability, everything's moving in the right direction. So we're thrilled to be able to show them the actual results of what we're doing.\nJulie Stewart: That will wrap up the analysts\u2019 portion of our call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer to start the media questions.\nTim Mapes: Well good morning to all the members of the media. Thank you for your time this morning. We're grateful for that. And Katie, if you wouldn't mind reiterating for the members of the media the rules of asking a question with one follow up, please. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. \nMary Schlangenstein: While planning for the rest of the year if you can talk about the numbers versus that percentage, increase that will be and then also if you'll comment on whether you're having any trouble finding enough people to hire?\nEd Bastian: Mary, this is Ed. We missed the first part of your question. Could you repeat that?\nMary Schlangenstein: Yes, I wondered if you could say how many employees you're going to add the number versus that percentage increase?\nEd Bastian: Over the course of this year, we're in the process of hiring between 4000 and 5000. \nMary Schlangenstein: And are you having any trouble finding applicants for those jobs? \nEd Bastian: We are not. The Delta brand is a very strong hiring brand. We're having great success. The challenge as I mentioned on the call is the training, the time it takes to get people in position, whether it's on the phones in reservations or in the airports. It takes a few months and the demand has come back in such a fast clip. It's taken us all a little bit of time to catch our breath. But we'll be fully back over the next couple of months and providing -- we've been providing great service, but the service levels that customers should expect and deserve you'll be getting back from Delta in the next couple of months. \nMary Schlangenstein: Okay, and have your flight operations been affected at all in terms of lack of flight crews?\nEd Bastian: Not at all. Not at all. We've been managing the best completion factor in the industry and it's not even close. Our team is doing a good job. We've been at this for over a year, managing the training queue and the training pipeline, and our pilots and our maintenance team are doing great.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters.\nTracy Rucinski: Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you have any updates on your plans for the trainer refinery, and particularly on the outstanding liability on the biofuel credits?\nGlen Hauenstein: Tracy, we don't have any -- anything any news. In that regard we continue to operate, train or the team does a very nice job there. We have said in the past that there are opportunities to pull another strategic partner in, we'd be open to that. Relative to the question around RINs, we are fully accrued. So I know there's been some discussion in the press about whether we pulled away from acquiring RINs, we just know the pricing of RINs is not a market based price at the present time. And we're not going to spend good cash chasing a fairly marketplace that isn't transparent. So we've accrued the costs but we have time to decide as we settle those obligations over the next couple of years.\nTracy Rucinski: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Koenig with the Associated Press.\nDavid Koenig: Oh, hi. Well, Mary asked my question but if I could kind of follow up, I know, Ed, you said that it's too early to raise wages but what about starting pay, are you having to raise starting pay to attract people or do anything else out of the ordinary to find those 4000 to 5000? \nEd Bastian: It's interesting Dave, we've looked at potentially hiring bonuses and other incentives. And largely we haven't needed to resort to that. People look at the Delta brand as a place they want to be long term and they see this as an opportunity to get inside Delta. So no, we haven't had to make any changes to scale. We always watch it, we're very competitive in the market, we pay well, our people, we take great care of them. But no, we haven't had to adjust our salary scales in any in any meaningful way. \nDavid Koenig: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi, good morning. My questions are about the customer service wait times. They still are as long as six hours at least as recently as yesterday. So I'm wondering from a travelers perspective, is there any end in sight? I've also noticed that you guys have temporarily suspended help through Twitter DM which is a frequent recommendation I and other travel reporters give. So is there any end in sight, and what's your best advice for people to reaching Delta, especially with last minute travel questions? Thank you. Well,\nEd Bastian: Thanks. Thanks Dawn, this is Ed we are hiring a couple 1000 people into reservations. We've already hired at least half that number. We've got more to go every single week with more and more people are getting on the phones. We've reached out to many of the people at reservations who have retired as we had separation packages and voluntary departure packages over the last year. We have a fair number of them that returned, they are on the phones. We have people working from home. It's not a question of not providing the staff and we are doing everything we can the volumes are beyond anything we've ever seen there beyond the high point of 2019. And the handling times are substantially longer as people have more questions, as travel has changed, it is the first time back., So we're incredibly sensitive to it. The number you mentioned is not the average number at all. Yes, there are still rare occurrences of that. We have the callback features in place. We manage every one of the Qs, whether it's the General SkyMiles Q, the premium Qs, the non member Qs. And we're all at the longest the average we're seeing is in the one hour time frame. Which, by the -- wait way, which is, by the way too long, and by September we expect to get that back down to normal levels. \nDawn Gilbertson: Could somebody come in or get back to me on the Twitter DM, because you guys appear to be the only one of the major Airlines that's temporarily not responding via DM?\nEd Bastian: Yeah, I'm not sure about that. We'll get back to you. \nDawn Gilbertson: Thank you. \nEd Bastian: And by the way, people email me every day, every hour. That's a good way. Somebody needs help just send me a note, I will take care of it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Leslie Joseph with CNBC.\nLeslie Joseph: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. For the employees that are coming in now that you're hiring, are they on average at lower wages than some of the people that left with a lot of senior people took retirement? And then also for the 20% of employees that are not vaccinated or there are certain work groups that's concentrated in, are you doing anything to increase vaccination rates across the company?\nEd Bastian: Your first question, Leslie, yes the starting rates of people join the company are clearly lower than the then the rates that people retired at as they left the company after 25, 30, 40 years of service. So we are getting a juniority benefit in the scale. We're giving a lot of people, a lot of our particularly our young managers who are having opportunities to take on more responsibility and growth in their careers. And that's all very, very healthy. Your question around vaccinations the 28%, could you repeat that?\nLeslie Joseph: What are you doing to increase that vaccination rate across the company? And do you see that it's concentrated in any one work group or geography or the best access information?\nEd Bastian: Listen 72% candidly we're proud of it. It beats any national average by a meaningful amount. We do have pockets within the company in certain regions and certain demographics that are below 72% and we are doing everything we can to continue to encourage and incent. We provided $1 million last month in total awards to vaccinated employees. They are 40 different drawings of $25,000 a piece. I think we have one more drawing today that we have of anyone that's just been newly vaccinated within the last month. To win $25,000 we've given away free travel to employees through drawings that can get vaccinated. And we continue to describe the risks to individuals if they're not vaccinated from the variance. So I don't know a company is doing more to get its team vaccinated than Delta.\nLeslie Joseph: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: Hi. Thank you so much. I'm just curious what you are hearing about the math command on planes if you think it will be listed in September. And I guess how you feel about that if you are hoping it will be listed earlier or if you like to get extended?\nEd Bastian: Hi, Ali. I don't know what's going to happen. It's up to the FEA. It's not really up to the Airlines to make that decision. We will be in conversations clearly with the FEA. I think it's important that medical experts make those decisions, not airline professionals as we've learned through the pandemic. They're the ones that have all the insight and the information, and keeping people safe. I appreciate people not wanting to wear the mask. I don't like wearing the mask when I'm on board either, but it's something that we need to do to keep each other safe. And I think the other question about what's going to happen in September. It really depends on where we are in the recovery phase. If the variants are continuing, I think people are going to be a little more careful about lifting the masks. If international borders are not yet opened, I'm not sure lifting the mask is going to help opening up those borders. So there's a lot that goes into that and I think as many pros to take the mask requirement as there are to keeping it on at the present time.\nAlison Sider: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call or my question. I had a question about the federal payroll support and whether based on the arguments Delta management made last year, if you still believe that the support was facilitate faster recovery, protecting jobs? And the second part of my question is what happens after October first weather and what burning off the expiration of support will mean or burning off the expiration of support will mean for Delta's earnings?\nEd Bastian: Well, I think it's without debate that the federal support was critical to keeping our industry afloat and keeping our employees employed and being in position for the recovery. As we've talked on this call, one of the biggest challenges we're having now is getting everything fully stood up, even though we've kept all of our employees. So you can imagine if we had to actually let many people go and abandon those individuals, the challenges we'd be facing in our country of getting travel moving again. So I think it's been an incredible success. One can debate the length of the PSP2 and PSP3. I see no interest in going beyond what we have at the present time with PSP3, and we expect to be profitable in Q3 and beyond without any PSP support. Yes. \nUnidentified Analyst : Thank you.\nTim Mapes: Katie we have time for one final question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from David Slotnick with TPG.\nDavid Slotnick: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you've seen in the last few weeks with unruly passengers. Has there been any upward or downward trending in incidents of that, and do you have any thoughts on just what's been causing this sort of search this spring and early summer?\nEd Bastian: You know, David, we haven't seen any meaningful shifts. It's been something we've been dealing with over the course of the Pandemic. Some people want to related to having to wear masks. I'm sure that's a piece of it. I don't know that's the main piece. I think the bigger challenge is that we've got a lot of individuals that have been impacted. Their emotional wellbeing have been impacted during the pandemic. It has people are coming back out into society. You see challenges in all walks of life, not just our industry. You see it happening in other places as well in society. So obviously, social media amplifies that and puts it on a stage that's not our experience. That's not our normal experience by any means. Their crews are trained and they're incredibly professional in managing the conditions when we have someone who doesn't want to follow instructions of the crew. And unfortunately, something we've become good at. And I look forward to the return of our business and patterns of normalcy so that we can start to manage our business without having to worry about these effects.\nGlen Hauenstein: Patterns of normalcy, it's a good way to put it. Thank you.\nTim Mapes: Thank you for the question, David. And thank you to all the members of the media for your time this morning. As we wrap up, we'll turn it over to Ed for final comments.\nEd Bastian: Well, I thank you all for joining us. It's been an hour and a half. We spent a fair bit of time with you, but hopefully you've learned a lot as to why we're encouraged. And as we power our plan for the post pandemic future, why that I'm and our team is as optimistic as ever for the journey that we're on. U.S. Travelers are returning and it's really a tribute to the incredible work of our scientific community in developing effective vaccines. And that's going to be key to opening the world or return to profitability in the month of June is a major milestone. Solid profitability close to 10% speaks to the strength of our brand and the great work of our team worldwide. As we move past this inflection point from crisis into restoration, the people of Delta will be front and center, serving our customers and our communities. Our mission of connecting the people of the globe is a noble one. It's an important one. It's got great purpose and the social good that's generated by travel will be essential in the months and years ahead as our world heals. So I thank you all for your time today for joining us. And one more time, I want to say a special thanks to all the Delta people worldwide for their great work over the course of this last 16 months in getting our business to a point where we're looking to bright skies ahead. So thank you all.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks Ed and good morning, everyone. 16 months after the start of the pandemic, I'm encouraged by the pace of the recovery and excited about our future. Delta is well positioned with a powerful brand, strong competitive advantages, and a differentiated customer experience, all of which are increasingly driving deeper customer engagement. During the quarter we saw consumer demand for travel return at an accelerated rate as pent up demand drove an increase for air travel. As customers returned to the skies, Delta is their airline of choice given our industry leading service that's provided by the best employees in the industry. This resulted in a more than $2.7 billion improvement in revenue from the March quarter.  Compared to 2019, revenues were 49% lower beating our initial guide on 39% less sellable capacity. Bookings in domestic and short haul Latin leisure markets recovered to nearly 90% of 2019 levels, and during the quarter we began experiencing strengthened demand to select European countries as they reopened. Domestic business travel is on an improving trajectory with corporate volumes 40% recovered in the month of June, doubling from the 20% recovery rate in March. Small and medium sized enterprise volumes continued to outperform corporates by 10 points and are now 50% recovered. I'll talk more about the encouraging trends we see in corporate in a few minutes.  From April to June passenger unit revenues improved by 25 points, with both load factors and yields strengthening through the quarter. This is a great accomplishment considering that we had the middle seat block in place for the month of April, which, when lifted on May 1st resulted in a 45% increase in sellable capacity with minimal incremental costs. So kudos to the Delta team for managing through this transition period and driving these outstanding results. I also want to congratulate our cargo team for an outstanding quarter with cargo revenues up 35% compared to the June 2019 quarter, despite running a much smaller operation. We are also seeing momentum in daily bookings and net cash sales. Our average net cash came in 20% higher than forecast, doubling relative to the March quarter. Importantly, in the month of June, our average net cash sales are 70% restored to corresponding 2019 levels that's running about 10 points ahead of revenue recovery as customers are making travel plans out into the future.  As Ed mentioned, we're exiting June with a demand environment that's much stronger than just three months ago. Since the start of the year, we've seen a sequential revenue improvement from 35% recovery versus 2019 and first quarter to 51% in the second quarter. That trajectory is continuing and we expect our September quarter total revenue to be 65% to 70% recovered on capacity at 70% to 72% recovered when compared to the same quarter in 2019. This positions us for another significant sequential improvement in unit revenues. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents another 2 billion sequential increase in revenue on approximately 10% higher capacity.  We expect strong leisure demand to continue through the fall and winter and we're starting to see the next leg of the recovery take hold with improving trends in business and international travel. Delta is well positioned to take advantage of both with leading domestic corporate share and a strong global network. Corporate travel volumes accelerated in May and June with almost 95% of our accounts booking travel in the month of June. We're also beginning to see a return of consulting and sales related travel and higher volumes in traditionally business heavy markets like New York City and Boston. Our recent corporate survey results show that over 90% of our corporate accounts anticipate travel volumes to increase in the September quarter, up from just 33% in the March quarter. In addition to these survey results our close engagement with customers give us increased confidence of the acceleration of business travel, especially as we move towards the post Labor Day period as schools and offices continue to reopen.  We expect domestic corporate volumes will recover between 55% and 60% of 2019 levels by the end of the September quarter, up from 40% at the end of the June quarter. Despite volatility in global COVID recovery trends, international travel is accelerating with capacity and load factors increasing as we head into the fall. When we spoke last quarter, only two European countries had reopened for U.S. citizens, today more than 15 European countries are open and we're seeing strong bookings follow as border closings lift. We are also hopeful that 212F restrictions prohibiting inbound travel to the U.S. will be significantly reduced in the September quarter. The recovery in short haul Latin exceeded 2019 levels, but in long haul Latin demand remains muted as many countries are still closed. Pacific demand remains low and will likely be the last region to recover.  Delta has a strong platform internationally due to the structural changes in the landscape, but more importantly because of elements unique to Delta. First, we will have the number one joint ventures in each entity, and our international partners will emerge from their restructuring efforts more competitive than before. We look forward to continuing our valuable strategic relationships with all of our global partners as they navigate through the COVID-19 crisis and as they position themselves to emerge from their restructuring processes. We are confident these strategic relationships will accelerate our international recovery in the years to come.  Second, our hubs are powerful, offering extensive and efficient global coverage. The strengths of our global hubs resemble those of our core domestic hubs, namely strong presence and local share and the ability to connect traffic efficiently. Third, our wide body fleet renewal will be instrumental in our recovery and path to higher margins. Adding the seven A350s announced yesterday builds on our long-term pre-planned efforts. Our wide body fleet renewal program improves our product offering, enhances our cargo capability, reduces our unit costs, and is more efficient -- fuel efficient, contributing to a more sustainable future.  As we rebuild the airline, we're optimizing the network for the return of business in international travel and are building on the strengths of our core and coastal hubs where we've been able to improve our local share by three points from pre-pandemic levels. We also continue to put the customer at the center of everything we do, creating an enhanced premium experience. This is successfully de-commoditizing air travel on Delta, providing customers with the products and flexibility that they value most. Premium products are demonstrating resilience where demand is strongest with domestic and short haul Latin premium revenues outpacing main cabin by 5 to 10 points. We believe this will be reflected at the system level as premium revenue and other entities improves with a return of business and international travel at scale.  We're also seeing increases in customer engagement and brand momentum. This is evident in SkyMiles acquisitions which set an all-time record in the month of June, outpacing the prior record achieved in July of 2019. These acquisitions allow us to bring new customers into the Delta ecosystem. The engagement is also coming through the performance of our co-brand credit card program as customers are increasingly seeing the value proposition and continue to aspire for travel, status, and premium experience. For the quarter, program spend was 110% recovered to 2019 levels driven by improving T&E spend indicating customer's desire to explore the world and reconnect with friends and family. We exited the quarter with program spent around 115% recovered for the month of June. [Indiscernible] brand account acquisitions improved more than 75% sequentially and were around 90% recovered to 2019 levels for the quarter. In addition we're seeing more customers moving into premium co-branded cards given the value of proposition for those products. The improving trajectory resulted in cash remuneration from American Express in the month of June exceeding 2019 levels. We expect remuneration will continue to remain at or above 2019 levels into the second half with significant growth opportunities in the years ahead.  In closing the foundational building blocks for our long-term success are in place. With the industry's best domestic and global network renewed an efficient fleet, a de-commoditized product and a highly valued brand and the industry's best employees we continue to extend our commercial and financial lead. Combining that with our efficient cost structure puts us on a path to improve on our pre-pandemic margins and generate sustainable free cash flows allowing us to reinvest in the business and restore our balance sheet strength. Delta's future is incredibly bright. And with that I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome our incoming CFO to Delta. Dan, I'm looking forward to working with you and now I'll turn the call over to you for a few minutes. Well, we talked about the major drivers. The key is really leveraging the continued build on the network. And as I was describing in prepared remarks, generally, when we move from the third into the fourth quarter, we have a pretty big reduction in our activity levels. This year we expect that to be relatively flat. That gives us the opportunity to leverage the things that I was describing to get some good incremental leverage on our people, some good incremental leverage on our asset utilization, and it's just a natural outcome of the way the capacity progression is moving. In terms of how we see the bigger pieces, they don't change that much between the third and the fourth quarter. We expect that rebuild expenses will still be at elevated levels in that five to six-point range in both quarters. And one of the things I mentioned on the last call, from a mixed point of view, both the second and third quarters, we've got about a five-point drag from not having anywhere near as much of our long haul international flying, which is just structurally very low CASM, long stage length flying. As we move into the fourth quarter, it's still a headwind. It's not quite as much. It's about three points. So that's the color that I would add. I think domestically we see redistribution towards domestic from long haul international. That's a natural occurrence. I think people are ready to get out. The exact quantification I think would be difficult. But we do see that if those leisure destinations are open, there's significant demand for that and that includes the transatlantic where it is open. And if you think about running load factors in the mid to high 80s in the shoulder season, as we head to the end of the summer here just on U.S. origin travel, pretty strong demand trends that we're seeing. So if it is open people would want to get there. Good morning Steve, I don't. As we've been monitoring our bookings and clearly we're mindful of the risks around COVID and the new variants and the continued information that the CDC provides us with, we have not seen any reduction or drop in demand, looking out over the next 60 to 90 days, which is about as far as our crystal ball can go right now. We know our customers are largely vaccinated. Our people are largely vaccinated, we have over 72% of Delta people are vaccinated and the vaccines work. And they are giving people the ability to get back to their lives. So no, we do not anticipate any changes at this time. December 16th. Myles, if I could speak to that for a second, we at Delta our number one task is to safely get our business to back up with the service levels that our customers deserve and expect at Delta. And given the huge surge in demand that we've seen over the last 90 days, the entire industry is challenged with that. That's not a unique Delta position. And we're going to do everything we can to get ahead of it and that includes staffing levels, providing whatever support we need to the service providers and service contractors, training, maintenance, because we realize that this is about protecting our brand and our long term customer base rather than trying to manage costs for an individual quarter. We will hit the cost targets that we mentioned to you. One of the things that we learned a lot about Delta over the pandemic is our ability to manage down labor cost is really unique in this industry. And we have a whole lot more, many more tools and flexibility, I think, than we ever really appreciated. And so we shouldn't think about labor, which is the biggest part -- a big part of the rebuild cost, as a fixed costs, that's not going to stay. So the productivity, the efficiency, the ability to work closely with our people, we'll be in really good shape on the class run next year. And we'll protected our customers experience at the same time and the revenue base, which is the most important. Sure. Well, I first like to say we're proud that we started the decommoditization process many, many years back and we're well along. And I think we're objectively maybe the furthest along in terms of exploiting that opportunity. There's probably more space out there for other carriers, given the appetite we've seen for these products that have been sustained through the pandemic. So I'm not going to articulate on anybody else's plan. But we think that there's continued growth in our fleet evolution, as we continue to update the airline over the next several years, our percentage of seats that are in the premium cabins continues to increase. And we think given the fact that we are still in the early stages of being able to distribute those products and services, to all of our customers through all of our channels, that there's plenty of opportunity for us to continue to grow that space in the next years, next several years. Yeah, those are passengers and yields on domestic leisure are up. Yields on domestic corporate are down, but we see trajectory in domestic corporate and we expect that, as you say to continue as we move forward. Yeah well, I think that's something you'll have to come to our December. See I don't think we're ready to disclose the exact date yet but it suffices to say that we're feeling much better about making up some ground that we lost during the pandemic today than we sat six or nine months ago. Chris, on an underlying basis we still have and are experiencing a lot of leverage, even as we move into the third quarter. That will be the case for a good bit here. The guidance we have in the third quarter, we're still operating 28% to 30%, below where we were in 2019. So there are parts of the system where we were under pressure as Ed described, and we're absolutely meeting the needs there. But there are also lots of opportunities for us to drive that leverage. Some of what you're seeing in terms of the moving pieces are at least I think unrelated to that. A big cost pressure as we've moved from the second to the third quarter, at least a couple points which is selling related expense, so obviously thrilled to be seen. And it's just a function of the demand recovery that we're experiencing. Normally when we're in a typical year, we work very hard to not be maintaining aircraft during the peak summer months for obvious reasons, we want them flying and generating contributions. This year we've got a maintenance step up as we move from the second to the third quarter. In fact, I think when you look at third quarter maintenance, it'll be comparable to if not even slightly ahead of where we were in 2019 instead of the down 30ish% that you've been seeing over the last few quarters. So, it's a year with a lot of unique features in terms of how they play out on the cost side, but the fundamental leverage that we've been describing is there. Tracy, we don't have any -- anything any news. In that regard we continue to operate, train or the team does a very nice job there. We have said in the past that there are opportunities to pull another strategic partner in, we'd be open to that. Relative to the question around RINs, we are fully accrued. So I know there's been some discussion in the press about whether we pulled away from acquiring RINs, we just know the pricing of RINs is not a market based price at the present time. And we're not going to spend good cash chasing a fairly marketplace that isn't transparent. So we've accrued the costs but we have time to decide as we settle those obligations over the next couple of years. Patterns of normalcy, it's a good way to put it. Thank you."

            "name": "Gary Chase",
            "content": "Thank you Dan and on behalf of the entire finance team welcome to Delta. Good morning everyone on the call and thanks for joining us. Delta people shined and carried our brand to new heights during the crisis. Those efforts combined with the strong demand recovery Glen described and the benefits of operating a simpler and more efficient fleet are enabling us to cross a number of key milestones on our journey to return to and exceed 2019 performance. Let me quickly review the second quarter and then provide color on our second half cost outlook. I will wrap with a discussion of our capital outlook and balance sheet.  Starting with highlights from the quarter, we reported an adjusted pretax loss of 881 million, more than $2 billion sequential improvement and generated a solid June month profit despite revenues for the month of June still 40% below 2019. Non-fuel costs rose 6% sequentially on 21% higher capacity as the teams continued to rebuild our network efficiently. Non-fuel CASM was 9% higher than 2019. We realize savings from tax credits and third party rate reductions that were offset by rebuild expenses and maintenance and pilot training and a non-cash expense for employee flight passes awarded to our employees in recognition of winning the JD Power award.  Adjusted fuel price per gallon of $2.12 was 11% higher than the first quarter, including a $0.23 per gallon impact from refinery losses. We realized a 7.1% fuel efficiency gain versus the June quarter of 2019 with the majority driven by fleet renewal. Demand momentum field cast sales across the booking curve driving $1.5 billion of growth in our air traffic liability to nearly 7 billion, now 300 million higher than the same period in 2019. With the strength we see in the demand environment we expect our air traffic liability to remain above 2019 levels into next year. Daily cash generation was substantially positive for the full quarter. More importantly we generated nearly 200 million of free cash flow excluding our 1.5 billion pension contribution and 2.5 billion in PSP grant proceeds. We are transitioning now away from daily metrics to focus on regular free cash flow, the best measure of value creation as we turn the corner on profitability and look to restore our financial strength. As we head into the second half we are excited to shift our focus to return into profitability generating cash and restoring and exceeding our pre-COVID results and financial position. With continued recovery and limited cost growth, we expect to be profitable in both the September and December quarters at current fuel prices.  Regarding the cost outlook, I'm very happy with the team's performance in the first half as we continue to rebuild the network efficiently. We remain on a path to achieve non-fuel CASM below 2019 levels by fourth quarter though the strength of demand recovery is creating some welcome cost pressure in the form of higher rebuild and selling related expense. We have also experienced inflationary pressure from vendors and our operating teams have accelerated hiring of frontline employees to ensure we maintain excellence in operations in service levels as we rescale. Despite these pressures we will see continued leverage in key areas. For example, we expect an approximate 8% headcount growth through the end of the year on a nearly 15% increase in ASM production. We'll see our fleet utilization rise from 2Q levels approximately 15% below 2019 to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter. Our airports will also see better utilization particularly our coastal hubs as they move from 70% to more than 90% restored.  As we accelerate maintenance and training in the higher potential capacity in 2022, rebuild expenses are stepping up in both the third and fourth quarters to 5 to 6 point cost headwind versus 3 to 4 points in the first half. September quarter will see non-fuel costs grow sequentially at roughly the same rate as capacity due to the higher rebuild and revenue related expenses I mentioned. With these factors September quarter non-fuel CASM is expected to be 11% to 14% higher than 2019. We expect to close the gap to 2019 non-fuel CASM in the fourth quarter through continued volume leverage as capacity remains essentially flat from the third to fourth quarters instead of the more normal seasonal decline of approximately 15%. Adjusted fuel price per gallon for the third quarter is expected at 205 to 215. The fuel efficiency for the quarter is expected to remain better than the September quarter 2019 period by approximately 5%.  On the capital outlook, we now expect gross CAPEX of approximately 3.2 billion in 2021 up from our original guidance of 2.5 billion driven by our aircraft announcements. Hats off to our fleet and technical supply chain teams for landing these compelling opportunities that meet three key criteria. These transactions are opportunistic and take advantage of attractive economics in the used market. These aircraft types are currently active in our fleet and entirely consistent with our fleet simplification strategy. In addition, these aircraft along with the 321neo options we exercised in April will support the potential for up to 7 points of additional capacity restoration at compelling marginal economics by 2023. We have a lot of additional optionality in our fleet plan to flex capacity up or down at low cost depending on the shape of the recovery. Our 717 and 767 fleets are our largest levers. We're still flying these fleets at scale today and could retire additional units or reactivate parked aircrafts to meet higher demand scenarios.  Let me now move to the balance sheet. With improving financial performance and a strong liquidity position, we're using cash to reduce leverage and non-operating expense while rebuilding on encumbered assets and managing our debt maturity profile. During the quarter we pre-paid 450 million in aircraft related debt in addition to normal amortization of 875 million and contributed 1.5 billion to the pension plans. Additionally, we paid cash for all but three aircraft deliveries. Since October, our debt reduction initiatives have totaled 11 billion and freed up 6 billion in collateral. With the additional funding this quarter, we do not foresee the need to make any material pension contributions in the future. By year end, we expect the plans to be fully funded on a Pension Protection Act basis and 90% funded on a GAAP basis. With this level of funding and the plans frozen to new participants, we are now reducing the investment risk of the portfolio to protect our funded status. The great work of our Pension and Treasury teams over the last decade in funding this obligation frees up roughly a billion in annual free cash flow that can be used in the future to further delever or otherwise create value. Adjusted net debt is expected to be approximately 19 billion at the end of the September quarter, modestly increasing from where we ended June as we paid cash for aircraft deliveries. As we turn the corner on profitability and look to the future, we're excited to shift our focus to restoring our business and delivering long term value for our owners. Restoring our financial Foundation remains a top priority as we position for the future, and we look forward to sharing more of our long-term vision with you in December. Let me conclude by congratulating the 75,000 people who make the Delta difference a reality every day. These excellent results are your score card and a reflection of all you do to delight our customers. With that I will turn the call back over to Julie to begin the Q&A. So Helane, first about the entities a little bit. We're seeing a U.S. based demand recovery to the open countries in the Transatlantic, and we expect our loads to move to be close to historical levels running probably in the low to mid-80s by the August, September, October period. Again, the 212f restricts Europeans from coming to this country. So I think we focused on those countries that generally have high U.S. outbound demand. And as we move forward, we will be adding a little bit of capacity but essentially keeping our levels flat where we would normally pull down in the September October time frame and focusing on our European hubs and distributing traffic through them. So I'm pretty optimistic about how the results could play out in the Transatlantic and that's really -- we have 35% to 40% of our travel still missing with the European origin piece not open for sale, and with business really not recovering at the same level as leisure. So pretty optimistic about where we can get to on this leg but there's a lot more to come in the Transatlantic.  In Latin, it's really the tale of two markets. One is the closing U.S. point of origin leisure market as well as Mexico business. Both of these are actually exceeding 2019 levels. So short haul Latin is doing quite well and we continue to expect that to be very, very strong as we move into the more traditional leisure season in the late fall. And then the Pacific, which I think Ed has talked in the past, we expect this to be the laggard due to low vaccination rates and continuing outbreaks over and restrictions in the Pacific, and we really don't see any impetus for that to be lifted. Now, I think we're looking at 2022 at the earliest, probably significant recovery in the Pacific.  So, Atlantic clearly the furthest along, that's great for us because 65% of our international revenues are in the Transatlantic. So we're excited about what we see in terms of U.S. demand there. Domestically post Labor Day, this is every month that we look from August to September and October, clearly as you move out, you have fewer and fewer bookings. But we have about a third of our September bookings on the books now. And we have as it sits today, and we expect to give some of this back, but we have positive yield in every one of the entities. We have sequential improvements in RASM [ph]. So I think we're seeing very strong indications of demand through the post Labor Day period. Of course, those are initial indications. We have a long way to go as we move closer and closer to those departure dates. No Hunter, that's not what I was saying. What I'm saying is that the fleet actions we've taken give us the potential to add seven points to our capacity profile by 23. But I was also noting the flexibility that we continue to have with some of the flex fleets to go up or down. And I think the teams have positioned us really well to react to what comes at us in terms of the demand environment. Yeah, Jamie obviously, there's still a lot of uncertainty around that in our thinking right now and that's embedded in how we're thinking about net debt is for a slight decline in that, but we don't expect that you're going to see the normal seasonal pattern as we move through the remainder of this year for all the reasons you just highlighted. Yeah, I'm not sure I would characterize it exactly that way. But it is about having more scale relative to 2019. So, sequentially I think that what you outlined is roughly accurate and that is what we expect. As we go into 2022, your question was about the sustainability of the rebuild. Yeah, Joe we'll talk more about that and what our long term capital needs will be in December with you. What I was pointing out was the portfolio decisions that we've made gives us seven points of additional capacity that we can bring in that timeframe. And, just continue to point out that the team has positioned us with a tremendous amount of flexibility to go either up or down, depending on how we see the demand environment. But we'll have more color on that with a bigger picture about how some of the other components play into it as well. Thanks Andrew, we don't preannounce what we're doing on our labor strategy and cost. And obviously, our people are working really hard and delivering great value. We're still losing money. We need to get the company stabilized first before we start talking about wage increases."

To ensure that we continue to establish clear priorities, deliver on our commitment, and build a more resilient valuable Delta there's no doubt it is an interesting time to join. What really drew me to this opportunity at Delta is the unique culture, industry leadership, and growing brand strength with customers. It's a combination like no other in the industry. It's really clear that there's a great deal of talent in the finance organization. I'm humbled and honored to lead this organization forward through this pivotal time.  The key guiding principle for me will be open and transparent communication with the financial community. I look forward to speaking to all of you and getting to know the key stakeholders in the coming weeks and months including many of you on the call. Now I'll turn it over to Gary for the financial update."
        },
        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Well thank you Julie and good morning everyone. I appreciate you joining us this morning. As we speak we are well into the summer travel season. And if you have been to the airport in recent weeks you have seen first-hand how travelers are reclaiming their lives and returning to the skies. This increase in demand drove a better than expected revenue outcome for us in the June quarter with revenues down 49% versus 2019 resulting in a 6.3 billion total revenue. This was an impressive 76% sequential improvement from the March quarter. More encouragingly momentum is continuing as we exited June with a demand environment that's accelerating. Domestic leisure demand and yields are above June quarter 2019 levels and we see clear signs of business in international demand recovery heading into the fall.  Through the crisis we've earned an unprecedented level of brand loyalty and trust, thanks to the world class service, operational reliability and innovation that drives the Delta difference, and our commitment to safety, cleanliness, and wellness is as strong as ever. The people at Delta are our strongest competitive advantage powering our resurgence and running the best operation in the industry. It is because of our people's incredible work that Delta was honored as the number one airline for 2021 by JD Power. I want to thank every member of the Delta family for the professionalism, spirit of service, and warmth you show to our customers every single day.  I'd also like to thank our crews and operations teams for continuing to put our customers and their safety first as we restore our business. We are now in active recovery of our business and the challenges of getting our airline fully back to the service level our customers expect and deserve is daunting in light of the huge surge in demand that we are experiencing. But we're taking all the right steps primarily through increased staffing levels about Delta and our contract service providers to service this demand without compromising on the standard of care and cleanliness that our customers have become accustomed to on Delta throughout the pandemic. And even with these challenges our team continues to run the very best airline in the industry leading on all key operating metrics for the month of June and year-to-date.  For the June quarter we narrowed our pretax loss to $881 million. This was meaningfully better than initial expectations driven by demand strength. Importantly we achieved significant financial milestones during the quarter, these include returning to profitability in the month of June with a pretax margin in the high single-digits despite still missing 40% of our prior revenue from June of 2019 generating 1.5 billion of free cash flow and nearly 200 million of adjusted free cash flow in the June quarter. Achieving solid profitability and generating meaningful free cash flow a little over a year from the start of the worst crisis in this industry's history is an impressive statement about the resilience of our business and the great work of our people. In showcasing the value of the commercial partnerships that we have developed leveraging the Delta brand, we have created almost $1 billion in investment value this year through our partnerships with Wheels Up and CLEAR and I want to point out that $1 billion is against a zero cost base.  I want to give a big shout out to Kenny Dichter and the Wheels Up team as their listing on the New York Stock Exchange goes live today. We are proud to be Wheels Up exclusive commercial airline partners and largest shareholder with a stake valued at over $500 million. Also congratulations to Caryn Seidman Becker and the CLEAR team on their successful IPO. Our investment in CLEAR is worth approximately $340 million. And finally I want to congratulate Sir Richard Branson and our team at Virgin Galactic for making history last weekend and completing their first fully crewed spaceflight. It was exciting to watch Richard break new barriers once again, this time commercial space travel.  I take the time to mention these relationships because of the much larger eco system that Delta operates and attracts. And these opportunities to create value will continue to be nurtured as we extend our brand beyond traditional airline boundaries. With June profitability in the books we're now in the restoration phase of recovery and focused on harnessing the power of our differentiated brand and our resilient competitive advantages to drive sustainable profitability in the second half of 2021, and enable long-term value creation. Specifically, for the September quarter we expect a mid-single-digit pretax margin as demand continues to improve with the return of corporate travel and gradual reopening of international markets. We are starting to see signs of a resurgence of business in international travel both of which are supporting the next leg of the revenue recovery. And we're well positioned to take advantage of both with leading domestic corporate chair and a strong global network.  Around the country more and more offices are opening and people are reconnecting to their businesses and to each other. With 72% of our employees vaccinated, we officially reopened our own offices last month in June. And as I interact with other CEOs I'm encouraged to hear about their own plans to accelerate their return to office. That sentiment is coming through loud and clear in our most recent corporate survey with almost 95% of our accounts indicating they'll be returning to their offices by the end of this year. Domestic corporate volume grew from 20% base in March of this year, the March month that is, to 40% recovered in the June month and we expect it to be close to 60% recovered by September based largely on these reopenings.  I'm also encouraged by the strength that we're seeing in international. While we know international demand recovery will be very choppy and uneven, we're seeing strong bookings to Europe when countries open their borders. From our experience in the U.S. we're seeing the impact that widespread vaccinations have on reopening the economy. We know the same will be true for the rest of the world over time but are mindful of the risks that new variants posed to the pace of recovery and our team will stay very disciplined in restoring international capacity. As the recovery builds steam, we are making the required investments including hiring frontline and reservations employees, in investing ahead of the full recovery of the airline in places like maintenance and training. This will allow us to continue to provide industry leading service levels and prepare the airline for success in a stronger than previously expected demand environment. These investments are key to the execution of our strategy to win which is defined by providing best in class service to our customers and leveraging the brand while creating a simpler, more efficient airline.  The power of our brand has come through the crisis stronger than ever and we're seeing evidence of this across the business. The resilience of our American Express co-brand credit card program is a great testament to the increasing brand affinity that we have. Cards spend on the Delta American Express portfolio in the month of June was 115% recovered to 2019 levels for the same month despite travel purchases still being off by 25% in that same period. We're continuing to renew and simplify our fleet and yesterday we announced that we're opportunistically adding seven Airbus 350s and twenty-nine 737-900ers that will enter service over the next 12 to 24 months. These are current vintage to the aircraft that we operate in our existing fleet and we are adding these pre-owned aircraft for substantially less than the cost of new planes. These aircraft align with our fleet strategy that's focused on simplification, scale, size, and sustainability and create optionality for future growth or replacement in a capital disciplined manner. These transactions accelerate our recovery plans which also began with the exercise of 25 Airbus A321neo options in April. The A321neos which will start to deliver in 2022, offer the lowest seat cost in our fleet and will strengthen Delta's gauge advantage relative to our competitors.  Our recent actions on fleet enhanced efficiency throughout the cost structure. Gary will talk more about this shortly and we'll highlight the progress that we're making on our balance sheet and journey back to investment grade metrics. As our recovery path becomes clear so does our future as a carbon neutral airline. In 2020, we committed to our airline's carbon neutrality and we're taking actions today that are critical to our future. This includes a reduction in emissions that we're achieving with our fleet renewal, investments in sustainable aviation fuel together with many corporate partners, and the evaluation of long-term investments in carbon reduction and removal technologies. During the quarter we released our inaugural 2020 ESG report, which expands on the corporate responsibility reports that we have issued in the past. You'll be able to hear more about our ESG commitments as well, importantly as our multi-year financial targets and vision moving forward at Delta's Capital Markets Day, which we will be holding in person in New York on December the 16th. This event will give everyone an opportunity to hear from our management team, which over the past year we've strengthened by bringing in outside perspectives and promoting our deep bench. That includes Allison Ausband, who during the quarter pleased to announce, was named our Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Experience Officer. In addition, John Laughter, who I'm also pleased we announced as our new Executive President and Chief of Operations. Alison and John are Delta veterans who bring deep experience and unmatched expertise to their roles.  In addition, our incoming CFO, Dan Janki brings extensive business and financial skills to his role, as well as a broad global perspective and operational experience that will serve us well in the recovery and beyond. Dan's background makes him the ideal leader to advance our efforts to restore Delta to our pre pandemic financial position. You'll hear from him briefly before Gary delivers the financial update. With this great team of serving leaders, we're building an airline that's positioned to drive long term value for all of our stakeholders. Our people and customers are owners in our communities where we live, work and serve. I could not be more excited about our future. And now I'd like to turn it over to Glen. Well, thanks, Connor. It's a very important segment for us, and we have one, as I think, you know, business travel news, Airline of the Year for 10 straight years and we expect to hopefully win it again this fall as well. Our team does a magnificent job of servicing the accounts, providing the technology, the access, the insights to make their job, travel on Delta as easy as possible. And that's supplemented by the great product and service that our people put forward every single day. We're the leading operational airline in the industry. So when you marry up the investments we've been making, particularly in the premium product sector, which our corporates are a main consumer of, with the great service ourselves and commercial team provide and the product and operational integrity of the business, it's a very, very strong moat. We have gained share over the pandemic, meaningful amount of share that we have gained. And the one thing that we have seen is when customers come to Delta, they don't leave. And so we're going to continue to expand upon that. Good morning Hunter, I would like to ask you first you're sitting on a rocking chair estimate or no. I will rock back in my chair as I answer to you. That's good. Deleveraging is important to us. It's something that, first of all, we're the same team that's been here for over the last 15 years. We believe in derisking our balance sheet and our then paying down debt. And we also know that we can do that while also driving a premium product and service offering in the markets that we see as being critical to Delta. We were able to do both those things over the last decade and we'll continue to do that. The level of debt that we took on over the pandemic, candidly, it's a meaningful amount but it's not an overwhelming amount. It was about $8 billion of net debt that we took on during the pandemic. And when you think about, as Gary mentioned, we're basically done funding our pension plan with no more pension contributions required. As I think you also know that we've been averaging over the last several years, close to $3 billion, $2 billion to $3 billion a year in stock repurchases, which clearly we won't be doing in the next two to three years until we get our investment grade metrics back. And another billion on top of that of dividend distributions that we've been making. There's a substantial amount of free cash that is available to us as we reclaim investment grade for Delta. And we'll be sharing our longer term metrics at the Investor Day in December and showing you the path forward. But we can do all this and have plenty of headroom to compete hard and effectively in the marketplace. Thanks Myles. As you can appreciate every one of the proposed manufacturers has been after Delta. We've heard from many of them. We're studying this space and we will continue to get good smartness space. I think it's at a very, very early stage right now and I think a lot of the plans that we see are a bit premature, candidly. But it's not anything that we are unaware of and I guarantee every one of those manufacturers would love to have Delta colors on their plane. So hard to predict timing but we're in the marketplace having lots of conversations. Yeah, we definitely expect those to moderate. A lot of that is going to depend candidly on how the demand environment develops. What I would say is, what we've articulated is driving to levels below 19. We're not excluding rebuild expenses. This year they happen to be particularly high. As we get into 2022 we expect those to be more normal, and it's part of the thought process on what we've got to accomplish. Yeah, I would -- Mike, this is Ed. Mind if I chime in. I would say that we are thrilled with the relationship with American Express. Our team, their team, I was with Steve Squery [ph] last Friday, and I think we had the best performing card in the entire portfolio. Delta, even though we're the highest value that we create, I think we're also the best performing on top of that. So in terms of growth. So it's really been a great, great relationship and that's still without a lot of travel spend that's missing, international and business yet from the card. So we're excited. Mike, this is Ed, let me chime in on that one too. Because I've got the numbers right here in front of me. We've done our own survey, talking to our clients, the biggest the biggest companies in the world, and a very large number of them, and I couldn't make heads or tails out of what the GBTA was speaking to either. Let me give you the most recent survey and this is as of last week updated. 36% of our big corporates expect they're going to return fully to pre COVID levels no later than next year 2022 is 36%. Another 21% says fully back no later than 2023. Interestingly, only 5% of our of our big corporates say that we never returned to pre-COVID levels. 5% that had been 8% in previous surveys, it's now down 5%. While 38% indicate it's still unclear as to what their levels, not that they're not getting back, it's just the level of flying and the timing is still somewhat uncertain, which is understandable. So if you take the 2022-2023, that's 57% no later than 2023. And you assume, say 75% of those unknowns, the 43%, if you actually did 90% back over the course of the next couple of years. And frankly, I think it's going to be even better than that. So this is one of the things that as we have seen there's enormous pent up energy and demand for travel. Also in that survey, 93% of our customers said they're going to increase travel in Q3 over Q2 and many of those by meaningful amounts. So I think the surge is coming. And just as we've seen it on the consumer side, we're getting ready for it on the business side. And once you open businesses, offices, and you get international markets opened, I think it's going to be a very good run over the next 12 to 24 months. Well, thanks Duane. We do have a great Board, I agree with that, and there is a lot of good insight we garner from that Board. This is largely the same Board that's been with us over the last decade. It was the Board that was involved in and how we delevered coming out of the financial crisis in 2009. How we've the lead the industry in getting back to investment grade metrics over five years ago while delivering a premium product and service level and expanding internationally at a rate probably faster than anyone, particularly with the investments that we've made. So the Board knows the strategy that we're on, we've talked a lot at the Board level about needing to get our debt down of the balance sheet to get those investment grade metrics back. We'll give you some very specific guideposts on that when we have our capital markets day in December, so you know what to expect from us. And at the same time, we're also investing meaningfully into the business with opportunistic purchase of Airbus 350s and 737-900 that are current vintage, they'll plug and play. And we'll continue to be able to grow the business accordingly. So the strategy actually is not that different from where we've been. And I think it's going to -- we're going to stay very focused to get the investment grade back and growing the business at the same time. No, I don't know if it's the most profitable. I hope we are. You'd have to ask Steve that. But what I can tell you is it creates the highest overall level of spend and growth in the portfolio. And it's been that way for some time and it continues, and we both continue to invest to keep it that way. I really don't. Well, we'll study. We'll talk to the administration and Department of Transportation and Secretary [indiscernible] and many individuals about it. We have a long history of driving great value for customers. It's expensive to drive great value, and we're making the investments to drive great value. There's no question when you think about the level of service, the quality of service, the reliability, the affordability, everything's moving in the right direction. So we're thrilled to be able to show them the actual results of what we're doing. Mary, this is Ed. We missed the first part of your question. Could you repeat that? Over the course of this year, we're in the process of hiring between 4000 and 5000. We are not. The Delta brand is a very strong hiring brand. We're having great success. The challenge as I mentioned on the call is the training, the time it takes to get people in position, whether it's on the phones in reservations or in the airports. It takes a few months and the demand has come back in such a fast clip. It's taken us all a little bit of time to catch our breath. But we'll be fully back over the next couple of months and providing -- we've been providing great service, but the service levels that customers should expect and deserve you'll be getting back from Delta in the next couple of months. Not at all. Not at all. We've been managing the best completion factor in the industry and it's not even close. Our team is doing a good job. We've been at this for over a year, managing the training queue and the training pipeline, and our pilots and our maintenance team are doing great. It's interesting Dave, we've looked at potentially hiring bonuses and other incentives. And largely we haven't needed to resort to that. People look at the Delta brand as a place they want to be long term and they see this as an opportunity to get inside Delta. So no, we haven't had to make any changes to scale. We always watch it, we're very competitive in the market, we pay well, our people, we take great care of them. But no, we haven't had to adjust our salary scales in any in any meaningful way. Thanks. Thanks Dawn, this is Ed we are hiring a couple 1000 people into reservations. We've already hired at least half that number. We've got more to go every single week with more and more people are getting on the phones. We've reached out to many of the people at reservations who have retired as we had separation packages and voluntary departure packages over the last year. We have a fair number of them that returned, they are on the phones. We have people working from home. It's not a question of not providing the staff and we are doing everything we can the volumes are beyond anything we've ever seen there beyond the high point of 2019. And the handling times are substantially longer as people have more questions, as travel has changed, it is the first time back., So we're incredibly sensitive to it. The number you mentioned is not the average number at all. Yes, there are still rare occurrences of that. We have the callback features in place. We manage every one of the Qs, whether it's the General SkyMiles Q, the premium Qs, the non member Qs. And we're all at the longest the average we're seeing is in the one hour time frame. Which, by the -- wait way, which is, by the way too long, and by September we expect to get that back down to normal levels. Yeah, I'm not sure about that. We'll get back to you. And by the way, people email me every day, every hour. That's a good way. Somebody needs help just send me a note, I will take care of it. Your first question, Leslie, yes the starting rates of people join the company are clearly lower than the then the rates that people retired at as they left the company after 25, 30, 40 years of service. So we are getting a juniority benefit in the scale. We're giving a lot of people, a lot of our particularly our young managers who are having opportunities to take on more responsibility and growth in their careers. And that's all very, very healthy. Your question around vaccinations the 28%, could you repeat that? Listen 72% candidly we're proud of it. It beats any national average by a meaningful amount. We do have pockets within the company in certain regions and certain demographics that are below 72% and we are doing everything we can to continue to encourage and incent. We provided $1 million last month in total awards to vaccinated employees. They are 40 different drawings of $25,000 a piece. I think we have one more drawing today that we have of anyone that's just been newly vaccinated within the last month. To win $25,000 we've given away free travel to employees through drawings that can get vaccinated. And we continue to describe the risks to individuals if they're not vaccinated from the variance. So I don't know a company is doing more to get its team vaccinated than Delta. Hi, Ali. I don't know what's going to happen. It's up to the FEA. It's not really up to the Airlines to make that decision. We will be in conversations clearly with the FEA. I think it's important that medical experts make those decisions, not airline professionals as we've learned through the pandemic. They're the ones that have all the insight and the information, and keeping people safe. I appreciate people not wanting to wear the mask. I don't like wearing the mask when I'm on board either, but it's something that we need to do to keep each other safe. And I think the other question about what's going to happen in September. It really depends on where we are in the recovery phase. If the variants are continuing, I think people are going to be a little more careful about lifting the masks. If international borders are not yet opened, I'm not sure lifting the mask is going to help opening up those borders. So there's a lot that goes into that and I think as many pros to take the mask requirement as there are to keeping it on at the present time. Well, I think it's without debate that the federal support was critical to keeping our industry afloat and keeping our employees employed and being in position for the recovery. As we've talked on this call, one of the biggest challenges we're having now is getting everything fully stood up, even though we've kept all of our employees. So you can imagine if we had to actually let many people go and abandon those individuals, the challenges we'd be facing in our country of getting travel moving again. So I think it's been an incredible success. One can debate the length of the PSP2 and PSP3. I see no interest in going beyond what we have at the present time with PSP3, and we expect to be profitable in Q3 and beyond without any PSP support. Yes. You know, David, we haven't seen any meaningful shifts. It's been something we've been dealing with over the course of the Pandemic. Some people want to related to having to wear masks. I'm sure that's a piece of it. I don't know that's the main piece. I think the bigger challenge is that we've got a lot of individuals that have been impacted. Their emotional wellbeing have been impacted during the pandemic. It has people are coming back out into society. You see challenges in all walks of life, not just our industry. You see it happening in other places as well in society. So obviously, social media amplifies that and puts it on a stage that's not our experience. That's not our normal experience by any means. Their crews are trained and they're incredibly professional in managing the conditions when we have someone who doesn't want to follow instructions of the crew. And unfortunately, something we've become good at. And I look forward to the return of our business and patterns of normalcy so that we can start to manage our business without having to worry about these effects. Well, I thank you all for joining us. It's been an hour and a half. We spent a fair bit of time with you, but hopefully you've learned a lot as to why we're encouraged. And as we power our plan for the post pandemic future, why that I'm and our team is as optimistic as ever for the journey that we're on. U.S. Travelers are returning and it's really a tribute to the incredible work of our scientific community in developing effective vaccines. And that's going to be key to opening the world or return to profitability in the month of June is a major milestone. Solid profitability close to 10% speaks to the strength of our brand and the great work of our team worldwide. As we move past this inflection point from crisis into restoration, the people of Delta will be front and center, serving our customers and our communities. Our mission of connecting the people of the globe is a noble one. It's an important one. It's got great purpose and the social good that's generated by travel will be essential in the months and years ahead as our world heals. So I thank you all for your time today for joining us. And one more time, I want to say a special thanks to all the Delta people worldwide for their great work over the course of this last 16 months in getting our business to a point where we're looking to bright skies ahead. So thank you all."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Travis. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for our March quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our Interim Co-CFO, Gary Chase. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Gary will discuss cost, fleet, and our balance sheet. Similar to last quarter's call, we scheduled today's call for 90 minutes to make sure we have plenty of time for questions. For analysts, we ask you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst's Q&A, we will move to our media questions, after which, Ed will provide a brief closing statement. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call to Ed.\nEd Bastian: Thank you, Julie. It's been a little over a year since the onset of the pandemic and our customers are gaining confidence in air travel and beginning to reclaim their lives. Reflecting on what it's been in a year like no other, I'm tremendously proud of the progress that we've made and the agility that we've demonstrated. I developed an even deeper appreciation for Delta\u2019s strength, and firmly believe that the pandemic has served as a catalyst for us to find new and better ways to serve our customers and our communities. Thanks to the incredible dedication and sacrifices of our people, Delta has weathered the storm with our culture, our brand, and our values stronger than ever before. And I want to thank every member of the Delta family for your incredible efforts over the past year. Collectively, you've carried us through and shown that unique spirit that we call the Delta Difference. I also want to thank the administration and Congress for continued payroll support, which has protected thousands of airline jobs throughout the industry, and will help speed the U.S. economy in the recovery. Thanks to that support, we've been able to return our people to full work schedules, despite running an operation that will be at 65% to 70% of 2019 levels in the June quarter. The first quarter had two distinct periods, with the first half feeling very much like an extension of 2020. This demand was slower than expected. But as case counts decline and vaccinations accelerated demand picked up meaningfully later in the quarter, allowing us to achieve $4 million of daily positive cash generation in the month of March, the first positive cash generation since the onset of COVID-19. This marks a critical milestone in the path to restoring our financials. It is truly a great accomplishment, especially considering that our middle seat block limited the inventory that we're selling in business and international travel remain muted. It's also important to note that this metric takes into account all expenses that we're incurring as we rebuild our business. [Indiscernible] turned a true net positive cash flow position within a year of the biggest crisis ever seen in the history of this industry, is a real testament to the resilience of the company that we have built. Consumer confidence in air travel continues to increase with the pace of vaccinations in the U.S. rapidly accelerating, and predictions of herd immunity as soon as the summer. We said throughout the pandemic that one of the most important objectives was to restore confidence in air travel. We are now seeing more normal booking behavior as customers make plans for spring and summer travel. In fact, our daily net cash sales in March were twice what they were in January. As volumes grow, keeping our employees and customers safe and healthy will always be our top priority. We've taken a science-based approach to cleanliness, and are being guided by our own Chief Health Officer, Dr. Henry Ting, as well as by medical experts at the Mayo Clinic in Emory. And earlier this month, the CDC confirmed that it is safe to travel within the U.S. for those who have been fully vaccinated, an important step forward for the recovery of our industry. We are aligning with the recommendations of health professionals and government officials who continue to ensure the safe and effective distribution of vaccines and listening to our customers. Based on our survey work, 75% of our customers expect to be vaccinated by Memorial Day. With improving demand and vaccine trends, we announced that we'll start selling middle seats May the 1st, providing a powerful tool for improving our financial performance. We also launched other customer experience and loyalty enhancements to increase confidence in travel and maintain the trust and loyalty that we've built over the last 12 months. Looking ahead and assuming that these recovery trends holds, we expect to cut our pretax loss by more than half in the June quarter to between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, and we see a path to returning to profitability in the September quarter. Delta's resilience has helped us navigate the worst days of the pandemic driven by the competitive advantages that are core to our DNA. Those advantages our people, our brand and loyalty program, our reliable operations, our network, and our balance sheet will be even more important as we accelerate through the phases of recovery. These modes were tested like never before, and I'm proud of the resilience that they've demonstrated. Our people and our culture of service remain our most strategic asset. Loyalty to the Delta brand has never been stronger. Thanks to the outstanding service that our people provide. They are truly the best professionals in the business. This is evident in our domestic customer Net Promoter Scores, which have been in the low 70s throughout the pandemic, a full 20 point increase over 2019. We've also seen our customers continue to invest in the Delta brand using their American Express co-brand cards, demonstrating the resiliency of this unique revenue stream. Despite a large reduction in T&E categories, March co-brands spend on the card overall was up relative to March 2019 levels. Our operational performance remained strong. During the quarter we led the industry in all on-time metrics including A0, D0, and completion factor, which was more than 99%. And our network rebuild leverages the strength of our core hub structure in our international partner gateways. Same time, we are renewing and simplifying our fleet, improving the customer experience driving efficiency, and reducing emissions as we push toward our carbon neutral goals. And finally, the strength of our balance sheet enabled us to manage through the worst crisis in our history with no dilution to our shareholders other than warrants related to the Payroll Support Program, is something that continues to set us apart in the industry. We've begun our journey of de-levering, and by the end of the June quarter, we will have reduced financial obligations by nearly $10 billion through a combination of paying down debt and accelerating pension funding since last fall. This reflects an unprecedented turnaround in the health of our pensions over the last decade, securing the future of our retirees. Later this year, we expect to make one final contribution to the plan of up to $1 billion, which should enable our pension to reach fully funded PPA status by the end of this year, largely mitigating the need for any additional cash contributions going forward. And finally, as we look toward the future, it's important to acknowledge that the commitment we made last year to achieving carbon neutrality is as strong as ever. The only future for Delta and our industry is a sustainable future. This is why we're accelerating our fleet renewal and balancing near-term needs for verifiable offsets with long-term investments in sustainable aviation fuels, carbon sequestration advancements, and clean propulsion technology. And because we can't do this alone, we are collaborating with corporate customers as well as large energy producers in order to address aviation emissions together and work to scale up sustainable aviation fuels. We're excited about the progress that we're making to combat climate change, and enable a cleaner, more sustainable world. These steps are vital to Delta's long-term future, and we owe it to the next generation of customers and employees to continue down this path. The time for action not talk is now and I'm proud of the steps our team is taking. As the recovery takes hold, glimmers of hope are now optimism for the future. Demand for air travel is accelerating in a meaningful way and we are well-positioned to build a stronger Delta, as demand recovers to pre-pandemic levels in the next few years. With our competitive advantages having been fully tested, we have built the platform to extend Delta's leadership position in the years to come. More than ever, I am confident in the future of Delta and our people. Over the last year, we've taken meaningful actions to become a better, more sustainable, more inclusive company, driven by our mission to connect the world. And with that, I'll turn it over to Glen.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. As Ed mentioned the pace of demand recovery accelerated over the course of the quarter. With growing confidence, customers are now buying tickets for travel further out speeding our cash recovery. In the month of March, daily new bookings improved 50% from the January and February average, well ahead of its normal seasonality. As customers are now buying tickets for travel further out, our booking curve has extended and our air traffic liability has grown for the first time in three quarters up more than 800 million from December. On our January call, I outlined three distinct phases to the year and our levers for each. To progress to the second phase, we need to see higher vaccination rates, easing travel advisories, and growing consumer confidence, all of which are now evident in the United States today. Approximately 50% of the adult population in the U.S. have never received at least one dose of the vaccine. And by May, all states will have lifted mandatory domestic quarantine restrictions. Pent-up demand is also evident with domestic leisure bookings 85% recovered to 2019 levels and Latin leisure markets more than fully restored. Beyond our own bookings, we see encouraging data points in the broader economy. This includes accumulated savings, restaurant dining, credit card spend, hotel occupancy rates, web search data on travel, and corporations announcing more concrete office reopening plans. In response to these developments and the reduction of COVID-19 cases, as well as accelerating vaccination rates, we will sunset our middle seat block as of May 1st. That provides us with a very powerful lever to add capacity in a cost efficient way and generate meaningful margin tailwind. Removing our middle seat block results in our sellable capacity increasing from 46% of 2019 levels for the month of April to 67% of 2019 levels for the month of June. And with this increase coinciding with strong customer demand for our product, we expect our passenger unit revenue to improve by 20 to 25 points over that period. With this added capacity and a continuation of the leisure recovery heading into peak season. We expect our June quarter revenues to improve by approximately $2 billion from the March quarter. The corporate travel recovery has been slow but steady. Corporate volumes in March were nearly 20% recovered, up from 15% at the end of 2020. Small and medium enterprises continue to outperform other corporates by about five points. And given our investments and the customer experience, we've been able to grow our domestic corporate share lead which is now significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. To progress to the next leg of the recovery, we need corporate travel to return in earnest. While we expect continued improvements to business travel through the summer, we anticipate the significant increases will occur after Labor Day as we enter the more traditional business travel season. That will happen as vaccinations become even more widespread and offices continue to reopen. We continue to expect operational and sales related traveled to lead with travel to large conferences and internal meetings likely the last recover. Our views on corporate demand recovery are consistent with what we've heard in our most recent quarterly corporate survey, where one-third of our accounts expect to increase travel volume in the June quarter, and a majority of our corporate customers expect to return to office in the second half of the year. Vaccine distribution and lifting of government travel restrictions remain the top two drivers of corporate willingness to travel. International travel remains muted with long haul international bookings volumes at only 15% to 25% recovered. We're seeing some early signs of life in Europe with Iceland opening to travel to vaccinated U.S. citizens and increased demand for Israel and leisure destinations this fall. That said Europe lags the U.S. and Pacific is expected to be the last region to recover. We do not anticipate meaningful international demand improvement until later in the year when borders reopen. Once the recovery of those segments are underway, we'll expect they also proved to be a powerful cash and profitability lever for our business. Considering our operating leverage improvements in those segments will be cost effective and highly margin accretive, a dynamic that is very similar to what we expect from lifting our middle seat blocks and one that I am very enthusiastic about. In the meantime, we'll continue to benefit from the strengthening demand environment in the domestic and short haul Latin regions and from our non-ticket revenue streams which have proven more resilient. Our cargo revenues in the March quarter improved 5% sequentially and we're up 12% versus the March quarter of 2019. The performance of our loyalty is indicative of Delta's strong brand affinity and our customer aspirations to return to travel. As Ed mentioned co-brand spin in the month of March was higher than 2019 levels. This was a result of solid growth in non-T&E spend and continued momentum in T&E, which is now down 35% in March from down approximately 55% in November -- in December I'm sorry. Card acquisitions are also rebounding nicely and our attrition rates are below pre-pandemic levels. For the Month of March, co-brand acquisitions were over 60% recovered with less than half of our customer base blind. Our long-term partnership with American Express combines two strong consumer brands enhancing customer loyalty, while also providing a high margin revenue stream that has proven its resiliency. We have driven stronger engagement through our digital channels resulting in more direct relationships with our customers and record high digital satisfaction scores. Over the last year, we've created a more flexible and enhanced experience for our direct channels, increasing self service and making it easier for our customers to do business with Delta. Digital adoption is on the rise and direct channels like delta.com and the Fly Delta app account for 66% of our sales in the March quarter, up 15 points from 2019. While we expect that will normalize especially as corporate travel recovers, direct channels will continue to be preferred, particularly among medallions and young customers. As we restore our business, we're rebuilding our industry leading network with a simpler, younger, and more fuel efficient fleet. At the same time, we have preserved optionality with levers to flex our capacity restoration in either direction depending on the shape of the recovery. We are also capitalizing on the industry's best domestic hub structure with the highest return profile. The combination of our strong core hubs and coastal positions provides us with the unique opportunity to leverage cost efficient gauge with large narrow body aircraft, providing meaningful efficiency and scale advantages. In addition, we now see the opportunity to significantly improve our international returns from pre-pandemic levels, driven by an improved competitive position, a stronger cargo business, the acceleration of our fleet renewal, stronger partnerships, and an improved product offering. Reflecting on what has been the most difficult 12 months in the company's history, I could not be prouder of what our teams have accomplished. So, I want to thank them for their commitment and continue to put the customer in the center of what we do every day Looking forward, I'm optimistic about Delta's bright future. We have a powerful brand loyalty program that's proven their resiliency; we continue to improve our customer experience both in the air and on the ground as we've accelerated our robust array of airport projects. Our focus on health and flexibility has won the confidence of our travelers and we're being well served by our younger, more eco-friendly fleet, and leaner cost structure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Chase: Thanks Glen. And good morning, everyone. I'm excited to see our recovery begin to take root and our focus shift from stabilizing the company's financials to creating value by returning to profitability, generating cash, and restoring our financial position to its pre-COVID strength. Let me start with some highlights from the quarter and I'll address the upcoming quarter our fleet strategy and the beginnings of our de-leveraging journey. Our first quarter pretax loss of $1.5 billion includes a $1.2 billion benefit related to the Payroll Support Program. Net of this benefit, restructuring items and extinguishment charges associated with the prepayment of debt reported an adjusted loss of 2.9 billion. Our people out in the operation along with the commercial and finance teams came together nicely to produce great cost performance. Adjusted operating costs of $6.3 billion were 33% lower than 2019. Slightly higher than we anticipated at the outset of the quarter was half due to higher fuel expense and the other half due to recovery and COVID-related items. Non-fuel CASM was up sequentially as expected on 10% higher capacity as we restored our employees to full work hours and incurred costs to prepare for the recovery. Adjusted fuel price of $1.91 per gallon was 33% higher than 4Q, driven by market prices and losses at the refinery, which drove a $0.23 per gallon headwind in the quarter. On the consumption side, we realized the 12% fuel efficiency gain compared to 2019 with nearly half of that a direct result of our fleet renewal. Daily cash burn averaged $11 million in the quarter, improving from $12 million in the December quarter despite stepped up expenses. Improved receipts in March drove $4 millions of daily and positive cash generation. We ended the quarter with $16.6 billion in -- of liquidity and adjusted net debt of $19.1 billion, roughly flat with the December quarter though above where we expected to be due to aircraft financing decisions. Let's now look forward into the June quarter. We expect a nearly $2 billion improvement in our pretax results. If the recovery progresses in line with our expectations and fuel remains at current levels, we expect to narrow our pretax loss to between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, with progressive improvement through the quarter to breakeven in the month of June. The key driver of improvement will be the sunset of our middle seat block, increasing our inventory available for sale at minimal cost. We also expect continued strong performance on our non-fuel cost and still target levels below 2019 by the fourth quarter. In 2020, the team's delivered strong cost performance by baselining aggressively. In 2021, we are focused on driving cost leverage as we rebuild the network and revenue returns. We are seeing that leverage materialize in the June quarter, with a small increase in costs on a 20% increase in capacity, driving a 12% to 15% improvement in non-fuel costs sequentially. Compared to the same period in 2019, non-fuel CASM is expected to be 6% to 9% higher, including three to four points from rebuild items. Adjusted fuel price is expected at $1.85 to $1.95 per gallon and fuel efficiency for the quarter is expected to remain better than 2019 by more than 10%. Bringing these items together at the midpoint of our guidance, June quarter total operating expense is expected to be down approximately 35% from June quarter 2019. We expect daily cash generation in the June quarter as demand further improves. Now, let me comment on our fleet strategy, a key enabler of our cost performance. Our accelerated fleet transformation drives more than $400 million in annualized cost benefit relative to 2019, driven by fuel efficiency, simplification, and gauge. These benefits have enabled excellent cost performance and will support further inflection in our financials as the demand recovery accelerates. Since the pandemic began, Delta has taken a measured approach in matching supply with demand. That discipline, combined with the great work of our fleet and tech ops teams, have positioned us to capture fleet efficiencies, while preserving optionality on upside capacity levels for the future that will utilize flex fleet if demand warrants additional capacity. As Glen said, we have the ability to flex capacity in either direction based on the demand. The teams have plotted a path to invest in our fleet with maintenance that will either support higher flying levels if warranted or largely offset costs we'd otherwise incur in the future. Let me now move to the balance sheet. With our cash flow and earnings close to inflection, we've begun to reduce our debt levels and chip away at our $4 million daily interest burden. In the March quarter, we set in motion our first phase of debt reduction. Using $3 billion of our liquidity, we are paying down debt, funding our pension and acquiring aircraft in the June quarter with cash. Combined, these initiatives drive $240 million of annualized savings and free up $2 billion of lending capacity. On April 1, we contributed $1 billion to the pension. This accelerated contribution, along with strong returns produced by our pension team, position the funds to be more than 95% funded by year-end under the Pension Protection Act that determines cash funding obligations. On a GAAP basis, we expect to be more than 85% funded by year end. We are now assessing an additional contribution of up to $1 billion to achieve fully funded PPA status by year end. It is really exciting to see our long-term pension vision crystallize. The combination of contributions and strong returns over time, now position us where we expect no material contributions to the plan beyond 2021, freeing up an average of more than $1 billion annually of our cash flow. Adjusted net debt is expected to be $19 billion to $19.5 billion in the June quarter as we draw down liquidity to fund the pension plans and pay cash for aircraft deliveries in the June quarter. We expect normal amortization of debt, including the $600 million unsecured maturity in April, to be approximately $850 million in the June quarter. We're also working on a longer term vision to restore and improve upon the strong financial position we enjoyed pre-COVID. Our financial foundation has greatly helped us to weather this crisis, while investing in our future and avoiding dilution for our owners. In closing, I am proud of what the Delta team has accomplished over the last year. The Delta Difference that Ed mentioned has never been more important, nor has it been more pronounced, thanks to all 75,000 of you for protecting each other, our customers and our future. We have exciting opportunities ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Julie to begin the Q&A.\nJulie Stewart: Thanks Gary. Travis, we are ready for the analyst questions if you could give the instructions on how to get into the queue.\nOperator: Yes, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, good morning. Thanks. I wanted to ask you about restart bottlenecks. As we travel more, it feels like staffing levels are very tight. And that's just not an airline observation, but really across service providers, hotels, car rentals, it feels like there's understaffing right now relative to demand. And I think there's been some anecdotes about a hard time filling open positions. Obviously, the airline industry is in a different position given PSP, but I wanted to ask you, as you gain confidence in the demand recovery, what are the bottlenecks in getting spooled back up? Are you short staffed today relative to any of your work groups or is it really just a pilot training exercise?\nEd Bastian: Hi Duane. I think the issue you talk about in the broader hospitality sector is an issue -- I don't think it's an issue for the airlines, but I know the hotels, rental car providers that you say are having a difficult time getting staff back, given the level of unemployment and other stimulus that's been provided into the general economy, we're not experiencing that issue at all here at Delta. Our people have been at work throughout the entire the entire time. I'd say the biggest bottleneck -- two bottlenecks that we face, which I feel very good about where we're at, is clearly getting our pilot training and our pilots into the right categories and ready to fly. And secondly, maintenance, making certain that we got our aircraft and our engines and all the work ready for a pretty quick rebound. It's a -- we had some cancellations on Easter Sunday, a couple of weeks ago, about 100 in the business and we've noticed -- it's been a trend on some of the holiday weekends, but for the last few holidays, certainly President's Day and Easter, not nearly the challenges that we experienced earlier in Thanksgiving and Christmas and it's because our businesses is dealing with the tension between making sure that we've got as many costs out and saved and people on whether it's voluntary leave or some other alternative plan and being ready to respond to demand as it comes back. I feel pretty good about where we sit for the common spring and summer. We spent an awful lot of time understanding that. You also need to appreciate that in certain parts of the country, the virus is growing at a faster rate than others. We've had vaccinations moving and that's impacted a little bit on the pilot availability because pilots need to sit for a couple of days once they -- every time they get a shot. But all-in, I think our team is well-positioned and ready for the rebound that we see coming this summer.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. Thanks for that Ed. And then just for follow-up and I think Gary touched on it, but how do you think about the range of outcomes on June, whether it's capacity or revenue, what ability do you have here in 2Q to flex up if demand plays out better than what your guidance assumes? Thanks for taking the questions.\nEd Bastian: Well, the biggest flex lever we have is the middle seat, which comes available May the 1st and you're going to see a significant capacity bump from April to May because of the seat. So, we're not anticipating a significant amount of schedule -- additional schedule requirements. Probably the biggest question mark we have is the international space and we're working closely with the international authorities to be ready to fly when they enable travel, particularly in the transatlantic markets, but I'm not contemplating us having a big challenge getting seats in the market for June.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski, Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Gary, you walked through a lot of changes on the balance sheet there, but I think you said you're going to end the quarter or 2Q that is with about $19 billion to $19.5 billion in net debt. I guess, could you just talk to, again, the priorities on the fleet and the pension pay down, as well as, like where you'd like to see that net debt number by the end of the year and then maybe a longer term goal around the balance sheet?\nGary Chase: Yes, well, Brandon, we're not going to comment on where we'll be by the end of the year. What we've been very clear about as long-term goal was that we want to be back to an investment-grade quality balance sheet. If you think about it, simplistically, our net debt is up about $8.5 billion since the end of 2019. So, one easy way to think about what we need to do is get that back down to the $10 billion range. In terms of near-term priorities, you noted one we did make beyond the quarter -- on April 1st - we made a $1 billion contribution to the plan. We've discussed in here the potential for up to another $1 billion to achieve that fully funded PPA status. The other things that you should expect to see from us would be we're going to continue to pay cash for our aircraft, which not only prevents us from incurring debt, but it obviously builds our unencumbered collateral base. And then we have ongoing debt maturity. So, in this quarter alone, in fact, on Monday, we will pay a $600 million unsecured maturity. Over the course of the rest of the quarter, we'll have another roughly $250 million of regularly scheduled amortization, and another $400 million of that across the second half. So, you'll continue to see those debt levels work down for all of those reasons.\nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate that. And has the pandemic made you rethink your minimum liquidity threshold that you're comfortable carrying going forward?\nGary Chase: Well, we've looked at this a number of different ways. We're thinking about it on an interim basis. We've looked at it a number of ways and they're all kind of pointing to the same zip code. So, we've sketched out about a $10 billion to $12 billion interim floor for liquidity that we want to see. I think it's important to note though, that we don't have that thought process in isolation and I'll just repeat one of the things that you see us very deliberately doing is consciously building the unencumbered collateral base as we go. So, in addition to thinking about where we want to be with liquidity, our mind is also on continuing to build that unencumbered asset base so that we've got the flexibility.\nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Baker, JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. First question for Ed, or maybe for Glen, I appreciate the endorsement of the third quarter profit. From a high level, can you expand on what it's going to require? I mean, can you get there solely on domestic leisure recovery or do you need some percentage of international reopening or corporate to improve from down 80 to down 60, that sort of thing?\nEd Bastian: Hi, Jamie. Obviously, there's still a ways to go between here and there to get to the third quarter. Clearly, the number one dependency is the vaccination rate and getting to herd immunity in our country. And all the experts we talked to, including our own doctors tell us that early summer, is when we should expect our country to be in some form of early herd immunity and that will continue to inspire additional travel. Yes, we're working on reopening international corridors. I think the one that is most likely to be open for the third quarter, hopefully, is the U.S.-U.K. travel corridor and we're spending a lot of time with the authorities both here in the U.S. as well as the U.K. so what's going to be required to get that done and hopefully early summer, that we'll see the corridor open, which will then bring some pressure I'm sure on other markets to follow similar suits and protocols. The middle seat opening is another huge leverage point. The fact that we've been carrying such a significant amount of our capacity deliberately not selling it's going to be a big add on there. So, when you think about all these factors, you need to think about the additional scale that we have from better utilizing our fleet. Our fleet is still somewhat probably 10% to 15% underutilized as we're operating it today. These are the types of things we look at to give us some real optimism that there's a pathway to get into profitability this summer.\nJamie Baker: Okay, that's helpful. Second question for Gary and I suppose this builds a little bit on Brandon's question. But you cited the build in the ATL in the release in the prepared remarks, that was helpful. Thank you. A competitor of yours has said that one of their most important lessons learned from the downturn is you just can't count on the ATL anymore. Is that consistent with how you're thinking and how it ties back to how you manage liquidity going forward?\nGary Chase: Jamie, I think I'll answer it this way; there are a number of factors that we put into the thought process about liquidity. It is safe to say that that was one of the stress points that we consider.\nJamie Baker: Okay.\nGary Chase: It's wrapped into the analysis I was describing that has us kind of landing in that $10 billion to $12 billion zone.\nJamie Baker: Got it. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you, gentlemen. Look forward to seeing you next month. Its going be getting back to in-person.\nEd Bastian: Look forward to it Jamie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker, Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for your time. Two questions, Ed you referenced -- and you and I talked about this last month too, sustainability and the things that you're doing with respect to carbon sequestration and I think you mentioned other changes in the fleet. And I'm just kind of wondering, how should we think about getting to net carbon zero by 2040 and the costs involved in that? And if you think that that helps your corporate market share going forward?\nEd Bastian: Sure Helane. As I mentioned, in my opening comments, sustainability is a real issue for us for our business and it's a problem now, and it can't wait till later to be addressed. We're doing as we've committed to invest and verified carbon offsets with the highest certification, which are the really the only real solution in the marketplace right now. And we appreciate -- there's a lot of concerns about efficacies and we are concerned also, and that's why we're so specific in terms of what we're investing in. But there is real evidence, they have a clear impact and we can't wait for those longer term investments to start paying off to reduce the footprint in the meantime. We're working with a lot of providers, whether it's in the energy arena or other technology providers, seeking solutions to de-carbonize our operations and our footprint. We've committed $1 billion over this decade towards investments along these lines. And as you see this become a increased importance to the current administration, their priorities. We're hopefully going to get some support from our government, particularly in the area of sustainable aviation fuels, which is critical. We don't have as an industry have a clear roadmap to net carbon zero by 2040 at the present time, but it's important that we have the mindset that we're going to do what it takes to continue to invest in a better future for all.\nHelane Becker: That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just on another subject. When we were down there for investor day in 2019, one of the things that we saw was the Delta tech ops and the maintenance operation, and so on. And I'm just wondering how you guys are thinking about that business going forward, given the huge reduction in older aircraft that exists out there in the world now. And your non-Delta customers, and how they're thinking about renewing contracts or whatever and how you're thinking about that business? Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Well, we're excited about the -- sure Helane. We're excited about the MRO and its future and you're right in 2020, there was a dip in volumes as airlines pulled back, not just flying levels, but retired on a global basis some of the older fleets. But our MRO revenues are not down nearly in line with what were flying levels have come down to. And as we look to the pipeline of opportunities, there's still a pretty good backlog to dip into. So, team's doing a great job over there, first and foremost, taking care of the Delta fleet, but looking for opportunities to expand going forward and I think as your earlier question that Duane answered -- or asked around pipeline of blockages or obstacles to getting our businesses back. The MRO is going to be key for us not just helping Delta, but also helping some other airlines around the world, get their businesses back up and running as quickly as they can.\nHelane Becker: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hunter Keay, Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. With so much liquidity and demand including, is there a better than 0% probability Ed that you do not participate in PSP 3?\nEd Bastian: I'm sorry, Hunter, you said with the liquidity -- let me rephrase it, with liquidity we have, will we be participating in PSP 3, is that your fundamental question?\nHunter Keay: I guess, yes. I'm just wondering if there's a chance that you turn down PSP 3 if things continue to improve like this or ask not to participate in it.\nEd Bastian: We don't anticipate turning that down, though.\nHunter Keay: Okay, thank you. And then Glen, as you talk to the corporates, and I know it's early, you think about 2022 spending, are you starting these conversations from 2019 spend and working it down? Or are you starting at zero and sort of building it up?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes, I think we're looking at what we have today and building it back up again. And we don't know the outcome or when, but we do see is that slow and steady build. And we think as we get to the end of the summer, as we said in the script as the vaccination rates continue to improve, and officers continue to return that we will see an acceleration as we head into the fall. And I think still unknown where we'll wind up this year and where we'll wind up in summer of 2022. And that's I think we're going to work on the flexibility of our fleet to flex up or down depending on what we see in the market at different points in time.\nEd Bastian: To add to Glen's points, we did update the corporate survey that we commented upon last quarter and the numbers continue to look favorable. 36% of -- and this is -- many of our large corporations participated 36% expect to be fully back travel to pre-COVID levels by 2022, and another 16% by 2023. So, 52% say they're anticipating get back to full levels. Only 8% of the corporations that we survey say that we'll never get back to pre-COVID levels. And there's 40% that that are unclear as to what level of additional flying that we -- that they anticipate. So, if you take a fairly conservative view on the 40% uncertain and 8% that never get fully back and say that only 50% of that returns, then we're looking at 75% to 80% of our corporate revenues coming back over the course of the next couple years, which I continue to think is conservative, and we're working hard as people feel confident getting back out into the sky to get that business volume back to where it was.\nHunter Keay: Thank you both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Morning everyone. I have two questions from me, one near-term and one longer term. In the near-term, how would you characterize the current competitive environment are out there? Obviously, early days yet and everyone's trying to do obviously, add capacity to places the people want to go. But are you encouraged by what you're seeing right now? And do you think it gets better or worse from here as we open up more?\nEd Bastian: No, I think there's really two things that we would talk about and they are different scenarios. One is internationally coming out of the pandemic; I think we see a vastly improved competitive scenario with a lot of the ultra-low cost or low cost players in each region coming out of this much weaker or gone. And so as we see Europe come back, as we see Latin and the Pacific come back, I think we're going to see a much improved environment for many years ahead of us. And domestically, I think you characterize it quite well as people are traveling differently than they were pre-pandemic and while we are back at 85% of demand, that 85% is going different places than it was pre-pandemic. So, you see a lot more capacity from the industry in places that people are interested, basically, the less, the wide open spaces, the Florida markets, the Latin leisure markets. And so we've put our capacity where people want to fly and I think that's where we'll continue to focus and I see -- ultimately, I can't tell you what our competitors are going to do with capacity, but I think we feel really comfortable about how the U.S. arena is developing.\nRavi Shanker: Great. And just looking at it longer term, I don't know how much of your time is spent thinking about 2022 and even 2023 at this point, but look everyone's looking at 2019 as a baseline, but given the huge pent-up demand and the huge amount of excess savings with the consumer, do you think there's a likelihood that we significantly surpass 2019 levels of travel in 2022, 2023 and beyond? And if so, do you have the ability to service that without bringing on significantly more resources? Thanks,\nEd Bastian: Ravi, I wish I had a crystal ball that was clear to know with some degree of confidence. Certainly, there's enormous pent up demand. Consumers have built up a lot of wealth over the pandemic, people have really lost the connection that they look to recreate and get back together, whether that's for leisure, purpose, or business. And I think over the course of the next 12 to 18 months, we're going to see a strong surge as markets reopen for different categories as well as different borders. Looking out into the next couple years, does that mean we'll be beyond 2019? I think it's possible. We have flex in our fleet, in our order book to address that. We're not going to be limited. If there's demand out there, we're going to be positioned to be able to service.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth, Raymond James.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is actually Nat on for Savi. Thanks for the time. A couple quick ones for me. Being we're just on the international topic, in terms of leveraging your international partners, how you plan on positioning your domestic network for that? Or are there any changes necessary or priorities to your coastal hubs?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think one of the things we're excited about as we come out of this pandemic is the strength of our international partners, as I mentioned earlier, is, international is taken much more of a reshape than domestic given the fact that a lot of international carriers didn't receive government support through the pandemic and are going to either be much smaller or not be there as the pandemic way eases off. And so we are very encouraged about continuing to leverage our partner hubs as the first wave of pre-pandemic international travel comes back. And that's really what we've done so far. And I think, yes, there will be opportunities for us to reshape our domestic to better feed our internationals coming out of this than we had going in. But we'll deal with that as it occurs as opposed to anticipating.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks, Glen. And then one quick one on the fleet, fuel efficiency is impressive, it seems like that's taking hold well, but do you expect that kind of level to hold back to full utilization? Thanks again for the time.\nGary Chase: Yes, well, as we said, about half of the 12% improvement that you saw in the quarter versus 2019, is really structural change driven by the fleet renewal that we've been talking about. So, you can think of the remainder as conditional on where we are on the system. We did say, however, that as we look into the second quarter, we expect at least a 10% improvement on where we were for the same metric in 2019. So, do expect continued fuel efficiency certainly through the June quarter of significance.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, thanks for that clarification there.\nOperator: Next question comes from Andrew Didora, Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. Glen just curious on your booking curve commentary in terms of how it continues to lengthen, is there -- are there any data points you can put around this? Maybe how much of your 2Q budgeted revenues are already on the books versus how that typically compares to normal times or anything you can help quantify that for us?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, through the pandemic, looking curve it compressed and starting about middle of last month, for the first time ever, we saw advanced bookings outside of the 60-day window is actually surpassing the percentage of bookings that were in that category in 2019. So, hopefully I can give you some context that people are feeling much more comfortable booking further out in the curve. And I think we're looking at several things. One is I think in the U.S., they're feeling much more comfortable in domestic flying, knowing they'll get their shots, knowing they'll be able to travel, still waiting for more and more events to open and places to open and kind of one of the things that continues to accelerate the domestic demand and then really waiting for the internationals to reopen in earnest. I think people are now looking at it, the fall and making some speculative bookings that Europe will be open in the fall. There are not a great number of those out there yet, but certainly, there's interest out there. And I do believe that in the next month or two, we'll see at least some of the European countries attempting to reopen, and that will hopefully put pressure on the others to figure out ways to reopen their markets.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. It makes sense. And then my second question here just for Ed, I guess, more bigger picture here. I mean coming out of the pandemic after past downturns that meaningfully affected the industry, there have been some pretty big changes out there, right. But this time around, we really haven't seen that, there's plenty of liquidity; airline survived, no consolidation, no hub closures. Has any of this surprised you? And why do you think a lot of these have not happened this time around?\nEd Bastian: Sure Andrew. No, it doesn't surprise me at all. And it's primarily because of the government support that the U.S/ airlines have received in terms of PSP. When you think about the significant levels of support and ensuring that that support goes to retaining employment across the industry as a national priority, there really isn't a lot of change structural. You use that money to try to get your business back up, which was what they were intended to do. Certainly on an international level, we're seeing a lot of change. There's been a lot of international restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations, changes, which I don't think we really fully appreciate the full extent of that. It's going to take some time yet to play out. I think it'll help and benefit the U.S. industry because we're going to be competitively stronger than in the international landscape than we were previously. So, we'll see how that plays out.\nAndrew Didora: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg, Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, just two here. The first one to Glen. Glen have you come up with an estimate of what you think the net revenue hit that you incurred because of the middle seat block, and I would be most focused on the month of March where you actually had pretty good demand, and we're probably spilling traffic?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes, we've looked at that. And I think maybe for the month of March in particular and clearly as we got to the end of -- or as the traffic continued to rise again -- and confidence returned, it got to be a more expensive proposition. So, for the month of March, it was probably between $100 billion and $150 million of gross revenue that we left on the table not blocking the middle seat, but really ensuring that demand came back and ensuring that our brand came out of this very strong. And I think had we the choice to do it over again, we would do it in a heartbeat because I think it's something that really set Delta apart through this pandemic is putting consumer confidence and the confidence in health and safety first, was a very important part of how we've invested in our brand through this pandemic. So, I think that's when we see this real competence returning in the April-May time period that was also one of our big cues to say it is time to let it go away.\nMike Linenberg: Thanks for the color there. And then just my second question to Gary, on the $1.85 to $1.95 fuel guide, is there an embedded refinery loss in there? What is if there is on a per gallon basis? And sort of sort of a part two to that, as I recall, I believe the voluntary participation in the CORSIA program was supposed to commence I believe in 2021. In fact, is that true? And where's that going to show up on the Delta P&L is in fact that does kick in this year. Thank you.\nPeter Carter: Good morning. It's Peter Carter. So, from the CORSIA perspective, this is the year where we benchmark so this is the year where our use will be determined for future years.\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nPeter Carter: And it is completely voluntary, but we're fully participating.\nGary Chase: Yes, and Mike on the first part of your question, the $1.85 to $1.95, it does contemplate a loss at the refinery. It's not as substantial as what we experienced in the first quarter. The fuel curve that we're using is generally what you see out there, crude in the low $60s and cracks in the $5 to $6 range.\nMike Linenberg: Great, very helpful. Thanks. Thanks both. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Vernon, Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Good morning, guys. A couple of questions for you on the contours of the revenue environment, if we look at kind of where average fares are sort of trending based on some of the arc data and other sources out there, it looks like the average fare levels lower than we were in 2019. Can you talk to how much of that is sort of mix and loss of business travel demand? And what maybe like-for-like leisure yield would look like today versus 2019?\nEd Bastian: Maybe I'll take a stab at that is -- and give you a little bit of a forward look is we have clearly in the month of May, we're calling May a transition month because we are putting the middle seats back in which gives us a substantial increase in our capacity levels. And we're expecting that May will come in with an absolute load factor of 75%. As we get into June, and the more peak travel season, and with those seats being absorbed into the marketplace, we believe that we will move from the 70s into the mid 80s, that gives us a little bit of an opportunity to start to manage yield a little bit more than we have in the past. And so structurally, we think we're in a pretty good space in terms of the structure of leisure travel and fares being within the range of where we were in 2019. And so as we head into the summer, we believe that the real pressure on domestic yields will come primarily from the lack of business travel, not from the structure themselves or not for leisure travelers paying significantly less than they did in 2019. Does that help answer your question?\nDavid Vernon: It does. I guess and maybe just as a follow-up as you think about getting the yield management sort of levers to work in the revenue optimization systems. How long do you think from a domestic standpoint, like when do you think you'll actually be at a level where you're not just starting that process, but you're kind of more at a run rate of getting that full benefit of managing appeals?\nEd Bastian: Well, remember, the way the yield curve works is we're always saving for the last minute business traveler, who's -- there are not that many of them out there this year, they're substantially less than they were for 2019. So, you won't see I think the full impact of yield management flow into the revenue equation until a little bit later, probably early fall. So, summer is going to be about managing leisure demand and there's a little less opportunity in terms of saving that last seat for the business customer. So, as we move through the year, I think we're going to get say September-October to really be in a much better position to manage yield through the traditional RM systems.\nDavid Vernon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien, Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good morning. Thanks so much for your time. So, a little bit of those shorter term take on Ravi's question earlier, regarding your plans to get to 75% of 2019 capacity in the fourth quarter, is that the structural maximum based on your fleet and crew retirements? And if we do see that wave of pent-up demand that you discussed in your CNBC interview this morning, Ed, would you consider sourcing additional aircraft to be able to add more capacity back sooner or is that capacity plan that's really in line with your views on the piece of the recovery through year end? I realized a couple questions in there. Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Thanks, Katie. We certainly have in the very near-term for this coming summer limitations to how much demand we can we can serve and its decisions that are taken six to 12 months in advance in terms of getting pilots into the right categories. That said, with a significant amount of capacity we're adding through the middle seats being returned to service, I don't think it's going to be a substantial impact on our ability to serve the demand that we see out there.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. And then maybe one on the cost outlook. You know you previously announced expectation that the company can achieve 2019 CASM on just 75% of 2019 ASM. I guess for that's still the expectation? And then second, is inflation contemplated in that figure or is that a like-for-like a year assuming 2019 labor maintenance costs, and the like that typically do see some annual inflation? Thank you.\nGary Chase: Katie, that's the number that we expect to hit this year. And I would say I'm really pleased with where we are, I mean, we are on the trajectory. The 6% to 9%, as I mentioned that we're achieving in the second quarter, I mentioned the four points of rebuild that are included in there. But you heard Glen talk about some of the international flying that we're not doing now. Our international mix is down quite a bit. In particular, we're not flying a lot of the long haul international network yet. If you look like-for-like in what you're seeing in the second quarter, that's also about a five point headwind. So, kudos to the team here, everybody has really embraced it. And they've just done a great job. The whole company really has come together around it. As I mentioned, in 2020, it was really about aggressively attacking the cost base, we understand the mission this year is really getting that incremental leverage as the network rebuilds. And you're really seeing it in the second quarter, if you take a look at how the ASMs are coming on and the cost incurred to do that. It's really nice operating leverage. So, very happy with where we are and fully expect to be on that 2019 number by the time we hit the fourth quarter.\nCatherine O'Brien: Great, thank you.\nEd Bastian: Katie, one other thing I'd like to add to the point. People probably don't appreciate the fact that for the last couple of quarters, Delta has actually been flying the most scheduled service of anyone out there. So, when people worry whether we were going to have the capacity and the seats in the market to fill it, we're flying more scheduled servers, because we're blocking so many of the seats on the individual airplanes. As we open that inventory up, we're going to be raised with anybody in terms of being able to provide service and strength into some of our key hubs and markets domestically. So, we're not we're not concerned in the short-term that we're going to be short aircraft or short staffed.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, great. Thanks for additional color Ed.\nOperator: Next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu, Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, everyone and thank you. I guess, somewhat related to the last question, how are you thinking about international markets coming back up here, relatively upbeat guidance on that international capacity for summer 2021? How are you thinking about that in terms of geographically, are you seeing any dispersion in booking so far?\nEd Bastian: Well, on the reopening of international borders, I think there's still more -- many more questions that are answers. We are focused on trying to get the U.S.-U.K. travel corridor open. I think that's the most logical and has the greatest value to us. And I think those are the markets where we'll start to see demand grow quickly when we can get that open and we're working with our partners at Virgin from the U.K. standpoint, as well as across not just the airline industry, but within the broader travel and hospitality sector too, figure out how we can get it open for summer. And we're making progress in that regard. When you think about other parts of Europe, there may be some occasional markets open this summer based on Southern Mediterranean leisure traffic that people will be interested in, but I don't I don't think you're going to see Continental Europe open in any meaningful way till later in the year. We'll probably unfortunately miss much of the summer for most of Continental Europe. On the other end extreme, I think Asia is going to be the long pole in the tent. I think that could take a year or more to start travel back up at scale. When you think about China, and Japan and many of the other Pacific markets, the one market that we will be spending a lot of time trying to support is Korea, with our partner at Korean. And South America is going to be somewhere in the middle. It's really going to be based on the success they have in trying to get the virus under containment in their countries, which we all know right now is a very difficult spot that they sit in. So, that's probably late this year, into the winter when you start to see South America open up.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you for that color. And then how should we think about progression of yields, particularly given that you guys have been successful in doing so. You mentioned summer's all about leisure and limited capacity. So, how are you thinking about that progression on yield?\nEd Bastian: I think we're really focused on the unit revenues. And I think we outline the progression and of course, there's a yield traffic trade off that we're always monitoring. But when you think about getting 20 to 25 points of unit revenues sequentially between the end of March and June, that's a huge improvement and one that I think is indicative of what we'd be looking at for summer travel. And I outlined earlier we think that the traffic will be in the mid-80s for peak summer domestic, and that presents opportunity to manage yield.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi, Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe Ed or Gary, just looking at the fleet, pre-COVID you guys talked about NMA and as option for 757 replacement. I'm wondering if that's still the thinking or maybe kind of what the updated thoughts are with that? Are there new options kind of out there on the used aircraft side that changes the approach or how are you all thinking about that? And maybe, kind of when do you need to order something to -- for that?\nEd Bastian: Hey, Joe its Ed. As you probably have seen or read the NMA is not being actively discussed at Boeing at the present time, but they certainly do have alternatives and new designs that they're thinking about, and we're engaged with those conversations. Nothing imminent, or on the short horizon here, but we are looking at the longer term opportunities with our friends in Seattle.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then you talked about March co-brand spend being up versus 2019, seems very bullish to me. Can you talk about the longer term target and your ability to get to the $7 billion that you talked about pre-COVID? Can you do better? And then specifically, how sensitive is that to corporate demand or not? It would seem more tied to leisure, but just interested in your thoughts there. Thank you.\nEd Bastian: So, clearly, the co-branded cards are an array of purpose, including a lot of small and medium sized enterprises, where we're seeing a lot of success with the cards right now. And so I think, we feel very, very confident that we can get to the $7 billion and clearly the crisis has put a little delay on that. And we're sizing up how significant that delay is and how we can shorten that delay by new and innovative programs to stimulate demand for the card. And I think we feel confident coming out of this that the card performed at or above our expectations of how it would do in a scenario -- a recessionary scenario. And so we think a very bright future for that card.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: Now, we'll go to our final analyst question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton, UBS.\nMyles Walton: Great. Thanks. Ed maybe a reflective question, given the level of government support and assistance the U.S/ airline industry has gotten in the last 12 months, does it reframe how you and others in the U.S. will look at subsidization of international carriers that was clearly a complaint pre-crisis? And is there a potential for almost a turning of the tables as they look at us and the level of support we've gotten in the U.S.?\nEd Bastian: That's an interesting question Myles and certainly, we've depended upon the support from our government here to be able to sustain an essential service for our economy. I don't know what that means, in terms of long-term. Clearly, the Middle Eastern subsidies were not there as a support tool for essential service, they were there to grow their economies and grow their businesses. So, I think fundamentally, the nature of the intervention, not just in the U.S., but around the world that we've seen over the last year, is of a very different character. And we'll see on the other end of this where the international market slant and the level of subsidies that that continues. So, yes, we've been appreciative of that. But no, I don't think it changes the character of what our issues were in the past.\nMyles Walton: Okay, and maybe Glen, the shape of the quarter in June, obviously, 1Q was January-February versus March, is May -- April, May, June more linear in the recovery profile.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, clearly, the big step up is from April to May as the seats get released. And then June is just sequentially better. So, more of a traditional seasonality, moving from May to June, and really it's about the capacity absorption of that middle seat, is this story of the second quarter. Clearly, in the first few weeks of data, it will -- people have to leave to come back. So, there'll be some imbalances. And so we see the first two weeks of May being a little bit later and then the second two weeks as you get into Memorial Day and that more traditional peak leisure period, which should be much stronger.\nMyles Walton: Okay. Thanks.\nJulie Stewart: And that\u2019s going to wrap-up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer to start the media questions.\nTim Mapes: So, Travis, if we could just repeat the instructions as the members of the media lineup in the queue and just as a reminder, one question and one brief follow-up, and we'll try to get to as many of those as we can.\nOperator: Yes sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Leslie Josephs, CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: On the pilot training issues, how much of that is contributing to your costs? Same question for the maintenance issues you discussed before the kind of the ramping up? And do you expect to hire pilots at all this year?\nEd Bastian: I think Leslie; we mentioned that in the cost guidance for the second quarter the rebuild, the maintenance, and as well as some training is probably in a three to four point range of the 6% to 9% growth that we're seeing over 2019 levels. So, it's a meaningful amount that we're investing to get the business back. We've not made a decision yet with respect to hiring, but I do anticipate if we see the recovery, continue to gain strength that before the end of the year, we could very well be in the market for both pilot and flight attendant hiring again.\nLeslie Josephs: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alison Sider, Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: Hi, thanks so much. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you might be seeing at some of these leisure destinations that are proving to be really popular. Are there any constraints on any airports that you're looking at or that you've been talking to? Or are they -- are any of those airports starting to get really crowded?\nEd Bastian: We haven't encountered that yet. So, we've been able to fly schedules that we wanted to fly to all those leisure destinations.\nAlison Sider: Got it. And I just I'm curious if you're thinking about or planning to do any more point-to-point flying -- flights that over five, some of your house, as some of your competitors have? Is that something that you're looking at ramping up for the summer?\nEd Bastian: No, we have very, very strong performance from our core hubs in our coastal gateways. So, we're going to stay focused on them.\nAlison Sider: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein, Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you very much. We saw Southwest yesterday increase their number of Rapid Reward points that it's going to take to redeem an award, they increased by about 6%. I'm wondering if you can comment at all on whether that's something that Delta might be considering, or we might see you do down the road here?\nEd Bastian: No, we're not considering that. And we're very excited about the value we're bringing to customers and grow our program. And we\u2019ve actually used the program to stimulate a lot of demand with really some very attractive offers that we've had in market across the U.S. And hopefully, our frequent flyers are enjoying the benefits associated with those track offers.\nMary Schlangenstein: And can you talk about how you've seen the build of point, I mean, very few people were traveling, especially internationally as we all know, but what did you see keep up your level of points being built with a credit card use, did that surpass a travel or can you comment on that at all?\nEd Bastian: Well, if you think about it, unfortunately, there weren't very many people traveling on the airline, which is the vast majority of issue. And on the credit card side, clearly that had a much more sustained. So, we don't feel that there's a huge imbalance coming out of the pandemics, but the difference between what points have been accrued versus what we anticipate being able to supply in the marketplace. And we're pretty excited about people returning to use their points.\nMary Schlangenstein: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Slotnick, TBD.\nDavid Slotnick: Good morning everyone. Thanks for the call and the question. I want to go back to what we were talking about before, as you pointed out, the likelihood of the U.K.-U.S. tunnel is seemingly growing. Just curious if you can shed some light on what kind of demand you're expecting there, and how you would plan to capture that demand, especially if it's a last minute reopening kind of thing without being -- having aircraft and cruise over committed to some of the domestic and regional leisure markets?\nEd Bastian: Well, certainly what we've seen is when customers can travel internationally, they are willing to and excited about it. And I think when you think about the places that you can go today, whether or not it's the Caribbean or the Latin, we have said that there's more than 100% of the demand restored to those places. So, we're over-indexing already versus where we were in 2019. So, as those open, we will be able to supply and as you think about it, there's still a significant number of our places that will be closed. So, if the U.K. were to open, we'd be able to satisfy as many seats as people needed to fill the demand. I think we're excited about that and we'll see how it goes. But the one thing I would have a takeaway is Americans want to travel and they want to travel abroad.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Silk, Travel Weekly.\nRobert Silk: Yes hi. Where is Delta at as far as Digital Health Passport development? And also you all see this -- how much impact do you see Digital Health Passports as being able to have particularly when you talk about on a global scale interoperability across nations versus simply the vaccines and the end of the pandemic being really what brings back international demand?\nEd Bastian: So, we're spending a considerable amount of time building an open source platform, because as you probably know, there's a lot of different marketing technologies for Digital Health credentials, which I think is probably the more appropriate right versus passport, which gains a lot of negativity, calling them passports. The challenge we face is every government around the world is looking at their questions uniquely, and we need to start looking collectively at answers. So that'll be important, for example, as we reopen the U.S.-U.K. border as to what technology will be available to actually evidence vaccination, if indeed the regulator's even require a vaccination. It's not clear that that's been -- that's even be requirement. So, we're working to try to keep as open a framework as possible, working with health providers, technology providers, and our customers to ensure that when they need to show that they've been vaccinated or have been tested, they can do it in as efficient manner as possible.\nRobert Silk: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Biers, AFP. Hello, John, your line is live. If your phone is on mute, please unmute.\nJohn Biers: Thank you. Hi, John Biers at Agence France-Presse. I wanted to ask there was the whole controversy about the Georgia election law and there was a -- briefly there was a boycott Delta hash tag that went viral on and so forth. And you came out strongly against the law after it passed. I wondered if you had seen any impact on customers, either positive or negative in industry, if you could discuss whether you think there'll be any lasting impact on your brand with the public.\nEd Bastian: No, we haven't seen any significant impact from the different discussions that have been going on in Georgia.\nPeter Carter: With that, Travis, we have time for one final question before we turn it back over to Ed for his closing comments, please.\nOperator: Yes sir. Our next question comes from Elliot Blackburn, Argus Media.\nElliot Blackburn: Good morning. Thanks for making the time for me. I just hoped you could talk a little bit about especially in light of Delta's de-carbonization goals. How does the Trainer Refinery fit into Delta and how do you -- how are you guys looking at that facility going forward now?\nEd Bastian: Well, it fits in as it always has, it's an offset to our exposure to jet cracks. And that's one of the things that we are saying. We had some questions about impact at the refinery, and one of the primary drivers of that -- there are two. But the first primary driver is just the fact that jet cracks right now are very low. I mentioned they were in the $5 to $6 range. We've seen them historically in $15 to $20 range. The other contributor to the near-term performance has just been a huge escalation in the cost of rents, which have gone towards the end of the fourth quarter, they were in the $0.60 to $0.70 range and they're, they're well north of $1 now. That's a market dislocation that we just don't see as sustainable.\nElliot Blackburn: Given that, I mean, especially with the rent uncertainty, and also with your interest in an assay, I mean, are you guys looking at possibly converting that refinery to renewables or would you change operations at that refinery going forward?\nEd Bastian: I think it's safe to say we're always evaluating all our options. What we're not going to do, though, is let some of these short-term dislocations guide our actions. This is an asset that has contributed a lot to the company over the last in the time that we've owned it, which is the better part of the last decade. We've got a world-class team, they're operating it, they\u2019re operating it efficiently. They're operating it cost effectively. And as I mentioned, it is serving the purpose that we've always had for it, which is an offset to the crack exposure that we have.\nElliot Blackburn: Thanks very much.\nPeter Carter: With that, we'll turn it over to Ed for final closing comments. Thank you, everybody for your participation today.\nEd Bastian: So, I'd like to thank you all for your participation and joining us this morning. As we sum up the call, it's clear that at Delta, we've reached an important inflection point, as we navigate the pandemic and move into the recovery phase of 2021. As the pace of vaccinations accelerate, our customers are reclaiming their lives. Air travel will be central as people reconnect with loved ones and business colleagues, replacing their screens with real human touch points as they venture out of their homes, and communities to experience the world again. Looking forward, with customer demand steadily rising, there is a lot of runway ahead of us. As we open our middle seats to booking and corporate and international begin to recover in earnest. And once the recovery of those segments are underway, we expect they'll prove to be a powerful cash and profitability lever to get our business back to where we needed to be. The strength of our balance sheet has been critical and I'm excited that we're shifting our focus to delivering, which will also be an important accelerator in our recovery. But with all of this, I have great confidence that Delta is well-positioned to lead the industry in the months and years ahead. I thank all of the people at Delta for your tremendous job, particularly over these last 12 months in positioning us for success. And we look forward to welcoming all of you back aboard our flights in the days and months to come. Thank you all.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Gary Chase",
            "content": "Thanks Glen. And good morning, everyone. I'm excited to see our recovery begin to take root and our focus shift from stabilizing the company's financials to creating value by returning to profitability, generating cash, and restoring our financial position to its pre-COVID strength. Let me start with some highlights from the quarter and I'll address the upcoming quarter our fleet strategy and the beginnings of our de-leveraging journey. Our first quarter pretax loss of $1.5 billion includes a $1.2 billion benefit related to the Payroll Support Program. Net of this benefit, restructuring items and extinguishment charges associated with the prepayment of debt reported an adjusted loss of 2.9 billion. Our people out in the operation along with the commercial and finance teams came together nicely to produce great cost performance. Adjusted operating costs of $6.3 billion were 33% lower than 2019. Slightly higher than we anticipated at the outset of the quarter was half due to higher fuel expense and the other half due to recovery and COVID-related items. Non-fuel CASM was up sequentially as expected on 10% higher capacity as we restored our employees to full work hours and incurred costs to prepare for the recovery. Adjusted fuel price of $1.91 per gallon was 33% higher than 4Q, driven by market prices and losses at the refinery, which drove a $0.23 per gallon headwind in the quarter. On the consumption side, we realized the 12% fuel efficiency gain compared to 2019 with nearly half of that a direct result of our fleet renewal. Daily cash burn averaged $11 million in the quarter, improving from $12 million in the December quarter despite stepped up expenses. Improved receipts in March drove $4 millions of daily and positive cash generation. We ended the quarter with $16.6 billion in -- of liquidity and adjusted net debt of $19.1 billion, roughly flat with the December quarter though above where we expected to be due to aircraft financing decisions. Let's now look forward into the June quarter. We expect a nearly $2 billion improvement in our pretax results. If the recovery progresses in line with our expectations and fuel remains at current levels, we expect to narrow our pretax loss to between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, with progressive improvement through the quarter to breakeven in the month of June. The key driver of improvement will be the sunset of our middle seat block, increasing our inventory available for sale at minimal cost. We also expect continued strong performance on our non-fuel cost and still target levels below 2019 by the fourth quarter. In 2020, the team's delivered strong cost performance by baselining aggressively. In 2021, we are focused on driving cost leverage as we rebuild the network and revenue returns. We are seeing that leverage materialize in the June quarter, with a small increase in costs on a 20% increase in capacity, driving a 12% to 15% improvement in non-fuel costs sequentially. Compared to the same period in 2019, non-fuel CASM is expected to be 6% to 9% higher, including three to four points from rebuild items. Adjusted fuel price is expected at $1.85 to $1.95 per gallon and fuel efficiency for the quarter is expected to remain better than 2019 by more than 10%. Bringing these items together at the midpoint of our guidance, June quarter total operating expense is expected to be down approximately 35% from June quarter 2019. We expect daily cash generation in the June quarter as demand further improves. Now, let me comment on our fleet strategy, a key enabler of our cost performance. Our accelerated fleet transformation drives more than $400 million in annualized cost benefit relative to 2019, driven by fuel efficiency, simplification, and gauge. These benefits have enabled excellent cost performance and will support further inflection in our financials as the demand recovery accelerates. Since the pandemic began, Delta has taken a measured approach in matching supply with demand. That discipline, combined with the great work of our fleet and tech ops teams, have positioned us to capture fleet efficiencies, while preserving optionality on upside capacity levels for the future that will utilize flex fleet if demand warrants additional capacity. As Glen said, we have the ability to flex capacity in either direction based on the demand. The teams have plotted a path to invest in our fleet with maintenance that will either support higher flying levels if warranted or largely offset costs we'd otherwise incur in the future. Let me now move to the balance sheet. With our cash flow and earnings close to inflection, we've begun to reduce our debt levels and chip away at our $4 million daily interest burden. In the March quarter, we set in motion our first phase of debt reduction. Using $3 billion of our liquidity, we are paying down debt, funding our pension and acquiring aircraft in the June quarter with cash. Combined, these initiatives drive $240 million of annualized savings and free up $2 billion of lending capacity. On April 1, we contributed $1 billion to the pension. This accelerated contribution, along with strong returns produced by our pension team, position the funds to be more than 95% funded by year-end under the Pension Protection Act that determines cash funding obligations. On a GAAP basis, we expect to be more than 85% funded by year end. We are now assessing an additional contribution of up to $1 billion to achieve fully funded PPA status by year end. It is really exciting to see our long-term pension vision crystallize. The combination of contributions and strong returns over time, now position us where we expect no material contributions to the plan beyond 2021, freeing up an average of more than $1 billion annually of our cash flow. Adjusted net debt is expected to be $19 billion to $19.5 billion in the June quarter as we draw down liquidity to fund the pension plans and pay cash for aircraft deliveries in the June quarter. We expect normal amortization of debt, including the $600 million unsecured maturity in April, to be approximately $850 million in the June quarter. We're also working on a longer term vision to restore and improve upon the strong financial position we enjoyed pre-COVID. Our financial foundation has greatly helped us to weather this crisis, while investing in our future and avoiding dilution for our owners. In closing, I am proud of what the Delta team has accomplished over the last year. The Delta Difference that Ed mentioned has never been more important, nor has it been more pronounced, thanks to all 75,000 of you for protecting each other, our customers and our future. We have exciting opportunities ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Julie to begin the Q&A. Yes, well, Brandon, we're not going to comment on where we'll be by the end of the year. What we've been very clear about as long-term goal was that we want to be back to an investment-grade quality balance sheet. If you think about it, simplistically, our net debt is up about $8.5 billion since the end of 2019. So, one easy way to think about what we need to do is get that back down to the $10 billion range. In terms of near-term priorities, you noted one we did make beyond the quarter -- on April 1st - we made a $1 billion contribution to the plan. We've discussed in here the potential for up to another $1 billion to achieve that fully funded PPA status. The other things that you should expect to see from us would be we're going to continue to pay cash for our aircraft, which not only prevents us from incurring debt, but it obviously builds our unencumbered collateral base. And then we have ongoing debt maturity. So, in this quarter alone, in fact, on Monday, we will pay a $600 million unsecured maturity. Over the course of the rest of the quarter, we'll have another roughly $250 million of regularly scheduled amortization, and another $400 million of that across the second half. So, you'll continue to see those debt levels work down for all of those reasons. Well, we've looked at this a number of different ways. We're thinking about it on an interim basis. We've looked at it a number of ways and they're all kind of pointing to the same zip code. So, we've sketched out about a $10 billion to $12 billion interim floor for liquidity that we want to see. I think it's important to note though, that we don't have that thought process in isolation and I'll just repeat one of the things that you see us very deliberately doing is consciously building the unencumbered collateral base as we go. So, in addition to thinking about where we want to be with liquidity, our mind is also on continuing to build that unencumbered asset base so that we've got the flexibility. Jamie, I think I'll answer it this way; there are a number of factors that we put into the thought process about liquidity. It is safe to say that that was one of the stress points that we consider. It's wrapped into the analysis I was describing that has us kind of landing in that $10 billion to $12 billion zone. Yes, well, as we said, about half of the 12% improvement that you saw in the quarter versus 2019, is really structural change driven by the fleet renewal that we've been talking about. So, you can think of the remainder as conditional on where we are on the system. We did say, however, that as we look into the second quarter, we expect at least a 10% improvement on where we were for the same metric in 2019. So, do expect continued fuel efficiency certainly through the June quarter of significance. Yes, and Mike on the first part of your question, the $1.85 to $1.95, it does contemplate a loss at the refinery. It's not as substantial as what we experienced in the first quarter. The fuel curve that we're using is generally what you see out there, crude in the low $60s and cracks in the $5 to $6 range. Katie, that's the number that we expect to hit this year. And I would say I'm really pleased with where we are, I mean, we are on the trajectory. The 6% to 9%, as I mentioned that we're achieving in the second quarter, I mentioned the four points of rebuild that are included in there. But you heard Glen talk about some of the international flying that we're not doing now. Our international mix is down quite a bit. In particular, we're not flying a lot of the long haul international network yet. If you look like-for-like in what you're seeing in the second quarter, that's also about a five point headwind. So, kudos to the team here, everybody has really embraced it. And they've just done a great job. The whole company really has come together around it. As I mentioned, in 2020, it was really about aggressively attacking the cost base, we understand the mission this year is really getting that incremental leverage as the network rebuilds. And you're really seeing it in the second quarter, if you take a look at how the ASMs are coming on and the cost incurred to do that. It's really nice operating leverage. So, very happy with where we are and fully expect to be on that 2019 number by the time we hit the fourth quarter."

            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie. It's been a little over a year since the onset of the pandemic and our customers are gaining confidence in air travel and beginning to reclaim their lives. Reflecting on what it's been in a year like no other, I'm tremendously proud of the progress that we've made and the agility that we've demonstrated. I developed an even deeper appreciation for Delta's strength, and firmly believe that the pandemic has served as a catalyst for us to find new and better ways to serve our customers and our communities. Thanks to the incredible dedication and sacrifices of our people, Delta has weathered the storm with our culture, our brand, and our values stronger than ever before. And I want to thank every member of the Delta family for your incredible efforts over the past year. Collectively, you've carried us through and shown that unique spirit that we call the Delta Difference. I also want to thank the administration and Congress for continued payroll support, which has protected thousands of airline jobs throughout the industry, and will help speed the U.S. economy in the recovery. Thanks to that support, we've been able to return our people to full work schedules, despite running an operation that will be at 65% to 70% of 2019 levels in the June quarter. The first quarter had two distinct periods, with the first half feeling very much like an extension of 2020. This demand was slower than expected. But as case counts decline and vaccinations accelerated demand picked up meaningfully later in the quarter, allowing us to achieve $4 million of daily positive cash generation in the month of March, the first positive cash generation since the onset of COVID-19. This marks a critical milestone in the path to restoring our financials. It is truly a great accomplishment, especially considering that our middle seat block limited the inventory that we're selling in business and international travel remain muted. It's also important to note that this metric takes into account all expenses that we're incurring as we rebuild our business. [Indiscernible] turned a true net positive cash flow position within a year of the biggest crisis ever seen in the history of this industry, is a real testament to the resilience of the company that we have built. Consumer confidence in air travel continues to increase with the pace of vaccinations in the U.S. rapidly accelerating, and predictions of herd immunity as soon as the summer. We said throughout the pandemic that one of the most important objectives was to restore confidence in air travel. We are now seeing more normal booking behavior as customers make plans for spring and summer travel. In fact, our daily net cash sales in March were twice what they were in January. As volumes grow, keeping our employees and customers safe and healthy will always be our top priority. We've taken a science-based approach to cleanliness, and are being guided by our own Chief Health Officer, Dr. Henry Ting, as well as by medical experts at the Mayo Clinic in Emory. And earlier this month, the CDC confirmed that it is safe to travel within the U.S. for those who have been fully vaccinated, an important step forward for the recovery of our industry. We are aligning with the recommendations of health professionals and government officials who continue to ensure the safe and effective distribution of vaccines and listening to our customers. Based on our survey work, 75% of our customers expect to be vaccinated by Memorial Day. With improving demand and vaccine trends, we announced that we'll start selling middle seats May the 1st, providing a powerful tool for improving our financial performance. We also launched other customer experience and loyalty enhancements to increase confidence in travel and maintain the trust and loyalty that we've built over the last 12 months. Looking ahead and assuming that these recovery trends holds, we expect to cut our pretax loss by more than half in the June quarter to between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, and we see a path to returning to profitability in the September quarter. Delta's resilience has helped us navigate the worst days of the pandemic driven by the competitive advantages that are core to our DNA. Those advantages our people, our brand and loyalty program, our reliable operations, our network, and our balance sheet will be even more important as we accelerate through the phases of recovery. These modes were tested like never before, and I'm proud of the resilience that they've demonstrated. Our people and our culture of service remain our most strategic asset. Loyalty to the Delta brand has never been stronger. Thanks to the outstanding service that our people provide. They are truly the best professionals in the business. This is evident in our domestic customer Net Promoter Scores, which have been in the low 70s throughout the pandemic, a full 20 point increase over 2019. We've also seen our customers continue to invest in the Delta brand using their American Express co-brand cards, demonstrating the resiliency of this unique revenue stream. Despite a large reduction in T&E categories, March co-brands spend on the card overall was up relative to March 2019 levels. Our operational performance remained strong. During the quarter we led the industry in all on-time metrics including A0, D0, and completion factor, which was more than 99%. And our network rebuild leverages the strength of our core hub structure in our international partner gateways. Same time, we are renewing and simplifying our fleet, improving the customer experience driving efficiency, and reducing emissions as we push toward our carbon neutral goals. And finally, the strength of our balance sheet enabled us to manage through the worst crisis in our history with no dilution to our shareholders other than warrants related to the Payroll Support Program, is something that continues to set us apart in the industry. We've begun our journey of de-levering, and by the end of the June quarter, we will have reduced financial obligations by nearly $10 billion through a combination of paying down debt and accelerating pension funding since last fall. This reflects an unprecedented turnaround in the health of our pensions over the last decade, securing the future of our retirees. Later this year, we expect to make one final contribution to the plan of up to $1 billion, which should enable our pension to reach fully funded PPA status by the end of this year, largely mitigating the need for any additional cash contributions going forward. And finally, as we look toward the future, it's important to acknowledge that the commitment we made last year to achieving carbon neutrality is as strong as ever. The only future for Delta and our industry is a sustainable future. This is why we're accelerating our fleet renewal and balancing near-term needs for verifiable offsets with long-term investments in sustainable aviation fuels, carbon sequestration advancements, and clean propulsion technology. And because we can't do this alone, we are collaborating with corporate customers as well as large energy producers in order to address aviation emissions together and work to scale up sustainable aviation fuels. We're excited about the progress that we're making to combat climate change, and enable a cleaner, more sustainable world. These steps are vital to Delta's long-term future, and we owe it to the next generation of customers and employees to continue down this path. The time for action not talk is now and I'm proud of the steps our team is taking. As the recovery takes hold, glimmers of hope are now optimism for the future. Demand for air travel is accelerating in a meaningful way and we are well-positioned to build a stronger Delta, as demand recovers to pre-pandemic levels in the next few years. With our competitive advantages having been fully tested, we have built the platform to extend Delta's leadership position in the years to come. More than ever, I am confident in the future of Delta and our people. Over the last year, we've taken meaningful actions to become a better, more sustainable, more inclusive company, driven by our mission to connect the world. And with that, I'll turn it over to Glen. Hi Duane. I think the issue you talk about in the broader hospitality sector is an issue -- I don't think it's an issue for the airlines, but I know the hotels, rental car providers that you say are having a difficult time getting staff back, given the level of unemployment and other stimulus that's been provided into the general economy, we're not experiencing that issue at all here at Delta. Our people have been at work throughout the entire the entire time. I'd say the biggest bottleneck -- two bottlenecks that we face, which I feel very good about where we're at, is clearly getting our pilot training and our pilots into the right categories and ready to fly. And secondly, maintenance, making certain that we got our aircraft and our engines and all the work ready for a pretty quick rebound. It's a -- we had some cancellations on Easter Sunday, a couple of weeks ago, about 100 in the business and we've noticed -- it's been a trend on some of the holiday weekends, but for the last few holidays, certainly President's Day and Easter, not nearly the challenges that we experienced earlier in Thanksgiving and Christmas and it's because our businesses is dealing with the tension between making sure that we've got as many costs out and saved and people on whether it's voluntary leave or some other alternative plan and being ready to respond to demand as it comes back. I feel pretty good about where we sit for the common spring and summer. We spent an awful lot of time understanding that. You also need to appreciate that in certain parts of the country, the virus is growing at a faster rate than others. We've had vaccinations moving and that's impacted a little bit on the pilot availability because pilots need to sit for a couple of days once they -- every time they get a shot. But all-in, I think our team is well-positioned and ready for the rebound that we see coming this summer. Well, the biggest flex lever we have is the middle seat, which comes available May the 1st and you're going to see a significant capacity bump from April to May because of the seat. So, we're not anticipating a significant amount of schedule -- additional schedule requirements. Probably the biggest question mark we have is the international space and we're working closely with the international authorities to be ready to fly when they enable travel, particularly in the transatlantic markets, but I'm not contemplating us having a big challenge getting seats in the market for June. Hi, Jamie. Obviously, there's still a ways to go between here and there to get to the third quarter. Clearly, the number one dependency is the vaccination rate and getting to herd immunity in our country. And all the experts we talked to, including our own doctors tell us that early summer, is when we should expect our country to be in some form of early herd immunity and that will continue to inspire additional travel. Yes, we're working on reopening international corridors. I think the one that is most likely to be open for the third quarter, hopefully, is the U.S.-U.K. travel corridor and we're spending a lot of time with the authorities both here in the U.S. as well as the U.K. so what's going to be required to get that done and hopefully early summer, that we'll see the corridor open, which will then bring some pressure I'm sure on other markets to follow similar suits and protocols. The middle seat opening is another huge leverage point. The fact that we've been carrying such a significant amount of our capacity deliberately not selling it's going to be a big add on there. So, when you think about all these factors, you need to think about the additional scale that we have from better utilizing our fleet. Our fleet is still somewhat probably 10% to 15% underutilized as we're operating it today. These are the types of things we look at to give us some real optimism that there's a pathway to get into profitability this summer. Look forward to it Jamie. Sure Helane. As I mentioned, in my opening comments, sustainability is a real issue for us for our business and it's a problem now, and it can't wait till later to be addressed. We're doing as we've committed to invest and verified carbon offsets with the highest certification, which are the really the only real solution in the marketplace right now. And we appreciate -- there's a lot of concerns about efficacies and we are concerned also, and that's why we're so specific in terms of what we're investing in. But there is real evidence, they have a clear impact and we can't wait for those longer term investments to start paying off to reduce the footprint in the meantime. We're working with a lot of providers, whether it's in the energy arena or other technology providers, seeking solutions to de-carbonize our operations and our footprint. We've committed $1 billion over this decade towards investments along these lines. And as you see this become a increased importance to the current administration, their priorities. We're hopefully going to get some support from our government, particularly in the area of sustainable aviation fuels, which is critical. We don't have as an industry have a clear roadmap to net carbon zero by 2040 at the present time, but it's important that we have the mindset that we're going to do what it takes to continue to invest in a better future for all. Well, we're excited about the -- sure Helane. We're excited about the MRO and its future and you're right in 2020, there was a dip in volumes as airlines pulled back, not just flying levels, but retired on a global basis some of the older fleets. But our MRO revenues are not down nearly in line with what were flying levels have come down to. And as we look to the pipeline of opportunities, there's still a pretty good backlog to dip into. So, team's doing a great job over there, first and foremost, taking care of the Delta fleet, but looking for opportunities to expand going forward and I think as your earlier question that Duane answered -- or asked around pipeline of blockages or obstacles to getting our businesses back. The MRO is going to be key for us not just helping Delta, but also helping some other airlines around the world, get their businesses back up and running as quickly as they can. I'm sorry, Hunter, you said with the liquidity -- let me rephrase it, with liquidity we have, will we be participating in PSP 3, is that your fundamental question? We don't anticipate turning that down, though. To add to Glen's points, we did update the corporate survey that we commented upon last quarter and the numbers continue to look favorable. 36% of -- and this is -- many of our large corporations participated 36% expect to be fully back travel to pre-COVID levels by 2022, and another 16% by 2023. So, 52% say they're anticipating get back to full levels. Only 8% of the corporations that we survey say that we'll never get back to pre-COVID levels. And there's 40% that that are unclear as to what level of additional flying that we -- that they anticipate. So, if you take a fairly conservative view on the 40% uncertain and 8% that never get fully back and say that only 50% of that returns, then we're looking at 75% to 80% of our corporate revenues coming back over the course of the next couple years, which I continue to think is conservative, and we're working hard as people feel confident getting back out into the sky to get that business volume back to where it was. No, I think there's really two things that we would talk about and they are different scenarios. One is internationally coming out of the pandemic; I think we see a vastly improved competitive scenario with a lot of the ultra-low cost or low cost players in each region coming out of this much weaker or gone. And so as we see Europe come back, as we see Latin and the Pacific come back, I think we're going to see a much improved environment for many years ahead of us. And domestically, I think you characterize it quite well as people are traveling differently than they were pre-pandemic and while we are back at 85% of demand, that 85% is going different places than it was pre-pandemic. So, you see a lot more capacity from the industry in places that people are interested, basically, the less, the wide open spaces, the Florida markets, the Latin leisure markets. And so we've put our capacity where people want to fly and I think that's where we'll continue to focus and I see -- ultimately, I can't tell you what our competitors are going to do with capacity, but I think we feel really comfortable about how the U.S. arena is developing. Ravi, I wish I had a crystal ball that was clear to know with some degree of confidence. Certainly, there's enormous pent up demand. Consumers have built up a lot of wealth over the pandemic, people have really lost the connection that they look to recreate and get back together, whether that's for leisure, purpose, or business. And I think over the course of the next 12 to 18 months, we're going to see a strong surge as markets reopen for different categories as well as different borders. Looking out into the next couple years, does that mean we'll be beyond 2019? I think it's possible. We have flex in our fleet, in our order book to address that. We're not going to be limited. If there's demand out there, we're going to be positioned to be able to service. Sure Andrew. No, it doesn't surprise me at all. And it's primarily because of the government support that the U.S/ airlines have received in terms of PSP. When you think about the significant levels of support and ensuring that that support goes to retaining employment across the industry as a national priority, there really isn't a lot of change structural. You use that money to try to get your business back up, which was what they were intended to do. Certainly on an international level, we're seeing a lot of change. There's been a lot of international restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations, changes, which I don't think we really fully appreciate the full extent of that. It's going to take some time yet to play out. I think it'll help and benefit the U.S. industry because we're going to be competitively stronger than in the international landscape than we were previously. So, we'll see how that plays out. Maybe I'll take a stab at that is -- and give you a little bit of a forward look is we have clearly in the month of May, we're calling May a transition month because we are putting the middle seats back in which gives us a substantial increase in our capacity levels. And we're expecting that May will come in with an absolute load factor of 75%. As we get into June, and the more peak travel season, and with those seats being absorbed into the marketplace, we believe that we will move from the 70s into the mid 80s, that gives us a little bit of an opportunity to start to manage yield a little bit more than we have in the past. And so structurally, we think we're in a pretty good space in terms of the structure of leisure travel and fares being within the range of where we were in 2019. And so as we head into the summer, we believe that the real pressure on domestic yields will come primarily from the lack of business travel, not from the structure themselves or not for leisure travelers paying significantly less than they did in 2019. Does that help answer your question? Well, remember, the way the yield curve works is we're always saving for the last minute business traveler, who's -- there are not that many of them out there this year, they're substantially less than they were for 2019. So, you won't see I think the full impact of yield management flow into the revenue equation until a little bit later, probably early fall. So, summer is going to be about managing leisure demand and there's a little less opportunity in terms of saving that last seat for the business customer. So, as we move through the year, I think we're going to get say September-October to really be in a much better position to manage yield through the traditional RM systems. Thanks, Katie. We certainly have in the very near-term for this coming summer limitations to how much demand we can we can serve and its decisions that are taken six to 12 months in advance in terms of getting pilots into the right categories. That said, with a significant amount of capacity we're adding through the middle seats being returned to service, I don't think it's going to be a substantial impact on our ability to serve the demand that we see out there. Katie, one other thing I'd like to add to the point. People probably don't appreciate the fact that for the last couple of quarters, Delta has actually been flying the most scheduled service of anyone out there. So, when people worry whether we were going to have the capacity and the seats in the market to fill it, we're flying more scheduled servers, because we're blocking so many of the seats on the individual airplanes. As we open that inventory up, we're going to be raised with anybody in terms of being able to provide service and strength into some of our key hubs and markets domestically. So, we're not we're not concerned in the short-term that we're going to be short aircraft or short staffed. Well, on the reopening of international borders, I think there's still more -- many more questions that are answers. We are focused on trying to get the U.S.-U.K. travel corridor open. I think that's the most logical and has the greatest value to us. And I think those are the markets where we'll start to see demand grow quickly when we can get that open and we're working with our partners at Virgin from the U.K. standpoint, as well as across not just the airline industry, but within the broader travel and hospitality sector too, figure out how we can get it open for summer. And we're making progress in that regard. When you think about other parts of Europe, there may be some occasional markets open this summer based on Southern Mediterranean leisure traffic that people will be interested in, but I don't I don't think you're going to see Continental Europe open in any meaningful way till later in the year. We'll probably unfortunately miss much of the summer for most of Continental Europe. On the other end extreme, I think Asia is going to be the long pole in the tent. I think that could take a year or more to start travel back up at scale. When you think about China, and Japan and many of the other Pacific markets, the one market that we will be spending a lot of time trying to support is Korea, with our partner at Korean. And South America is going to be somewhere in the middle. It's really going to be based on the success they have in trying to get the virus under containment in their countries, which we all know right now is a very difficult spot that they sit in. So, that's probably late this year, into the winter when you start to see South America open up. I think we're really focused on the unit revenues. And I think we outline the progression and of course, there's a yield traffic trade off that we're always monitoring. But when you think about getting 20 to 25 points of unit revenues sequentially between the end of March and June, that's a huge improvement and one that I think is indicative of what we'd be looking at for summer travel. And I outlined earlier we think that the traffic will be in the mid-80s for peak summer domestic, and that presents opportunity to manage yield. Hey, Joe its Ed. As you probably have seen or read the NMA is not being actively discussed at Boeing at the present time, but they certainly do have alternatives and new designs that they're thinking about, and we're engaged with those conversations. Nothing imminent, or on the short horizon here, but we are looking at the longer term opportunities with our friends in Seattle. So, clearly, the co-branded cards are an array of purpose, including a lot of small and medium sized enterprises, where we're seeing a lot of success with the cards right now. And so I think, we feel very, very confident that we can get to the $7 billion and clearly the crisis has put a little delay on that. And we're sizing up how significant that delay is and how we can shorten that delay by new and innovative programs to stimulate demand for the card. And I think we feel confident coming out of this that the card performed at or above our expectations of how it would do in a scenario -- a recessionary scenario. And so we think a very bright future for that card. That's an interesting question Myles and certainly, we've depended upon the support from our government here to be able to sustain an essential service for our economy. I don't know what that means, in terms of long-term. Clearly, the Middle Eastern subsidies were not there as a support tool for essential service, they were there to grow their economies and grow their businesses. So, I think fundamentally, the nature of the intervention, not just in the U.S., but around the world that we've seen over the last year, is of a very different character. And we'll see on the other end of this where the international market slant and the level of subsidies that that continues. So, yes, we've been appreciative of that. But no, I don't think it changes the character of what our issues were in the past. I think Leslie; we mentioned that in the cost guidance for the second quarter the rebuild, the maintenance, and as well as some training is probably in a three to four point range of the 6% to 9% growth that we're seeing over 2019 levels. So, it's a meaningful amount that we're investing to get the business back. We've not made a decision yet with respect to hiring, but I do anticipate if we see the recovery, continue to gain strength that before the end of the year, we could very well be in the market for both pilot and flight attendant hiring again. We haven't encountered that yet. So, we've been able to fly schedules that we wanted to fly to all those leisure destinations. No, we have very, very strong performance from our core hubs in our coastal gateways. So, we're going to stay focused on them. No, we're not considering that. And we're very excited about the value we're bringing to customers and grow our program. And we've actually used the program to stimulate a lot of demand with really some very attractive offers that we've had in market across the U.S. And hopefully, our frequent flyers are enjoying the benefits associated with those track offers. Well, if you think about it, unfortunately, there weren't very many people traveling on the airline, which is the vast majority of issue. And on the credit card side, clearly that had a much more sustained. So, we don't feel that there's a huge imbalance coming out of the pandemics, but the difference between what points have been accrued versus what we anticipate being able to supply in the marketplace. And we're pretty excited about people returning to use their points. Well, certainly what we've seen is when customers can travel internationally, they are willing to and excited about it. And I think when you think about the places that you can go today, whether or not it's the Caribbean or the Latin, we have said that there's more than 100% of the demand restored to those places. So, we're over-indexing already versus where we were in 2019. So, as those open, we will be able to supply and as you think about it, there's still a significant number of our places that will be closed. So, if the U.K. were to open, we'd be able to satisfy as many seats as people needed to fill the demand. I think we're excited about that and we'll see how it goes. But the one thing I would have a takeaway is Americans want to travel and they want to travel abroad. So, we're spending a considerable amount of time building an open source platform, because as you probably know, there's a lot of different marketing technologies for Digital Health credentials, which I think is probably the more appropriate right versus passport, which gains a lot of negativity, calling them passports. The challenge we face is every government around the world is looking at their questions uniquely, and we need to start looking collectively at answers. So that'll be important, for example, as we reopen the U.S.-U.K. border as to what technology will be available to actually evidence vaccination, if indeed the regulator's even require a vaccination. It's not clear that that's been -- that's even be requirement. So, we're working to try to keep as open a framework as possible, working with health providers, technology providers, and our customers to ensure that when they need to show that they've been vaccinated or have been tested, they can do it in as efficient manner as possible. No, we haven't seen any significant impact from the different discussions that have been going on in Georgia. Well, it fits in as it always has, it's an offset to our exposure to jet cracks. And that's one of the things that we are saying. We had some questions about impact at the refinery, and one of the primary drivers of that -- there are two. But the first primary driver is just the fact that jet cracks right now are very low. I mentioned they were in the $5 to $6 range. We've seen them historically in $15 to $20 range. The other contributor to the near-term performance has just been a huge escalation in the cost of rents, which have gone towards the end of the fourth quarter, they were in the $0.60 to $0.70 range and they're, they're well north of $1 now. That's a market dislocation that we just don't see as sustainable. I think it's safe to say we're always evaluating all our options. What we're not going to do, though, is let some of these short-term dislocations guide our actions. This is an asset that has contributed a lot to the company over the last in the time that we've owned it, which is the better part of the last decade. We've got a world-class team, they're operating it, they're operating it efficiently. They're operating it cost effectively. And as I mentioned, it is serving the purpose that we've always had for it, which is an offset to the crack exposure that we have. So, I'd like to thank you all for your participation and joining us this morning. As we sum up the call, it's clear that at Delta, we've reached an important inflection point, as we navigate the pandemic and move into the recovery phase of 2021. As the pace of vaccinations accelerate, our customers are reclaiming their lives. Air travel will be central as people reconnect with loved ones and business colleagues, replacing their screens with real human touch points as they venture out of their homes, and communities to experience the world again. Looking forward, with customer demand steadily rising, there is a lot of runway ahead of us. As we open our middle seats to booking and corporate and international begin to recover in earnest. And once the recovery of those segments are underway, we expect they'll prove to be a powerful cash and profitability lever to get our business back to where we needed to be. The strength of our balance sheet has been critical and I'm excited that we're shifting our focus to delivering, which will also be an important accelerator in our recovery. But with all of this, I have great confidence that Delta is well-positioned to lead the industry in the months and years ahead. I thank all of the people at Delta for your tremendous job, particularly over these last 12 months in positioning us for success. And we look forward to welcoming all of you back aboard our flights in the days and months to come. Thank you all."

            "name": "Glen Hauenstein",
            "content": "Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. As Ed mentioned the pace of demand recovery accelerated over the course of the quarter. With growing confidence, customers are now buying tickets for travel further out speeding our cash recovery. In the month of March, daily new bookings improved 50% from the January and February average, well ahead of its normal seasonality. As customers are now buying tickets for travel further out, our booking curve has extended and our air traffic liability has grown for the first time in three quarters up more than 800 million from December. On our January call, I outlined three distinct phases to the year and our levers for each. To progress to the second phase, we need to see higher vaccination rates, easing travel advisories, and growing consumer confidence, all of which are now evident in the United States today. Approximately 50% of the adult population in the U.S. have never received at least one dose of the vaccine. And by May, all states will have lifted mandatory domestic quarantine restrictions. Pent-up demand is also evident with domestic leisure bookings 85% recovered to 2019 levels and Latin leisure markets more than fully restored. Beyond our own bookings, we see encouraging data points in the broader economy. This includes accumulated savings, restaurant dining, credit card spend, hotel occupancy rates, web search data on travel, and corporations announcing more concrete office reopening plans. In response to these developments and the reduction of COVID-19 cases, as well as accelerating vaccination rates, we will sunset our middle seat block as of May 1st. That provides us with a very powerful lever to add capacity in a cost efficient way and generate meaningful margin tailwind. Removing our middle seat block results in our sellable capacity increasing from 46% of 2019 levels for the month of April to 67% of 2019 levels for the month of June. And with this increase coinciding with strong customer demand for our product, we expect our passenger unit revenue to improve by 20 to 25 points over that period. With this added capacity and a continuation of the leisure recovery heading into peak season. We expect our June quarter revenues to improve by approximately $2 billion from the March quarter. The corporate travel recovery has been slow but steady. Corporate volumes in March were nearly 20% recovered, up from 15% at the end of 2020. Small and medium enterprises continue to outperform other corporates by about five points. And given our investments and the customer experience, we've been able to grow our domestic corporate share lead which is now significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. To progress to the next leg of the recovery, we need corporate travel to return in earnest. While we expect continued improvements to business travel through the summer, we anticipate the significant increases will occur after Labor Day as we enter the more traditional business travel season. That will happen as vaccinations become even more widespread and offices continue to reopen. We continue to expect operational and sales related traveled to lead with travel to large conferences and internal meetings likely the last recover. Our views on corporate demand recovery are consistent with what we've heard in our most recent quarterly corporate survey, where one-third of our accounts expect to increase travel volume in the June quarter, and a majority of our corporate customers expect to return to office in the second half of the year. Vaccine distribution and lifting of government travel restrictions remain the top two drivers of corporate willingness to travel. International travel remains muted with long haul international bookings volumes at only 15% to 25% recovered. We're seeing some early signs of life in Europe with Iceland opening to travel to vaccinated U.S. citizens and increased demand for Israel and leisure destinations this fall. That said Europe lags the U.S. and Pacific is expected to be the last region to recover. We do not anticipate meaningful international demand improvement until later in the year when borders reopen. Once the recovery of those segments are underway, we'll expect they also proved to be a powerful cash and profitability lever for our business. Considering our operating leverage improvements in those segments will be cost effective and highly margin accretive, a dynamic that is very similar to what we expect from lifting our middle seat blocks and one that I am very enthusiastic about. In the meantime, we'll continue to benefit from the strengthening demand environment in the domestic and short haul Latin regions and from our non-ticket revenue streams which have proven more resilient. Our cargo revenues in the March quarter improved 5% sequentially and we're up 12% versus the March quarter of 2019. The performance of our loyalty is indicative of Delta's strong brand affinity and our customer aspirations to return to travel. As Ed mentioned co-brand spin in the month of March was higher than 2019 levels. This was a result of solid growth in non-T&E spend and continued momentum in T&E, which is now down 35% in March from down approximately 55% in November -- in December I'm sorry. Card acquisitions are also rebounding nicely and our attrition rates are below pre-pandemic levels. For the Month of March, co-brand acquisitions were over 60% recovered with less than half of our customer base blind. Our long-term partnership with American Express combines two strong consumer brands enhancing customer loyalty, while also providing a high margin revenue stream that has proven its resiliency. We have driven stronger engagement through our digital channels resulting in more direct relationships with our customers and record high digital satisfaction scores. Over the last year, we've created a more flexible and enhanced experience for our direct channels, increasing self service and making it easier for our customers to do business with Delta. Digital adoption is on the rise and direct channels like delta.com and the Fly Delta app account for 66% of our sales in the March quarter, up 15 points from 2019. While we expect that will normalize especially as corporate travel recovers, direct channels will continue to be preferred, particularly among medallions and young customers. As we restore our business, we're rebuilding our industry leading network with a simpler, younger, and more fuel efficient fleet. At the same time, we have preserved optionality with levers to flex our capacity restoration in either direction depending on the shape of the recovery. We are also capitalizing on the industry's best domestic hub structure with the highest return profile. The combination of our strong core hubs and coastal positions provides us with the unique opportunity to leverage cost efficient gauge with large narrow body aircraft, providing meaningful efficiency and scale advantages. In addition, we now see the opportunity to significantly improve our international returns from pre-pandemic levels, driven by an improved competitive position, a stronger cargo business, the acceleration of our fleet renewal, stronger partnerships, and an improved product offering. Reflecting on what has been the most difficult 12 months in the company's history, I could not be prouder of what our teams have accomplished. So, I want to thank them for their commitment and continue to put the customer in the center of what we do every day Looking forward, I'm optimistic about Delta's bright future. We have a powerful brand loyalty program that's proven their resiliency; we continue to improve our customer experience both in the air and on the ground as we've accelerated our robust array of airport projects. Our focus on health and flexibility has won the confidence of our travelers and we're being well served by our younger, more eco-friendly fleet, and leaner cost structure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary. Yes, I think we're looking at what we have today and building it back up again. And we don't know the outcome or when, but we do see is that slow and steady build. And we think as we get to the end of the summer, as we said in the script as the vaccination rates continue to improve, and officers continue to return that we will see an acceleration as we head into the fall. And I think still unknown where we'll wind up this year and where we'll wind up in summer of 2022. And that's I think we're going to work on the flexibility of our fleet to flex up or down depending on what we see in the market at different points in time. I think one of the things we're excited about as we come out of this pandemic is the strength of our international partners, as I mentioned earlier, is, international is taken much more of a reshape than domestic given the fact that a lot of international carriers didn't receive government support through the pandemic and are going to either be much smaller or not be there as the pandemic way eases off. And so we are very encouraged about continuing to leverage our partner hubs as the first wave of pre-pandemic international travel comes back. And that's really what we've done so far. And I think, yes, there will be opportunities for us to reshape our domestic to better feed our internationals coming out of this than we had going in. But we'll deal with that as it occurs as opposed to anticipating. Well, through the pandemic, looking curve it compressed and starting about middle of last month, for the first time ever, we saw advanced bookings outside of the 60-day window is actually surpassing the percentage of bookings that were in that category in 2019. So, hopefully I can give you some context that people are feeling much more comfortable booking further out in the curve. And I think we're looking at several things. One is I think in the U.S., they're feeling much more comfortable in domestic flying, knowing they'll get their shots, knowing they'll be able to travel, still waiting for more and more events to open and places to open and kind of one of the things that continues to accelerate the domestic demand and then really waiting for the internationals to reopen in earnest. I think people are now looking at it, the fall and making some speculative bookings that Europe will be open in the fall. There are not a great number of those out there yet, but certainly, there's interest out there. And I do believe that in the next month or two, we'll see at least some of the European countries attempting to reopen, and that will hopefully put pressure on the others to figure out ways to reopen their markets. Yes, we've looked at that. And I think maybe for the month of March in particular and clearly as we got to the end of -- or as the traffic continued to rise again -- and confidence returned, it got to be a more expensive proposition. So, for the month of March, it was probably between $100 billion and $150 million of gross revenue that we left on the table not blocking the middle seat, but really ensuring that demand came back and ensuring that our brand came out of this very strong. And I think had we the choice to do it over again, we would do it in a heartbeat because I think it's something that really set Delta apart through this pandemic is putting consumer confidence and the confidence in health and safety first, was a very important part of how we've invested in our brand through this pandemic. So, I think that's when we see this real competence returning in the April-May time period that was also one of our big cues to say it is time to let it go away. Well, clearly, the big step up is from April to May as the seats get released. And then June is just sequentially better. So, more of a traditional seasonality, moving from May to June, and really it's about the capacity absorption of that middle seat, is this story of the second quarter. Clearly, in the first few weeks of data, it will -- people have to leave to come back. So, there'll be some imbalances. And so we see the first two weeks of May being a little bit later and then the second two weeks as you get into Memorial Day and that more traditional peak leisure period, which should be much stronger."

Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Earlier Delta reported our full year results including our December quarter earnings per share of $1.48 on record revenue that was 8% above 2019 levels. We generated a 12% operating margin, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit operating margins pointing to the strength of our recovery. I want to sincerely thank the 90,000 strong Delta team for their outstanding work in delivering these results and serving our customers during a very busy holiday travel season. In my opinion, 2022 was the most difficult operational year in our history and was capped off by severe winter storms over the holidays. I am grateful to our employees for their great work to recover the operation, while keeping our customers and each other safe. They are the reason our brand and customer loyalty is at the top of the industry. Our December quarter earnings per share and margins exceeded guidance, marking a strong close to a year where we made significant progress regarding restoration of our financial foundation. For the full year, we reported earnings of $3.20 per share on $46 billion of revenue. We delivered pre-tax income of $2.7 billion, an improvement of more than $6 billion over 2021. Delta\u2019s profitability led the industry and in our nearly 100-year history, 2022 was our seventh highest result even with a $1 billion loss in the first quarter. We are pleased to report positive free cash flow for the year, which funded $6 billion of capital invested back into the business and we repaid close to $5 billion in gross debt. Sharing our success is a longstanding pillar of Delta\u2019s culture and I am proud to announce that we will be paying our employees $550 million in well-earned profit sharing coming Valentine\u2019s Day. 2022 came in ahead of our plan on revenue, earnings and cash flow, demonstrating strong execution in the first year of the three-year plan we laid out at the 2021 Capital Markets Day. I am incredibly proud of the team for rebuilding the world\u2019s best performing airline, and importantly, we are not just building back, we are continuing to improve and extend our competitive advantages. Delta\u2019s brand continued to strengthen in 2022, with record performance from our loyalty and co-brand card programs, and customer satisfaction scores consistently perform above pre-pandemic levels. Through the year, we have hired and trained 25,000 new employees, now representing over a quarter of the total company. Our team showed their operating talent and resilience as we retained our number one position in completion factor and on time arrivals amongst our peer set, despite having so many new team members. The Delta brand is centered on our safe, reliable and exceptional service, and our operational excellence was recognized by Cirium last week, which named us yet again the most on time airline in North America. We fortified our international partnerships in 2022, position -- positioning us for profitable international growth in the years ahead. As detailed last month, expanding our international margins to domestic levels is an important opportunity for Delta in the years to come. We have invested in the customer experience at every stage of the travel journey, from the continued refresh of our fleet with next-generation far more fuel efficient aircraft to generational airport rebuilds and technology investments that are providing our employees better tools and our customers a more seamless experience. And we continue to attract and partner with leading brands to grow our SkyMiles ecosystem and further enable customers to use their SkyMiles during travel and beyond. Heading into 2023, our momentum continues. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas just last week, we unveiled the next phase in our vision to connect the Sky. Starting February 1st, Delta will be the first major U.S. airline to provide fast, free, unlimited WiFi to all through its free SkyMiles account. This will be available on nearly 80% of our U.S. system to start and growing every week. By the end of next year, we expect to deliver this service seamlessly throughout the rest of our international and regional fleets. And we debuted Delta Sync, which will create personalized experiences and engagement opportunities on the free WiFi portal. We are partnering with great brands like T-Mobile and Paramount+, as well as building on our longstanding relationship with American Express to bring to life our vision of a more connected and personalized travel experience. As a trusted consumer brand, Delta continues to differentiate the premium flying experience, building loyalty and supporting our ambition to transcend the industry. Moving to our outlook, at our Investor event last month, we provided full year 2023 guidance for revenue growth of 15% to 20% year-over-year, earnings of $5 per share to $6 per share and free cash flow of over $2 billion. We are affirming that guidance today and introducing our March quarter outlook, which Glen and Dan will provide in detail. For the March quarter, we expect to deliver a 4% to 6% operating margin and improve our pre-tax income by more than $1 billion compared to the same period last year. Importantly, we are embedding the assumed impact of all labor cost increases throughout our guidance metrics. We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle with our pilots, but out of respect for the process, we will not be discussing the details of the agreement on today\u2019s call. As I outlined last month, I have never seen a more constructive backdrop for the industry. Demand remains strong as passengers return to the skies and industry returns to the long-term trend to GDP, all while supply constraints continue. I believe our industry will see tens of billions of dollars of incremental demand in the next few years coming out of the pandemic. As the industry leader with a proven strategy and strong execution track record, Delta is well positioned to build on our momentum in the New Year. We are confident in our ability to deliver significant improvement in earnings and free cash flow in 2023, consistent with the plan we laid out last month and we are on track to deliver our 2024 targets of more than $7 of earnings per share and $4 billion of free cash flow. As always, we remain mindful of the macroeconomic trends and have demonstrated that we have the tools to effectively manage a changing economic climate. In closing, Delta delivered in 2022, outperforming our plan and leading the industry operationally and financially. We are uniquely positioned to grow earnings and cash flow in 2023, 2024 and beyond. The power of our premium brand continues to grow, and with the very best people in the industry, I couldn\u2019t be more excited about what\u2019s ahead for Delta and our customers. Thank you again. With that, I will turn it over to Glen.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of what the Delta people accomplished throughout 2022 and I want to congratulate our teams on their much deserved profit sharing payout they will be receiving next month. For the full year, we generated revenue of $46 billion, a $19 billion improvement year-over-year. We delivered record December quarter and full year unit revenues, sustaining our revenue premium to the industry of more than 110%. For the 12th consecutive year, Delta was named the number one corporate airline in Business Travel News survey, as we continue to invest in our network and product offerings. And through the year, we made significant progress on our long-term commercial strategy to deepen our network advantages, expand premium revenues, grow our loyalty ecosystem and further diversify our revenues. Starting with our network strategy, we focused on solidifying our positions in coastal gateways, while protecting our core hub shares. We secured the leading positions in both Boston and Los Angeles, while increasing local market share in our core hubs. Premium let all year with paid load factors higher than 2019 and yield growth outpacing Main Cabin, while basic economy made up less than 5% of revenue, half of the 2019 levels. We expanded our Delta Premium Select rollout during the year. Customer response has been positive and the cabin performed better than our initial expectations. Our rollout continues in 2023 and we will have this product on 84% of our international wide-body fleet by this summer. Our loyalty program continued to exceed our expectations with record SkyMiles acquisitions in 2022, 42% higher than 2019. As Ed noted, we are partnering with leading companies to expand our loyalty ecosystem, increasing the value of our program for customers and deepening customer engagement with Delta. With an expanding ecosystem and free, fast WiFi, we expect continued growth in our loyalty base. Our partnership with American Express delivered record results, with full year remuneration of $5.5 billion, ahead of our initial target and positioning us to deliver over $6.5 billion in 2023 and over $7 billion in 2024. Cargo revenue was a record in 2022 and we expect to grow cargo revenues in 2023, as increased capacity offsets the cargo yield environment. With strong execution across our business lines, a record 55% of revenue was generated by premium products and diverse revenue streams. We are confident in our path to exceed 60% by 2024. While not without challenges, 2022 was a strong year for Delta and we exited the year with momentum. During the December quarter, we generated revenue of $12.3 billion, 8% higher than 2019 on 9% less capacity. We saw revenue recapture at the end of December that offset the impact of weather disruptions in our system around Christmas. Fourth quarter unit revenues were 19% higher than 2019, with strength driven by consumer demand throughout the quarter. Corporate travel demand was steady through the quarter, with corporate domestic sales 80% recovered to 2019 levels. We expect March quarter revenue to be up 14% to 17% higher versus 2019. On capacity approaching full restoration, we expect March quarter unit revenues will be up 15% to 17% compared to 2019, including a 2-point impact from higher stage. Based on how we are deploying our network, our stage length is expected to be up 5 points compared to 2019, resulting in a higher restoration of ASMs and seats. This is a temporary dynamic that is unique to Delta among major carriers. Stage will begin to normalize relative to 2019 and relative to the industry as we rebuild our core hubs later this year. For 2023, we expect to grow revenue 15% to 20% year-over-year as we fully restore our network and further diversify our revenue streams. Consumer demand remains healthy, with advanced bookings significantly ahead on both yield and load factor for each month of the March quarter compared to 2019. And in our recent corporate survey, results were positive with 96% of respondents expecting to travel as much or more in 1Q than 4Q led by financial services. In the New Year, bookings reflect the survey optimism and are accelerating. International revenue continues to be led by the transatlantic. We are seeing robust demand across our expanded footprint in Europe and expect the spring and summer to set new record revenues. Latin America is performing very well, led by Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America, with a recovery in Deep South America now accelerating. And we are pleased with the early results from the launch of the LATAM JV and I am excited about the opportunities for us in 2023 and beyond. In the Pacific, we expected record first quarter profits in both Australia and Korea as our multiyear international transformation delivers on anticipated results. Japan is also building momentum and we expect a very strong summer there. And lastly, with China, indicating its reopening, we expect to rebuild capacity in line with demand starting later this year. In closing, we delivered on our key commercial priorities in 2022, supporting a significant improvement in our revenue, while strengthening our competitive advantages. We have started the New Year with great momentum and are well positioned to extend our leadership position in the years ahead. And with that, I will turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials.\nDan Janki: Great. Thank you, Glen. In 2022 we made significant progress restoring our financial foundation. We delivered earnings of $3.20 per share, with pre-tax income of $2.7 billion, ahead of our plan. Operating margins of 7.8% was driven by three quarters of double-digit margins. We improved profitability and the strong advanced bookings. We generated $6.2 billion of operating cash flow, enabling continued investment in our people, our fleet, our partners and technology. After gross CapEx of $6 billion, we generated $244 million of free cash flow. We ended the year with liquidity of $9.4 billion and adjusted net debt of $22.3 billion. Our adjusted net debt to EBITDAR was 5 times and our after-tax return on invested capital was 8.4%. We finished the year strong, reporting a $1.4 billion operating profit on a margin of 11.6% for the December quarter. Our non-fuel costs were 13.4% higher than 2019, in line with guidance, excluding a 1-point impact from the severe winter weather in late December. Now moving to guidance, as Ed mentioned, we are including all expected labor rate increases in our guidance metrics, including non-fuel CASM. As it relates to our pilots, if they vote to ratify the proposed agreement by March 1st, pay rates would be retroactive to January 1st. This results in a 3-point impact on our non-fuel unit costs for the year and in each of the quarters. Including this in the full year guidance we gave last month brings our 2023 non-fuel unit decline to 2% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. Delivering a competitive cost structure is a key financial priority. Delta has led the industry an investment in our people and our customers and this is embedded in our outlook, as is a full reset of regional costs and inflation. As we move through the year, scale and efficiency will drive a decline in 2023 non-fuel CASM versus 2022. While approaching 2019 capacity provides scale benefits, we are still bearing the cost to fully restore our network to the peak summer levels, with a continued emphasis on operational reliability during this ramp-up. We expect to complete our rebuild by the second half, with the majority of our flex fleet reactivated and training levels for our pilots reverting to historical levels. This will allow a significant shift of resources from training to production, giving us the confidence in our ability to deliver a fully restored network during the peak summer period, while enabling our operating teams to drive efficiency in the back half of the year. One unique item within the year is the pacing of our core maintenance, as we prepare to step up the network for summer flying with the first half year-over-year higher than the second -- and then lower in the second half of the year. While these dynamics impacting early part of the year, we expect 1Q non-fuel unit cost to increase 3% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. We expect the year-over-year unit cost to progressively improve through 2023 as we complete our rebuild and elevated maintenance activity, while driving efficiency across our operating groups. This cadence is consistent with our full year outlook for non-fuel unit cost to decline 2% to 4% year-over-year. With our outlook for revenue, we expect the March quarter operating margins to be 4% to 6% and earnings of $0.15 per share to $0.40 per share. For the full year, we are regulating our outlook for earnings of $5 per share to $6 per share and operating margins of 10% to 12%, delivering a 2-point to 4-point expansion of margins, including over 1-point impact from higher profit sharing. We expect the full year free cash flow to be more than $2 billion with gross CapEx of $5.5 billion. In 2023, non-operating expense is expected to be $470 million higher year-over-year. These results from non-cash pension expense increasing over $550 million year-over-year due to broad market declines, more than offsetting the reduction in interest expense from repaying debt. We plan to pay cash for our $2.4 billion in debt maturities, while opportunistically reducing debt with excess liquidity. This will bring our leverage to 3 to 3.5 target for 2023 and remaining on track for 2024 adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR to be 2 times to 3 times. Returning to investment grade metrics by 2024, while continuing to reinvest in the business remains our focus for capital allocation. In closing, I want to thank -- add my thanks to the Delta team and people for their hard work this year. We outperformed the first year of our three-year plan and we entered 2023 on track to generate a significant improvement in both earnings and cash flow. We remain confident in delivering on our 2024 target of $7 of earnings per share and generating over $4 billion of free cash flow. With that, I will turn it over back to Julie for our Q&A.\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good morning, everyone. So good to be back. So maybe I will start with a question on the capacity bottlenecks that you mentioned in your prepared remarks Ed. So I know Delta itself has made a lot of progress in hiring and getting through a large wave of training, but there are other constraints outside of the airline industry\u2019s control with aircraft delivery slower than planned and aviation infrastructure still fairly strapped at airports, the FAA. Now I know the answer will be different for Delta than some of your peers who are further behind in their pilot hiring, but how do you think about the time line to remove some of these bottlenecks across the industry that aren\u2019t directly in airlines control and I guess really what I am asking is, do you expect there to be continued tension between supply and demand over the medium-term, just how do you think about those rolling off? Thanks so much.\nEd Bastian: Thanks, Catie, and welcome back. Yeah. I think you summed it up well and I mentioned at the Capital Markets Day last month that while we -- at Delta and I think the industry broadly provides you, our capacity expectations. I think expectations have quotation marks around them and they do feel still a little bit more aspirational than because there are a number of things that are outside of our control. We are doing our very best to get our people in place. The hiring is strong. We have the team assembled. We need to get them through, principally our pilots through the training -- the limited training devices and school house that we have available to us. We expect by the summer that we will be in position to have not just get through most of that bottleneck, but then the large resource drain that it takes with respect to all of the training that are existing team has to do to train our new employees, whether that\u2019s pilots or flight attendants, mechanics, the airports, reservations. It doesn\u2019t matter where in the system you sit. That\u2019s hard to see. I can appreciate that if you are sitting in your chair, but it\u2019s very meaningful here on the airline. And then by summer, we hope at Delta that we will be able to be back 100%. I also use the term fragile last month when speaking about the aviation system as we continue to return to the skies, and I think we have seen just in the last few weeks a couple of illustrations of that fragility. So we are going to continue to do our best to make sure we don\u2019t fly in excess of our capabilities so that we can deliver a great product for our customers and provide all the tools and support for our employees.\nCatherine O'Brien: That\u2019s great. Helpful, Ed. And if I could maybe just for my follow-up. Glen, I know 75% of this year\u2019s growth by your core hubs. Can you help us think about RASM performance at your core hubs versus the rest of your network or even better since we know its lower cost capacity? Can you help us think about the margin differential of adding capacity in core hubs versus competitive coastal hubs? Thank you so much.\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure. I think we outlined that at the Investor Day and core hub is about 10 points higher than coastal hubs and 10 points in margin.\nEd Bastian: Yeah.\nGlen Hauenstein: And about 20 points in terms of RASM. I think as we continue to build our core hubs out we will see, that\u2019s one of the things we are counting on is acceleration of profitability in those core hubs and driving efficiency so we are getting them back to scale. As we mentioned in our Investor Day, we are already at scale in our coastal cities. That was our priority, just because we thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity during the pandemic and so that was our priority to ensure that we came out in a good position there. I think we are very happy with the positions we have established there and now it\u2019s back to the core where we think it\u2019s actually easier lifting.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Ed, you said in your prepared remarks that you have never seen a more constructive industry backdrop. Black Swan event aside, what do you see are probably the biggest risks or things to watch out for the industry in 2023? Is it your previous response on kind of infrastructure and things that\u2019s outside of your control or kind of what are you looking at?\nEd Bastian: Well, thanks, Ravi. I -- that\u2019s right. I think the most important thing that Delta we can do is to continue to restore confidence back to the traveling public. We know the traveling. The public wants to travel in outsized amounts that we see continuing and we have to do our very best not to disappoint them as they return to the skies, I think, 2022 was very difficult. In that regard, demand clearly exceeded our ability to supply it for lots of ways, including in the service levels with the exceptional degree of service that we want to provide our customers. And I think we all in the industry owe it to our customers to make sure we don\u2019t fly in excess of our capabilities. So I think that\u2019s the single biggest thing that we all need to pay attention to and so I wouldn\u2019t call it a Black Swan risk other than just trying to stay within our capability.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. And maybe as a follow-up maybe for Glen. Can you just unpack your thoughts on corporate in the near term, a little bit more, I think, that\u2019s, obviously, one of the big focus areas for investors right now. You said 96% of corporate in your survey say that they are going to be kind of flat to up in the near-term, but obviously, macro is really choppy. We saw some of the hotel data kind of coming into January take a bit of a step down. What are you seeing in terms of your booking curve kind of any signs at all on cracks and corporate demand given where macro is?\nGlen Hauenstein: We have had our highest post-pandemic days in terms of corporate booking over the last week or 10 days. So we see a very strong post-holiday demand set. We are in kind of a strange period right now because you over 2019. This is an MLK weekend and MLK weekend was next weekend. So I think once we get past MLK, we will give you a better view. But we are counting on it to stay in that roughly 80%. That\u2019s not -- the survey would indicate that it\u2019s better than that. So I think that\u2019s -- if it does materialize is better than that, that\u2019s upside for our forward looking forecasts.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Glen, if I look at the RASM guide for Q1, down about 6% just in absolute terms from Q4, so that\u2019s worse than normal Q4 to Q1 seasonality. Any color on that and then when do we really start to see this hub tailwinds show up in RASM?\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. Well, quarter-over-quarter, we had a 2-point increase in domestic stage. So, and that again is unique to Delta and we think that\u2019s about 1 point of pressure from the 19 down to the 16. There\u2019s another international mix, length of haul changing internationally as well. So that\u2019s another point. And so then we are thinking about this as really being sequentially about 1 point difference to get from a 91% restoration all the way up to 99% restoration. So our core -- for core same-store sales, we are actually seeing first quarter being stronger than fourth quarter and with that sequential improvement from February being better than January and March being better than February. So I think we are sitting in a pretty exciting place right now as we look at how 2023 is starting.\nEd Bastian: Then the rebuild of the core.\nGlen Hauenstein: The rebuild of the core, we wish we could do it sooner. Again, I think, our priority has been to make sure that we can sustain industry leading operations and so that\u2019s going to work throughout the year. I think when we talked about it at the Investor Day, we didn\u2019t really give you color that this is not a first quarter event. While there\u2019s some rebuild domestically in the core, the major rebuilds we expect, for example, Atlanta, which was about 85% last year in terms of seats to be close to 95% by summer and then 100% by fall with Minneapolis close to Atlanta and then Detroit a little bit behind. So we are working on that, that\u2019s our priority and we will get there we believe by fall, but it really doesn\u2019t impact significantly the first quarter\u2019s core.\nScott Group: Okay. And then just for Dan, just help bridge us from CASM up 3% to 4% in Q1 to down 2% to 4% for the year? You mentioned maintenance, how much does that hurt Q1, how much has that then helped the back half, any color here? Thank you.\nDan Janki: Yeah. Certainly. There\u2019s two pieces in there. Maintenance being one, it\u2019s about a 2-point headwind in the first quarter and first half and it\u2019s driven by engine induction levels and scope of work related to that. As you get into the back half of the year, that\u2019s a 2-point to 3-point benefit year-over-year, so a 5-point progression from beginning to end. And then the second piece of that is related to the completion of our rebuild and those rebuild costs stepping down. Most of our rebuild over 85% of that cost is in the first half of the year. You don\u2019t have that in the back half of the year. And as Glen just talked about, one of the enablers that efficiency is, as we restore the core hubs, these low-cost subs, low CP most cost competitive as we put that capacity and that drives efficiency of our assets and our workforce. That is 5 points. So the 5 points related to that and the 5 points related to maintenance is 10-point progression as you go through the year from the beginning to the end and that drives that continuous cadence improvement as you go through the quarters.\nScott Group: Helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. First, I wanted to maybe ask about just profitability levels. You finished the year with 8% margins and are guiding to Q1 with 4% to 6%, and given the full year guide, how do we think about margin progression throughout the year?\nDan Janki: It will -- part of it is tied to the cost progression and as you see that progression being up, and I said to you get about a 10-point improvement in cost from beginning to end, that will drive your expansion of margins throughout the year as you progress, along with what then Glen talked about, which was the commercial rebuild related to the core. So you will see this progression. Certainly, year-over-year, the improvement versus the comp that we are coming off drives some material improvement here in the first quarter over $1 billion pre-tax, a big part of the step-up in earnings year-over-year, but you will also see improvement as we go through the year.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: That\u2019s helpful. And then just maybe one follow-up related to that, just margin progression. I think, Ed, you mentioned high margin Pacific routes opening up, I think, it was Australia and Korea, what are one time to two items we should watch for as we see that international recovery help margin momentum?\nEd Bastian: Our international recovery is well underway, and if you think about Europe, it will actually be bigger in the transatlantic this year than we were in 2019 by about 8 points in terms of seats. Early advanced bookings for that are incredibly strong, so we are very pleased with how that\u2019s developing. And so what\u2019s really left to reopen is China and that\u2019s -- we are not going to get ahead of ourselves in terms of capacity to China. We are going to be very mindful to see how demand warrants and how this opens up, but that\u2019s the big question mark, I think, in terms of international demand for 2023 that we don\u2019t know yet. I think the others we are very confident that we have a good path forward that will get us back to 2019 or bigger at better margins.\nDan Janki: And I think as we talked about at Investor Day, the multiyear progression on international, the structural elements here, right? The next-generation fleet that we are at, the reconfiguration of more premium seats with DPS, better cargo capability stronger partner network, all those are systematic drivers not only in this year but really on a multiyear basis.\nEd Bastian: And if you go back in our history, not to go into too much detail, but we had a multiyear restructure of our Asia capacity and that has been a drag on earnings for many years leading up to the pandemic. And now as we come out of that, we feel like our restructuring is really done in earnest and so we should see really good improvements in specific profitability moving forward.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live.\nJamie Baker: Hey. Good morning, everybody. And Glen, it\u2019s been a while since we visited the topic of domestic and international RASM premiums. We know what those metrics were pre-COVID, there\u2019s obviously been quite a bit of international upheaval since then, a bit of domestic change, and of course, the premium market at least is stronger than what I was anticipating in 2019. How should we think about the magnitude of Delta\u2019s RASM premiums going forward and any related timing?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think right now we are sitting probably at a low point relative to the industry given our stage length and the way we rebuilt the airline and I would expect to gain a couple 2 points to 3 points domestically back as we get towards the back half of the year on how we rebuild the airline. So that\u2019s how I view it. I am pleased with -- at a macro level or at an individual flight level, I am pleased with where we are. When you add it all up, sum total looks like we are taking a step backwards, but I think, it\u2019s really the way we have done it rather than a structural look away from Delta or anything that we are losing customers. So I think we are in a good spot for that.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Thank you. And second for Dan, as we think about the order book, particularly on the wide-body side, considering the OEM backlogs that -- Catie, welcome back by the way, I mentioned in her question. How should we be thinking about the cadence of CapEx in the coming years? We tend to model you on a normalized basis, but one of your competitors is on a CapEx holiday, another right now is on a CapEx vendor. I am just trying to assess whether 2024 represents a potential peak in cash flow in light of future aircraft needs?\nDan Janki: I think it\u2019s steady as it goes. We have been very consistent, very deliberate, very disciplined related to CapEx. We certainly had this period where this past year in 2022, there was some catch-up in there. We are continuing to do that here in 2023 for what was deferred for a couple of years. But I think as you exit 2024, you are normalized. Now, at the same time, we are getting bigger as an airline and growing from that perspective, but I think with -- it\u2019s a good foundation for us as it relates to where we are stepping off in 2024.\nEd Bastian: Yeah. Jamie, this is Ed. I\u2019d agree with Dan\u2019s comments. Don\u2019t forget we are exclusively taking Airbus equipment over the last couple of years, the next couple of years pretty much and we will be back with the MAX starting in 2025. So we did not have any supply interruption of any note over the last couple of years through the pandemic this year or the years going forward. So there\u2019s a consistency and I am confident you are going to see a -- you are not going to see any jumps or any significant declines. We are ensuring that we are staying rated within our sweet spot here on the fleet.\nJamie Baker: That\u2019s the answer we were looking for. Thank you everybody. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Thanks. Good morning and thanks for the time. Maybe just start with Glen on transatlantic. Typically, this is a pretty quiet time of the year, but it appears the industry is sort of doing less seasonal shaping or kind of deseasonalizing transatlantic, which probably makes sense in light of rebuild for the summer. Can you just talk about what you are seeing in transatlantic less about this summer and more about getting from here to there?\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. Well, there\u2019s not a lot of room between here and there. We are seeing really robust bookings for March and beyond. So it\u2019s really, if I look at how we view the transatlantic, there\u2019s April through October peak spring, March is getting to be a peak month these days. So that leaves you really the non-holiday weeks in November and the non-holiday weeks in January and February as really your low periods and so how we have shaped it this year is we have had a bigger transatlantic in 2019. We had some operational issues in Amsterdam. Excluding those, we were very pleased with the results in the off-peak season and it\u2019s setting up really well. Because I think one of the things that you forget about building up for the summer is the first few weeks for the high point of sale U.S. travel are always throwaway weeks, because you have got a significant amount of outbound traffic and very light inbound traffic. So getting those out of the way earlier in the season and really allowing the summer peak to be even more robust than it has been before is, I think, how we are shaping. So I don\u2019t know if I answered your question, but I\u2019d say we really like what we saw. There are things we are going to do differently next year. There are learnings from this year that we can improve on. So we are excited about those learnings and then really excited about the summer peak season to Europe. We think this is going to be a record breaker.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you, Glen. And then just on fuel, maybe this is Ed or Dan. You own a refinery. Can you talk a little bit about your outlook for jet fuel, and I am not asking for guidance, we can obviously see that. But just with respect to the unusually high crack spreads and refining margins, which week-to-week look like we are going to get relief and then that relief sort of goes away, obviously, you have a hedge in that regard, but I wondered if you could talk kind of intermediate term about when the -- when we see sort of refining margin relief?\nDan Janki: Yeah. No. You saw it constrained markets throughout 2022 state elevated certainly was disrupted significantly in the second quarter, particularly we don\u2019t anticipate it being at those levels for the current year giving back. But I would say for the next 12 months to 18 months, I think, you are at least in a period where you are structurally constrained. The global flows for both oil and refined products have changed. Things that used to revert both gasoline diesel and jet coming out of Europe into the U.S. aren\u2019t taking place. Utilization of refineries are high and you get disruptions, you have seen it as the winter storms came through in December and incredibly low temperatures. Refineries were impacted and you are seeing the rippling effect here in January and the unusual nature even in the last seven days to 10 days, where the physical market is short. Jet many times throughout 2022 it was diesel and you see a spike. And then the -- as the refineries get the utilization back up and optimize you get a balancing, but they are still tight and we expect them to stay elevated.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live.\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good morning. Glen, could you talk a little bit more about what you are seeing on the corporate demand side on the -- across the international entities and just as you get to the summer, I realized it\u2019s early days, but where you expect kind of capacity be restored across these entities?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think we talked a little bit about that in the previous question, we expect the transatlantic to be about 108% restored to 2019 levels, so it will be bigger than 2019. Most of that is engaged as we bring in the newer, more efficient fleets. So we have some exciting departures. We haven\u2019t loaded our entire summer schedule yet. That will be announced over the next 8 days to 10 days. There are a few more things we need to put back in. And then in the Pacific, absent of China, we are more than rebuilt in Australia, we are more than rebuilt in Korea and we are about 75% rebuilt in Japan. We expect to be somewhere between 75% and 100% rebuilt in Japan. If we do or don\u2019t receive slot waivers -- if we do receive slot waivers, we are probably sitting at 75%. If we don\u2019t, we will go back to 100. And then China is the big question mark, as I mentioned earlier. We just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to go on there with demand. So we are not going to get ahead of that and publish a China schedule for the summer that we don\u2019t know if we can fly and we don\u2019t know if the demand will be there. So we will let demand drive what we are going to fly in China. And then last but not least, in Latin, we are very close to fully restoring Latin right now with Deep South really starting to turn on with our partners at LATAM and getting some really, really positive early results on that. So I think other than China, we are fully restored internationally and we see international restoration where countries are open and that\u2019s very similar to domestic at about 80%.\nSavi Syth: I appreciate that. And just kind of a quick follow-up, just on the kind of change fees and the revenue that you are seeing here, the dropping of the change fees, what kind of an impact is that having as you kind of think about the network or the revenue and will it be different once things are fully restored versus where it is today?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. Change fees accounted for almost $1 billion of revenue in the pre-pandemic world and we were on a path even absent the pandemic to change fees. They have become onerous, people didn\u2019t like them and trying to give customers what they want, we were on a path to a different approach that got accelerated and I think we are very happy with where we are today, giving customers choice in how they want to fly. And I\u2019d say we are counting on about half of that $1 billion to be replaced by people who want flexible, fully refundable at time of purchase, which is an option that they are choosing as opposed to being imposed on that. And the rest of that is then coming from a higher share of total customer base and upsells more than covering to produce the record revenues that we expect this year.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you for the time. Just on the question that Scott talked about the bridge on the cost side. I don\u2019t think you mentioned gauge or asset utilization improving throughout there. Can you just provide some color around where you expect those two metrics to kind of be meaningful tailwinds as you move throughout the year? The reason why I asked is that, there\u2019s a lot of changes on the regional side, I would think that, that would be a pretty big tailwind from you?\nDan Janki: Yeah. The mainline asset utilization increases about -- mid single-digit about 5% as we progress through the year. So we get the benefit associated with that and as we talked about at Investor Day, we continue to get the benefit associated with gauge.\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah.\nConor Cunningham: Okay.\nGlen Hauenstein: Related to regional flying, as you know, we have about a third of our regional flight that flying that has not been flown today and that\u2019s also one of the disparities between seat restoration and capacity restoration. We are not expecting a significant increase of that until the end of 2023 and into 2024. So we are going to be carrying that\u2026\nDan Janki: We are carrying that under utilization regional\u2026\nGlen Hauenstein: \u2026under utilization.\nDan Janki: \u2026 network absolutely in our run rate.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Okay. That makes sense. And then on the Amex targets, I am a little surprised that those aren\u2019t being revised up from 6.5%, from 5.5%, I mean that\u2019s basically mirroring the capacity growth year-over-year. I would just think that there would be some outperformance just given the fact that, that portfolio has grown a fair bit. Can you just talk about like what you need to see to push those targets up or did you just see a lot of pull forward in consumer spend that kind of inflated the 2022 number, just trying to unpack that a little bit? Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, we are pretty excited about hitting a $6.5 billion number. Hopefully, there\u2019s upside to that. I think its January. We don\u2019t want to commit to that. But we are ahead of our long-term goals for that and we continue to find ways to accelerate our long-term goals. And I think next year or maybe even in June we are going to give you what\u2019s beyond the $7 billion, because our first market was how do you get the $7 billion, and when we said that, I think, it was a daunting task for us, it was a daunting task for the team, we are there, right? And I think the question really for us and I was investors, okay, you are at the $7 billion, what\u2019s next, and that\u2019s what we have got to be working on showing you that we are not done here.\nEd Bastian: Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing -- Conor, this is Ed. It\u2019s not driven by capacity, as you can appreciate, it\u2019s driven by the spend on the portfolio. So that\u2019s a pretty sizable increase in portfolio spend as well.\nConor Cunningham: Good problem to have. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is live.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, Operator, and hi, team. Thank you. Sort of a question about TechOps, pre-pandemic, you guys were building that business out, it was going to be a more than $1 billion revenue business at some point. How are you thinking about that coming out of the pandemic and into sort of the middle part of this decade into the end or is that something that is another focus or is that being supplanted by the other revenues that you are talking about?\nEd Bastian: Hi, Helane. How are you? This is Ed. We are\u2026\nHelane Becker: Good.\nEd Bastian: \u2026 incredibly excited about your question and the MRO, and in fact, we made great progress during the pandemic to continue to accelerate that vision when we sign a deal to acquire the LEAP as part of the MAX deal. So we now have basically all the new engine technologies on our platform with exclusive arrangements and opportunities for third-party work that will extend over the next 20 years. Obviously, in the short-term, our focus is on -- to every extent we have labor and we have supply challenges focusing on the Delta metal and continuing to get the airline itself back up and running. So the MRO has taken a little bit of a backseat over the short-term. But we continue to make the investments where we have got the commitments from all of our partners on the engine side and this is something you are going to hear a fair bit about in June when we look at the strategic discussion that we are looking to create.\nHelane Becker: Right. In June. Okay. That\u2019s going to be really helpful. And then, Ed, can I please ask you in June, if you will also update us on your diversity and inclusion targets. We talked a lot about that pre-pandemic and then during the pandemic, you have obviously hired 25,000 new people. You mentioned that in your prepared remarks. Can you also at some point update us on how that\u2019s going and whether you are meeting your own internal goals? You don\u2019t have to share those with us, but if you can share with us how it\u2019s coming along? That might be helpful.\nEd Bastian: We will certainly do that, and that was already in the plan, Helane, to go through that in June. The good news is that we are making great progress and we will share our targets, because we share them publicly.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much, team.\nEd Bastian: Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Good morning, everyone. First question for Glen, I guess, based on my math, it seems like you are assuming PRASM could start to decline sort of in the high-single digits year-over-year as you move through 2023 to kind of get to your 15% to 20% revenue outlook. What drives that assumption particularly given kind of the RASM benefit you should have from your mid-continent growth strategy?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think when we look at the progression through the quarter we had some very extenuating circumstances last second quarter and early third quarter with fuel running up over $120 a barrel. And as we think about how we do fuel recapture on the way up, we also as inflation cools down and as fuel comes down, we are not going to keep all of that. We are going to keep as much of it as we can and we are not anticipating that big mobile and fuel, which is driving the sequential decrease. So we will see how it actually rolls out and hopefully it\u2019s better than that, but that\u2019s how we are thinking about how the year progresses in terms of absolute unit revenues.\nAndrew Didora: Yeah. That makes sense. And then I just ask you kind of strategically here, Glen. As you see -- as you have seen the revenue environment continue to show this strength pretty much since kind of almost a year ago, are you seeing any changes in behavior from any of your competitors that may show that they are acting differently today than they would have pre-pandemic? Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. We don\u2019t really talk about how our competitors behave. I think what we have seen is we have seen a very big shift in how and why people travel and trying to stay ahead of that in our own planning and make sure that we are capturing where people want to go and what products they want to buy and that\u2019s really our continued focus and it\u2019s been a very interesting journey.\nAndrew Didora: Yeah.\nGlen Hauenstein: And as you look at individual market levels, we are very different sizes than we were pre-pandemic based on where our customers want us to take in these days.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.\nMike Linenberg: Oh! Hey. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Glen, just a quick question sort of following up on Conor\u2019s on loyalty. It feels like with the free WiFi, this is going to be a banner year for SkyMiles, I think, last year $8.5 million. How do we think about the conversion of number of SkyMiles to ultimately those who take -- uptake on the credit card, I think this last year, it was like an 8:1 ratio. Is that kind of what it\u2019s been historically?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think that\u2019s about right. That\u2019s one of the -- we see the more engaged the customers with Delta, the higher their satisfaction is and so that\u2019s really part of that ecosystem that we are really trying to grow is, SkyMiles is an entry point, of course, as everybody knows it\u2019s free and now they have an incentive to do that, because there\u2019s an immediate benefit to join because you get the free WiFi and so how do we translate that ultimately into more loyal customers who eventually will wind up getting some of our other products and that\u2019s really what our flywheel is right now and how we are going to continue to press forward in terms of loyalty.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Very good. And then just second question on Dan, you talked about non-ops, the $470 million headwind, obviously, non-cash pension expense maybe there\u2019s some other items. How do we think about through the year, is that ratably, is it lumpy and what tax rate should we be using on March quarter full year? Thank you.\nDan Janki: Yes. 1.3 for the year. The first quarter think of it being closer to -- if it was ratable, it would be about 3.30 a quarter. First quarter will be a little bit higher. We think about it as 3.60 to 3.65 associated with it. And tax rate continues to be consistent, right, in that 24% to 24.5%.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: We will now go to our final analyst question.\nOperator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live.\nBrandon Oglenski: Keep it to one as well. Dan, can you talk about your normal amortization this year, which I think is about $2.5 billion relative to the $2 billion of free cash flow that you guys are anticipating? And what are your options here, especially in a higher interest rate environment, how does that change your capital priorities in any way?\nDan Janki: Normal -- yes. We have normal maturities at 2.4. We had 1.8 this past year and we ended up retiring $4.5 billion of debt. Ken and the team were opportunistic in regards to debt that we can take out that we think is higher cost and has good economic payback associated with it. And given our liquidity position, as we progress through this year, we will continue to look at those options. There are certainly a number out there that are targets for us, but we will either do it through how we have done it with through tenders, but also just as you go open market repurchases and being smart and going after the higher cost debt, that\u2019s a priority. We want to drive down that non-op interest line over time and the team is good at it. They have done it. Did it for a decade. They will continue to do it.\nBrandon Oglenski: And I guess, Dan, how does a higher interest rate environment here change your capital priorities, if at all?\nDan Janki: About changing it, I think, it does -- when it may change in regards to how you look at some of your debt, some of them that are off of LIBOR and floating have become more attractive to retire in certain situations. So, but we are continuing to be focused on, as you know, it\u2019s reinvesting back in the business, but also this path to deleveraging. So continuing to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce debt and drive down those leverage ratios.\nBrandon Oglenski: All right. Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer to start the media questions.\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Julie. Matt, if you don\u2019t mind, could we reiterate for the members of the media, the practice for getting in the call queue and in addition to thanking each of them for their time this morning, just to remind everyone around one question and one follow-up so we can get through as many of these as we could please. Thank you.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from Claire Bushey from Financial Times. Your line is live.\nClaire Bushey: Hi. I was wondering, what needs in your opinion to happen at the FAA so that what happened on Wednesday doesn\u2019t happen again?\nEd Bastian: Hi, Claire. It\u2019s Ed. I missed the first part of your question. Your question is what does the FAA need to do in order to ensure\u2026\nClaire Bushey: So that.\nEd Bastian: \u2026 no repeat of Wednesday?\nClaire Bushey: Correct.\nEd Bastian: Well, if you saw my comments this morning on CNBC. I think it\u2019s very clear that there has to be a call to action amongst our political leaders, the Congress and the White House to fund and properly provide the FAA the resources they need to do the job. We have long talked about the need for modernization of our air traffic control systems. I think this is a crystal clear example of the challenge the FAA has faced when you have aging systems that aren\u2019t as resilient as they need to be. You have tools and technologies that are somewhat outdated and staffing levels, not where they need to be. So FAA I know is doing the very best they can with what they have, but we need to stand behind the FAA and we need to take them off the kind of year-by-year funding that seems like they go through that\u2019s caught up in political negotiations and realize the importance of having a strong aviation infrastructure and the importance of that to our economy, as well as our public.\nClaire Bushey: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live.\nAlison Sider: Hey. Thanks so much. I guess sort of a related question, but I guess curious, how much do you think that the infrastructure and aerospace issues are likely to be a constraint on growth for the industry overall, whether it vulnerability of technical systems and lack of redundancy or just controller staffing or what have you, how impactable do you expect that to be going forward?\nEd Bastian: Well, it\u2019s according constraint on our ability to grow as an industry. You see the length of flight times they are taking to complete missions. You see the some of the challenges the air traffic control -- controllers have when you get into congested space in the Northeast or down in Florida. There\u2019s been a lot -- it\u2019s just even during the pandemic itself some real challenges that we have experienced. So there\u2019s no question that the investment in a modernized air traffic control system will drive a tremendous amount of efficiencies, as well as growth, which will mean better service for the American public.\nAlison Sider: Thanks. And I guess can you talk a little bit about sort of what sort of systems or backup or its own redundancy Delta has, like if there was another outage of the NOTAM system like we saw earlier this week? Is that something that Delta can kind of deal with or work around or is that something you need to have or, yeah, there\u2019s anything you can share on that?\nEd Bastian: Yeah. The NOTAM system that went down is an essential system and no airline would fly without having that capability. Interestingly, at Delta, we had and have a long -- a fairly old backup technology that does see that and we were able to keep some of the NOTAM information flowing to Delta. So we probably had a little better opportunity to fly during this stoppage as compared to anyone else, but out of deference to the FAA and making certain that we gave them the ability to make the decisions we didn\u2019t utilize that backup system. But it\u2019s an important part of our resiliency and redundancy.\nAlison Sider: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kelly Yamanouchi from the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Your line is live. Kelly Yamanouchi, your line is live. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live.\nMary Schlangenstein: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to see if I could get you to talk a little bit more about your comments about business bookings remaining steady. It seems like the 80% recovered level in the December quarter is what you had been saying previous to that and I wanted to see if you have got any sort of an outlook beyond the March quarter that gives you confidence that, that corporate recovery is not going to stall at some level?\nGlen Hauenstein: We do those corporate surveys, and that\u2019s why we do them to see what our corporate partners are thinking about in terms of future travel and it was actually the last one we did, which is for future travel, was the best survey we have had since pre-pandemic in terms of their enthusiasm that more people would be flying in future months than we are flying in current or past months. As I said in the call, we are not counting on that in our current revenue forecast, because sometimes that doesn\u2019t come to fruition, but there\u2019s a sense of optimism from this pent-up demand for business travel that we see could potentially offset any weakness in the general economy. And we are taking a very cautious look, but -- and we are counting on it being stable and not growing dramatically, but it looks like people think it will grow.\nEd Bastian: Mary, this is Ed.\nMary Schlangenstein: Great.\nEd Bastian: I -- you see in the -- in our country a lot of businesses struggling to get their employees back into the office and I think this is tied to that. As companies return and employees return to office, you are going to see another step up in my opinion of return to more normal trends, including improved business travel. You think of a lot of the big accounts we serve are consultancies legal firms, accounting firms, it\u2019s tough for them to get out on the road if they don\u2019t have the offices open of their clients and their customers. So I think that\u2019s the -- a little bit of the choppiness that Glen was referring to, because that companies are intending to open and have had some -- there\u2019s been some stalls going on there, but I do think as we progress over the course of the year, you are going to see more and more of business being done like it used to be done than ever before.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. And if I can just follow up, I understand about your survey, but are there bookings that you can see at this point beyond the March quarter that gives you any idea of whether that weakness will continue? And then when you said you are counting on that corporate demand being stable, but not growing dramatically, that\u2019s a change though from what you had been seeing. Is that correct, you had been seeing growth, but now you are seeing it more stable?\nGlen Hauenstein: Clearly, in the early parts of the pandemic recovery, we saw some accelerated growth. I think we have been pretty consistent at the past couple of quarters and we see some stability in the booking curve at about 80% of revenue. So as you know, business travel usually has the shortest advanced purchase windows and is mostly close in. So we would not have any further visibility beyond the next 60 days to 90 days that would be of any significant help in charting that water.\nMary Schlangenstein: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Edward Russell from Skift. Your line is live.\nEdward Russell: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wonder if you could comment on if Delta saw any benefit from Southwest Airlines operational issues in December, was there an uptick in bookings people buying less ticket sent out, any color would be great?\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure. As you know, we had our own weather operations during the peak Christmas holiday travel period, and we saw after that, when we were fully recovered and Southwest was still not back in full swing that we had an uptick in our bookings. That\u2019s trended in highly competitive with Southwest markets a little bit into January, but we think that will resolve itself over the next six months to 12 months.\nEdward Russell: Thank you.\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Edward. Matt, we have time for one final question, if we could, please.\nOperator: Certainly. The last question is coming from Robert Silk from Travel Weekly. Your line is live.\nRobert Silk: Yeah. Hi. When you talk about getting back to full pre-pandemic capacity in your major hubs, are you talking about seats or flight numbers? And then what percent of your gauge up, let\u2019s say, in Atlanta, what will it be up this summer and how do you think about managing crowds as you increase gauge and bring your flight numbers back up to where they were or beyond?\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. We will probably not, for the next couple of years see the flight numbers we did in 2019. We will get seat capacity restoration to 100%, which means that gauge will go up significantly. When you look at our fleet evolution that was always our plan was to continue to grow not by additional departures but by larger airplanes, more efficiency, less fuel burn, better products and services and so that\u2019s really what we are intending on doing. The pandemic accelerated that and so you have got our average gauge up by double digits right now. That\u2019s partly because we keep taking larger airplanes partly because the regional fleets are less restored.\nRobert Silk: Yeah.\nGlen Hauenstein: And we think that will normalize out over the next 18 months, but we will probably not for the foreseeable future get back to the flight levels, although we will match or exceed by the end of the year at the historic levels in terms of seat capacity.\nRobert Silk: Is there any with the higher gauge, do you end up with more crowded banks in terms of number of passengers or is that a swag by having less flights\u2026\nGlen Hauenstein: No. I think\u2026\nRobert Silk: \u2026 if you have more crack\u2026\nGlen Hauenstein: \u2026that\u2019s why we have done these generational builds across our network is that, we knew that bigger gauge was coming, we needed to accommodate it and even for example, here in Atlanta, we have worked closely with the city to reconfigure the deconcourse to be wider than any of the other concourses to accommodate that increased gauge. So we have got short-, medium- and long-term plans to accommodate those gauges. But a lot of that was in our generational builds across the network and we don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to be more crowded than it was in 2019 or feel more crowded.\nRobert Silk: Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Glen.\nEd Bastian: Thank you, Robert. Matt that will wrap our call for today. We are grateful for everyone\u2019s time and participation.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Earlier Delta reported our full year results including our December quarter earnings per share of $1.48 on record revenue that was 8% above 2019 levels. We generated a 12% operating margin, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit operating margins pointing to the strength of our recovery. I want to sincerely thank the 90,000 strong Delta team for their outstanding work in delivering these results and serving our customers during a very busy holiday travel season. In my opinion, 2022 was the most difficult operational year in our history and was capped off by severe winter storms over the holidays. I am grateful to our employees for their great work to recover the operation, while keeping our customers and each other safe. They are the reason our brand and customer loyalty is at the top of the industry. Our December quarter earnings per share and margins exceeded guidance, marking a strong close to a year where we made significant progress regarding restoration of our financial foundation. For the full year, we reported earnings of $3.20 per share on $46 billion of revenue. We delivered pre-tax income of $2.7 billion, an improvement of more than $6 billion over 2021. Delta's profitability led the industry and in our nearly 100-year history, 2022 was our seventh highest result even with a $1 billion loss in the first quarter. We are pleased to report positive free cash flow for the year, which funded $6 billion of capital invested back into the business and we repaid close to $5 billion in gross debt. Sharing our success is a longstanding pillar of Delta's culture and I am proud to announce that we will be paying our employees $550 million in well-earned profit sharing coming Valentine's Day. 2022 came in ahead of our plan on revenue, earnings and cash flow, demonstrating strong execution in the first year of the three-year plan we laid out at the 2021 Capital Markets Day. I am incredibly proud of the team for rebuilding the world's best performing airline, and importantly, we are not just building back, we are continuing to improve and extend our competitive advantages. Delta's brand continued to strengthen in 2022, with record performance from our loyalty and co-brand card programs, and customer satisfaction scores consistently perform above pre-pandemic levels. Through the year, we have hired and trained 25,000 new employees, now representing over a quarter of the total company. Our team showed their operating talent and resilience as we retained our number one position in completion factor and on time arrivals amongst our peer set, despite having so many new team members. The Delta brand is centered on our safe, reliable and exceptional service, and our operational excellence was recognized by Cirium last week, which named us yet again the most on time airline in North America. We fortified our international partnerships in 2022, position -- positioning us for profitable international growth in the years ahead. As detailed last month, expanding our international margins to domestic levels is an important opportunity for Delta in the years to come. We have invested in the customer experience at every stage of the travel journey, from the continued refresh of our fleet with next-generation far more fuel efficient aircraft to generational airport rebuilds and technology investments that are providing our employees better tools and our customers a more seamless experience. And we continue to attract and partner with leading brands to grow our SkyMiles ecosystem and further enable customers to use their SkyMiles during travel and beyond. Heading into 2023, our momentum continues. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas just last week, we unveiled the next phase in our vision to connect the Sky. Starting February 1st, Delta will be the first major U.S. airline to provide fast, free, unlimited WiFi to all through its free SkyMiles account. This will be available on nearly 80% of our U.S. system to start and growing every week. By the end of next year, we expect to deliver this service seamlessly throughout the rest of our international and regional fleets. And we debuted Delta Sync, which will create personalized experiences and engagement opportunities on the free WiFi portal. We are partnering with great brands like T-Mobile and Paramount+, as well as building on our longstanding relationship with American Express to bring to life our vision of a more connected and personalized travel experience. As a trusted consumer brand, Delta continues to differentiate the premium flying experience, building loyalty and supporting our ambition to transcend the industry. Moving to our outlook, at our Investor event last month, we provided full year 2023 guidance for revenue growth of 15% to 20% year-over-year, earnings of $5 per share to $6 per share and free cash flow of over $2 billion. We are affirming that guidance today and introducing our March quarter outlook, which Glen and Dan will provide in detail. For the March quarter, we expect to deliver a 4% to 6% operating margin and improve our pre-tax income by more than $1 billion compared to the same period last year. Importantly, we are embedding the assumed impact of all labor cost increases throughout our guidance metrics. We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle with our pilots, but out of respect for the process, we will not be discussing the details of the agreement on today's call. As I outlined last month, I have never seen a more constructive backdrop for the industry. Demand remains strong as passengers return to the skies and industry returns to the long-term trend to GDP, all while supply constraints continue. I believe our industry will see tens of billions of dollars of incremental demand in the next few years coming out of the pandemic. As the industry leader with a proven strategy and strong execution track record, Delta is well positioned to build on our momentum in the New Year. We are confident in our ability to deliver significant improvement in earnings and free cash flow in 2023, consistent with the plan we laid out last month and we are on track to deliver our 2024 targets of more than $7 of earnings per share and $4 billion of free cash flow. As always, we remain mindful of the macroeconomic trends and have demonstrated that we have the tools to effectively manage a changing economic climate. In closing, Delta delivered in 2022, outperforming our plan and leading the industry operationally and financially. We are uniquely positioned to grow earnings and cash flow in 2023, 2024 and beyond. The power of our premium brand continues to grow, and with the very best people in the industry, I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead for Delta and our customers. Thank you again. With that, I will turn it over to Glen. Thanks, Catie, and welcome back. Yeah. I think you summed it up well and I mentioned at the Capital Markets Day last month that while we -- at Delta and I think the industry broadly provides you, our capacity expectations. I think expectations have quotation marks around them and they do feel still a little bit more aspirational than because there are a number of things that are outside of our control. We are doing our very best to get our people in place. The hiring is strong. We have the team assembled. We need to get them through, principally our pilots through the training -- the limited training devices and school house that we have available to us. We expect by the summer that we will be in position to have not just get through most of that bottleneck, but then the large resource drain that it takes with respect to all of the training that are existing team has to do to train our new employees, whether that's pilots or flight attendants, mechanics, the airports, reservations. It doesn't matter where in the system you sit. That's hard to see. I can appreciate that if you are sitting in your chair, but it's very meaningful here on the airline. And then by summer, we hope at Delta that we will be able to be back 100%. I also use the term fragile last month when speaking about the aviation system as we continue to return to the skies, and I think we have seen just in the last few weeks a couple of illustrations of that fragility. So we are going to continue to do our best to make sure we don't fly in excess of our capabilities so that we can deliver a great product for our customers and provide all the tools and support for our employees. Yeah. Well, thanks, Ravi. I -- that's right. I think the most important thing that Delta we can do is to continue to restore confidence back to the traveling public. We know the traveling. The public wants to travel in outsized amounts that we see continuing and we have to do our very best not to disappoint them as they return to the skies, I think, 2022 was very difficult. In that regard, demand clearly exceeded our ability to supply it for lots of ways, including in the service levels with the exceptional degree of service that we want to provide our customers. And I think we all in the industry owe it to our customers to make sure we don't fly in excess of our capabilities. So I think that's the single biggest thing that we all need to pay attention to and so I wouldn't call it a Black Swan risk other than just trying to stay within our capability. Then the rebuild of the core. Our international recovery is well underway, and if you think about Europe, it will actually be bigger in the transatlantic this year than we were in 2019 by about 8 points in terms of seats. Early advanced bookings for that are incredibly strong, so we are very pleased with how that's developing. And so what's really left to reopen is China and that's -- we are not going to get ahead of ourselves in terms of capacity to China. We are going to be very mindful to see how demand warrants and how this opens up, but that's the big question mark, I think, in terms of international demand for 2023 that we don't know yet. I think the others we are very confident that we have a good path forward that will get us back to 2019 or bigger at better margins. And if you go back in our history, not to go into too much detail, but we had a multiyear restructure of our Asia capacity and that has been a drag on earnings for many years leading up to the pandemic. And now as we come out of that, we feel like our restructuring is really done in earnest and so we should see really good improvements in specific profitability moving forward. Yeah. Jamie, this is Ed. I'd agree with Dan's comments. Don't forget we are exclusively taking Airbus equipment over the last couple of years, the next couple of years pretty much and we will be back with the MAX starting in 2025. So we did not have any supply interruption of any note over the last couple of years through the pandemic this year or the years going forward. So there's a consistency and I am confident you are going to see a -- you are not going to see any jumps or any significant declines. We are ensuring that we are staying rated within our sweet spot here on the fleet. Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing -- Conor, this is Ed. It's not driven by capacity, as you can appreciate, it's driven by the spend on the portfolio. So that's a pretty sizable increase in portfolio spend as well. Hi, Helane. How are you? This is Ed. We are... ... incredibly excited about your question and the MRO, and in fact, we made great progress during the pandemic to continue to accelerate that vision when we sign a deal to acquire the LEAP as part of the MAX deal. So we now have basically all the new engine technologies on our platform with exclusive arrangements and opportunities for third-party work that will extend over the next 20 years. Obviously, in the short-term, our focus is on -- to every extent we have labor and we have supply challenges focusing on the Delta metal and continuing to get the airline itself back up and running. So the MRO has taken a little bit of a backseat over the short-term. But we continue to make the investments where we have got the commitments from all of our partners on the engine side and this is something you are going to hear a fair bit about in June when we look at the strategic discussion that we are looking to create. We will certainly do that, and that was already in the plan, Helane, to go through that in June. The good news is that we are making great progress and we will share our targets, because we share them publicly. Thank you. Hi, Claire. It's Ed. I missed the first part of your question. Your question is what does the FAA need to do in order to ensure... ... no repeat of Wednesday? Well, if you saw my comments this morning on CNBC. I think it's very clear that there has to be a call to action amongst our political leaders, the Congress and the White House to fund and properly provide the FAA the resources they need to do the job. We have long talked about the need for modernization of our air traffic control systems. I think this is a crystal clear example of the challenge the FAA has faced when you have aging systems that aren't as resilient as they need to be. You have tools and technologies that are somewhat outdated and staffing levels, not where they need to be. So FAA I know is doing the very best they can with what they have, but we need to stand behind the FAA and we need to take them off the kind of year-by-year funding that seems like they go through that's caught up in political negotiations and realize the importance of having a strong aviation infrastructure and the importance of that to our economy, as well as our public. Well, it's according constraint on our ability to grow as an industry. You see the length of flight times they are taking to complete missions. You see the some of the challenges the air traffic control -- controllers have when you get into congested space in the Northeast or down in Florida. There's been a lot -- it's just even during the pandemic itself some real challenges that we have experienced. So there's no question that the investment in a modernized air traffic control system will drive a tremendous amount of efficiencies, as well as growth, which will mean better service for the American public. Yeah. The NOTAM system that went down is an essential system and no airline would fly without having that capability. Interestingly, at Delta, we had and have a long -- a fairly old backup technology that does see that and we were able to keep some of the NOTAM information flowing to Delta. So we probably had a little better opportunity to fly during this stoppage as compared to anyone else, but out of deference to the FAA and making certain that we gave them the ability to make the decisions we didn't utilize that backup system. But it's an important part of our resiliency and redundancy. Mary, this is Ed. I -- you see in the -- in our country a lot of businesses struggling to get their employees back into the office and I think this is tied to that. As companies return and employees return to office, you are going to see another step up in my opinion of return to more normal trends, including improved business travel. You think of a lot of the big accounts we serve are consultancies legal firms, accounting firms, it's tough for them to get out on the road if they don't have the offices open of their clients and their customers. So I think that's the -- a little bit of the choppiness that Glen was referring to, because that companies are intending to open and have had some -- there's been some stalls going on there, but I do think as we progress over the course of the year, you are going to see more and more of business being done like it used to be done than ever before. Thank you, Robert. Matt that will wrap our call for today. We are grateful for everyone's time and participation."

            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I couldn't be prouder of what the Delta people accomplished throughout 2022 and I want to congratulate our teams on their much deserved profit sharing payout they will be receiving next month. For the full year, we generated revenue of $46 billion, a $19 billion improvement year-over-year. We delivered record December quarter and full year unit revenues, sustaining our revenue premium to the industry of more than 110%. For the 12th consecutive year, Delta was named the number one corporate airline in Business Travel News survey, as we continue to invest in our network and product offerings. And through the year, we made significant progress on our long-term commercial strategy to deepen our network advantages, expand premium revenues, grow our loyalty ecosystem and further diversify our revenues. Starting with our network strategy, we focused on solidifying our positions in coastal gateways, while protecting our core hub shares. We secured the leading positions in both Boston and Los Angeles, while increasing local market share in our core hubs. Premium let all year with paid load factors higher than 2019 and yield growth outpacing Main Cabin, while basic economy made up less than 5% of revenue, half of the 2019 levels. We expanded our Delta Premium Select rollout during the year. Customer response has been positive and the cabin performed better than our initial expectations. Our rollout continues in 2023 and we will have this product on 84% of our international wide-body fleet by this summer. Our loyalty program continued to exceed our expectations with record SkyMiles acquisitions in 2022, 42% higher than 2019. As Ed noted, we are partnering with leading companies to expand our loyalty ecosystem, increasing the value of our program for customers and deepening customer engagement with Delta. With an expanding ecosystem and free, fast WiFi, we expect continued growth in our loyalty base. Our partnership with American Express delivered record results, with full year remuneration of $5.5 billion, ahead of our initial target and positioning us to deliver over $6.5 billion in 2023 and over $7 billion in 2024. Cargo revenue was a record in 2022 and we expect to grow cargo revenues in 2023, as increased capacity offsets the cargo yield environment. With strong execution across our business lines, a record 55% of revenue was generated by premium products and diverse revenue streams. We are confident in our path to exceed 60% by 2024. While not without challenges, 2022 was a strong year for Delta and we exited the year with momentum. During the December quarter, we generated revenue of $12.3 billion, 8% higher than 2019 on 9% less capacity. We saw revenue recapture at the end of December that offset the impact of weather disruptions in our system around Christmas. Fourth quarter unit revenues were 19% higher than 2019, with strength driven by consumer demand throughout the quarter. Corporate travel demand was steady through the quarter, with corporate domestic sales 80% recovered to 2019 levels. We expect March quarter revenue to be up 14% to 17% higher versus 2019. On capacity approaching full restoration, we expect March quarter unit revenues will be up 15% to 17% compared to 2019, including a 2-point impact from higher stage. Based on how we are deploying our network, our stage length is expected to be up 5 points compared to 2019, resulting in a higher restoration of ASMs and seats. This is a temporary dynamic that is unique to Delta among major carriers. Stage will begin to normalize relative to 2019 and relative to the industry as we rebuild our core hubs later this year. For 2023, we expect to grow revenue 15% to 20% year-over-year as we fully restore our network and further diversify our revenue streams. Consumer demand remains healthy, with advanced bookings significantly ahead on both yield and load factor for each month of the March quarter compared to 2019. And in our recent corporate survey, results were positive with 96% of respondents expecting to travel as much or more in 1Q than 4Q led by financial services. In the New Year, bookings reflect the survey optimism and are accelerating. International revenue continues to be led by the transatlantic. We are seeing robust demand across our expanded footprint in Europe and expect the spring and summer to set new record revenues. Latin America is performing very well, led by Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America, with a recovery in Deep South America now accelerating. And we are pleased with the early results from the launch of the LATAM JV and I am excited about the opportunities for us in 2023 and beyond. In the Pacific, we expected record first quarter profits in both Australia and Korea as our multiyear international transformation delivers on anticipated results. Japan is also building momentum and we expect a very strong summer there. And lastly, with China, indicating its reopening, we expect to rebuild capacity in line with demand starting later this year. In closing, we delivered on our key commercial priorities in 2022, supporting a significant improvement in our revenue, while strengthening our competitive advantages. We have started the New Year with great momentum and are well positioned to extend our leadership position in the years ahead. And with that, I will turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. Sure. I think we outlined that at the Investor Day and core hub is about 10 points higher than coastal hubs and 10 points in margin. And about 20 points in terms of RASM. I think as we continue to build our core hubs out we will see, that's one of the things we are counting on is acceleration of profitability in those core hubs and driving efficiency so we are getting them back to scale. As we mentioned in our Investor Day, we are already at scale in our coastal cities. That was our priority, just because we thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity during the pandemic and so that was our priority to ensure that we came out in a good position there. I think we are very happy with the positions we have established there and now it's back to the core where we think it's actually easier lifting. We have had our highest post-pandemic days in terms of corporate booking over the last week or 10 days. So we see a very strong post-holiday demand set. We are in kind of a strange period right now because you over 2019. This is an MLK weekend and MLK weekend was next weekend. So I think once we get past MLK, we will give you a better view. But we are counting on it to stay in that roughly 80%. That's not -- the survey would indicate that it's better than that. So I think that's -- if it does materialize is better than that, that's upside for our forward looking forecasts. Right. Well, quarter-over-quarter, we had a 2-point increase in domestic stage. So, and that again is unique to Delta and we think that's about 1 point of pressure from the 19 down to the 16. There's another international mix, length of haul changing internationally as well. So that's another point. And so then we are thinking about this as really being sequentially about 1 point difference to get from a 91% restoration all the way up to 99% restoration. So our core -- for core same-store sales, we are actually seeing first quarter being stronger than fourth quarter and with that sequential improvement from February being better than January and March being better than February. So I think we are sitting in a pretty exciting place right now as we look at how 2023 is starting. The rebuild of the core, we wish we could do it sooner. Again, I think, our priority has been to make sure that we can sustain industry leading operations and so that's going to work throughout the year. I think when we talked about it at the Investor Day, we didn't really give you color that this is not a first quarter event. While there's some rebuild domestically in the core, the major rebuilds we expect, for example, Atlanta, which was about 85% last year in terms of seats to be close to 95% by summer and then 100% by fall with Minneapolis close to Atlanta and then Detroit a little bit behind. So we are working on that, that's our priority and we will get there we believe by fall, but it really doesn't impact significantly the first quarter's core. Yeah. I think right now we are sitting probably at a low point relative to the industry given our stage length and the way we rebuilt the airline and I would expect to gain a couple 2 points to 3 points domestically back as we get towards the back half of the year on how we rebuild the airline. So that's how I view it. I am pleased with -- at a macro level or at an individual flight level, I am pleased with where we are. When you add it all up, sum total looks like we are taking a step backwards, but I think, it's really the way we have done it rather than a structural look away from Delta or anything that we are losing customers. So I think we are in a good spot for that. Right. Well, there's not a lot of room between here and there. We are seeing really robust bookings for March and beyond. So it's really, if I look at how we view the transatlantic, there's April through October peak spring, March is getting to be a peak month these days. So that leaves you really the non-holiday weeks in November and the non-holiday weeks in January and February as really your low periods and so how we have shaped it this year is we have had a bigger transatlantic in 2019. We had some operational issues in Amsterdam. Excluding those, we were very pleased with the results in the off-peak season and it's setting up really well. Because I think one of the things that you forget about building up for the summer is the first few weeks for the high point of sale U.S. travel are always throwaway weeks, because you have got a significant amount of outbound traffic and very light inbound traffic. So getting those out of the way earlier in the season and really allowing the summer peak to be even more robust than it has been before is, I think, how we are shaping. So I don't know if I answered your question, but I'd say we really like what we saw. There are things we are going to do differently next year. There are learnings from this year that we can improve on. So we are excited about those learnings and then really excited about the summer peak season to Europe. We think this is going to be a record breaker. Yeah. I think we talked a little bit about that in the previous question, we expect the transatlantic to be about 108% restored to 2019 levels, so it will be bigger than 2019. Most of that is engaged as we bring in the newer, more efficient fleets. So we have some exciting departures. We haven't loaded our entire summer schedule yet. That will be announced over the next 8 days to 10 days. There are a few more things we need to put back in. And then in the Pacific, absent of China, we are more than rebuilt in Australia, we are more than rebuilt in Korea and we are about 75% rebuilt in Japan. We expect to be somewhere between 75% and 100% rebuilt in Japan. If we do or don't receive slot waivers -- if we do receive slot waivers, we are probably sitting at 75%. If we don't, we will go back to 100. And then China is the big question mark, as I mentioned earlier. We just don't know what's going to go on there with demand. So we are not going to get ahead of that and publish a China schedule for the summer that we don't know if we can fly and we don't know if the demand will be there. So we will let demand drive what we are going to fly in China. And then last but not least, in Latin, we are very close to fully restoring Latin right now with Deep South really starting to turn on with our partners at LATAM and getting some really, really positive early results on that. So I think other than China, we are fully restored internationally and we see international restoration where countries are open and that's very similar to domestic at about 80%. Yeah. Change fees accounted for almost $1 billion of revenue in the pre-pandemic world and we were on a path even absent the pandemic to change fees. They have become onerous, people didn't like them and trying to give customers what they want, we were on a path to a different approach that got accelerated and I think we are very happy with where we are today, giving customers choice in how they want to fly. And I'd say we are counting on about half of that $1 billion to be replaced by people who want flexible, fully refundable at time of purchase, which is an option that they are choosing as opposed to being imposed on that. And the rest of that is then coming from a higher share of total customer base and upsells more than covering to produce the record revenues that we expect this year. Yeah. Related to regional flying, as you know, we have about a third of our regional flight that flying that has not been flown today and that's also one of the disparities between seat restoration and capacity restoration. We are not expecting a significant increase of that until the end of 2023 and into 2024. So we are going to be carrying that... ...under utilization. Well, we are pretty excited about hitting a $6.5 billion number. Hopefully, there's upside to that. I think its January. We don't want to commit to that. But we are ahead of our long-term goals for that and we continue to find ways to accelerate our long-term goals. And I think next year or maybe even in June we are going to give you what's beyond the $7 billion, because our first market was how do you get the $7 billion, and when we said that, I think, it was a daunting task for us, it was a daunting task for the team, we are there, right? And I think the question really for us and I was investors, okay, you are at the $7 billion, what's next, and that's what we have got to be working on showing you that we are not done here. Thank you. I think when we look at the progression through the quarter we had some very extenuating circumstances last second quarter and early third quarter with fuel running up over $120 a barrel. And as we think about how we do fuel recapture on the way up, we also as inflation cools down and as fuel comes down, we are not going to keep all of that. We are going to keep as much of it as we can and we are not anticipating that big mobile and fuel, which is driving the sequential decrease. So we will see how it actually rolls out and hopefully it's better than that, but that's how we are thinking about how the year progresses in terms of absolute unit revenues. Yeah. We don't really talk about how our competitors behave. I think what we have seen is we have seen a very big shift in how and why people travel and trying to stay ahead of that in our own planning and make sure that we are capturing where people want to go and what products they want to buy and that's really our continued focus and it's been a very interesting journey. And as you look at individual market levels, we are very different sizes than we were pre-pandemic based on where our customers want us to take in these days. Yeah. I think that's about right. That's one of the -- we see the more engaged the customers with Delta, the higher their satisfaction is and so that's really part of that ecosystem that we are really trying to grow is, SkyMiles is an entry point, of course, as everybody knows it's free and now they have an incentive to do that, because there's an immediate benefit to join because you get the free WiFi and so how do we translate that ultimately into more loyal customers who eventually will wind up getting some of our other products and that's really what our flywheel is right now and how we are going to continue to press forward in terms of loyalty. We do those corporate surveys, and that's why we do them to see what our corporate partners are thinking about in terms of future travel and it was actually the last one we did, which is for future travel, was the best survey we have had since pre-pandemic in terms of their enthusiasm that more people would be flying in future months than we are flying in current or past months. As I said in the call, we are not counting on that in our current revenue forecast, because sometimes that doesn't come to fruition, but there's a sense of optimism from this pent-up demand for business travel that we see could potentially offset any weakness in the general economy. And we are taking a very cautious look, but -- and we are counting on it being stable and not growing dramatically, but it looks like people think it will grow. Clearly, in the early parts of the pandemic recovery, we saw some accelerated growth. I think we have been pretty consistent at the past couple of quarters and we see some stability in the booking curve at about 80% of revenue. So as you know, business travel usually has the shortest advanced purchase windows and is mostly close in. So we would not have any further visibility beyond the next 60 days to 90 days that would be of any significant help in charting that water. Sure. As you know, we had our own weather operations during the peak Christmas holiday travel period, and we saw after that, when we were fully recovered and Southwest was still not back in full swing that we had an uptick in our bookings. That's trended in highly competitive with Southwest markets a little bit into January, but we think that will resolve itself over the next six months to 12 months. Right. We will probably not, for the next couple of years see the flight numbers we did in 2019. We will get seat capacity restoration to 100%, which means that gauge will go up significantly. When you look at our fleet evolution that was always our plan was to continue to grow not by additional departures but by larger airplanes, more efficiency, less fuel burn, better products and services and so that's really what we are intending on doing. The pandemic accelerated that and so you have got our average gauge up by double digits right now. That's partly because we keep taking larger airplanes partly because the regional fleets are less restored. And we think that will normalize out over the next 18 months, but we will probably not for the foreseeable future get back to the flight levels, although we will match or exceed by the end of the year at the historic levels in terms of seat capacity. No. I think... ...that's why we have done these generational builds across our network is that, we knew that bigger gauge was coming, we needed to accommodate it and even for example, here in Atlanta, we have worked closely with the city to reconfigure the deconcourse to be wider than any of the other concourses to accommodate that increased gauge. So we have got short-, medium- and long-term plans to accommodate those gauges. But a lot of that was in our generational builds across the network and we don't think that it's going to be more crowded than it was in 2019 or feel more crowded."

            "name": "Dan Janki",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Glen. In 2022 we made significant progress restoring our financial foundation. We delivered earnings of $3.20 per share, with pre-tax income of $2.7 billion, ahead of our plan. Operating margins of 7.8% was driven by three quarters of double-digit margins. We improved profitability and the strong advanced bookings. We generated $6.2 billion of operating cash flow, enabling continued investment in our people, our fleet, our partners and technology. After gross CapEx of $6 billion, we generated $244 million of free cash flow. We ended the year with liquidity of $9.4 billion and adjusted net debt of $22.3 billion. Our adjusted net debt to EBITDAR was 5 times and our after-tax return on invested capital was 8.4%. We finished the year strong, reporting a $1.4 billion operating profit on a margin of 11.6% for the December quarter. Our non-fuel costs were 13.4% higher than 2019, in line with guidance, excluding a 1-point impact from the severe winter weather in late December. Now moving to guidance, as Ed mentioned, we are including all expected labor rate increases in our guidance metrics, including non-fuel CASM. As it relates to our pilots, if they vote to ratify the proposed agreement by March 1st, pay rates would be retroactive to January 1st. This results in a 3-point impact on our non-fuel unit costs for the year and in each of the quarters. Including this in the full year guidance we gave last month brings our 2023 non-fuel unit decline to 2% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. Delivering a competitive cost structure is a key financial priority. Delta has led the industry an investment in our people and our customers and this is embedded in our outlook, as is a full reset of regional costs and inflation. As we move through the year, scale and efficiency will drive a decline in 2023 non-fuel CASM versus 2022. While approaching 2019 capacity provides scale benefits, we are still bearing the cost to fully restore our network to the peak summer levels, with a continued emphasis on operational reliability during this ramp-up. We expect to complete our rebuild by the second half, with the majority of our flex fleet reactivated and training levels for our pilots reverting to historical levels. This will allow a significant shift of resources from training to production, giving us the confidence in our ability to deliver a fully restored network during the peak summer period, while enabling our operating teams to drive efficiency in the back half of the year. One unique item within the year is the pacing of our core maintenance, as we prepare to step up the network for summer flying with the first half year-over-year higher than the second -- and then lower in the second half of the year. While these dynamics impacting early part of the year, we expect 1Q non-fuel unit cost to increase 3% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. We expect the year-over-year unit cost to progressively improve through 2023 as we complete our rebuild and elevated maintenance activity, while driving efficiency across our operating groups. This cadence is consistent with our full year outlook for non-fuel unit cost to decline 2% to 4% year-over-year. With our outlook for revenue, we expect the March quarter operating margins to be 4% to 6% and earnings of $0.15 per share to $0.40 per share. For the full year, we are regulating our outlook for earnings of $5 per share to $6 per share and operating margins of 10% to 12%, delivering a 2-point to 4-point expansion of margins, including over 1-point impact from higher profit sharing. We expect the full year free cash flow to be more than $2 billion with gross CapEx of $5.5 billion. In 2023, non-operating expense is expected to be $470 million higher year-over-year. These results from non-cash pension expense increasing over $550 million year-over-year due to broad market declines, more than offsetting the reduction in interest expense from repaying debt. We plan to pay cash for our $2.4 billion in debt maturities, while opportunistically reducing debt with excess liquidity. This will bring our leverage to 3 to 3.5 target for 2023 and remaining on track for 2024 adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR to be 2 times to 3 times. Returning to investment grade metrics by 2024, while continuing to reinvest in the business remains our focus for capital allocation. In closing, I want to thank -- add my thanks to the Delta team and people for their hard work this year. We outperformed the first year of our three-year plan and we entered 2023 on track to generate a significant improvement in both earnings and cash flow. We remain confident in delivering on our 2024 target of $7 of earnings per share and generating over $4 billion of free cash flow. With that, I will turn it over back to Julie for our Q&A. Yeah. Certainly. There's two pieces in there. Maintenance being one, it's about a 2-point headwind in the first quarter and first half and it's driven by engine induction levels and scope of work related to that. As you get into the back half of the year, that's a 2-point to 3-point benefit year-over-year, so a 5-point progression from beginning to end. And then the second piece of that is related to the completion of our rebuild and those rebuild costs stepping down. Most of our rebuild over 85% of that cost is in the first half of the year. You don't have that in the back half of the year. And as Glen just talked about, one of the enablers that efficiency is, as we restore the core hubs, these low-cost subs, low CP most cost competitive as we put that capacity and that drives efficiency of our assets and our workforce. That is 5 points. So the 5 points related to that and the 5 points related to maintenance is 10-point progression as you go through the year from the beginning to the end and that drives that continuous cadence improvement as you go through the quarters. It will -- part of it is tied to the cost progression and as you see that progression being up, and I said to you get about a 10-point improvement in cost from beginning to end, that will drive your expansion of margins throughout the year as you progress, along with what then Glen talked about, which was the commercial rebuild related to the core. So you will see this progression. Certainly, year-over-year, the improvement versus the comp that we are coming off drives some material improvement here in the first quarter over $1 billion pre-tax, a big part of the step-up in earnings year-over-year, but you will also see improvement as we go through the year. And I think as we talked about at Investor Day, the multiyear progression on international, the structural elements here, right? The next-generation fleet that we are at, the reconfiguration of more premium seats with DPS, better cargo capability stronger partner network, all those are systematic drivers not only in this year but really on a multiyear basis. I think it's steady as it goes. We have been very consistent, very deliberate, very disciplined related to CapEx. We certainly had this period where this past year in 2022, there was some catch-up in there. We are continuing to do that here in 2023 for what was deferred for a couple of years. But I think as you exit 2024, you are normalized. Now, at the same time, we are getting bigger as an airline and growing from that perspective, but I think with -- it's a good foundation for us as it relates to where we are stepping off in 2024. Yeah. No. You saw it constrained markets throughout 2022 state elevated certainly was disrupted significantly in the second quarter, particularly we don't anticipate it being at those levels for the current year giving back. But I would say for the next 12 months to 18 months, I think, you are at least in a period where you are structurally constrained. The global flows for both oil and refined products have changed. Things that used to revert both gasoline diesel and jet coming out of Europe into the U.S. aren't taking place. Utilization of refineries are high and you get disruptions, you have seen it as the winter storms came through in December and incredibly low temperatures. Refineries were impacted and you are seeing the rippling effect here in January and the unusual nature even in the last seven days to 10 days, where the physical market is short. Jet many times throughout 2022 it was diesel and you see a spike. And then the -- as the refineries get the utilization back up and optimize you get a balancing, but they are still tight and we expect them to stay elevated. Yeah. The mainline asset utilization increases about -- mid single-digit about 5% as we progress through the year. So we get the benefit associated with that and as we talked about at Investor Day, we continue to get the benefit associated with gauge. We are carrying that under utilization regional... ... network absolutely in our run rate. Yes. 1.3 for the year. The first quarter think of it being closer to -- if it was ratable, it would be about 3.30 a quarter. First quarter will be a little bit higher. We think about it as 3.60 to 3.65 associated with it. And tax rate continues to be consistent, right, in that 24% to 24.5%. Normal -- yes. We have normal maturities at 2.4. We had 1.8 this past year and we ended up retiring $4.5 billion of debt. Ken and the team were opportunistic in regards to debt that we can take out that we think is higher cost and has good economic payback associated with it. And given our liquidity position, as we progress through this year, we will continue to look at those options. There are certainly a number out there that are targets for us, but we will either do it through how we have done it with through tenders, but also just as you go open market repurchases and being smart and going after the higher cost debt, that's a priority. We want to drive down that non-op interest line over time and the team is good at it. They have done it. Did it for a decade. They will continue to do it. About changing it, I think, it does -- when it may change in regards to how you look at some of your debt, some of them that are off of LIBOR and floating have become more attractive to retire in certain situations. So, but we are continuing to be focused on, as you know, it's reinvesting back in the business, but also this path to deleveraging. So continuing to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce debt and drive down those leverage ratios."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Cody. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our September quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs in our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we will take analyst questions and we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Bastian: Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we begin, I want to recognize all of those who have been impacted by Hurricanes Ian and Fiona, including Delta employees who live in the affected communities. We have contributed $600,000 to the Red Cross relief efforts and activated our Delta Care Fund to take care of our employees who have suffered loss. Delta will continue to support our people and our communities [Indiscernible] to recovery and rebuilding. The demand for air travel remains very strong, and that is reflected in today's results and outlook. We generated earnings of $1.51 per share in the September quarter. Our results mark clear financial progress as we report the highest quarterly revenue in Delta's history, 3% above the third quarter of 2019 and $1.5 billion of operating income, generating a 12% margin. This was our second quarter -- consecutive quarter of double-digit operating margins. And importantly, we achieved these results despite record high fuel prices and on capacity only 83% restored relative to 2019. Our customer satisfaction scores are running meaningfully above 2019, and loyalty to Delta has never been stronger, with record SkyMiles acquisitions and American Express results ahead of our plan. I want to sincerely thank the Delta people for their great work in delivering these results and restoring our operational reliability through a very difficult summit, delivering safe, reliable and on-time service for our customers remains our top priority, and no airline does this better than Delta. We saw strong consistent improvement in our operating metrics throughout the quarter. For example, excluding the impact of Hurricane Ian, we ran a 99.9% domestic completion factor in September and month-to-date in October with 90% arrivals on time. To put that in context, out of 120,000 mainline flights over the last 45 days, we had just 108 cancellations in total, performance that is even better than our pre-pandemic levels. And year-to-date, Delta remains in the number one industry position amongst our peer set in completion factor and on-time arrivals. After two years of delaying travel, it is clear that consumers are getting out and traveling the world. Business travel continues to recover in line with our expectations as bookings have improved after Labor Day and companies reconnect with their teams and their customers. And while consumer spend on experiences is growing, the airline industry revenues are still $20 billion to $30 billion below the historical trend against GDP, highlighting the significant opportunity still ahead. We expect our December quarter revenues to maintain this momentum, and we will be 5% to 9% higher than 2019. With strong demand, we expect earnings per share of $1 to $1.25 and a 9% to 11% operating margin. While we face numerous challenges and headwinds this year, Delta has demonstrated its resilience. We're ahead of our plan that we laid out for you last December on profitability and cash flow, and we expect to be free cash flow positive in 2022 this year. Our priority over the next six months is to prepare for full network restoration by next summer, consistent with our original plan, but always conditioned on continuing demand strength. This will support another meaningful step-up in profitability and cash flow next year as we stay on our path to earn over $7 of EPS and $4 billion of free cash in 2024. We'll provide more details on our outlook for 2023 and progress towards our long-term targets at an investor meeting that we will host December 14 in New York. As we think about our long-term plan, we had some really important achievements this quarter. Building on Delta's global network and partnerships, we strengthened our network with the recent DOT approval of our joint venture with LATAM. Together with LATAM, our JV will have the number one market position in South America. To support our best-in-class network, we continue to reshape our fleet and recently placed an order for 100 Boeing 737-10 aircraft. We're also expanding the power of our loyalty ecosystem with the recently announced Starbucks partnership, bringing two premier brands together. And this week, we announced a strategic partnership with an investment in Joby Aviation, aligning the industry's best airline with the innovation leader in developing eVTOL. Joby shares our vision of providing customers a premium experience. We're excited to help support Joby's long-term vision of faster, more reliable and more sustainable transit to the airport. In closing, while we are mindful of macroeconomic headwinds, the travel industry is experiencing a countercyclical recovery. Global demand is continuing to ramp as consumers shift spend to experiences, businesses return to travel and international markets continue to reopen. Demand has not come close to being quenched by a hectic summer travel season. At the same time, industry supply is constrained by aircraft availability, regional pilot shortages, and hiring and training needs. With record high fuel prices and increasing cost of capital, the hurdle rate is rising for incremental capacity across an industry that's still restoring its financial condition post-pandemic. Against this backdrop and coupled with meaningfully improved asset utilization, at Delta, we are uniquely positioned to grow our earnings and cash flow in 2023. At the same time, we will remain nimble and have the tools to manage through any changes in the overall environment. Over the last decade, Delta has structurally improved in significant ways, creating a trusted consumer brand built on a foundation as the most reliable airline globally driven by the very best professionals in the industry. And I truly believe that we are positioned to come through this period as a stronger airline than ever before. With that, let me hand it over to Glen, who can provide more details on our commercial performance.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to first thank our employees for their hard work restoring our operations and delivering for our customers during a very busy summer travel season. Demand for travel on Delta remains strong. Investments in our products, airport service and the liability are reshaping customer perceptions and driving record satisfaction scores. Brand affinity supports our revenue premium to the industry, and we're making meaningful progress against our multiyear commercial strategy. September quarter results reflect momentum in premium products and loyalty, supporting continued diversification of our revenues. This quarter, a record 54% of our total revenue was generated by premium products and diverse revenue streams. We expect this to grow to 60% by 2024. September quarter revenues of $12.8 billion is a new quarterly record and 3% higher than 2019 on 17% less capacity. Hurricane Ian impacted revenues by approximately $70 million, with the impact evenly split between the third and fourth quarters. Total unit revenues finished 23.4% higher versus 2019, improving three points sequentially as international demand accelerated. Demand was strong throughout the quarter, with premium revenue growth outpacing main cabin by 10 points. Delta Premium Select is performing well ahead of our expectations as we expand the offering to more of our international network every day. We see continued runway ahead with the return of business travel, complementing strength in premium leisure. Our growing loyalty base drives high-margin revenue and supports continued growth in our valuable co-brand relationship with American Express. SkyMiles acquisitions are running 40% above 2019 with over 60% of our passenger revenues now generated by SkyMiles members. In the third quarter, record spend and strong acquisitions on our Amex co-brand cards resulted in $1.4 billion of Amex remuneration. This was 37% higher than 2019, and we now expect 2022 remuneration of $5.5 billion, further reinforcing our confidence in achieving our $7 billion target in 2024. Other revenue streams continue to perform well, with cargo revenue up 27% and MRO revenues up 4% versus '19. Business travel continues to improve. We expect corporate sales recovery in the December quarter in the low- to mid-80s at a system level. Importantly, less recovered sectors like banking, consulting and consumer services have all seen double-digit growth post Labor Day, helping bring New York largely in line with domestic system. We have growing confidence that while there will be changes, corporate travel will fully recover and increased workplace flexibility is creating new travel patterns. Our recent corporate survey validates our perspective with nearly 90% of accounts expecting near travel to stay the same or increase as we move into the fourth quarter. That optimism is also reflected in GBTA's recent travel survey where 80% of respondents expect travel volumes to increase in 2023 compared to '22. On the consumer side, domestic revenue remains well ahead of 2019, with international consumer revenue now fully restored. International is being led by the transatlantic where revenue was 12% higher than 2019 on 89% capacity restoration. Pacific was the most improved entity in the quarter and generated the highest unit revenue growth. We are encouraged by how the Pacific recovery is progressing, led by strong demand in our hub in Korea and to Australia. And we expect continued improvement as Japan reopens. Turning to the December quarter. Bookings for travel and spending on our co-brand cards continue to show healthy trends. We expect our revenue compared to 2019 will continue to improve in fourth quarter, up 5% to 9% on 8% to 9% less capacity. Demand for transatlantic travel is extending well into the fall. Starting in October, we anticipate flying more transatlantic capacity than 2019, making it the first geography to exceed 2019 capacity levels. And while European currencies are down versus the dollar, foreign yields are more than offsetting the foreign exchange impact, and U.S. demand is driving higher U.S. point of sale than 2019. October and November revenue is trending well. The December month will be impacted by an elongated period between the holidays and more return travel than usual pushed into January. Demand for the entire holiday period, however, is very robust. Fourth quarter unit revenues are expected to be up mid-teens versus 2019 as we continue to restore international capacity and increase domestic stage length. During the pandemic and through 2022, we set out a goal to improve our share in coastal gateways to become the leading global carrier in these important revenue centers, and I am proud of the team for successfully achieving this goal. Looking to 2023, we are shifting our focus to our core hubs, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Detroit and Salt Lake City, with approximately 75% of domestic seat growth dedicated to full restoration of our higher-margin core hubs. As our plan progresses, Delta will continue to prioritize our people and our customers, and extend our competitive advantages. In closing, we're coming into the final quarter of the year with a healthy demand backdrop, running the most reliable operation and exceeding our key commercial goals. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials.\nDan Janki: Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. The September quarter demonstrated progress on our financial priorities to drive margin improvement and reduce debt. We reported a $1.5 billion operating profit, and that's on a margin of 11.6%, our second consecutive quarter with a double-digit operating margin. That is on a network that's 17% smaller than 2019. Our non-unit fuel costs were 22.5% higher, in line with guidance, excluding the impact of the hurricane on capacity. The refinery generated profit of $192 million partially offsetting the impact of volatile crack spreads. Gross CapEx spend was $1.5 billion as we took delivery of 11 aircraft, including five A321neos, which are generating margins approximately 10 points higher than the aircraft they're replacing. CapEx was lower than our guidance, with fewer delivery -- with a few delivery delays, and we now expect CapEx spend of $5.7 billion for the full year. We ended the quarter with $20.5 billion of adjusted net debt. We repaid $1.8 billion of debt during the quarter as we continue to manage down our maturities over the next several years. This brings our debt repayment to over $4 billion year-to-date, reducing our run rate interest expense and reflecting our continued focus on returning to investment-grade metrics by 2024. For the December quarter, we expect earnings to be between $1 and $1.25 per share and an operating margin of 9% to 11%. Fuel prices remain volatile. With the most recent move up last week, we expect fourth quarter adjusted fuel price per gallon between $3.35 and $3.55. This includes $105 million contribution from the refinery equating to a $0.23 per gallon benefit. We expect the December quarter unit cost to be 12% to 13% higher than 2019. This is a 10-point improvement sequentially and shows clear progress as capacity restoration increases from the low 80% to low 90%. It's taken significant resources to rebuild the airline with industry-leading reliability. We are nearing the final stages with the workforce now in line with 2019. From here, we expect further benefit from scale as we reach full network restoration and better utilization of our fleet, our hubs and our workforce. The incremental cost to restore additional capacity is low as the resources are already in place, reducing unit costs. As Glen noted, much of our growth next year will be in our lowest cost core hubs through increased mainline aircraft utilization. Approximately 75% of our domestic seat growth in 2023 will be in our core hubs, including 45% from Atlanta alone. Further, between inefficiencies and rebuild expenses, we are carrying over $1 billion of excess costs in 2022. With the teams in place and the operations running reliable, we are seeing early improvements in efficiency. October metrics are pacing ahead of September, and we expect to return to historic levels as elevated training and the network normalized next summer. Achieving scale while restoring efficiency are Delta's largest CASM levers, these are within our control based on the pace of restoration and running an operation in line with Delta's standard of excellence. We know managing cost down is the best protection from economic uncertainty, and it is a company-wide priority. We are making progress restoring our financial foundation with significant profitability and positive cash flow this year. As we fully restore our network and unit costs improve, we expect another step-up in earnings next year, resulting in meaningful cash flow to further reduce our debt on path to our long-term targets. We are confident in delivering a competitive cost structure and our 2024 mid-teen margin target. In closing, I want to recognize the Delta entire global team for the operational improvements they delivered over the past few months. We are on track for meaningful and well-deserved employee profit-sharing payments, and I look forward to celebrating with our employees in February. Now with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q& A.\nJulie Stewart: Cody, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: You touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks, but the opportunity in Atlanta [Technical Difficulty].\nJulie Stewart: Conor, you're cutting out. Can you please repeat your question?\nConor Cunningham: Is this better?\nJulie Stewart: Try again.\nConor Cunningham: Is that better?\nJulie Stewart: Yes.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Cool. You touched about the opportunity in Atlanta and the other core markets in 2023, and I think that's a really powerful trend for you guys. And I was just wondering if you could unpack it a little bit more, just -- I think you're really [Technical Difficulty] flow traffic. And you kind of -- your priority some other hub markets or other markets [Technical Difficulty] recovery. So could you just talk about the margin profile of flow traffic in general and just how you expect that to trend into next year?\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. Well, we set really two priorities during the pandemic that we wanted to come through that we thought would be important for the long-term strength of the franchise, and one was to improve our competitive positions in the coastal gateways. And we've certainly completed that as we exited the pandemic and get into a more normalized demand sets. So if you look at places like Los Angeles where we've now taken the number one position or Boston in terms of revenue, same in Boston, and we've strengthened our position in key markets like Seattle. So that was very important for us. The other thing to do was to not lose share in our core, and that was really the very tricky part. So we went in with a share in our core hubs of about 58% to 59% when you added them all up. And our goal is to exit at 60% or above, and we did that as well. So if you think about our core being approximately 20 points less restored than the coastal gateways, which are now fully restored or actually growing, maintain your core hub share or actually increase it, there was a lot of focus on that through the revenue management systems. So we choked off what I would say is more of our traditional flow in very key markets where Delta has historically been the leading carrier, particularly in the Southeast. And so as we head into -- and these customers or our customers are in our loyalty program. But in a lot of cases, they couldn't get fares that were competitive on Delta because we didn't have the seats to produce those. And really, as we head into 2023, our task that we've assigned our team is to get those historical high-yield flow customers back on Delta. And that's really our -- what our rebuild phase for 2023 is all about.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: I was - to achieve those kind of goals that you just talked about on the pilot side, could you detail a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of training bottlenecks and pilot staffing on the mainline side as well as maybe attrition and staffing levels on the regional side?\nEd Bastian: I could take it, Savi. We continue to make good progress in clearing those bottlenecks and getting our pilots into seats and categories every week. We're producing more and more pilots back to the operation. As we said in our remarks, our goal is to be in a position to have our network fully restored by the summer, and the pilots are obviously a big part of that.\nSavi Syth: But can you provide a little bit more color on the regional side given that's a little more unique as to what's happening there and not just about training throughput? Is some of the kind of the changes that you're seeing in the industry in terms of pilot rates and things like that, is that having an impact? What's Delta doing to make sure you're rebuilding those -- that capacity?\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. Well, clearly, the labor rates at the regional carriers have moved during the pandemic, and they're at significantly higher rates than they were pre-pandemic. I think long-term conventional wisdom is that will mean that the regional fleet in the long run are smaller. In the short run, we're wanting to get to a stabilization of demand for pilots, and we think that will occur sometime in '23. These new higher rates should keep more people in place. And so -- but we don't think it will be fully restored until probably '24, '25 at the earliest. And we're uniquely positioned there because we have the, of course, A220s, which we're delivering every month or so. And we've reactivated the 717s, which were actually not in our original plan for reactivation, but we've leaned on them pretty heavily to rebuild more quickly. And we think it's a better product. And now with the new labor rates, it's at lower unit cost as well as, yes, much lower unit cost than pre-pandemic. So I think we're uniquely positioned there with really the only major carrier that has these plethora of 100-seat airplanes. And we'll see what happens with the regionals in '23, but we think we're near the bottom in terms of pilot availability there.\nEd Bastian: And one other thing I'd add is that we have the lowest regional jet footprint in the industry. We've been on a path, Savi, over the last decade to eliminate the 50-seat regional jet, and we're just about there. So we are out of that category. We do have 325 two-class regional jets, which we will continue to maintain going forward, but we are far less exposed than others to the -- some of this regional pilot shortage issue.\nOperator: We'll now move on to our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Glen, I'm sure you've gotten this from a lot of investors. But obviously, folks are worried about a looming recession in the U.S. just driven by rates and inflation. And we're reminded of that again today. But obviously, your revenue guidance is pretty positive, but I do think it's a sequential decline in your yields. Can you talk to the components there? Because I know your long-haul flying is coming up as well. Just, if you're seeing any weakness or softness across your geographies.\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes. I think that's a great question, and I'm happy to explain it. Really, it's three main factors. One is international restoration continuing in 4Q as we -- as Pacific continues to open up, and we continue to increase our capacity in the Pacific that has downward pressure on RASM. Domestic stage is going up dramatically and at a different rate than some of our competitors and all of our competitors as we head into 4Q. That's really being driven by a lot of additional flying into Hawaii from the East Coast hubs that we didn't have pre-pandemic. And lastly, it's that period and the shift of the holiday return in December where December will be below trend, and January will be above trend. So those are the three main factors that are driving the sequential decline. And we're not seeing -- taking those out, we're not really seeing a decline at the market level. It's actually continuing to be quite strong, and we don't just see any impact yet. We're looking, of course, vigilant of looking for it, and we'll make adjustments as necessary if it does. But I think Ed was very clear earlier that we think that we have -- as an industry, very off trend in terms of our percent of GDP and just getting back to that represents a huge upside to the industry.\nBrandon Oglenski: And I guess related to that, can you talk about business travel recovery in the quarter and what you're seeing right now in the fourth quarter?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes. I think we outlined at earlier conferences that we've seen about a 10-point improvement between 3Q and 4Q, and we see that continuing through 4Q. So, we're now in the low to mid-80s in terms of revenue, with traffic being about 10 points below that. And that's what we see as we head into the end of the year.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Ed, I want to go back to the comment that you made in your opening comments. You said something about $20 billion to $30 billion on the table relative to GDP. Can you shed some light on that? And are you assuming that we get back to that historical relationship? Or are you building in some cushion there, if you could elaborate?\nEd Bastian: Sure, Mike. That's an industry number, as you can appreciate. And that gets you closer to the historical relationship. We've seen over many, many years, it's a very sticky relationship. We saw it fall a bit after 9/11, and we saw it bounce back. We saw it fall during the recession. We've seen it bounce back. And we certainly saw it the biggest fall ever coming back from the pandemic. So one of the things that we're seeing is such outsized demand for our product across the board. And when you couple that as well with the industry constraints that we also talked about, that is also keeping the pricing strong at the same time. So whether we get back to the full $20 billion or $30 billion, I don't know, but I think we're gaining on it as we go.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Great. And then just a quick one, Glen, on the percentage of your total revenue that ties to a premium and diverse revenue streams. I think we're at 54% now, but the goal is to get to 60% by 2024. That seems somewhat conservative, but maybe you're envisioning just a much bigger pie as other segments recover like Asia Pacific, and that's probably why it's taking that much longer. Am I thinking about that correctly? Or is there something else going into that?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think we're very, very confident in getting to 60% given that we've been less restored internationally, and internationally has actually a higher component of premium revenues and as well as the new fleets coming in and the continuation of growth at American Express and [indiscernible]. I think the one that we're not confident with right now is cargo for 2024. We've seen some lowering yields, but that's being more than offset by the international restoration. So I don't see that continuing to grow at double digits as we head into '24. But I think 60%, as you pointed out, was our aspirational target. As we get closer and closer to it, it looks like it's -- we may need to increase that as we get closer to '24.\nOperator: We'll now move on to our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: So Dan, you mentioned the cost of adding incremental capacity right now is very low as we get through to '23. '24. Can you talk about how low that is relative to the average? And then maybe as a follow-on, Ed or Glen, can you talk to the topic of maintaining capacity discipline, right? Obviously, if there's a way to unlock cost, you want to unlock the cost, but you also don't necessarily want to flood the market. How would you suggest we kind of sue the investor concerns about that tension between adding capacity to lower cost versus potentially adding too much capacity and tipping over the fair cart?\nDan Janki: Okay. First, on the cost opportunity and the incremental costs associated with it. When you think about where we are this year in '22, we're 18 points higher on a unit cost basis versus '19. And in there, there's over nine points related to scale and the ability to put scale in going from 85% restored to being fully restored. That would go in at low incremental CASM in the $0.03 to $0.04 range. And then there's another five points related to -- I talked about over $1 billion related to the rebuild and inefficiencies. About half -- almost half of that is rebuilt. And when you think about that bucket, half of that is just the hiring and training intensity that we're under. And that will, as Ed talked about, as we put people back in production that will sunset. And then the other piece is split between elevated over time as we've protected the operation and also the reactivation of the fleet from that product that isn't normal run rate maintenance. So that's really where you get the 14 points of opportunity of the 18, but the incremental piece is at nine points, which is very attractive incremental growth at low CASM.\nGlen Hauenstein: On capacity, we are just going to continue to monitor it as we move forward. And each one -- each market is different. And when we look at it not at an aggregate level, but at a market level to ensure that our margins stay where we need them to be. And so I think that's our -- has been our approach historically. It's worked quite well. And our approach moving forward is that it's a ctually a very granular thing. And what we've seen is demand has come back very different in 2022 than it left in 2019, although the aggregates are now above where we were in '19, where people are flying and why they're flying is very different. And so that's where we're going to continue to focus on, seeing opportunities and capitalizing them in '23 as we move forward with our rebuilt.\nEd Bastian: And David, if I could add to Glen's comments, as you also appreciate, we've been, by far, the most cautious about building back our network given that we wanted to make certain we're doing it reliably, and we're doing it with our customers and our people in mind, first and foremost. And so a good chunk of the restoration is solely that, just getting back up to our normalized industry share our full capacity and utilization of the airline. There are a lot more governors in this environment on the capacity than ever before, whether it's high-fuel prices, high-cost capital, difficulty getting pilot staffed, typically OEMs producing aircraft. So I think with respect to investor questions around overall capacity levels, I feel very comfortable with what we're doing here at Delta.\nDavid Vernon: So is it fair to say that profitability is more important than achieving some unit costs and market share goal?\nEd Bastian: Of course, it's always about profitability and margins. And that's why I said in my remarks, I think we are uniquely positioned to do both, to grow where we haven't had the opportunity to grow as quickly as others have grown with strong demand supporting that, coupled with a significant unit cost benefit as we move forward because we already own all the assets and we already have the full staffing numbers pretty much on property.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe I wanted to ask a big picture question, Ed. Industry unit revenues are up fairly substantially over the long-term trend due to a number of factors you guys have talked about. I know you don't want to comment on forward pricing trends for you, but broadly about the industry. Do you think that through the pandemic, with the growth of expansion of premium, growth of loyalty products and other shifts, do you think that there's a structural shift in the way airlines think about pricing and the consumer takes that price?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes. I don't -- we don't ever comment on forward pricing. And I think what you've seen is that the industry has done a good job historically now in recovering the higher cost in both fuel and nonfuel. And I don't see anything that would indicate that, that's not going to be the case moving forward.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Then maybe just a quick follow-up. Can you just talk about the strength of the dollar versus other currencies and then how that's potentially affecting international demand at all?\nGlen Hauenstein: Absolutely, great question. As we know, the dollar is at historic highs right now. And normally, we would see that impacting our offshore point of sale in terms of realized fares. But given the demand and supply balance that's existing right now in all of the international marketplaces that we serve, we see that not materializing. The fare increases have more than offset the lower currency rates. And indeed, the onshore tracking as a percent of 2019 is roughly in sync with offshore revenue, so really good balance. And what we've also seen is given the strength of the dollar, that outbound travel has more than offset a bit of weakness in terms of the outbound travel from the foreign point of sale. So all in all, that's been a very positive mix for us. At a service level, you might look at it and say that could be trouble. But for us, it's not been trouble as Delta.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So on the Amex side, $5.5 billion, you're talking about going to $7.5 billion by $24 million. How do you think about '23? Is it linear? How does the downturn in consumer spending impact that trajectory?\nGlen Hauenstein: I'd say given where we sit right now, we are very confident in the $5.5 billion, and we have some rate adjustments that occur in '23 that give you a good way to the $7 billion, and then the continued acquisitions. I think we're -- we have some cushion in there right now. And it's not a stretch objective to get to $7 billion in '24 as we sit today. And so there's a little cushion in there should we see revenues plateau. Well, having said that, we have not seen card spend plateau. And although we have a record number of accounts in force, we're also seeing record spend on individual cards right up until today. So I mean this is really current numbers that we're looking at. And so while we're mindful that, that may trend down a little bit, I think we've got some cushion in there given the strong acquisition and, if any, the brand.\nScott Group: Okay. And then with all the talk about the excess cost in the network right now and restoring the network, what's your degree of confidence that CASM could be down year-over-year, '23 versus '22, and you can maintain sort of double-digit margin even if pricing starts to moderate?\nDan Janki: Yes. It goes back to a little bit what I talked about earlier. When you think about sequentially year-over-year, we're up 18 points. So our confidence is as high as it relates to the 14 points that I talked about in an opportunity for clear improvement because of the capacity going in, 15 points alone drives over nine points of that. The other one I gave you a lot of color on it is regarding the rebuilt cost, and those will certainly sunset and dissipate as we complete the rebuild. And then I think the last one is the efficiency, which is the other half of that five-point, and we'll get that over time. That's about the proficient -- the workforce and our resources getting more effective It certainly is helped by the operational reliability that is foundational to that as that happens. And we see that the workforce will get the hours more aligned to the operations. And the underlying processes and efficiencies will come through.\nEd Bastian: And Scott, if I could wrap that, is that when you think about next year, obviously, we're going to be bringing a fair bit of capacity into the domestic system. That's going to help with what Glen mentioned earlier, a lot of our customers are priced out of our products. And so, we're going to be bringing more affordability, opening us up to additional buckets of demand. Yet at the same time, the incremental marginal cost of delivering that supply is substantially lower than any modest price adjustments we would see.\nOperator: We'll now move on to our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Glen, when I look at kind of your domestic passenger revenues, 3Q, they were up two. And 2Q, they were up three. What do you think it takes to get the domestic network growth accelerating? Is it just the capacity adds in your core hubs that you spoke of earlier on? Or should we just think about the opening up of international markets being the main driver of the revenue recovery over the next few quarters?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think it's both, right, is that -- and pretty evenly distributed. We have first time forever we're actually now bigger in the transatlantic in the month of October than we were in October of '19 and with very successful unit revenues and improved profitability there. So I think as we head through the winter, it's international growth. We have LATAM now really starting to come online in earnest. And then the Japan opening in -- right now is a very exciting thing for us being a historically very large carrier in Japan. So, if the international marketplaces are open and open without restrictions, we see robust demand, and we see that continuing to be our backdrop. We see -- we have good visibility now to the winter in Europe because the APs are a little bit longer in Europe. And so, now we're thinking about the spring. And I can't imagine that as we get to spring and summer of next year that we don't see another robust demand because we did miss three years of demand for the leisure travel to Europe. So people run out of time, myself included, and I think, gosh, how many years do I have left to do that? And so I think we have a really good backdrop there. And then domestically, these are customers that we know want to fly Delta. These are in our core regional markets that we just weren't able to produce capacity at attractive inventory levels that they would want to purchase on Delta. And as we bring those down, as Ed mentioned earlier, as we bring those relative fair premiums down, as we open up the hubs, we think that's going to be some relatively easy lifting for us.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. That's helpful. And just wanted to follow up from an earlier question as regard to the improved training pipeline that Ed mentioned earlier, look, you've been very consistent about carefully building back the network by next summer. But if you wanted to, would you have enough pilot availability and enough labor to accelerate that network restoration? Not saying that you will, but I'm just trying to get a sense of where you stand just in terms of the pipeline the training backlog.\nEd Bastian: You can expect our network rebuild to be disciplined. It's going to steadily grow. But we're not going to fall in the trap we were last spring where we pushed ourselves too hard. So we learned from that. We're not going to accelerate it faster, and we're ready to deliver.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Glen, you commented a couple of times on corporate recovering, but looking different. Hoping you can expand on that, but also include leisure. And just a couple of examples, looking at JPMorgan employee patterns, Friday meetings are increasingly difficult to get. So most of our employees are coming back Thursday night instead, I'm seeing people leave earlier for Thanksgiving since they know they can work on the road. I'm just looking for more examples of these type of shifts and, more importantly, whether revenue management and scheduling have to evolve to take advantage of it.\nGlen Hauenstein: I think they already have. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, that the demand sets are very different than they were in 2019 in terms of places people are going, in terms of times that they're going. And we're making those adjustments. I think one of the more interesting things, as you mentioned, Monday -- Sunday night outbound, Monday morning outbound used to be the peak. That's now bleeding into Tuesday, out Tuesday, back Thursday, so some shorter trips midweek. It's bleeding into people, taking -- mixing business and leisure. So I know myself, I went to Paris last week for meetings, and I spent the weekend for leisure and before I probably would have just come back. So I think we see that. We see in the holidays with people not having to necessarily be in the office as regularly as they did before the pandemic, and we see people stretching out the holiday. So Sunday night, Monday morning -- Sunday night returns or the Sunday after Thanksgiving was historically the highest revenue day we had in our network. That's now a little bit lighter, and we see that travel moving into Monday and Tuesday returns. So yes -- and we've been making those adjustments along the way, and I think pretty successfully. And I think it's pretty exciting, right, that it's coming -- in aggregate, it's coming back differently, but it's coming back even stronger.\nJamie Baker: Okay. And quickly for Ed. So Mark and I have been doing quite a bit of work on LATAM. You referenced it before now that the JBA is in place. Can you update us on the partnership? I mean how have your forecast changed because of their restructuring as well as the industry dynamic in South America? How should we think about the contribution of Delta going forward? Just an update there would be appreciated.\nEd Bastian: Sure. A couple of things that have changed. One, as you know, they've also worked through the very difficult restructuring. And they're still not out of the court process, though they expect to be out sometime next month. So, we're anxious to see them out, and that's going to provide them some additional opportunities to start to grow and really take advantage of the powerhouse they've become as well as the substantial reduction in cost as well as balance sheet -- reductions on debt that they've been able to achieve through the bankruptcy process. We just got the ATI from DOT, and we're excited about that. So we haven't really been able to talk in three years to them at a detailed level about the JV itself, though those meetings are beginning literally as we speak. And it's a little bit of a delayed response, but there's nothing in there that we laid out three years ago when we announced the investment in LATAM that I'm any less excited for. I think if anything, we're going to have an accelerated impact there. The competitive balance in South America is less intense. There's a lot of local airlines got hit by the pandemic pretty hard. And you look at them, you look at what we're doing with Aeromexico in the same time, we see a lot of growth potential for Delta as well as the JV.\nOperator: We'll then move on to our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Most of my questions have been asked. But maybe one for Glen on seasonality and sort of getting back to normal seasonality, which some other carriers have referred to, can you just talk about which regions, if any, are sort of back to normal and maybe contrast domestic with some of the international regions, which are probably outperforming sequentially?\nGlen Hauenstein: I'd say there's a new normal on all of this. And while we do start to see seasonality patterns reemerging that we're not as present in the early stages of the rebuild, they're not as acute maybe as they were pre-pandemic. So we had a fantastic September to Florida, absent of the hurricane, which you wouldn't have thought. If you look at September, which is historically one of the worst months for Florida, you couldn't buy a ticket to Disney. We had some people who were on break here, and they said they wanted to go to Disney with their families, and they couldn't buy a ticket. It's closed out. And so I think we've seen this shift. And as airfares have increased and as hotels have increased and the whole -- people are also moving to the shoulders a little bit more because they can take advantage of the fact that on the margin, it's a little bit less expensive, and they have more flexibility with their work that they don't necessarily need to be in the office on those days. So I think yes, there are definitely things that are reappearing in terms of more traditional seasonality. But I think also, there are a lot of things that are offsetting that muting it and making it a little bit less pronounced as it was pre-pandemic.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful. And then maybe just one for Dan. Just given the move in rates, any high-level thoughts on pension gains versus interest expense? And any particular pieces of debt that you'll need to roll in 2023 and how we should be thinking about that?\nDan Janki: Yes, certainly. As it relates to the debt stack, 17% of our debt is variable, and the size of that relative to our cash position, our cash position to outsize. So as you have increasing rates, actually, interest income will outpace interest expense meaningful through that period of time. On the pension, you have both the -- when you think about it, rates reduce your liability, change your interest expense. Those are fairly neutral as you're going forward, certainly change in your asset returns versus your expected performance. And given how debt and -- the debt markets and equity markets have moved, we've underperformed the expected target rate. So you smooth those into earnings over a 20-year period, and then you earn off a lower rate. So that would create a headwind. As you think about going forward, we'll talk more about that in December. We had that stepping down somewhat, but not to the degree that it will. But interest expense is ahead. As we've been ahead on, on managing down our debt levels and ahead on that, our interest expense is coming in better, and our interest income will be better, which will be a partial offset to that.\nOperator: We'll then move on to our next question from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: I just wanted to confirm something that I heard you say about the holiday season being extended and that kind of pushing some demand into January. Can you unpack that a little bit and kind of talk about how much that impacted your 4Q comps versus 2019? And also, did you see something similar over the summer into the fall where do you think that some people who may have been priced at of traveling over the summer are now traveling in the fall?\nGlen Hauenstein: No. I think it's mostly the fact -- just a calendar shift of where the returns are. And so, I think that's -- and we think it's about two points of sequential decline from -- in our 23.5 to 17, about two points of that is a shift of some of the returns of the holiday into January.\nJulie Stewart: We'll now go to our final analyst question.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Appreciate the time. So team, here's my question. As you think about the shift in mix that you've been talking about, not just this quarter, but most of the year, how should we think about the importance of loyalty? You've talked about the increase in SkyMile cards and the spend you're seeing. But I have to think that loyalty is shifting kind of away from that business traveler to the leisure traveler. So how should we think about that going forward?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, Helane, I think at a macro level is that whatever your purpose was, the redemptions that carried at the end, was always for the leisure travel. And so as people continue to see our brand evolving and want to become involved with it, whether or not it's for business or for leisure, we've seen the opportunity to continue to grow the program itself at record pace, which is very exciting and, I think, a real testament to the brand strength and all the hard work that delta people put out every day. And now it's our job to take that brand strength and turn it into profitability. And of course, we do that through using those as prospects for our American Express card, but we're also increasingly making our ecosystem broader. And I think just yesterday, we had a very claiming announcement about partnering with Starbucks and linking our programs together. And I think creating an exciting dynamic ecosystem that is the cornerstone of our loyalty program, which is, of course, based on the fantastic airline that Delta runs every day, is really the base of it. But we are very excited about where we can take this over the next five years in terms of expanding that loyalty platform to be more than just Delta as an airline.\nJulie Stewart: All right. With that, we'll wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Trebor Banstetter, our Managing Director of Enterprise and Leader Communications, to start the media questions.\nTrebor Banstetter: Thank you, Julie. Cody, as we transition to the media Q&A, please remind all the reporters on the call the process for joining the queue. We're going to try to get to as many questions as we can in our remaining time.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.\nMary Schlangenstein: I wanted to first get a quick clarification. When you were talking about the regional capacity being constrained -- continuing to be constrained, and thus, your capacity being constrained by the pilot shortage, I thought I understood you to say you don't expect the full restoration at the regional level until '24, '25 at the earliest. I wanted to make sure I was hearing that correctly and whether you're talking about just Delta or if you're talking about the industry there.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I can't speak to the industry. I can speak for Delta. And yes, you've got it right, '24 to '25 is when we think we'll have the utilization back to historic levels on all the equipment we have contracted.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. And my second question was in terms of -- during the pandemic where you had a lot of leisure travelers who were flying, opting to buy up into premium seats because a lot of them were empty, are you still seeing that same thing? Are you seeing a lot of them buying up? Or do you -- have you seen that pull back now and not happening quite so much?\nGlen Hauenstein: It's strengthening as we get -- come out of the pandemic. So we're very excited. And I think we highlighted in the call that our recovery is being led by premium products. And premium products -- restoration is 10 points ahead, coach of main cabin and basic economy. So very excited about people getting used to this, people enjoying it and intend to repurchase is over 70%. So you see the customers coming back for more of this as well.\nMary Schlangenstein: And have you dropped the number of basic economy fares that you offer per flight or even total?\nGlen Hauenstein: That fluctuates every day based on demand and supply. So in general, it's been trending lower, but that could reverse itself today or tomorrow. So, it's not something we actively manage. It's kind of a daily occurrence.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from David Slotnick with TPG.\nDavid Slotnick: I'm wondering just with the growth in co-brand spend and card acquisitions and everything, are you seeing more numbers just year-over-year and year over '19 meeting medallion status or meeting the higher levels of status?\nGlen Hauenstein: Absolutely. And we want to continue to evolve our program today. It's premium for our most premium customers. And as you all know, we announced some changes for the '24 program earlier this month, which was really designed to ensure that we had the correct people. We were the most generous, as you know, also during the pandemic in extending benefit. So we actually have seen an incredible increase in the number of our most premium customers. And -- but our intent is to make sure that everybody who is a premium customer has a really premium experience. So, we've got to balance that off.\nDavid Slotnick: And then just considering the capacity cuts this summer and then the capacity discipline that we've seen going forward, I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on just outlook for the holiday season, what we're going to see in terms of operational reliability?\nEd Bastian: We will deliver the type of experience for our customers that they expect, which will be continuing to run just a very, very strong operation. One of the things that Glen talked about earlier is the shift of travel within the holiday period itself. And I think you're going to see a more normalized flow than you would typically do. Holidays tend to be very peaky on the highest days and lighter on some of the less -- lower travel days. And with travelers having a lot more flexibility and mobility relative to work, I think you're going to see a busy period for the Thanksgiving week throughout the week. And that's going to help us operationally a bit as well, managing flow. And I think you'll also see that over the Christmas, New Year break as well.\nOperator: We'll take your next question from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: I guess just kind of thinking about the economy broadly. Just curious, from your vantage point, where do we think the economy is? Like are we headed towards recession? But it -- maybe you want where travel is more resilient than it's been in the past? Are we not? I guess just -- you guys have a pretty -- big picture view from where you sit, so just curious for your thoughts.\nEd Bastian: We mentioned in our remarks that -- and I really do believe it. So the airline industry, not just Delta, is in a countercyclical recovery because we're still building back from where we were. And so the amount of supply that's in the market probably has already taken into account somewhat of any recessionary risks. We're not operating at Delta anywhere close to what we used to operate in the past, and that's why the demand of our product and the pricing for the product has been so strong. Our crystal ball is good for 90 to 120 days. After that, it gets a little murky. Our advanced bookings don't go out too much further than that in large numbers. But from what we can see and what our big corporates are telling us is that the travel sector of the economy is going to be very strong through the quarter and into the new year. So that's the best we can. I can't speak for the broader economy. I know there's some pretty significant macro shifts going on in spending out of goods and into services, which we are beneficiary of. Of course, we contributed the last two years to the other side of that, and we're glad to see people back on the road.\nAlison Sider: And then if I could ask one more. Just curious how you're thinking about share repurchases like you can sort of see that becoming a political issue already. I'm just curious how much sort of the pushback we've already seen from certain lawmakers and labor groups, how much that factors into your thinking about that?\nEd Bastian: Our sole priority at Delta is to make sure that any excess cash that we're generating is used to pay down debt. And we acquired a meaningful amount of debt during the pandemic. And we want to get our investment-grade rating back, as we've talked. So over the next couple of years, that will be our -- and beyond, by the way, not just the next couple of years, that will still be the top priority for any excess cash. And of course, we'll also be using our cash to continue to invest in the business and invest in our people. So that's where the cash is going. I don't see any share repurchases happening here at Delta for the foreseeable future.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Leslie Josephs of CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Delta has been putting in a lot of effort to position itself for a premium airline, and there's a lot of buyout into the premium cabins. Longer term, do you see a need for basic economy anymore? And then just second question, how much bigger would the airline be if it did have -- was it up-to-date in pilot training, hiring? And how many aircraft it had?\nGlen Hauenstein: Basic economy is not a hard cabin. It's an availability of a fare, and we want to keep that in place. It's a very effective tool. We haven't used it as much historically because we've been so full. But as we get to a more normalized environment, there probably will be more basic economy in -- available in '23 than there were in '24. And we created that because the way that the ultra-low-cost carriers price their products where they don't show you all of the add-ons, they show you a very low intro fare and then add on everything from carry-ons to a soda. And so, we wanted to have a relatively de-counted product, although it's still far superior to the product that you buy on the ULCCs. It doesn't have all the products and the upgradability that the higher fare structures do. And it's a very effective competitive tool. But as I mentioned earlier, it's -- the fare structures are there, and they're either available because there -- we're not selling out on airplanes or they're not. And so that's the way we've created it, and it's not a cabinet in and of itself where the premium products are actually hard cabins. They're Comfort+ or Delta Premium Select or Delta One, which actually have physical attributes as well as the other components, so...\nEd Bastian: And Leslie, on your second question, this summer, we operated roughly 15% below where we were in the summer of '19. And we said our goal is for next summer to close that gap and have our network fully restored. So I think that's a ballpark number of 15%. That doesn't mean we're going to have 15% more people or 15% more planes. It's really just utilizing the people we already have because we're already at pretty close to 2019 staffing levels. And the fleet we have has taken a pretty significant utilization hit as we've reduced supplying and bringing it back. So, it's really using the assets and the people we already have more efficiently. That's going to generate a meaningful amount of that growth.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. And have the passengers used most of their vouchers and credit that they got during the pandemic? Or are they still sitting on a lot of those? If you have any detail on how much or how many -- what the value is.\nGlen Hauenstein: We don't release any details, but there's still -- there's -- we have very long-dated expiration on that. So nothing is going to expire until the end of '24. And there's still a sizable number of credits out there.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Edward Russell with Skift.\nEdward Russell: I want to ask what Delta's plan is if the Congress does not extend the waiver for the 737 MAX 10 cockpits that expires at the end of the year?\nEd Bastian: We -- I was asked this question on CNBC this morning, and I said there is a plan B. And of course, when we made the decision to buy the 10, we had a lot of conversations with Boeing around that specific question because it's a big part of our capacity, and we want to make certain that we're not going to be left without an alternative. So, we do have a plan B. We're not discussing what that plan B is, but there is a plan B with Boeing in the event it doesn't get certified. That said, we remain optimistic it will be certified.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Dawn Gilbertson with Wall Street General.\nDawn Gilbertson: Ed, I wanted to ask you about the DOT's latest proposal on fee transparency. You guys and other airlines blasted it in 2014. What is your take on this latest proposal? I know you haven't filed a formal comment yet. And secondly, what do you think the chances are of this going through?\nPeter Carter: It's Peter Carter. What I would say in response to the proposal is we think that customers do have access to fee and pricing information. Today, on the Internet, we think our pricing is transparent. We will be providing formal comment to the DOT because one of the challenges with the rule as proposed is the way they're viewing transparency, they're expecting a carrier to provide a moment of making the search every single potential fee or price without regard to who's actually searching. So it may be a fee that's not relevant to the consumer, which, of course, could create quite a bit of confusion for consumers. So, we'll be providing that input to the DOT, and we hope that they obviously see that rule as something that's unnecessary to impose.\nEd Bastian: Thank you, Dawn. And we have time for one final question.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Kelly Yamanouchi with the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Kelly, your line is open. Kelly, we're not able to hear you. Please check your line mute function. All right. Hearing no response.\nEd Bastian: All right, Cody, we'll follow up with Kelly later, but I think that is going to conclude our call. So thanks, everybody, for listening and participating.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we begin, I want to recognize all of those who have been impacted by Hurricanes Ian and Fiona, including Delta employees who live in the affected communities. We have contributed $600,000 to the Red Cross relief efforts and activated our Delta Care Fund to take care of our employees who have suffered loss. Delta will continue to support our people and our communities [Indiscernible] to recovery and rebuilding. The demand for air travel remains very strong, and that is reflected in today's results and outlook. We generated earnings of $1.51 per share in the September quarter. Our results mark clear financial progress as we report the highest quarterly revenue in Delta's history, 3% above the third quarter of 2019 and $1.5 billion of operating income, generating a 12% margin. This was our second quarter -- consecutive quarter of double-digit operating margins. And importantly, we achieved these results despite record high fuel prices and on capacity only 83% restored relative to 2019. Our customer satisfaction scores are running meaningfully above 2019, and loyalty to Delta has never been stronger, with record SkyMiles acquisitions and American Express results ahead of our plan. I want to sincerely thank the Delta people for their great work in delivering these results and restoring our operational reliability through a very difficult summit, delivering safe, reliable and on-time service for our customers remains our top priority, and no airline does this better than Delta. We saw strong consistent improvement in our operating metrics throughout the quarter. For example, excluding the impact of Hurricane Ian, we ran a 99.9% domestic completion factor in September and month-to-date in October with 90% arrivals on time. To put that in context, out of 120,000 mainline flights over the last 45 days, we had just 108 cancellations in total, performance that is even better than our pre-pandemic levels. And year-to-date, Delta remains in the number one industry position amongst our peer set in completion factor and on-time arrivals. After two years of delaying travel, it is clear that consumers are getting out and traveling the world. Business travel continues to recover in line with our expectations as bookings have improved after Labor Day and companies reconnect with their teams and their customers. And while consumer spend on experiences is growing, the airline industry revenues are still $20 billion to $30 billion below the historical trend against GDP, highlighting the significant opportunity still ahead. We expect our December quarter revenues to maintain this momentum, and we will be 5% to 9% higher than 2019. With strong demand, we expect earnings per share of $1 to $1.25 and a 9% to 11% operating margin. While we face numerous challenges and headwinds this year, Delta has demonstrated its resilience. We're ahead of our plan that we laid out for you last December on profitability and cash flow, and we expect to be free cash flow positive in 2022 this year. Our priority over the next six months is to prepare for full network restoration by next summer, consistent with our original plan, but always conditioned on continuing demand strength. This will support another meaningful step-up in profitability and cash flow next year as we stay on our path to earn over $7 of EPS and $4 billion of free cash in 2024. We'll provide more details on our outlook for 2023 and progress towards our long-term targets at an investor meeting that we will host December 14 in New York. As we think about our long-term plan, we had some really important achievements this quarter. Building on Delta's global network and partnerships, we strengthened our network with the recent DOT approval of our joint venture with LATAM. Together with LATAM, our JV will have the number one market position in South America. To support our best-in-class network, we continue to reshape our fleet and recently placed an order for 100 Boeing 737-10 aircraft. We're also expanding the power of our loyalty ecosystem with the recently announced Starbucks partnership, bringing two premier brands together. And this week, we announced a strategic partnership with an investment in Joby Aviation, aligning the industry's best airline with the innovation leader in developing eVTOL. Joby shares our vision of providing customers a premium experience. We're excited to help support Joby's long-term vision of faster, more reliable and more sustainable transit to the airport. In closing, while we are mindful of macroeconomic headwinds, the travel industry is experiencing a countercyclical recovery. Global demand is continuing to ramp as consumers shift spend to experiences, businesses return to travel and international markets continue to reopen. Demand has not come close to being quenched by a hectic summer travel season. At the same time, industry supply is constrained by aircraft availability, regional pilot shortages, and hiring and training needs. With record high fuel prices and increasing cost of capital, the hurdle rate is rising for incremental capacity across an industry that's still restoring its financial condition post-pandemic. Against this backdrop and coupled with meaningfully improved asset utilization, at Delta, we are uniquely positioned to grow our earnings and cash flow in 2023. At the same time, we will remain nimble and have the tools to manage through any changes in the overall environment. Over the last decade, Delta has structurally improved in significant ways, creating a trusted consumer brand built on a foundation as the most reliable airline globally driven by the very best professionals in the industry. And I truly believe that we are positioned to come through this period as a stronger airline than ever before. With that, let me hand it over to Glen, who can provide more details on our commercial performance. I could take it, Savi. We continue to make good progress in clearing those bottlenecks and getting our pilots into seats and categories every week. We're producing more and more pilots back to the operation. As we said in our remarks, our goal is to be in a position to have our network fully restored by the summer, and the pilots are obviously a big part of that. And one other thing I'd add is that we have the lowest regional jet footprint in the industry. We've been on a path, Savi, over the last decade to eliminate the 50-seat regional jet, and we're just about there. So we are out of that category. We do have 325 two-class regional jets, which we will continue to maintain going forward, but we are far less exposed than others to the -- some of this regional pilot shortage issue. Sure, Mike. That's an industry number, as you can appreciate. And that gets you closer to the historical relationship. We've seen over many, many years, it's a very sticky relationship. We saw it fall a bit after 9/11, and we saw it bounce back. We saw it fall during the recession. We've seen it bounce back. And we certainly saw it the biggest fall ever coming back from the pandemic. So one of the things that we're seeing is such outsized demand for our product across the board. And when you couple that as well with the industry constraints that we also talked about, that is also keeping the pricing strong at the same time. So whether we get back to the full $20 billion or $30 billion, I don't know, but I think we're gaining on it as we go. And David, if I could add to Glen's comments, as you also appreciate, we've been, by far, the most cautious about building back our network given that we wanted to make certain we're doing it reliably, and we're doing it with our customers and our people in mind, first and foremost. And so a good chunk of the restoration is solely that, just getting back up to our normalized industry share our full capacity and utilization of the airline. There are a lot more governors in this environment on the capacity than ever before, whether it's high-fuel prices, high-cost capital, difficulty getting pilot staffed, typically OEMs producing aircraft. So I think with respect to investor questions around overall capacity levels, I feel very comfortable with what we're doing here at Delta. Of course, it's always about profitability and margins. And that's why I said in my remarks, I think we are uniquely positioned to do both, to grow where we haven't had the opportunity to grow as quickly as others have grown with strong demand supporting that, coupled with a significant unit cost benefit as we move forward because we already own all the assets and we already have the full staffing numbers pretty much on property. And Scott, if I could wrap that, is that when you think about next year, obviously, we're going to be bringing a fair bit of capacity into the domestic system. That's going to help with what Glen mentioned earlier, a lot of our customers are priced out of our products. And so, we're going to be bringing more affordability, opening us up to additional buckets of demand. Yet at the same time, the incremental marginal cost of delivering that supply is substantially lower than any modest price adjustments we would see. You can expect our network rebuild to be disciplined. It's going to steadily grow. But we're not going to fall in the trap we were last spring where we pushed ourselves too hard. So we learned from that. We're not going to accelerate it faster, and we're ready to deliver. Sure. A couple of things that have changed. One, as you know, they've also worked through the very difficult restructuring. And they're still not out of the court process, though they expect to be out sometime next month. So, we're anxious to see them out, and that's going to provide them some additional opportunities to start to grow and really take advantage of the powerhouse they've become as well as the substantial reduction in cost as well as balance sheet -- reductions on debt that they've been able to achieve through the bankruptcy process. We just got the ATI from DOT, and we're excited about that. So we haven't really been able to talk in three years to them at a detailed level about the JV itself, though those meetings are beginning literally as we speak. And it's a little bit of a delayed response, but there's nothing in there that we laid out three years ago when we announced the investment in LATAM that I'm any less excited for. I think if anything, we're going to have an accelerated impact there. The competitive balance in South America is less intense. There's a lot of local airlines got hit by the pandemic pretty hard. And you look at them, you look at what we're doing with Aeromexico in the same time, we see a lot of growth potential for Delta as well as the JV. We will deliver the type of experience for our customers that they expect, which will be continuing to run just a very, very strong operation. One of the things that Glen talked about earlier is the shift of travel within the holiday period itself. And I think you're going to see a more normalized flow than you would typically do. Holidays tend to be very peaky on the highest days and lighter on some of the less -- lower travel days. And with travelers having a lot more flexibility and mobility relative to work, I think you're going to see a busy period for the Thanksgiving week throughout the week. And that's going to help us operationally a bit as well, managing flow. And I think you'll also see that over the Christmas, New Year break as well. We mentioned in our remarks that -- and I really do believe it. So the airline industry, not just Delta, is in a countercyclical recovery because we're still building back from where we were. And so the amount of supply that's in the market probably has already taken into account somewhat of any recessionary risks. We're not operating at Delta anywhere close to what we used to operate in the past, and that's why the demand of our product and the pricing for the product has been so strong. Our crystal ball is good for 90 to 120 days. After that, it gets a little murky. Our advanced bookings don't go out too much further than that in large numbers. But from what we can see and what our big corporates are telling us is that the travel sector of the economy is going to be very strong through the quarter and into the new year. So that's the best we can. I can't speak for the broader economy. I know there's some pretty significant macro shifts going on in spending out of goods and into services, which we are beneficiary of. Of course, we contributed the last two years to the other side of that, and we're glad to see people back on the road. Our sole priority at Delta is to make sure that any excess cash that we're generating is used to pay down debt. And we acquired a meaningful amount of debt during the pandemic. And we want to get our investment-grade rating back, as we've talked. So over the next couple of years, that will be our -- and beyond, by the way, not just the next couple of years, that will still be the top priority for any excess cash. And of course, we'll also be using our cash to continue to invest in the business and invest in our people. So that's where the cash is going. I don't see any share repurchases happening here at Delta for the foreseeable future. And Leslie, on your second question, this summer, we operated roughly 15% below where we were in the summer of '19. And we said our goal is for next summer to close that gap and have our network fully restored. So I think that's a ballpark number of 15%. That doesn't mean we're going to have 15% more people or 15% more planes. It's really just utilizing the people we already have because we're already at pretty close to 2019 staffing levels. And the fleet we have has taken a pretty significant utilization hit as we've reduced supplying and bringing it back. So, it's really using the assets and the people we already have more efficiently. That's going to generate a meaningful amount of that growth. We -- I was asked this question on CNBC this morning, and I said there is a plan B. And of course, when we made the decision to buy the 10, we had a lot of conversations with Boeing around that specific question because it's a big part of our capacity, and we want to make certain that we're not going to be left without an alternative. So, we do have a plan B. We're not discussing what that plan B is, but there is a plan B with Boeing in the event it doesn't get certified. That said, we remain optimistic it will be certified. Thank you, Dawn. And we have time for one final question. All right, Cody, we'll follow up with Kelly later, but I think that is going to conclude our call. So thanks, everybody, for listening and participating."

Today, on the Internet, we think our pricing is transparent. We will be providing formal comment to the DOT because one of the challenges with the rule as proposed is the way they're viewing transparency, they're expecting a carrier to provide a moment of making the search every single potential fee or price without regard to who's actually searching. So it may be a fee that's not relevant to the consumer, which, of course, could create quite a bit of confusion for consumers. So, we'll be providing that input to the DOT, and we hope that they obviously see that rule as something that's unnecessary to impose."

            "name": "Glen Hauenstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to first thank our employees for their hard work restoring our operations and delivering for our customers during a very busy summer travel season. Demand for travel on Delta remains strong. Investments in our products, airport service and the liability are reshaping customer perceptions and driving record satisfaction scores. Brand affinity supports our revenue premium to the industry, and we're making meaningful progress against our multiyear commercial strategy. September quarter results reflect momentum in premium products and loyalty, supporting continued diversification of our revenues. This quarter, a record 54% of our total revenue was generated by premium products and diverse revenue streams. We expect this to grow to 60% by 2024. September quarter revenues of $12.8 billion is a new quarterly record and 3% higher than 2019 on 17% less capacity. Hurricane Ian impacted revenues by approximately $70 million, with the impact evenly split between the third and fourth quarters. Total unit revenues finished 23.4% higher versus 2019, improving three points sequentially as international demand accelerated. Demand was strong throughout the quarter, with premium revenue growth outpacing main cabin by 10 points. Delta Premium Select is performing well ahead of our expectations as we expand the offering to more of our international network every day. We see continued runway ahead with the return of business travel, complementing strength in premium leisure. Our growing loyalty base drives high-margin revenue and supports continued growth in our valuable co-brand relationship with American Express. SkyMiles acquisitions are running 40% above 2019 with over 60% of our passenger revenues now generated by SkyMiles members. In the third quarter, record spend and strong acquisitions on our Amex co-brand cards resulted in $1.4 billion of Amex remuneration. This was 37% higher than 2019, and we now expect 2022 remuneration of $5.5 billion, further reinforcing our confidence in achieving our $7 billion target in 2024. Other revenue streams continue to perform well, with cargo revenue up 27% and MRO revenues up 4% versus '19. Business travel continues to improve. We expect corporate sales recovery in the December quarter in the low- to mid-80s at a system level. Importantly, less recovered sectors like banking, consulting and consumer services have all seen double-digit growth post Labor Day, helping bring New York largely in line with domestic system. We have growing confidence that while there will be changes, corporate travel will fully recover and increased workplace flexibility is creating new travel patterns. Our recent corporate survey validates our perspective with nearly 90% of accounts expecting near travel to stay the same or increase as we move into the fourth quarter. That optimism is also reflected in GBTA's recent travel survey where 80% of respondents expect travel volumes to increase in 2023 compared to '22. On the consumer side, domestic revenue remains well ahead of 2019, with international consumer revenue now fully restored. International is being led by the transatlantic where revenue was 12% higher than 2019 on 89% capacity restoration. Pacific was the most improved entity in the quarter and generated the highest unit revenue growth. We are encouraged by how the Pacific recovery is progressing, led by strong demand in our hub in Korea and to Australia. And we expect continued improvement as Japan reopens. Turning to the December quarter. Bookings for travel and spending on our co-brand cards continue to show healthy trends. We expect our revenue compared to 2019 will continue to improve in fourth quarter, up 5% to 9% on 8% to 9% less capacity. Demand for transatlantic travel is extending well into the fall. Starting in October, we anticipate flying more transatlantic capacity than 2019, making it the first geography to exceed 2019 capacity levels. And while European currencies are down versus the dollar, foreign yields are more than offsetting the foreign exchange impact, and U.S. demand is driving higher U.S. point of sale than 2019. October and November revenue is trending well. The December month will be impacted by an elongated period between the holidays and more return travel than usual pushed into January. Demand for the entire holiday period, however, is very robust. Fourth quarter unit revenues are expected to be up mid-teens versus 2019 as we continue to restore international capacity and increase domestic stage length. During the pandemic and through 2022, we set out a goal to improve our share in coastal gateways to become the leading global carrier in these important revenue centers, and I am proud of the team for successfully achieving this goal. Looking to 2023, we are shifting our focus to our core hubs, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Detroit and Salt Lake City, with approximately 75% of domestic seat growth dedicated to full restoration of our higher-margin core hubs. As our plan progresses, Delta will continue to prioritize our people and our customers, and extend our competitive advantages. In closing, we're coming into the final quarter of the year with a healthy demand backdrop, running the most reliable operation and exceeding our key commercial goals. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. Right. Well, we set really two priorities during the pandemic that we wanted to come through that we thought would be important for the long-term strength of the franchise, and one was to improve our competitive positions in the coastal gateways. And we've certainly completed that as we exited the pandemic and get into a more normalized demand sets. So if you look at places like Los Angeles where we've now taken the number one position or Boston in terms of revenue, same in Boston, and we've strengthened our position in key markets like Seattle. So that was very important for us. The other thing to do was to not lose share in our core, and that was really the very tricky part. So we went in with a share in our core hubs of about 58% to 59% when you added them all up. And our goal is to exit at 60% or above, and we did that as well. So if you think about our core being approximately 20 points less restored than the coastal gateways, which are now fully restored or actually growing, maintain your core hub share or actually increase it, there was a lot of focus on that through the revenue management systems. So we choked off what I would say is more of our traditional flow in very key markets where Delta has historically been the leading carrier, particularly in the Southeast. And so as we head into -- and these customers or our customers are in our loyalty program. But in a lot of cases, they couldn't get fares that were competitive on Delta because we didn't have the seats to produce those. And really, as we head into 2023, our task that we've assigned our team is to get those historical high-yield flow customers back on Delta. And that's really our -- what our rebuild phase for 2023 is all about. Right. Well, clearly, the labor rates at the regional carriers have moved during the pandemic, and they're at significantly higher rates than they were pre-pandemic. I think long-term conventional wisdom is that will mean that the regional fleet in the long run are smaller. In the short run, we're wanting to get to a stabilization of demand for pilots, and we think that will occur sometime in '23. These new higher rates should keep more people in place. And so -- but we don't think it will be fully restored until probably '24, '25 at the earliest. And we're uniquely positioned there because we have the, of course, A220s, which we're delivering every month or so. And we've reactivated the 717s, which were actually not in our original plan for reactivation, but we've leaned on them pretty heavily to rebuild more quickly. And we think it's a better product. And now with the new labor rates, it's at lower unit cost as well as, yes, much lower unit cost than pre-pandemic. So I think we're uniquely positioned there with really the only major carrier that has these plethora of 100-seat airplanes. And we'll see what happens with the regionals in '23, but we think we're near the bottom in terms of pilot availability there. Yes. I think that's a great question, and I'm happy to explain it. Really, it's three main factors. One is international restoration continuing in 4Q as we -- as Pacific continues to open up, and we continue to increase our capacity in the Pacific that has downward pressure on RASM. Domestic stage is going up dramatically and at a different rate than some of our competitors and all of our competitors as we head into 4Q. That's really being driven by a lot of additional flying into Hawaii from the East Coast hubs that we didn't have pre-pandemic. And lastly, it's that period and the shift of the holiday return in December where December will be below trend, and January will be above trend. So those are the three main factors that are driving the sequential decline. And we're not seeing -- taking those out, we're not really seeing a decline at the market level. It's actually continuing to be quite strong, and we don't just see any impact yet. We're looking, of course, vigilant of looking for it, and we'll make adjustments as necessary if it does. But I think Ed was very clear earlier that we think that we have -- as an industry, very off trend in terms of our percent of GDP and just getting back to that represents a huge upside to the industry. Yes. I think we outlined at earlier conferences that we've seen about a 10-point improvement between 3Q and 4Q, and we see that continuing through 4Q. So, we're now in the low to mid-80s in terms of revenue, with traffic being about 10 points below that. And that's what we see as we head into the end of the year. I think we're very, very confident in getting to 60% given that we've been less restored internationally, and internationally has actually a higher component of premium revenues and as well as the new fleets coming in and the continuation of growth at American Express and [indiscernible]. I think the one that we're not confident with right now is cargo for 2024. We've seen some lowering yields, but that's being more than offset by the international restoration. So I don't see that continuing to grow at double digits as we head into '24. But I think 60%, as you pointed out, was our aspirational target. As we get closer and closer to it, it looks like it's -- we may need to increase that as we get closer to '24. On capacity, we are just going to continue to monitor it as we move forward. And each one -- each market is different. And when we look at it not at an aggregate level, but at a market level to ensure that our margins stay where we need them to be. And so I think that's our -- has been our approach historically. It's worked quite well. And our approach moving forward is that it's a ctually a very granular thing. And what we've seen is demand has come back very different in 2022 than it left in 2019, although the aggregates are now above where we were in '19, where people are flying and why they're flying is very different. And so that's where we're going to continue to focus on, seeing opportunities and capitalizing them in '23 as we move forward with our rebuilt. Yes. I don't -- we don't ever comment on forward pricing. And I think what you've seen is that the industry has done a good job historically now in recovering the higher cost in both fuel and nonfuel. And I don't see anything that would indicate that, that's not going to be the case moving forward. Absolutely, great question. As we know, the dollar is at historic highs right now. And normally, we would see that impacting our offshore point of sale in terms of realized fares. But given the demand and supply balance that's existing right now in all of the international marketplaces that we serve, we see that not materializing. The fare increases have more than offset the lower currency rates. And indeed, the onshore tracking as a percent of 2019 is roughly in sync with offshore revenue, so really good balance. And what we've also seen is given the strength of the dollar, that outbound travel has more than offset a bit of weakness in terms of the outbound travel from the foreign point of sale. So all in all, that's been a very positive mix for us. At a service level, you might look at it and say that could be trouble. But for us, it's not been trouble as Delta. I'd say given where we sit right now, we are very confident in the $5.5 billion, and we have some rate adjustments that occur in '23 that give you a good way to the $7 billion, and then the continued acquisitions. I think we're -- we have some cushion in there right now. And it's not a stretch objective to get to $7 billion in '24 as we sit today. And so there's a little cushion in there should we see revenues plateau. Well, having said that, we have not seen card spend plateau. And although we have a record number of accounts in force, we're also seeing record spend on individual cards right up until today. So I mean this is really current numbers that we're looking at. And so while we're mindful that, that may trend down a little bit, I think we've got some cushion in there given the strong acquisition and, if any, the brand. I think it's both, right, is that -- and pretty evenly distributed. We have first time forever we're actually now bigger in the transatlantic in the month of October than we were in October of '19 and with very successful unit revenues and improved profitability there. So I think as we head through the winter, it's international growth. We have LATAM now really starting to come online in earnest. And then the Japan opening in -- right now is a very exciting thing for us being a historically very large carrier in Japan. So, if the international marketplaces are open and open without restrictions, we see robust demand, and we see that continuing to be our backdrop. We see -- we have good visibility now to the winter in Europe because the APs are a little bit longer in Europe. And so, now we're thinking about the spring. And I can't imagine that as we get to spring and summer of next year that we don't see another robust demand because we did miss three years of demand for the leisure travel to Europe. So people run out of time, myself included, and I think, gosh, how many years do I have left to do that? And so I think we have a really good backdrop there. And then domestically, these are customers that we know want to fly Delta. These are in our core regional markets that we just weren't able to produce capacity at attractive inventory levels that they would want to purchase on Delta. And as we bring those down, as Ed mentioned earlier, as we bring those relative fair premiums down, as we open up the hubs, we think that's going to be some relatively easy lifting for us. I think they already have. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, that the demand sets are very different than they were in 2019 in terms of places people are going, in terms of times that they're going. And we're making those adjustments. I think one of the more interesting things, as you mentioned, Monday -- Sunday night outbound, Monday morning outbound used to be the peak. That's now bleeding into Tuesday, out Tuesday, back Thursday, so some shorter trips midweek. It's bleeding into people, taking -- mixing business and leisure. So I know myself, I went to Paris last week for meetings, and I spent the weekend for leisure and before I probably would have just come back. So I think we see that. We see in the holidays with people not having to necessarily be in the office as regularly as they did before the pandemic, and we see people stretching out the holiday. So Sunday night, Monday morning -- Sunday night returns or the Sunday after Thanksgiving was historically the highest revenue day we had in our network. That's now a little bit lighter, and we see that travel moving into Monday and Tuesday returns. So yes -- and we've been making those adjustments along the way, and I think pretty successfully. And I think it's pretty exciting, right, that it's coming -- in aggregate, it's coming back differently, but it's coming back even stronger. I'd say there's a new normal on all of this. And while we do start to see seasonality patterns reemerging that we're not as present in the early stages of the rebuild, they're not as acute maybe as they were pre-pandemic. So we had a fantastic September to Florida, absent of the hurricane, which you wouldn't have thought. If you look at September, which is historically one of the worst months for Florida, you couldn't buy a ticket to Disney. We had some people who were on break here, and they said they wanted to go to Disney with their families, and they couldn't buy a ticket. It's closed out. And so I think we've seen this shift. And as airfares have increased and as hotels have increased and the whole -- people are also moving to the shoulders a little bit more because they can take advantage of the fact that on the margin, it's a little bit less expensive, and they have more flexibility with their work that they don't necessarily need to be in the office on those days. So I think yes, there are definitely things that are reappearing in terms of more traditional seasonality. But I think also, there are a lot of things that are offsetting that muting it and making it a little bit less pronounced as it was pre-pandemic. No. I think it's mostly the fact -- just a calendar shift of where the returns are. And so, I think that's -- and we think it's about two points of sequential decline from -- in our 23.5 to 17, about two points of that is a shift of some of the returns of the holiday into January. Well, Helane, I think at a macro level is that whatever your purpose was, the redemptions that carried at the end, was always for the leisure travel. And so as people continue to see our brand evolving and want to become involved with it, whether or not it's for business or for leisure, we've seen the opportunity to continue to grow the program itself at record pace, which is very exciting and, I think, a real testament to the brand strength and all the hard work that delta people put out every day. And now it's our job to take that brand strength and turn it into profitability. And of course, we do that through using those as prospects for our American Express card, but we're also increasingly making our ecosystem broader. And I think just yesterday, we had a very claiming announcement about partnering with Starbucks and linking our programs together. And I think creating an exciting dynamic ecosystem that is the cornerstone of our loyalty program, which is, of course, based on the fantastic airline that Delta runs every day, is really the base of it. But we are very excited about where we can take this over the next five years in terms of expanding that loyalty platform to be more than just Delta as an airline. Well, I can't speak to the industry. I can speak for Delta. And yes, you've got it right, '24 to '25 is when we think we'll have the utilization back to historic levels on all the equipment we have contracted. It's strengthening as we get -- come out of the pandemic. So we're very excited. And I think we highlighted in the call that our recovery is being led by premium products. And premium products -- restoration is 10 points ahead, coach of main cabin and basic economy. So very excited about people getting used to this, people enjoying it and intend to repurchase is over 70%. So you see the customers coming back for more of this as well. That fluctuates every day based on demand and supply. So in general, it's been trending lower, but that could reverse itself today or tomorrow. So, it's not something we actively manage. It's kind of a daily occurrence. Absolutely. And we want to continue to evolve our program today. It's premium for our most premium customers. And as you all know, we announced some changes for the '24 program earlier this month, which was really designed to ensure that we had the correct people. We were the most generous, as you know, also during the pandemic in extending benefit. So we actually have seen an incredible increase in the number of our most premium customers. And -- but our intent is to make sure that everybody who is a premium customer has a really premium experience. So, we've got to balance that off. Basic economy is not a hard cabin. It's an availability of a fare, and we want to keep that in place. It's a very effective tool. We haven't used it as much historically because we've been so full. But as we get to a more normalized environment, there probably will be more basic economy in -- available in '23 than there were in '24. And we created that because the way that the ultra-low-cost carriers price their products where they don't show you all of the add-ons, they show you a very low intro fare and then add on everything from carry-ons to a soda. And so, we wanted to have a relatively de-counted product, although it's still far superior to the product that you buy on the ULCCs. It doesn't have all the products and the upgradability that the higher fare structures do. And it's a very effective competitive tool. But as I mentioned earlier, it's -- the fare structures are there, and they're either available because there -- we're not selling out on airplanes or they're not. And so that's the way we've created it, and it's not a cabinet in and of itself where the premium products are actually hard cabins. They're Comfort+ or Delta Premium Select or Delta One, which actually have physical attributes as well as the other components, so... We don't release any details, but there's still -- there's -- we have very long-dated expiration on that. So nothing is going to expire until the end of '24. And there's still a sizable number of credits out there."

            "content": "Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. The September quarter demonstrated progress on our financial priorities to drive margin improvement and reduce debt. We reported a $1.5 billion operating profit, and that's on a margin of 11.6%, our second consecutive quarter with a double-digit operating margin. That is on a network that's 17% smaller than 2019. Our non-unit fuel costs were 22.5% higher, in line with guidance, excluding the impact of the hurricane on capacity. The refinery generated profit of $192 million partially offsetting the impact of volatile crack spreads. Gross CapEx spend was $1.5 billion as we took delivery of 11 aircraft, including five A321neos, which are generating margins approximately 10 points higher than the aircraft they're replacing. CapEx was lower than our guidance, with fewer delivery -- with a few delivery delays, and we now expect CapEx spend of $5.7 billion for the full year. We ended the quarter with $20.5 billion of adjusted net debt. We repaid $1.8 billion of debt during the quarter as we continue to manage down our maturities over the next several years. This brings our debt repayment to over $4 billion year-to-date, reducing our run rate interest expense and reflecting our continued focus on returning to investment-grade metrics by 2024. For the December quarter, we expect earnings to be between $1 and $1.25 per share and an operating margin of 9% to 11%. Fuel prices remain volatile. With the most recent move up last week, we expect fourth quarter adjusted fuel price per gallon between $3.35 and $3.55. This includes $105 million contribution from the refinery equating to a $0.23 per gallon benefit. We expect the December quarter unit cost to be 12% to 13% higher than 2019. This is a 10-point improvement sequentially and shows clear progress as capacity restoration increases from the low 80% to low 90%. It's taken significant resources to rebuild the airline with industry-leading reliability. We are nearing the final stages with the workforce now in line with 2019. From here, we expect further benefit from scale as we reach full network restoration and better utilization of our fleet, our hubs and our workforce. The incremental cost to restore additional capacity is low as the resources are already in place, reducing unit costs. As Glen noted, much of our growth next year will be in our lowest cost core hubs through increased mainline aircraft utilization. Approximately 75% of our domestic seat growth in 2023 will be in our core hubs, including 45% from Atlanta alone. Further, between inefficiencies and rebuild expenses, we are carrying over $1 billion of excess costs in 2022. With the teams in place and the operations running reliable, we are seeing early improvements in efficiency. October metrics are pacing ahead of September, and we expect to return to historic levels as elevated training and the network normalized next summer. Achieving scale while restoring efficiency are Delta's largest CASM levers, these are within our control based on the pace of restoration and running an operation in line with Delta's standard of excellence. We know managing cost down is the best protection from economic uncertainty, and it is a company-wide priority. We are making progress restoring our financial foundation with significant profitability and positive cash flow this year. As we fully restore our network and unit costs improve, we expect another step-up in earnings next year, resulting in meaningful cash flow to further reduce our debt on path to our long-term targets. We are confident in delivering a competitive cost structure and our 2024 mid-teen margin target. In closing, I want to recognize the Delta entire global team for the operational improvements they delivered over the past few months. We are on track for meaningful and well-deserved employee profit-sharing payments, and I look forward to celebrating with our employees in February. Now with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q& A. Okay. First, on the cost opportunity and the incremental costs associated with it. When you think about where we are this year in '22, we're 18 points higher on a unit cost basis versus '19. And in there, there's over nine points related to scale and the ability to put scale in going from 85% restored to being fully restored. That would go in at low incremental CASM in the $0.03 to $0.04 range. And then there's another five points related to -- I talked about over $1 billion related to the rebuild and inefficiencies. About half -- almost half of that is rebuilt. And when you think about that bucket, half of that is just the hiring and training intensity that we're under. And that will, as Ed talked about, as we put people back in production that will sunset. And then the other piece is split between elevated over time as we've protected the operation and also the reactivation of the fleet from that product that isn't normal run rate maintenance. So that's really where you get the 14 points of opportunity of the 18, but the incremental piece is at nine points, which is very attractive incremental growth at low CASM. Yes. It goes back to a little bit what I talked about earlier. When you think about sequentially year-over-year, we're up 18 points. So our confidence is as high as it relates to the 14 points that I talked about in an opportunity for clear improvement because of the capacity going in, 15 points alone drives over nine points of that. The other one I gave you a lot of color on it is regarding the rebuilt cost, and those will certainly sunset and dissipate as we complete the rebuild. And then I think the last one is the efficiency, which is the other half of that five-point, and we'll get that over time. That's about the proficient -- the workforce and our resources getting more effective It certainly is helped by the operational reliability that is foundational to that as that happens. And we see that the workforce will get the hours more aligned to the operations. And the underlying processes and efficiencies will come through. Yes, certainly. As it relates to the debt stack, 17% of our debt is variable, and the size of that relative to our cash position, our cash position to outsize. So as you have increasing rates, actually, interest income will outpace interest expense meaningful through that period of time. On the pension, you have both the -- when you think about it, rates reduce your liability, change your interest expense. Those are fairly neutral as you're going forward, certainly change in your asset returns versus your expected performance. And given how debt and -- the debt markets and equity markets have moved, we've underperformed the expected target rate. So you smooth those into earnings over a 20-year period, and then you earn off a lower rate. So that would create a headwind. As you think about going forward, we'll talk more about that in December. We had that stepping down somewhat, but not to the degree that it will. But interest expense is ahead. As we've been ahead on, on managing down our debt levels and ahead on that, our interest expense is coming in better, and our interest income will be better, which will be a partial offset to that."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Cody and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us for our June quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us today from Atlanta, our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta\u2019s performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs in our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we will take analyst questions and we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Bastian: Well, thank you, Julie and good morning. We appreciate everyone joining us today. In a challenging operating environment for the entire industry, I now want to thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we restore the reliability that you have come to expect from Delta. I will speak more to the operation in a moment, but the good news is that we are making great progress to deliver the best-in-class experience that our customers deserve and I am pleased with our July performance to-date. This morning, we reported June quarter earnings per share of $1.44, with $1.4 billion of operating income and a 12% margin on revenues that were close to 2019 levels. Results improved throughout the quarter with revenue in the month of June 4% ahead of the June 2019 number, with a June month operating margin of 16.5%. So, it was only 3.5 points lower than June of 2019 despite a near doubling in fuel prices and our schedule only 82% restored. We generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which brings us close to $2 billion year-to-date, reflecting the robust demand environment and enabling further delevering as we work to regain an investment grade balance sheet. June quarter performance represents an important financial inflection and resulted in a profit sharing accrual for our employees. These results are a validation of the dedication of our people who have done an amazing job under the most difficult of circumstances imaginable over the past 2.5 years. We are happy to have been able to reward eligible employees, with a 4% raise on May 1 and we are looking forward to Delta people celebrating well-deserved and meaningful profit-sharing payouts for years to come with our return to profitability. Rebuilding Delta\u2019s operation during an unprecedented surge in customer demand has been a remarkable feat and I am grateful to our people for everything they do on a daily basis. While the demand and revenue landscape is the best we have seen, the operational environment for the entire industry remains uniquely challenged. I\u2019d like to sincerely apologize to those who have been impacted by cancellations, delays and long wait times over the last 2 months. This quarter\u2019s operational performance has not been up to our industry leading standards and restoring operational excellence is our top priority. Steps we have taken include the strategic direction to hold capacity at the June month level for the remainder of this year as well as additional investments to restore operational integrity, including earlier boarding procedures and operational buffers. We are pleased with the progress and July is off to a very good start with a 99.2% completion factor through the first 11 days of the month, which is exactly on par with the same holiday period in 2019. In fact, over the last 7 days of this period, we have had only 25 cancellations worldwide on over 30,000 departures. Over this period, 84% of our flights have arrived on time, as measured within 14 minutes of scheduled arrival. Since the start of 2021, we have hired 18,000 new employees and our active headcount is at 95% of 2019 levels, despite only restoring less than 85% of our capacity. The chief issue we are working through is not hiring, but a training and experience bubble. Coupling this with the lingering effects of COVID and we\u2019ve seen a reduction in crew availability and hire over time. By ensuring capacity does not outstrip our resources and working through our turning pipeline, we will continue to further improve our operational integrity. While our actions delay the improvement we expect in non-fuel cost, we know the best path to driving a competitive cost structure is running a high-quality operation. And the most important point I\u2019d leave with you is that the issues we are facing are temporary. We are already seeing significant improvement and operating in line with our record-setting performance levels of July of 2019. Turning to the revenue environment, strong demand and pricing trends are continuing into the September quarter. We expect revenue to be up 1% to 5% versus 2019 with an 11% to 13% operating margin. Consumer demand continues to maintain strength as we look to the fall and we are seeing steady progress in the return of business and international travel. Like all consumer businesses, we are closely monitoring consumer behavior and have yet to see any meaningful pullback in demand. However, if demand were to weaken, I am confident we have the tools and resources to remain profitable through the cycle. The last time an economic recession hit our business was in 2009 and absent fuel hedge losses at that time, which we no longer utilize, Delta was profitable that year. Comparing then to now, Delta\u2019s business has structurally evolved in significant ways over the last decade, building a trusted and premium consumer brand with proven competitive advantages within a much improved industry. Our revenues are far more diversified with much larger contributions from our premium product offerings and high margin loyalty business as well as our growing MRO and cargo businesses. And our balance sheet and access to capital are much stronger as proven during the pandemic. We have recently made major customer enhancements that will strengthen our brand for years to come, including recent openings this quarter of world class airport facilities at LAX and New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport, two largest markets for travel in the country as well as new Delta Sky Clubs in key markets. We spent over a decade building our reputation as the most reliable airline globally, but we are not only determined to deliver that same standard of excellence, but are investing to bring it to an even higher level. In the face of the pandemic, financially, we have been profitable over the last 12 months, with margins this summer beginning to approach 2019 levels despite meaningfully lower capacity and a doubling in fuel prices, in my opinion, a pretty remarkable turn in performance. With our results in the first half of the year, we remain confident in our 2024 targets for earnings per share of over $7, more than $4 billion in free cash flow and a return to investment grade metrics. Now, I will turn it over to Glen to talk about the revenue environment.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. I want to start by thanking every one of our employees for their professionalism and the care they deliver to our customers everyday. We are pleased with the return of demand across all categories and regions. Momentum accelerated through the June quarter, enabling the recapture of higher fuel prices. Looking forward, we are seeing demand and pricing strength carry into the late summer and fall as demand remains strong. The success of our customer-focused strategy and strength of the Delta brand is evident in strong June quarter results across our diverse revenue streams, including premium product outperformance and a record quarter for both AmEx remuneration and cargo. We generated $12.3 billion of revenue in the June quarter and achieved a total unit revenue that was 20.5% higher than 2Q of 2019. Revenue compared to 2019 progressed from down 15% in the month of March to up 4% in the month of June, resulting in quarterly revenues that were 1% below 2019 levels. We have seen broad-based demand and yield momentum with each region generating positive unit revenue growth. Premium product revenue continues to outperform and is at 10 point higher than 2019 domestically outpacing the growth in Main Cabin. Domestic consumer revenue remains healthy and is ahead of 2019 levels. International consumer revenue showed significant improvement during the quarter as travel restrictions eased and many countries removed testing requirements, including the United States. Latin America and Transatlantic exceeded 2019 levels in June and the Pacific is accelerating as Korea and Australia have reopened and restrictions are easing in Japan. Business travel continues to improve. During the June quarter, domestic corporate sales were 80% of 2019 levels on a 65% recovery in volume. International corporate sales improved 30 points during the quarter to 65% of 2019 levels, led by the Transatlantic where the recovery is now on par with domestic. Our recent corporate survey results show positive corporate expectations for business travel in 3Q, with several of the least recovered sectors conveying strong optimism for increased travel this fall. As the recovery progresses in these sectors, we expect an outsized impact on our coastal hubs. Our corporate customers expressed increased plans to travel internationally in the second half of the year given the elimination of the pre-departure test requirement for flights returning to the United States. Similar optimism was reflected in Morgan Stanley\u2019s recent Global Corporate Travel Survey, where respondents indicated travel volumes would reach 84% of 2019 levels in the second half of 2022. This is 20 points above the June quarter volumes and over 90% by 2023. As the leading carrier for business travel with a best-in-class product in the air and on the ground, we will benefit disproportionately as the business community continues to reconnect in person. For the September quarter, we expect revenue versus 2019 to be up 1% to 5% on capacity that is 15% to 17% lower, with total unit revenues versus 2019 improving sequentially. For the full year, we expect capacity to be 15% lower than 2019. This is a 5% reduction from our initial guidance. As we move to the back half of the year, we expect stronger corporate and international trends to offset seasonally lower customer demand. With a strong brand and diversified revenue base, Delta is positioned to consistently deliver a revenue and profitability premium to the industry. We expect more than 60% of revenue will come from premium products and non-ticket revenue sources by 2024. Premium continues to lead with load factors and yields higher than 2019. And as we increase the mix of premium seats in our fleet, improve the display and sales channels and see progression in the recovery of business, premium will continue to grow. A structural shift to premium is key to managing through inflation and economic cycles. Historically, more price-sensitive products like Basic Economy, which is currently less than 10% of our sold fares, have struggled to keep up with inflation, while high-value premium offerings performed much better and have proven to be much more resilient through the pandemic. Loyalty to the Delta brand is growing at record levels. We acquired another record number of new SkyMiles members in the quarter and achieved record spend and acquisitions on our AmEx co-brand card. More than 1 in 4 new cards acquired were Platinum and Reserve cards our premium tier is providing another proof point on the growing demand for premium products and brands. AmEx remuneration of $1.4 billion was 35% higher than the June 2019 quarter. And to put this in context, that is more than the remuneration for the full year in 2009. We are on track to receive over $5 billion in remuneration this year from American Express and we remain confident in our 2024 target of $7 billion. The decommoditization of our business, combined with diversifying revenue through the growth of loyalty, MRO and cargo have improved our financial resiliency and cash generation. We entered the second half of the year ahead of many of our commercial goals set at the Capital Markets Day. And we are excited about the opportunities to elevate our performance by extending our advantages and leveraging the Delta platform. Delta has been the most disciplined in restoring capacity and will remain nimble depending on the environment while staying true to our core competitive advantages. With that, I will turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials.\nDan Janki: Thank you, Glen and good morning to everyone. For the June quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.44, operating income of $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion of free cash flow. Our non-fuel unit cost was 21.8% higher than 2019, largely because our network is 18% smaller. Our operating margin was 11.7%. It came in below our most recent guidance as operational disruptions impacted both revenue and fuel prices moved higher. Operating cash flow of $2.5 billion was driven by solid profitability and a sequential build in the advanced ticket sales. Quarterly gross CapEx spend was $864 million. With nearly $2 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year, we repaid $2.4 billion of gross debt, ending June with $13.6 billion of liquidity and $19.6 billion in adjusted net debt. Our first half financial performance puts us ahead of our initial expectations at the start of the year, supporting our outlook for meaningful profitability in 2022. The exception to this outperformance is our non-fuel unit cost. At Capital Markets Day in December, we laid out a progression to return our non-fuel unit cost structure to within a few points of 2019 by 2024. The actions that Ed spoke about have changed the pace of our unit cost progression but not the destination. The primary drivers are slower capacity restoration and additional investments that deliver the operational excellence. The biggest impact is in the third quarter, where we expect non-fuel CASM to be up approximately 22% versus 2019 on capacity that is 15% to 17% below 2019. For the full year, we now expect non-fuel unit cost to be approximately 8 points higher than we initially guided. The level of capacity restoration accounts for the majority of this increase as we are largely carrying the full cost of the airline, with only 85% of our flying restored. As a result, we are not fully utilizing our assets. For example, third quarter aircraft utilization is about 10% lower than 2019. And while we have over 95% of the employees needed to fully restore capacity, we have thousands in some phase of hiring and training process. The remainder of the increase is driven by investments to support the operation, along with smaller items like higher maintenance and inflation. Actions related to reliability include added operational buffers and over time. Premium pay and over time is expected to total over $700 million this year. This is 50% higher than 2019. While we are delaying our unit cost recovery, it is pace-dependent and within our control. We remain confident in our ability to meaningfully improve our unit cost as we rebuild capacity, improve efficiency and run our operations in line with the Delta high standard. Now, moving to fuel. Second quarter fuel expense increased nearly 60% sequentially on higher prices and volume, with an adjusted fuel price per gallon of $3.82. The refinery continues to provide a hedge to historically high cracks, accounting \u2013 contributing $269 million of operating income during the quarter. This resulted in a $0.31 benefit to our adjusted fuel price per gallon. For the September quarter, we expect the adjusted fuel price per gallon between $3.45 to $3.60. Including a $0.27 per gallon contribution from the refinery based on the forward curves as of last Friday, we expect fuel efficiency to be about 5% better than 2019. Based on our September quarter outlook for revenue and cost, we expect operating margins to be between 11% and 13%. Gross CapEx is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion as we take more aircraft deliveries. We have seen some delays in deliveries and it\u2019s possible this trend continues. Debt reduction remains a key priority. We expect to end third quarter with adjusted net debt of approximately $20 billion. Our goal is to reduce net debt by $5 billion through 2024, bringing us back to investment grade metrics. We remain confident in our ability to make this goal, unlocking significant equity value for our shareholders. In closing, we have made meaningful progress in restoring our financial foundations. With this progress, our opportunities ahead and the resilient demand for air travel, we remain confident in our 2024 financial targets. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank the Delta people for their hard work, the service they provide our customers day in and day out. Our people will always be the Delta difference. With that, I will turn it back over to Julie for questions.\nJulie Stewart: Cody, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for a question and start the Q&A?\nOperator: Absolutely. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning everybody. So Dan, building on the prepared remarks, what needs to happen in order to achieve the 2023 capacity plan? Being flat with 2019, you are running well below right now, which you could see training bottlenecks presumably ease at some point, but the pilot shortage seems more acute than at Capital Markets Day. Regional is cutting back. You mentioned delivery delays. Maybe there is a utilization issue that I am not modeling for. I am just trying to assess the feasibility of getting back to 2019 capacity next year and given the implication that, that would have on ex-fuel CASM?\nDan Janki: Yes, certainly. And we can talk about the feasibility of getting back and really the progression of non-fuel CASM. Maybe I\u2019d start with the framework when you think about the total year with the 8 points, we had originally guided 7 to 10, picked 9 points as the starting point, you add the 8, that\u2019s 17. And when you think about that, we did that on capacity that was 85% restored. You assume you step up to that 100%, that\u2019s 15 points of capacity restoration. That drives 12 points improvement in that as you get that utilization of your resources and your capability. Now as I talked about in the prepared remarks, not about the hiring, as Ed talked about, it\u2019s really, we have 95% of the people will be substantially complete with that hiring and training as we move through the second half by year end, so we will be well positioned for that 100%. Additionally, there is 2 points in there of rebuild that we are incurring to do that, to bring those employees on, to hire them, to train them. And as I talked about, we are running over time and premium 50% higher than 2019 and that was a level that was already elevated. So you take that out, that\u2019s another 2 points. So that\u2019s 14 point improvement by just better leveraging your infrastructure utilization and the sun-setting of that rebuild off that 17 and that, along with \u2013 we are certainly going to continue to invest back in the airline. We laid out at Capital Markets Day around the airports and that capability continue to have that marker in there as it relates to escalation around our workforce and the components around that and managing our supplier inflation that really puts you in that single-digit level for 2023 on a run-rate basis. So, it really comes back to we are building it to be fully restored. We will have those assets on. It\u2019s really then dependent on bringing that capacity online.\nJamie Baker: And that\u2019s fully restored on a full year basis or fully restored by the fourth quarter of 2023?\nEd Bastian: Hey, Jamie, this is Ed. Let me jump in for a moment.\nJamie Baker: Hi, Ed. Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Good questions. I thought Dan did a good job laying out that \u2013 this is entirely within our control, if there is an underlying sentiment that we have kind of lost something in the operating prowess, I don\u2019t see that at all. It\u2019s not a full year number of 23 in terms of capacity. We are going to pace it to demand. I think, in my opinion, by summer of \u201823 would be our target to get back to 100%. I think we could do it maybe a little earlier or a little later depending on what we see in the economy, what happens is the last phases of the restoration of the industry comes together. But I think we have all the piece parts together. We just are very careful that we not incur any of the disruptive influences and elements that we saw during that 6-week period from mid-May to June. And we are going to stay within our capabilities. So I don\u2019t think there is anything that\u2019s outside of our control here.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Thank you for that. And just a real quick follow-up for Glen, the strength in premium, any changes in how consumers are purchasing premium products? Is the percent sold at initial ticketing and the subsequent percent sold pre-departure, is that staying the same? I\u2019m just wondering if the inflationary backdrop is causing any changes in the buying patterns of premium. I realize the aggregate outcome remains very encouraging.\nGlen Hauenstein: No. We had record load \u2013 paid load factors in every one of our premium cabins during the quarter. We had record yields. The travel patterns are pretty sustainable in terms of most of it still being purchased at time of purchase. Actually, the encouraging factor is the continued momentum in corporates authorizing premium travel for their employees who are traveling frequently. So as we move into September, we expect that to continue as we get back into a more seasonal business travel market.\nJamie Baker: That\u2019s great. Thank you to all three of you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Hey, good morning, everyone. First question for Glen. So it seems like the June trend is continuing into 3Q here. But can you comment a little bit on what you\u2019re seeing into your September bookings and kind of how you view the pace of unit revenues throughout the quarter? I would think you\u2019re baking in a September that is probably lower than July, August. Am I right on that? And then any thoughts that you could provide around how you\u2019re thinking about the corporate and leisure recovery come the fall would be helpful as well? Thanks.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, our thesis is really what I outlined in my comments that as we get towards the end of summer into the more traditional business travel season, that we\u2019re going to see an uptick in corporate travel. And that\u2019s been reinforced by a couple of surveys. The Delta survey, which really just closed last week, had some very encouraging statistics in that our customers are expecting that travel will pick up meaningfully as we get to the fall. I think the other piece is the international and the rebound of international. That was delayed and came later than the rebound at domestic. And as we look out to September, we have some really very, very strong data points in terms of travel for international for September. As a matter of fact, September, what we have on the books today, which is about 60% of the total bookings for international, is at record levels much higher than what we experienced in June. So that piece, which we already have in our books is very, very strong, and then we\u2019re just anticipating that there is a shift from high, high demand leisure to a little bit better mix of corporate versus leisure demand in the fall.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Makes sense. And then look, obviously, everyone is trying to find the cracks out there the in-services spend. Obviously, you have a big partner in Amex that has kind of a lot of data around this. How are you working with Amex to maybe identify potential areas of weakness in the consumer? What are they telling you about how consumers could behave in the back half of this year?\nGlen Hauenstein: Amex is our closest and best partner and we talk to them constantly and they are not seeing any indications yet. And I think we\u2019re all looking for it. But as of now, I think we\u2019re enjoying the very, very robust demand that\u2019s not only in our spend, airline spend but in our whole portfolio, Amex portfolio spend as well.\nEd Bastian: Andrew, this is Ed. Let me add to Glen\u2019s comments. I spoke to some of the media last night, this morning about this as well. There is such pent-up demand for our product. You\u2019ve got to remember, people have not had access to our product for the better part of 2 years, many \u2013 particularly business and some higher end consumers. And we\u2019re not going to satisfy that quench, that thirst in a space of a busy summer period. So there is a lot in there that is yet to come. But that is our thesis, as Glen mentioned. And yes, the data supports what we\u2019re seeing today, but we also acknowledge that our crystal ball is only about 3 to 4 months right now and it doesn\u2019t go all the way as far as people would like us to think. But everything we see tells us that we\u2019ve got to run \u2013 the only fly in the ointment, in my opinion, is that we don\u2019t run a quality operation. I mean, that will keep people from the product. And that\u2019s why we are so focused on delivering a high-quality operation, which is exactly what our team is delivering and that will continue to deliver. And the second thing, and it\u2019s been talked about in the industry and we talked about it last Investor Day is not just the move from goods to service spend because our economy is a lot larger today than it was in 2019, regardless of whatever you think that GDP is, whether we\u2019re already into the technically mild recession or not at the present time. I think by most estimates, our economy is about 15% higher than what it was in 2019. And our industry is only about 90% to 95% restored. That\u2019s a pretty big cushion or delta or hedge, depending on your point of view in terms of where the demand strength will be supported. And for Delta, it\u2019s even lower because we\u2019re only about 85% restored. So when you put all those factors together, it gives us confidence that we\u2019re going to see continuing strength. We will see some seasonal shift, as Glen mentioned. But I don\u2019t think the season will be as pronounced as it\u2019s been in the past. And we expect, as long as we run a high-quality operation, which we are doing and we will continue to do, we should be well positioned.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Dan, can you help us on the 22% CASM in third quarter going to around 10% in Q4? Can you help us sort of bridge to that? And then as I look out to the 2023 CASM guide you gave at Capital Markets Day, I understand the impact of we will see how much capacity we can add back. But if I look this year, CASM is 8 points worse on 5 points less capacity, so there is, call it, 3 points of sort of underlying cost. Should we just take that 3 points and add that to 2023 or can some of that go away as well?\nDan Janki: Yes, two pieces. Let me bridge it first to fourth quarter and the step down, going to come out, I talked about and run capacity at our June levels as we go \u2013 progress through the back half of the year. As you do that and you run that consistently, you get relative restoration in the fourth quarter. So capacity was to be stepped up to be 94% restored, a 10-point step up from the midpoint of our range. So when you do that, that\u2019s where you get that relative improvement as it relates to capacity and efficiency and utilization relative to 2019, that along with a stepdown in some of the rebuild expenses in the quarter, that gives you your over your 10-point improvement really gets you to that 10% level as we go into \u2013 as we go and execute through fourth quarter. That was the first one. The second one, when you think about that, yes, there are \u2013 we\u2019re building ahead. So some of that cost that you are seeing on those 3 points are costs that were occurring ahead related to it. Some of it is the additional point that I talked about in rebuild. We\u2019re incurring more overtime and more premium to run the airline this year. So you\u2019d expect that one \u2013 those costs to come out. So it\u2019s both making the investments in and those rebuild costs that will diminish that you\u2019ll see improvement in. One of those costs is we put cost in, in regards to our reporting practices and the changes associated with that. Yes, that\u2019s an increase, but that\u2019s going to be efficiencies for us throughout our network in regards to how we run and operate that throughout the system. And we did a lot of work \u2013 the operating teams did a lot of work to test that. validate that, and we know we will get those efficiencies as we go forward.\nScott Group: Okay, thanks. And then just second question, just more about the third quarter guide. So it sounds like June had revenue up 4% and margins of 16%, and I\u2019m sure there was some impact from operational issues. It sounds like that\u2019s getting better and fuel is coming down. Just I\u2019m trying to understand the 11% to 13% margin guidance for Q3 relative to that 16% in June. So any thoughts there would be great? Thank you.\nDan Janki: The \u2013 you have...\nEd Bastian: Talk about the month of June.\nDan Janki: For the month of June. As you think about \u2013 let me \u2013 July will be a lot like June and then you step down as you progress through. So the June, July, you get that momentum, but then you get the seasonality and the step-down that Glen talked about regarding top line as you progress through the rest of August and September. And then the other element in there as you think about guide, we also \u2013 so that \u2013 and underneath that, remember, we\u2019re coming off at June capacity rate. So we have underlying volume growth associated in that, about 7% to 8% associated with that. So you\u2019re getting bridge on that.\nEd Bastian: I think the other thing, Scott this is Ed in there, that we have a pretty significant profit sharing accrual also in the September quarter. In June, most of the results were offset by the loss in the first quarter of the year. So we have profit sharing accrual but it\u2019s modest. I think we\u2019re looking at close to another $200 million, plus or minus, at these guidance levels of additional expense for profit sharing, which also affects a little bit of the trend there.\nScott Group: Okay, very helpful. Thank you, guys. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Hi, Dan. Just to kind of stick on the cost outlook here. So we\u2019re looking for up low to mid-singles, we\u2019re ending \u201822 up 18, I guess, sort of 15, 18, whatever the number is, a little bit worse than were before. Just can you help us kind of understand like are we still looking up to low to mid-single digits off of the costs that have been pulled forward or should we be expecting that to moderate a little bit? And then as you think about those \u2013 the overtime and the costs that have been put in ahead of the demand recovering, is there going to be some sort of deceleration in some of that cost even kind of independent of the volume as we kind of think about the back half of this year or is that going to also be pushed into 2023?\nDan Janki: You see that step-down slightly in fourth quarter on that. And then it really, really starts to sunset as you flip the calendar and move into 2023 related to that. So you certainly do. The first part of the question, I missed the very beginning of it.\nDavid Vernon: So as you look at \u2013 we were \u2013 I think the guidance from the Capital Markets Day was up low to mid-singles on unit cost. Should we be kind of moderating that because of the 2022 sort of outperformance on cost or is it still sort of in that same kind of range from a directional standpoint?\nDan Janki: Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 again, as we talked about, the destination 24 hasn\u2019t changed in regards to it. It will be pace-dependent. As Ed talked about, it\u2019s in our control, putting the cost in ahead. It will be really when that capacity comes in and the pace of that capacity that comes in that will dictate that as we progress through 2023. So we will have to \u2013 as we get to the end of this year, we\u2019re going to look at that capacity and how we bring it on, and that will pace how the calendar falls out associated with it. But we expect that the leverage that we\u2019re going to get in the incremental CASM to be right in line with where we\u2019re expecting it, so yes, no change in leverage.\nDavid Vernon: And Glen, maybe just to kind of shift gears for a second and talk about corporate. As you think about the way corporates are buying, are you seeing a return to sort of close-in travel? Or is that \u2013 has that changed a little bit, the booking windows being a little bit more elevated? And how does that think of \u2013 and how does that change the load factor you ought to be running the operation at or does it have any impact on that?\nGlen Hauenstein: What we\u2019ve seen is a little bit of an elongation of the booking cycle. I think that is also dependent on the relaxation of the cancellation fees. I think one of the things that we didn\u2019t talk about is when you look at our quarterly results here, remember, we have no change fees, and that was $1 billion that we had to overcome in the bottom line. So I think we\u2019re all learning what the new world is without change fees, and we\u2019re seeing some change in travel patterns in terms of APs and in terms of stays. But I think we\u2019ve got that well managed. And we are going to run load factors that I think are very similar to 2019 levels throughout the rest of the third quarter and likely into 4Q.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hey good morning guys and thank you. If we think about the overtime pay in the $700 million range for the full year, how much of that was incurred in the first half? And how do we think about it for the remainder of the year, just given the operational adjustments you\u2019ve made?\nDan Janki: Yes, it\u2019s pretty balanced. I would say second and third quarter were the highest with it stepping down slightly that we anticipated in fourth quarter as we stabilize and run the operation.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, great. And then as a follow-up to that, I appreciate you guys have the hardest job on the planet here. But how do we think about flex options as we think about labor and salaries, just the number of employees you guys have in 2023, just given the potential different economic scenarios we might have next year? How are you guys planning for that?\nEd Bastian: Sheila, this is Ed. Let me take a stab at that. Obviously, we haven\u2019t given \u201823-specific guidance. We\u2019ve given you ranges and direction but we haven\u2019t given you guidance. I\u2019m going to defer on getting into any detail as to labor in \u201823, what the cost implications are. We mentioned at the Capital Markets Day that we do have long-term cost growth built into our model, and that is true for all of our work groups. We will see how the year progresses. Obviously, we\u2019re in the midst of a pilot contract negotiation, which I\u2019m not going to speak to publicly. So we will learn more as we go, but I don\u2019t see anything to lead me to believe that the core elements of what we described back in December are going to be that much different when you get to \u201824, what the trajectory is. And one other thing, I know a lot of it \u2013 Dan has been getting a lot of the questions on cost, which I fully understand. But thinking about it from our seat, the last 2 years, we\u2019ve been all about trying to drive down cost. And I think our team has done a really good job. In fact, for the better part of the pandemic, we had over 50% of our cost out, which was unheard of, showing the unforeseen flexibility which we\u2019re going to avail ourselves to once we get the operations stabilized. And my direction has been to stabilize and drive reliability. And now that we have demand like we haven\u2019t seen ever before as well, all hands are on deck to support and serve that demand. We\u2019re going to get to equilibrium over the course of the next 12 months, where cost and revenue and everything is going to be in balance. I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to end up in a better net spot on at all. But when you have revenues already surpassing 2019 levels, it\u2019s hard for the operations to make sure we have enough staff on hand and the focus there. So there is also a lot of costs that are embedded within the system that are hard to tease out but are a function of a very, very intense period of time that we\u2019re under.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, Ed. Maybe expanding on that answer, obviously, it was a challenging operational period in 2Q. But you mentioned it yourself your employment levels are close to 95% recovered. I think your own disclosure of pilot headcount is actually kind of flat with where you were in 2019. So can you speak more to maybe what unfolded? What\u2019s changed in July? And thinking about it from a brand perspective and a premium revenue perspective, obviously, if you incur a lot more cancellations and queuing at Sky Clubs and things like that, doesn\u2019t that erode that ability in the future? So how are you, I guess, protecting that moving forward?\nEd Bastian: It absolutely does erode that into the future. That\u2019s the risk, Brandon. I agree with that. What we\u2019ve seen in July as compared to that last 6 weeks at the end of the second quarter is some different scheduling practices that we\u2019ve taken within all of the work categories, including our pilots, our flight attendants and others. We\u2019ve made schedule adjustments as well. We\u2019ve taken any growth out. We\u2019re positioned not just for the next month or so. We\u2019re positioned for the balance of this year to kind of stay where we\u2019re at, and that level of stability gives the operations the capability to focus on the task at hand rather than continuing to invest and build on growth at the same time. We will build \u2013 we\u2019re going to have the capacity to grow when we\u2019re ready, but we want to make sure we\u2019re focused on serving what we have. And it\u2019s really remarkable being in this business for 25 years now. You run a better airline, everything runs better and the efficiencies start to materialize, that over time goes away on its own. The lines start to move quicker. And we can also accelerate the training and the experience of our team. When you think about the fact that we\u2019ve got 18,000 new people that have joined us, many of them over the last 12 months, there is a lot of experience that they are gaining, and that experience and scale is going to pay off. But you don\u2019t step into these jobs and you learn it overnight. There is a significant learning factor that we\u2019re also going through. And that\u2019s \u2013 whether it\u2019s in the airports with what you guys see or what\u2019s going on behind the scenes in tech ops or in reservations or in all categories of employment, even technology. So you see all behind the scenes, all the moving parts of how much new folks, new leadership we have in place, it\u2019s breathtaking. And I\u2019m optimistic they are doing a really good job, but there is a pretty big learning curve. It\u2019s hard to put a dollar amount against, but I know it\u2019s going to really pay off as we move forward.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate that. I will just keep it to one.\nOperator: Thank you. We will go ahead and take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Hello. Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody and thank you very much for the time. So one question is related to when you add time, which is what I assume you\u2019re doing in changing the boarding process, you\u2019re adding time between flights. Does that exacerbate pilots and flight attendants running out of time? Does it help baggage handling? Like how should we think about that? I think Dan, you already talked to the cost side. But how should we think about that from the actually day of operations side?\nEd Bastian: I\u2019ll take that. It doesn\u2019t, Helane. Obviously, it\u2019s a fact \u2013 you got to look at the full impact on overall utilization. Obviously, utilization comes down a touch. So it\u2019s embedded into the aircraft utilization. Dan talked about our aircraft utilizations already having been down versus \u201819, and we\u2019re capitalizing a little bit on that to take advantage of some boarding time. But the fact of the matter is that the \u2013 we were running with the large narrow-bodies in the domestic system, too hot in the airport environment. We didn\u2019t have enough time for our customers. And this is just recognizing the reality of the operation, which we\u2019re already running, which enables everybody to get in position ahead of time. And yes, we\u2019re tweaking show in times, reporting times and when the actual assets are being operated. But it doesn\u2019t really change a lot in the dynamics, it\u2019s going to give our people a little more time to board promptly. It\u2019s also giving us the opportunity, which we haven\u2019t been able to fully take advantage in the past actually to depart early when ready. And we\u2019re seeing that in meaningful ways. It\u2019s improving bags performance. I think the only pinch point we\u2019re seeing is making that we analyze make certain we had enough time to get the cleaners off the planes because we\u2019re not going to compromise on cleaning either. And so this has been worked on for the better part of the last year. It wasn\u2019t something we thought of overnight. And I think we\u2019re fully plugged in across all of the operating groups, that it\u2019s going to be a better customer experience, can be a better employee experience. And behind that, it\u2019s going to be a better brand experience as well.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s very helpful. And then just for my follow-up question is on what kind of technology can you use to speed the boarding process? I know you were working with biometrics and doing some of that leading-edge stuff pre pandemic and then even during the pandemic. But can you accelerate your IT spend to speed the process up and help day of operations, I wonder?\nEd Bastian: We\u2019re doing that. We\u2019re certain a lot of that\u2019s on the front end coming through security. And you may have seen that we\u2019ve added additional biometric processes and face ID and helping working with CLEAR and TSA to get customers through the security queues faster. At boarding at the moment, I don\u2019t see any magic bullets to get physically the number of people that we have on the plane and seated with their bags stowed that much sooner. But we\u2019re trying to make it more comfortable process. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be faster, but hopefully, it will be more comfortable.\nHelane Becker: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. Hey. Good morning everyone. Hey, Glen, I want to go back to the point that you made where you talked about some of the revenue segments that you were \u2013 that you focused on, to some extent, a hedge against inflation. You talked about basic economy being under 10%. How has that progressed over, say, the last few quarters as inflation has picked up and presumably some of the more price-sensitive passengers are just getting crowded out by your premium customers. Can you give us sort of a sense of how that\u2019s trended?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I think you just described what\u2019s happened is as spares came up and as inventory controls went into place, while the fares per basic economy were filed, they were not readily available as they were squeezed off by our higher-yielding customers. So, our target has been, and really, these are soft targets, but to have less than 20% of our capacity available on Basic Economy. That\u2019s our very soft kind of macro target that we have. And that\u2019s come down to below 10% or right around 10% as the high demand through the summer has really displaced those customers. That\u2019s a result, not an intent.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. And then can you give us a sense, if we go back to 2019 and we looked at sort of how many points of load factor on domestic flights connected to international, and sort of where we are today because I would think that there is probably some decent upside there as you start to turn on more of Asia, for example. You are a fairly big connecting airline. Where were we then and maybe where are we now?\nGlen Hauenstein: So, the domestic portion of international journey is generally about 10% of our total capacity or less [ph]. And that\u2019s about \u2013 it\u2019s right now in the high-single digits. So, that\u2019s a couple of points of load in the domestic system.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. All very high margin, I presume, as it comes on?\nGlen Hauenstein: Absolutely and the recovery has really been led by domestic premium. And now what we are really seeing is the acceleration of international premium as we move into the late summer and the fall. So, very exciting for us.\nMike Linenberg: Very good. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good morning. I noticed the kind of used aircraft \u2013 just the used aircraft purchases this quarter. And I was wondering if you could kind of take a step back and as we look to like 2023, \u201824 kind of plan and maybe even a little bit beyond, guessing that the small RJ reduction in your fleet is probably faster than you had expected back at Investor Day. I am just kind of curious what the holes you have in the order book? Essentially, what do you need in terms of growth or replacement compared to what you have in the order book today? Like what could we expect in terms of additional either used or new aircraft that needs to be added to your outlook?\nEd Bastian: Savi, this is Ed. We are reasonably good placed with the order book. Obviously, we have opportunity in the next 3 years to 5 years of delivery for some additional narrow-body, large narrow-body acquisitions, and that\u2019s something that we are always talking to Airbus and Boeing about and whether that\u2019s used or whether that\u2019s new, there is opportunity there. On the wide-bodies, we have focused a lot of our energy in the last few years on the wide-body and specifically the 350 and the 330, and we are pleased with the used 350s that we have acquired. And we have got a pretty healthy stream of wide-bodies coming. So, I would say the focus in the back end of the 5-year period is on the large narrow-bodies.\nSavi Syth: Alright. Helpful. I will leave it at that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Stephen Trent with Citi.\nStephen Trent: Good morning everybody and thanks for taking my question. Just one quick one here. When we look back earlier this year, there was this ongoing noise about these 5G towers getting installed in our airports. That all seemed to quiet down. And in that sort of general theme, are you seeing anything from other industries or maybe government proposals that are causing some concern at the moment, or have these conversations, whether they are industries, with Secretary Buttigieg and not giving you any sort of concern like that?\nPeter Carter: Steve, hi, it\u2019s Peter Carter. Thanks for the question. We have a very, I would say, direct and open dialogue with the administration, with the Secretary and the FAA. And we don\u2019t see any, I will say, storm clouds with respect to any of the initiatives that the government has been talking about. You may have seen that the Secretary proposed a bill of rights for passengers traveling with disabilities last Friday. That was just a restatement of existing regulations that Delta has been following. And obviously, we do everything we can to make sure that our disabled passengers are taken care of every step of the journey.\nStephen Trent: Okay. Really appreciate that color and I will leave it at that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Thanks. Almost fell asleep. Nice to speak with you both. Ed, with a longer term view that operations will kind of normalize and clearly, there is a lot of non-recurring in the baseline this year that your unit costs will normalize into 2023, what sounds like a constructive view on demand, meaningful free cash flow generation this quarter. How do you and the Board think about your stock here in the $20s? I think the plan was to stick to your knitting on deleveraging. But are you shocked with where your equity is trading? And is there any increased emphasis or increased thought on buyback with your stock down here when the restrictions come off?\nEd Bastian: Thanks Duane. Yes, I think we are all surprised with where the stock is, for the industry, by the way, it\u2019s not Delta-specific, is trading at. And I think it\u2019s a function of all the distractions or noise, whatever you want to call it. We have got a lot of moving parts in the industry as we get through the last phases of this pandemic. And we see the whipsaw effect, whether it\u2019s extraordinarily high revenue or high cost to serve that revenue and fuel prices. So, there is a lot of moving parts there. We can\u2019t do anything at the moment with respect to CARES Act limitation, so I can\u2019t provide you any specifics on that. But we talk over the long-term that we have got a responsibility to all constituencies, to our customers, to our employees and importantly to our owners as well as our communities. And our owners shouldn\u2019t be forgotten about and we didn\u2019t forget about them during the pandemic. We did not dilute. Our owner\u2019s one of the only airlines that didn\u2019t do that. So, it\u2019s an important point to us, but at this point in time, I really can\u2019t speak much about that.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then maybe just one last one on Transatlantic, some constructive comments from Glen, but can you talk about recovery sort of U.S. point of sale versus Europe point of sale and how you see that sort of changing over the balance of the year? Thanks for taking the questions.\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. Well, I am glad I got this question because I actually the first. So, thank you for the question.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: You\u2019re welcome.\nGlen Hauenstein: I think one of the issues is with the euro portion parity is what are we seeing in terms of EU point-of-sale and EU demand set. And what I would say is that \u2013 right now, the difference between EU point-of-sale and U.S. point-of-sale in terms of referencing back to \u201819, they are almost identical in terms of the fare increases that we have realized. Now, one of the things I historically never understood is most things in Europe are more expensive than they are in the U.S. on a dollar-adjusted basis. Airfares in Europe to the United States were never one of those. So, we have gotten some leverage here where we have gotten some nice fare initiatives and structures in place that are taking some of that disparity out of the U.S. point of origin versus the European point of origin. So, I think we like where we sit. I think the one concern is right now, we are in a high U.S. point-of-sale. Everybody likes to go to Europe in the summer. And as we shift to the fall, late fall, certainly that extends throughout the October season. But as we get into the November through February, I would just like to point out it would be a great time for you to go to Europe. And the after-Christmas sales would be very good and you would be \u2013 your dollar would go further than ever. So, we will keep a close eye on that balance as we move in, given the fact that the euro has weakened substantially. But that\u2019s something I think we can accommodate through capacity offering.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Question for Glen or Dan. What percentage of your corporate contracts right now are still grandfather contracts, i.e., pricing from pre-pandemic levels where there could potentially be an opportunity to renew at much higher yields?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, most of our contracts are based off of published fares and inventory that\u2019s available in those published fares, so it floats. And so I think what we are seeing and when you look at 65% recovered in terms of volume and 80% in terms of sales, you see that we are getting a lot of yield momentum on the corporate side as well. So, hopefully, as we get into the fall and corporate continues to return, we can realize those increased fares that are in the market today.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. Thanks for the clarity. And maybe just one follow-up. Obviously, thank you for all the commentary on how you expect 3Q to pan out. But just wanted to confirm that based on the visibility you have in the booking curve right now, which I think should give you at least three months of visibility, you are not seeing any drop-off in domestic leisure demand post Labor Day beyond normal seasonality. Is that a fair comment?\nEd Bastian: That\u2019s fair.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: We will go \u2013 we will now go to our last analyst question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our final analyst question from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning everyone. Thanks for getting me in here. So, Ed or Dan, there was some news out recently about Boeing perhaps getting close to doing a sizable end orders. And I understand if you don\u2019t want to comment on it. We might hear more on Farnborough over two weeks. But that would \u2013 I think if I understand, that would put that first delivery in 2025. And I am just trying to understand, if there is a pilot shortage out there, the consensus view out through mid-decade, which is a gating factor for domestic ASMs, could you just sort of frame, what is the peak year, if you will, for retirements for your current pilot workforce?\nEd Bastian: So, you raised a lot of speculation in your questions, so I will be careful to just speak to what I can. We don\u2019t have a massive reduction or retirement bubble in the Delta pilot or we have pilots retiring each year over the next handful of years. We were the only airline that offered a significant retirement inducement for our pilots. And close to 2,000 of our pilots took them back in the summer of 2020. And it\u2019s easy to have a revisionist history and wonder whether we should have done that or not should have done that. But you put yourselves back in summer of 2020 when the total revenues were probably less than 20% of 2019 levels. There was no knowledge of what a vaccine could do, when it would be found, the effectiveness, etcetera, and how the world was going to start to reunite. So, I don\u2019t look back with any regret at all about those decisions. That said, when you take out 2,000 pilots, you could imagine most of them are \u2013 were at the senior-most levels of the company, that causes churn at a much higher level of Delta than other airlines because we effectively wind up training everybody at some point over the following couple of years because everyone will have an opportunity to move up and move to different categories and the like. So, we have done a good job of bringing in the next 2,000. We have many of them hired. We saw \u2013 we had some to go, but we are through much of that. I don\u2019t see any pilot shortage issue for Delta at all. It is the place pilots want to come to. And certainly by the period of time that you were speculating on the latter part of \u201825, \u201826, \u201827, I think we will be in a great spot with respect to our pilot staff.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay, I appreciate that. Just a follow-up. So, your survey work, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments, is fairly constructive post Labor Day and your answer to Ravi\u2019s question echoes that. But in your survey work, I know you do a lot of very detailed survey work. Have you looked at travelers that have not yet flown during the pandemic and for those that have the frequency? Just trying to get a sense here for kind of look at this sort of pent-up demand from another angle using some of the survey work from the leisure side that you have done over the last few months? Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Yes. The survey work Glen mentioned was largely around corporate travel that we spend an awful lot of time with. We also survey SkyMiles customers, and we have an active survey dialogue going on there. And there is still pretty \u2013 some meaningful pent-up demand there. It\u2019s not just people that haven\u2019t traveled. It\u2019s volumes of trips that we anticipate people will take looking forward as they start to catch up on all the experience and all the opportunities that they lost. When you think about this pent-up demand, it feels \u2013 it sounds very personal. It actually is very personal. It\u2019s people investing in themselves to go see friends and family and have life experience that they haven\u2019t had time. I can\u2019t put how many weddings are being held now. All the reasons why people travel have not gone away. They have just been deferred and now they are being accelerated in the next period of time. So, whether it\u2019s the next 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, there is a lot of catch-up to be done. And every data point we look around indicates that. People aren\u2019t fearful of traveling. I mean there is still some, but it\u2019s a significantly shrinking number. But there is a lot of people that once they are now out on the road, they want to get back on the road. And the only inhibitor that I see, that I hear about is running a quality operation, and we are taking that off the table as a risk factor for our customers.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, to start the media questions.\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Julie. Cody, if we could, as we thank the analysts for their time this morning and transition to questions from the media, just remind the members of the media of what our process is, and we will try to get four or five questions answered while we have time here.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.\nAlison Sider: Hi. Thanks so much. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing with fares. The CPI data came out this morning and it seems to show some softening. Does that \u2013 have you seen that? Does that reflect any softening demand or more resistance to higher fares, or is it just fuel prices coming down?\nGlen Hauenstein: We don\u2019t really generally talk about future fares. So, I would like to stay away from that. What we see is a very robust demand set and our ability to harness that through both pricing and inventory in the future. So, I think we expect a very strong demand set to last through the remainder of the summer and into the fall. And as Ed indicated in his previous comments, we do believe there is a lot of pent-up demand for people who maybe didn\u2019t make it in the summer or got priced out of the summer who will be able to travel in the fall\u2026\nAlison Sider: Okay. And then just also curious if you are seeing any issues with replacement parts, including engines, are you seeing any lack of availability of spare parts and is that causing any operational issues?\nDan Janki: Certainly, when you think about the supply chain as it relates to aviation, it has been \u2013 it certainly has been challenged. It\u2019s been well documented from that perspective. We certainly have seen disruptions. It\u2019s forced us to think about how we \u2013 the inventory levels that we carry. We are fortunate that our team has deep expertise and has been doing this for years, where they are able to navigate that where it hasn\u2019t impacted, in any way, entry into service or availability of aircraft in a material way. It\u2019s allowed us to fly what we wanted to fly. But it\u2019s certainly ongoing. We certainly see those disruptions. We feel them. We work closely with our OEM partners on that and to ensure that we are at the top of the list, but we are working proactively with them to increase the flow. But it\u2019s day-to-day.\nAlison Sider: And is it especially engines or other products that have been a particular challenge?\nDan Janki: It cuts across both engines and components.\nOperator: Thank you. We then move on to our next question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein: Hi. I want to try to follow-up really quickly on Ali\u2019s question. With the CPI report showing that fares fell in June after three straight months of double-digit increases. So, I know you don\u2019t want to comment specifically on fares, but could you just comment on, is that a signal now that being able to continue to increase fares across the industry is likely being limited? And a second quick question. I wanted to see if you would comment on the report that you are close to a deal for a dozen or so new A220s with Airbus? Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Hi Mary, this is Ed. I think Glen answered it well. I didn\u2019t look at the CPI report yet that came out this morning, but I think that measure is kind of going from month-to-month. And when you think about our selling season, we are selling now into the latter part of the summer, early fall already, which seasonally is a little less amount of demand than what we have seen on the front end of the spring and summer surge. So, I don\u2019t \u2013 the fare environment, it continues to be healthy. It\u2019s not something that we would talk about, but it is \u2013 you can see in our guidance for Q3, the demand is quite strong. On your question relative to future acquisitions, as you know, we don\u2019t comment on such matters.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Leslie Josephs with CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the training and experience backlog, can you provide a little more detail on how that affected you financially, operationally? And also where are you in hiring? Do you still \u2013 do you have any hiring goals for this year, or do you think that the pace is going to start to slow anything surrounding your plans would be helpful. Thanks.\nEd Bastian: Yes. On the \u2013 a lot of it\u2019s in training and we will talk about pilots. We have an enormous amount of pilot activity and training going on. I am not sure the exact number, but at any one point in time, we have 1,500 or more pilots in training, which is much larger than we would normally carry. And by the way, it\u2019s not just the training because you have pilots waiting to be trained, that are sitting on reserves. So, there is a backup there as well in the process. So, it really impacts your overall productivity and efficiency. That will eventually sort itself out as we move through \u2013 move the snake \u2013 the bubble through the snake here and we get to the other end of that. It\u2019s going on with technicians, with mechanics. It\u2019s experience we see with our vendors, our contractors, their ability to repair parts. They are having some of the issues with experience the same way we have new people learning. So, it touches every part of our operation. And the good news is that we have got all our folks. And so we are at peak with respect to \u201ctraining\u201d and I wouldn\u2019t call it inefficiency, but the cost of efficiency. And every month that goes by, it\u2019s going to get better.\nLeslie Josephs: And in terms of the hiring numbers, do you expect the pace of hiring to slow for the rest of the year, whether being full or\u2026?\nEd Bastian: Yes. We are at \u2013 as I mentioned in my remarks, we are at roughly 95% of 2019. There is more hiring to be done in pilots. There is more hiring to be done in flight attendants, in mechanics. The big areas that we are hiring at much larger numbers previously were in the airports and the reservations. And in those two areas, we are largely where we need to be. So, additional staffing, certainly, but that is largely resolved.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Dawn Gilbertson with Wall Street Journal.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi. Good morning. Ed, you gave some really good statistics on the nascent turnaround here in July. I wondered if you or Glen or somebody could talk about the baggage handling situation. I am just hearing anecdotal evidence, not just the Delta on some baggage handling issues, lost bags. Can you share, I mean how is Delta doing in baggage handling and if there are trouble spots, where they are and how you are addressing them? Thanks very much.\nEd Bastian: Sure, Dawn. As you can imagine, when you hit a rough patch in your operations, the bags are going to be affected probably even more so than customers. And indeed, that\u2019s what we saw happening in May and June. That said, in July, month-to-date, we are actually ahead of goal that we had set for ourselves in terms of baggage performance. It\u2019s early, but it\u2019s a good indication. We missed our goal by a relatively modest amount in June, the month of June. But one of the things I was impressed with is the Atlanta Airport, which is our biggest baggage center and our biggest customer point was actually ahead of goal for June. So, the baggage issues for us are not domestic. Domestic, our operations are running in a really great place. It\u2019s tended to be more on the European side, where the airports, the European airports have \u2013 don\u2019t have the staff, and they haven\u2019t had the ability to invest ahead of time the way we have had here in the U.S. We are working with our airports, with our partners, with people on the ground. We have gone as far as recently, we had a separate charter just to repatriate bags back to customers that have been stranded because of some of the operational issues the European airports were having. And we did that on our own nickel just to reunite or to help the customers sort their bags as quickly as possible.\nDawn Gilbertson: Thank you very much.\nDan Janki: Thanks, Dawn. Cody, we have time for one final question, and then we will turn it back over to Ed for closing comments. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our final question from Rajesh Singh with Reuters.\nRajesh Singh: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. We are told that Delta is in talks with Airbus to expand the existing order for A220s and the deal could be signed next week. Is this accurate and if it is, can you please share the details? Thank you.\nEd Bastian: We don\u2019t comment on upcoming decisions that have yet to be taken, so I will leave that at that. Well, I want to thank you all for joining us today. It\u2019s \u2013 there has been a lot happening in our industry and in our business, and it was a very active second quarter. I am proud of the work our team did to deliver a great financial result, a real inflection point as we coined it. And we look forward to a strong third quarter ahead. We will keep a close eye on the operations and encouraged with what we are seeing. And we expect to report even better results when we get to the Q3 report in October. So, thank you for joining us, and hope you have a good rest of your summer.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Julie and good morning. We appreciate everyone joining us today. In a challenging operating environment for the entire industry, I now want to thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we restore the reliability that you have come to expect from Delta. I will speak more to the operation in a moment, but the good news is that we are making great progress to deliver the best-in-class experience that our customers deserve and I am pleased with our July performance to-date. This morning, we reported June quarter earnings per share of $1.44, with $1.4 billion of operating income and a 12% margin on revenues that were close to 2019 levels. Results improved throughout the quarter with revenue in the month of June 4% ahead of the June 2019 number, with a June month operating margin of 16.5%. So, it was only 3.5 points lower than June of 2019 despite a near doubling in fuel prices and our schedule only 82% restored. We generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which brings us close to $2 billion year-to-date, reflecting the robust demand environment and enabling further delevering as we work to regain an investment grade balance sheet. June quarter performance represents an important financial inflection and resulted in a profit sharing accrual for our employees. These results are a validation of the dedication of our people who have done an amazing job under the most difficult of circumstances imaginable over the past 2.5 years. We are happy to have been able to reward eligible employees, with a 4% raise on May 1 and we are looking forward to Delta people celebrating well-deserved and meaningful profit-sharing payouts for years to come with our return to profitability. Rebuilding Delta's operation during an unprecedented surge in customer demand has been a remarkable feat and I am grateful to our people for everything they do on a daily basis. While the demand and revenue landscape is the best we have seen, the operational environment for the entire industry remains uniquely challenged. I'd like to sincerely apologize to those who have been impacted by cancellations, delays and long wait times over the last 2 months. This quarter's operational performance has not been up to our industry leading standards and restoring operational excellence is our top priority. Steps we have taken include the strategic direction to hold capacity at the June month level for the remainder of this year as well as additional investments to restore operational integrity, including earlier boarding procedures and operational buffers. We are pleased with the progress and July is off to a very good start with a 99.2% completion factor through the first 11 days of the month, which is exactly on par with the same holiday period in 2019. In fact, over the last 7 days of this period, we have had only 25 cancellations worldwide on over 30,000 departures. Over this period, 84% of our flights have arrived on time, as measured within 14 minutes of scheduled arrival. Since the start of 2021, we have hired 18,000 new employees and our active headcount is at 95% of 2019 levels, despite only restoring less than 85% of our capacity. The chief issue we are working through is not hiring, but a training and experience bubble. Coupling this with the lingering effects of COVID and we've seen a reduction in crew availability and hire over time. By ensuring capacity does not outstrip our resources and working through our turning pipeline, we will continue to further improve our operational integrity. While our actions delay the improvement we expect in non-fuel cost, we know the best path to driving a competitive cost structure is running a high-quality operation. And the most important point I'd leave with you is that the issues we are facing are temporary. We are already seeing significant improvement and operating in line with our record-setting performance levels of July of 2019. Turning to the revenue environment, strong demand and pricing trends are continuing into the September quarter. We expect revenue to be up 1% to 5% versus 2019 with an 11% to 13% operating margin. Consumer demand continues to maintain strength as we look to the fall and we are seeing steady progress in the return of business and international travel. Like all consumer businesses, we are closely monitoring consumer behavior and have yet to see any meaningful pullback in demand. However, if demand were to weaken, I am confident we have the tools and resources to remain profitable through the cycle. The last time an economic recession hit our business was in 2009 and absent fuel hedge losses at that time, which we no longer utilize, Delta was profitable that year. Comparing then to now, Delta's business has structurally evolved in significant ways over the last decade, building a trusted and premium consumer brand with proven competitive advantages within a much improved industry. Our revenues are far more diversified with much larger contributions from our premium product offerings and high margin loyalty business as well as our growing MRO and cargo businesses. And our balance sheet and access to capital are much stronger as proven during the pandemic. We have recently made major customer enhancements that will strengthen our brand for years to come, including recent openings this quarter of world class airport facilities at LAX and New York's LaGuardia Airport, two largest markets for travel in the country as well as new Delta Sky Clubs in key markets. We spent over a decade building our reputation as the most reliable airline globally, but we are not only determined to deliver that same standard of excellence, but are investing to bring it to an even higher level. In the face of the pandemic, financially, we have been profitable over the last 12 months, with margins this summer beginning to approach 2019 levels despite meaningfully lower capacity and a doubling in fuel prices, in my opinion, a pretty remarkable turn in performance. With our results in the first half of the year, we remain confident in our 2024 targets for earnings per share of over $7, more than $4 billion in free cash flow and a return to investment grade metrics. Now, I will turn it over to Glen to talk about the revenue environment. Hey, Jamie, this is Ed. Let me jump in for a moment. Good questions. I thought Dan did a good job laying out that \u2013 this is entirely within our control, if there is an underlying sentiment that we have kind of lost something in the operating prowess, I don't see that at all. It's not a full year number of 23 in terms of capacity. We are going to pace it to demand. I think, in my opinion, by summer of \u201823 would be our target to get back to 100%. I think we could do it maybe a little earlier or a little later depending on what we see in the economy, what happens is the last phases of the restoration of the industry comes together. But I think we have all the piece parts together. We just are very careful that we not incur any of the disruptive influences and elements that we saw during that 6-week period from mid-May to June. And we are going to stay within our capabilities. So I don't think there is anything that's outside of our control here. Andrew, this is Ed. Let me add to Glen's comments. I spoke to some of the media last night, this morning about this as well. There is such pent-up demand for our product. You've got to remember, people have not had access to our product for the better part of 2 years, many \u2013 particularly business and some higher end consumers. And we're not going to satisfy that quench, that thirst in a space of a busy summer period. So there is a lot in there that is yet to come. But that is our thesis, as Glen mentioned. And yes, the data supports what we're seeing today, but we also acknowledge that our crystal ball is only about 3 to 4 months right now and it doesn't go all the way as far as people would like us to think. But everything we see tells us that we've got to run \u2013 the only fly in the ointment, in my opinion, is that we don't run a quality operation. I mean, that will keep people from the product. And that's why we are so focused on delivering a high-quality operation, which is exactly what our team is delivering and that will continue to deliver. And the second thing, and it's been talked about in the industry and we talked about it last Investor Day is not just the move from goods to service spend because our economy is a lot larger today than it was in 2019, regardless of whatever you think that GDP is, whether we're already into the technically mild recession or not at the present time. I think by most estimates, our economy is about 15% higher than what it was in 2019. And our industry is only about 90% to 95% restored. That's a pretty big cushion or delta or hedge, depending on your point of view in terms of where the demand strength will be supported. And for Delta, it's even lower because we're only about 85% restored. So when you put all those factors together, it gives us confidence that we're going to see continuing strength. We will see some seasonal shift, as Glen mentioned. But I don't think the season will be as pronounced as it's been in the past. And we expect, as long as we run a high-quality operation, which we are doing and we will continue to do, we should be well positioned. Talk about the month of June. I think the other thing, Scott this is Ed in there, that we have a pretty significant profit sharing accrual also in the September quarter. In June, most of the results were offset by the loss in the first quarter of the year. So we have profit sharing accrual but it's modest. I think we're looking at close to another $200 million, plus or minus, at these guidance levels of additional expense for profit sharing, which also affects a little bit of the trend there. Sheila, this is Ed. Let me take a stab at that. Obviously, we haven't given \u201823-specific guidance. We've given you ranges and direction but we haven't given you guidance. I'm going to defer on getting into any detail as to labor in \u201823, what the cost implications are. We mentioned at the Capital Markets Day that we do have long-term cost growth built into our model, and that is true for all of our work groups. We will see how the year progresses. Obviously, we're in the midst of a pilot contract negotiation, which I'm not going to speak to publicly. So we will learn more as we go, but I don't see anything to lead me to believe that the core elements of what we described back in December are going to be that much different when you get to \u201824, what the trajectory is. And one other thing, I know a lot of it \u2013 Dan has been getting a lot of the questions on cost, which I fully understand. But thinking about it from our seat, the last 2 years, we've been all about trying to drive down cost. And I think our team has done a really good job. In fact, for the better part of the pandemic, we had over 50% of our cost out, which was unheard of, showing the unforeseen flexibility which we're going to avail ourselves to once we get the operations stabilized. And my direction has been to stabilize and drive reliability. And now that we have demand like we haven't seen ever before as well, all hands are on deck to support and serve that demand. We're going to get to equilibrium over the course of the next 12 months, where cost and revenue and everything is going to be in balance. I'm confident we're going to end up in a better net spot on at all. But when you have revenues already surpassing 2019 levels, it's hard for the operations to make sure we have enough staff on hand and the focus there. So there is also a lot of costs that are embedded within the system that are hard to tease out but are a function of a very, very intense period of time that we're under. It absolutely does erode that into the future. That's the risk, Brandon. I agree with that. What we've seen in July as compared to that last 6 weeks at the end of the second quarter is some different scheduling practices that we've taken within all of the work categories, including our pilots, our flight attendants and others. We've made schedule adjustments as well. We've taken any growth out. We're positioned not just for the next month or so. We're positioned for the balance of this year to kind of stay where we're at, and that level of stability gives the operations the capability to focus on the task at hand rather than continuing to invest and build on growth at the same time. We will build \u2013 we're going to have the capacity to grow when we're ready, but we want to make sure we're focused on serving what we have. And it's really remarkable being in this business for 25 years now. You run a better airline, everything runs better and the efficiencies start to materialize, that over time goes away on its own. The lines start to move quicker. And we can also accelerate the training and the experience of our team. When you think about the fact that we've got 18,000 new people that have joined us, many of them over the last 12 months, there is a lot of experience that they are gaining, and that experience and scale is going to pay off. But you don't step into these jobs and you learn it overnight. There is a significant learning factor that we're also going through. And that's \u2013 whether it's in the airports with what you guys see or what's going on behind the scenes in tech ops or in reservations or in all categories of employment, even technology. So you see all behind the scenes, all the moving parts of how much new folks, new leadership we have in place, it's breathtaking. And I'm optimistic they are doing a really good job, but there is a pretty big learning curve. It's hard to put a dollar amount against, but I know it's going to really pay off as we move forward. I'll take that. It doesn't, Helane. Obviously, it's a fact \u2013 you got to look at the full impact on overall utilization. Obviously, utilization comes down a touch. So it's embedded into the aircraft utilization. Dan talked about our aircraft utilizations already having been down versus \u201819, and we're capitalizing a little bit on that to take advantage of some boarding time. But the fact of the matter is that the \u2013 we were running with the large narrow-bodies in the domestic system, too hot in the airport environment. We didn't have enough time for our customers. And this is just recognizing the reality of the operation, which we're already running, which enables everybody to get in position ahead of time. And yes, we're tweaking show in times, reporting times and when the actual assets are being operated. But it doesn't really change a lot in the dynamics, it's going to give our people a little more time to board promptly. It's also giving us the opportunity, which we haven't been able to fully take advantage in the past actually to depart early when ready. And we're seeing that in meaningful ways. It's improving bags performance. I think the only pinch point we're seeing is making that we analyze make certain we had enough time to get the cleaners off the planes because we're not going to compromise on cleaning either. And so this has been worked on for the better part of the last year. It wasn't something we thought of overnight. And I think we're fully plugged in across all of the operating groups, that it's going to be a better customer experience, can be a better employee experience. And behind that, it's going to be a better brand experience as well. We're doing that. We're certain a lot of that's on the front end coming through security. And you may have seen that we've added additional biometric processes and face ID and helping working with CLEAR and TSA to get customers through the security queues faster. At boarding at the moment, I don't see any magic bullets to get physically the number of people that we have on the plane and seated with their bags stowed that much sooner. But we're trying to make it more comfortable process. I don't think it's going to be faster, but hopefully, it will be more comfortable. Savi, this is Ed. We are reasonably good placed with the order book. Obviously, we have opportunity in the next 3 years to 5 years of delivery for some additional narrow-body, large narrow-body acquisitions, and that's something that we are always talking to Airbus and Boeing about and whether that's used or whether that's new, there is opportunity there. On the wide-bodies, we have focused a lot of our energy in the last few years on the wide-body and specifically the 350 and the 330, and we are pleased with the used 350s that we have acquired. And we have got a pretty healthy stream of wide-bodies coming. So, I would say the focus in the back end of the 5-year period is on the large narrow-bodies. Thanks Duane. Yes, I think we are all surprised with where the stock is, for the industry, by the way, it's not Delta-specific, is trading at. And I think it's a function of all the distractions or noise, whatever you want to call it. We have got a lot of moving parts in the industry as we get through the last phases of this pandemic. And we see the whipsaw effect, whether it's extraordinarily high revenue or high cost to serve that revenue and fuel prices. So, there is a lot of moving parts there. We can't do anything at the moment with respect to CARES Act limitation, so I can't provide you any specifics on that. But we talk over the long-term that we have got a responsibility to all constituencies, to our customers, to our employees and importantly to our owners as well as our communities. And our owners shouldn't be forgotten about and we didn't forget about them during the pandemic. We did not dilute. Our owner's one of the only airlines that didn't do that. So, it's an important point to us, but at this point in time, I really can't speak much about that. That's fair. So, you raised a lot of speculation in your questions, so I will be careful to just speak to what I can. We don't have a massive reduction or retirement bubble in the Delta pilot or we have pilots retiring each year over the next handful of years. We were the only airline that offered a significant retirement inducement for our pilots. And close to 2,000 of our pilots took them back in the summer of 2020. And it's easy to have a revisionist history and wonder whether we should have done that or not should have done that. But you put yourselves back in summer of 2020 when the total revenues were probably less than 20% of 2019 levels. There was no knowledge of what a vaccine could do, when it would be found, the effectiveness, etcetera, and how the world was going to start to reunite. So, I don't look back with any regret at all about those decisions. That said, when you take out 2,000 pilots, you could imagine most of them are \u2013 were at the senior-most levels of the company, that causes churn at a much higher level of Delta than other airlines because we effectively wind up training everybody at some point over the following couple of years because everyone will have an opportunity to move up and move to different categories and the like. So, we have done a good job of bringing in the next 2,000. We have many of them hired. We saw \u2013 we had some to go, but we are through much of that. I don't see any pilot shortage issue for Delta at all. It is the place pilots want to come to. And certainly by the period of time that you were speculating on the latter part of \u201825, \u201826, \u201827, I think we will be in a great spot with respect to our pilot staff. Yes. The survey work Glen mentioned was largely around corporate travel that we spend an awful lot of time with. We also survey SkyMiles customers, and we have an active survey dialogue going on there. And there is still pretty \u2013 some meaningful pent-up demand there. It's not just people that haven't traveled. It's volumes of trips that we anticipate people will take looking forward as they start to catch up on all the experience and all the opportunities that they lost. When you think about this pent-up demand, it feels \u2013 it sounds very personal. It actually is very personal. It's people investing in themselves to go see friends and family and have life experience that they haven't had time. I can't put how many weddings are being held now. All the reasons why people travel have not gone away. They have just been deferred and now they are being accelerated in the next period of time. So, whether it's the next 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, there is a lot of catch-up to be done. And every data point we look around indicates that. People aren't fearful of traveling. I mean there is still some, but it's a significantly shrinking number. But there is a lot of people that once they are now out on the road, they want to get back on the road. And the only inhibitor that I see, that I hear about is running a quality operation, and we are taking that off the table as a risk factor for our customers. Hi Mary, this is Ed. I think Glen answered it well. I didn't look at the CPI report yet that came out this morning, but I think that measure is kind of going from month-to-month. And when you think about our selling season, we are selling now into the latter part of the summer, early fall already, which seasonally is a little less amount of demand than what we have seen on the front end of the spring and summer surge. So, I don't \u2013 the fare environment, it continues to be healthy. It's not something that we would talk about, but it is \u2013 you can see in our guidance for Q3, the demand is quite strong. On your question relative to future acquisitions, as you know, we don't comment on such matters. Yes. On the \u2013 a lot of it's in training and we will talk about pilots. We have an enormous amount of pilot activity and training going on. I am not sure the exact number, but at any one point in time, we have 1,500 or more pilots in training, which is much larger than we would normally carry. And by the way, it's not just the training because you have pilots waiting to be trained, that are sitting on reserves. So, there is a backup there as well in the process. So, it really impacts your overall productivity and efficiency. That will eventually sort itself out as we move through \u2013 move the snake \u2013 the bubble through the snake here and we get to the other end of that. It's going on with technicians, with mechanics. It's experience we see with our vendors, our contractors, their ability to repair parts. They are having some of the issues with experience the same way we have new people learning. So, it touches every part of our operation. And the good news is that we have got all our folks. And so we are at peak with respect to \u201ctraining\u201d and I wouldn't call it inefficiency, but the cost of efficiency. And every month that goes by, it's going to get better. Yes. We are at \u2013 as I mentioned in my remarks, we are at roughly 95% of 2019. There is more hiring to be done in pilots. There is more hiring to be done in flight attendants, in mechanics. The big areas that we are hiring at much larger numbers previously were in the airports and the reservations. And in those two areas, we are largely where we need to be. So, additional staffing, certainly, but that is largely resolved. Sure, Dawn. As you can imagine, when you hit a rough patch in your operations, the bags are going to be affected probably even more so than customers. And indeed, that's what we saw happening in May and June. That said, in July, month-to-date, we are actually ahead of goal that we had set for ourselves in terms of baggage performance. It's early, but it's a good indication. We missed our goal by a relatively modest amount in June, the month of June. But one of the things I was impressed with is the Atlanta Airport, which is our biggest baggage center and our biggest customer point was actually ahead of goal for June. So, the baggage issues for us are not domestic. Domestic, our operations are running in a really great place. It's tended to be more on the European side, where the airports, the European airports have \u2013 don't have the staff, and they haven't had the ability to invest ahead of time the way we have had here in the U.S. We are working with our airports, with our partners, with people on the ground. We have gone as far as recently, we had a separate charter just to repatriate bags back to customers that have been stranded because of some of the operational issues the European airports were having. And we did that on our own nickel just to reunite or to help the customers sort their bags as quickly as possible. We don't comment on upcoming decisions that have yet to be taken, so I will leave that at that. Well, I want to thank you all for joining us today. It's \u2013 there has been a lot happening in our industry and in our business, and it was a very active second quarter. I am proud of the work our team did to deliver a great financial result, a real inflection point as we coined it. And we look forward to a strong third quarter ahead. We will keep a close eye on the operations and encouraged with what we are seeing. And we expect to report even better results when we get to the Q3 report in October. So, thank you for joining us, and hope you have a good rest of your summer."

            "content": "Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. I want to start by thanking every one of our employees for their professionalism and the care they deliver to our customers everyday. We are pleased with the return of demand across all categories and regions. Momentum accelerated through the June quarter, enabling the recapture of higher fuel prices. Looking forward, we are seeing demand and pricing strength carry into the late summer and fall as demand remains strong. The success of our customer-focused strategy and strength of the Delta brand is evident in strong June quarter results across our diverse revenue streams, including premium product outperformance and a record quarter for both AmEx remuneration and cargo. We generated $12.3 billion of revenue in the June quarter and achieved a total unit revenue that was 20.5% higher than 2Q of 2019. Revenue compared to 2019 progressed from down 15% in the month of March to up 4% in the month of June, resulting in quarterly revenues that were 1% below 2019 levels. We have seen broad-based demand and yield momentum with each region generating positive unit revenue growth. Premium product revenue continues to outperform and is at 10 point higher than 2019 domestically outpacing the growth in Main Cabin. Domestic consumer revenue remains healthy and is ahead of 2019 levels. International consumer revenue showed significant improvement during the quarter as travel restrictions eased and many countries removed testing requirements, including the United States. Latin America and Transatlantic exceeded 2019 levels in June and the Pacific is accelerating as Korea and Australia have reopened and restrictions are easing in Japan. Business travel continues to improve. During the June quarter, domestic corporate sales were 80% of 2019 levels on a 65% recovery in volume. International corporate sales improved 30 points during the quarter to 65% of 2019 levels, led by the Transatlantic where the recovery is now on par with domestic. Our recent corporate survey results show positive corporate expectations for business travel in 3Q, with several of the least recovered sectors conveying strong optimism for increased travel this fall. As the recovery progresses in these sectors, we expect an outsized impact on our coastal hubs. Our corporate customers expressed increased plans to travel internationally in the second half of the year given the elimination of the pre-departure test requirement for flights returning to the United States. Similar optimism was reflected in Morgan Stanley's recent Global Corporate Travel Survey, where respondents indicated travel volumes would reach 84% of 2019 levels in the second half of 2022. This is 20 points above the June quarter volumes and over 90% by 2023. As the leading carrier for business travel with a best-in-class product in the air and on the ground, we will benefit disproportionately as the business community continues to reconnect in person. For the September quarter, we expect revenue versus 2019 to be up 1% to 5% on capacity that is 15% to 17% lower, with total unit revenues versus 2019 improving sequentially. For the full year, we expect capacity to be 15% lower than 2019. This is a 5% reduction from our initial guidance. As we move to the back half of the year, we expect stronger corporate and international trends to offset seasonally lower customer demand. With a strong brand and diversified revenue base, Delta is positioned to consistently deliver a revenue and profitability premium to the industry. We expect more than 60% of revenue will come from premium products and non-ticket revenue sources by 2024. Premium continues to lead with load factors and yields higher than 2019. And as we increase the mix of premium seats in our fleet, improve the display and sales channels and see progression in the recovery of business, premium will continue to grow. A structural shift to premium is key to managing through inflation and economic cycles. Historically, more price-sensitive products like Basic Economy, which is currently less than 10% of our sold fares, have struggled to keep up with inflation, while high-value premium offerings performed much better and have proven to be much more resilient through the pandemic. Loyalty to the Delta brand is growing at record levels. We acquired another record number of new SkyMiles members in the quarter and achieved record spend and acquisitions on our AmEx co-brand card. More than 1 in 4 new cards acquired were Platinum and Reserve cards our premium tier is providing another proof point on the growing demand for premium products and brands. AmEx remuneration of $1.4 billion was 35% higher than the June 2019 quarter. And to put this in context, that is more than the remuneration for the full year in 2009. We are on track to receive over $5 billion in remuneration this year from American Express and we remain confident in our 2024 target of $7 billion. The decommoditization of our business, combined with diversifying revenue through the growth of loyalty, MRO and cargo have improved our financial resiliency and cash generation. We entered the second half of the year ahead of many of our commercial goals set at the Capital Markets Day. And we are excited about the opportunities to elevate our performance by extending our advantages and leveraging the Delta platform. Delta has been the most disciplined in restoring capacity and will remain nimble depending on the environment while staying true to our core competitive advantages. With that, I will turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. No. We had record load \u2013 paid load factors in every one of our premium cabins during the quarter. We had record yields. The travel patterns are pretty sustainable in terms of most of it still being purchased at time of purchase. Actually, the encouraging factor is the continued momentum in corporates authorizing premium travel for their employees who are traveling frequently. So as we move into September, we expect that to continue as we get back into a more seasonal business travel market. Well, our thesis is really what I outlined in my comments that as we get towards the end of summer into the more traditional business travel season, that we're going to see an uptick in corporate travel. And that's been reinforced by a couple of surveys. The Delta survey, which really just closed last week, had some very encouraging statistics in that our customers are expecting that travel will pick up meaningfully as we get to the fall. I think the other piece is the international and the rebound of international. That was delayed and came later than the rebound at domestic. And as we look out to September, we have some really very, very strong data points in terms of travel for international for September. As a matter of fact, September, what we have on the books today, which is about 60% of the total bookings for international, is at record levels much higher than what we experienced in June. So that piece, which we already have in our books is very, very strong, and then we're just anticipating that there is a shift from high, high demand leisure to a little bit better mix of corporate versus leisure demand in the fall. Amex is our closest and best partner and we talk to them constantly and they are not seeing any indications yet. And I think we're all looking for it. But as of now, I think we're enjoying the very, very robust demand that's not only in our spend, airline spend but in our whole portfolio, Amex portfolio spend as well. What we've seen is a little bit of an elongation of the booking cycle. I think that is also dependent on the relaxation of the cancellation fees. I think one of the things that we didn't talk about is when you look at our quarterly results here, remember, we have no change fees, and that was $1 billion that we had to overcome in the bottom line. So I think we're all learning what the new world is without change fees, and we're seeing some change in travel patterns in terms of APs and in terms of stays. But I think we've got that well managed. And we are going to run load factors that I think are very similar to 2019 levels throughout the rest of the third quarter and likely into 4Q. Well, I think you just described what's happened is as spares came up and as inventory controls went into place, while the fares per basic economy were filed, they were not readily available as they were squeezed off by our higher-yielding customers. So, our target has been, and really, these are soft targets, but to have less than 20% of our capacity available on Basic Economy. That's our very soft kind of macro target that we have. And that's come down to below 10% or right around 10% as the high demand through the summer has really displaced those customers. That's a result, not an intent. So, the domestic portion of international journey is generally about 10% of our total capacity or less [ph]. And that's about \u2013 it's right now in the high-single digits. So, that's a couple of points of load in the domestic system. Absolutely and the recovery has really been led by domestic premium. And now what we are really seeing is the acceleration of international premium as we move into the late summer and the fall. So, very exciting for us. Right. Well, I am glad I got this question because I actually the first. So, thank you for the question. I think one of the issues is with the euro portion parity is what are we seeing in terms of EU point-of-sale and EU demand set. And what I would say is that \u2013 right now, the difference between EU point-of-sale and U.S. point-of-sale in terms of referencing back to \u201819, they are almost identical in terms of the fare increases that we have realized. Now, one of the things I historically never understood is most things in Europe are more expensive than they are in the U.S. on a dollar-adjusted basis. Airfares in Europe to the United States were never one of those. So, we have gotten some leverage here where we have gotten some nice fare initiatives and structures in place that are taking some of that disparity out of the U.S. point of origin versus the European point of origin. So, I think we like where we sit. I think the one concern is right now, we are in a high U.S. point-of-sale. Everybody likes to go to Europe in the summer. And as we shift to the fall, late fall, certainly that extends throughout the October season. But as we get into the November through February, I would just like to point out it would be a great time for you to go to Europe. And the after-Christmas sales would be very good and you would be \u2013 your dollar would go further than ever. So, we will keep a close eye on that balance as we move in, given the fact that the euro has weakened substantially. But that's something I think we can accommodate through capacity offering. Well, most of our contracts are based off of published fares and inventory that's available in those published fares, so it floats. And so I think what we are seeing and when you look at 65% recovered in terms of volume and 80% in terms of sales, you see that we are getting a lot of yield momentum on the corporate side as well. So, hopefully, as we get into the fall and corporate continues to return, we can realize those increased fares that are in the market today. We don't really generally talk about future fares. So, I would like to stay away from that. What we see is a very robust demand set and our ability to harness that through both pricing and inventory in the future. So, I think we expect a very strong demand set to last through the remainder of the summer and into the fall. And as Ed indicated in his previous comments, we do believe there is a lot of pent-up demand for people who maybe didn't make it in the summer or got priced out of the summer who will be able to travel in the fall..."

            "name": "Dan Janki",
            "content": "Thank you, Glen and good morning to everyone. For the June quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.44, operating income of $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion of free cash flow. Our non-fuel unit cost was 21.8% higher than 2019, largely because our network is 18% smaller. Our operating margin was 11.7%. It came in below our most recent guidance as operational disruptions impacted both revenue and fuel prices moved higher. Operating cash flow of $2.5 billion was driven by solid profitability and a sequential build in the advanced ticket sales. Quarterly gross CapEx spend was $864 million. With nearly $2 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year, we repaid $2.4 billion of gross debt, ending June with $13.6 billion of liquidity and $19.6 billion in adjusted net debt. Our first half financial performance puts us ahead of our initial expectations at the start of the year, supporting our outlook for meaningful profitability in 2022. The exception to this outperformance is our non-fuel unit cost. At Capital Markets Day in December, we laid out a progression to return our non-fuel unit cost structure to within a few points of 2019 by 2024. The actions that Ed spoke about have changed the pace of our unit cost progression but not the destination. The primary drivers are slower capacity restoration and additional investments that deliver the operational excellence. The biggest impact is in the third quarter, where we expect non-fuel CASM to be up approximately 22% versus 2019 on capacity that is 15% to 17% below 2019. For the full year, we now expect non-fuel unit cost to be approximately 8 points higher than we initially guided. The level of capacity restoration accounts for the majority of this increase as we are largely carrying the full cost of the airline, with only 85% of our flying restored. As a result, we are not fully utilizing our assets. For example, third quarter aircraft utilization is about 10% lower than 2019. And while we have over 95% of the employees needed to fully restore capacity, we have thousands in some phase of hiring and training process. The remainder of the increase is driven by investments to support the operation, along with smaller items like higher maintenance and inflation. Actions related to reliability include added operational buffers and over time. Premium pay and over time is expected to total over $700 million this year. This is 50% higher than 2019. While we are delaying our unit cost recovery, it is pace-dependent and within our control. We remain confident in our ability to meaningfully improve our unit cost as we rebuild capacity, improve efficiency and run our operations in line with the Delta high standard. Now, moving to fuel. Second quarter fuel expense increased nearly 60% sequentially on higher prices and volume, with an adjusted fuel price per gallon of $3.82. The refinery continues to provide a hedge to historically high cracks, accounting \u2013 contributing $269 million of operating income during the quarter. This resulted in a $0.31 benefit to our adjusted fuel price per gallon. For the September quarter, we expect the adjusted fuel price per gallon between $3.45 to $3.60. Including a $0.27 per gallon contribution from the refinery based on the forward curves as of last Friday, we expect fuel efficiency to be about 5% better than 2019. Based on our September quarter outlook for revenue and cost, we expect operating margins to be between 11% and 13%. Gross CapEx is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion as we take more aircraft deliveries. We have seen some delays in deliveries and it's possible this trend continues. Debt reduction remains a key priority. We expect to end third quarter with adjusted net debt of approximately $20 billion. Our goal is to reduce net debt by $5 billion through 2024, bringing us back to investment grade metrics. We remain confident in our ability to make this goal, unlocking significant equity value for our shareholders. In closing, we have made meaningful progress in restoring our financial foundations. With this progress, our opportunities ahead and the resilient demand for air travel, we remain confident in our 2024 financial targets. In closing, I'd like to thank the Delta people for their hard work, the service they provide our customers day in and day out. Our people will always be the Delta difference. With that, I will turn it back over to Julie for questions. Yes, certainly. And we can talk about the feasibility of getting back and really the progression of non-fuel CASM. Maybe I'd start with the framework when you think about the total year with the 8 points, we had originally guided 7 to 10, picked 9 points as the starting point, you add the 8, that's 17. And when you think about that, we did that on capacity that was 85% restored. You assume you step up to that 100%, that's 15 points of capacity restoration. That drives 12 points improvement in that as you get that utilization of your resources and your capability. Now as I talked about in the prepared remarks, not about the hiring, as Ed talked about, it's really, we have 95% of the people will be substantially complete with that hiring and training as we move through the second half by year end, so we will be well positioned for that 100%. Additionally, there is 2 points in there of rebuild that we are incurring to do that, to bring those employees on, to hire them, to train them. And as I talked about, we are running over time and premium 50% higher than 2019 and that was a level that was already elevated. So you take that out, that's another 2 points. So that's 14 point improvement by just better leveraging your infrastructure utilization and the sun-setting of that rebuild off that 17 and that, along with \u2013 we are certainly going to continue to invest back in the airline. We laid out at Capital Markets Day around the airports and that capability continue to have that marker in there as it relates to escalation around our workforce and the components around that and managing our supplier inflation that really puts you in that single-digit level for 2023 on a run-rate basis. So, it really comes back to we are building it to be fully restored. We will have those assets on. It's really then dependent on bringing that capacity online. Yes, two pieces. Let me bridge it first to fourth quarter and the step down, going to come out, I talked about and run capacity at our June levels as we go \u2013 progress through the back half of the year. As you do that and you run that consistently, you get relative restoration in the fourth quarter. So capacity was to be stepped up to be 94% restored, a 10-point step up from the midpoint of our range. So when you do that, that's where you get that relative improvement as it relates to capacity and efficiency and utilization relative to 2019, that along with a stepdown in some of the rebuild expenses in the quarter, that gives you your over your 10-point improvement really gets you to that 10% level as we go into \u2013 as we go and execute through fourth quarter. That was the first one. The second one, when you think about that, yes, there are \u2013 we're building ahead. So some of that cost that you are seeing on those 3 points are costs that were occurring ahead related to it. Some of it is the additional point that I talked about in rebuild. We're incurring more overtime and more premium to run the airline this year. So you'd expect that one \u2013 those costs to come out. So it's both making the investments in and those rebuild costs that will diminish that you'll see improvement in. One of those costs is we put cost in, in regards to our reporting practices and the changes associated with that. Yes, that's an increase, but that's going to be efficiencies for us throughout our network in regards to how we run and operate that throughout the system. And we did a lot of work \u2013 the operating teams did a lot of work to test that. validate that, and we know we will get those efficiencies as we go forward. The \u2013 you have... For the month of June. As you think about \u2013 let me \u2013 July will be a lot like June and then you step down as you progress through. So the June, July, you get that momentum, but then you get the seasonality and the step-down that Glen talked about regarding top line as you progress through the rest of August and September. And then the other element in there as you think about guide, we also \u2013 so that \u2013 and underneath that, remember, we're coming off at June capacity rate. So we have underlying volume growth associated in that, about 7% to 8% associated with that. So you're getting bridge on that. You see that step-down slightly in fourth quarter on that. And then it really, really starts to sunset as you flip the calendar and move into 2023 related to that. So you certainly do. The first part of the question, I missed the very beginning of it. Yes. I think it's \u2013 again, as we talked about, the destination 24 hasn't changed in regards to it. It will be pace-dependent. As Ed talked about, it's in our control, putting the cost in ahead. It will be really when that capacity comes in and the pace of that capacity that comes in that will dictate that as we progress through 2023. So we will have to \u2013 as we get to the end of this year, we're going to look at that capacity and how we bring it on, and that will pace how the calendar falls out associated with it. But we expect that the leverage that we're going to get in the incremental CASM to be right in line with where we're expecting it, so yes, no change in leverage. Yes, it's pretty balanced. I would say second and third quarter were the highest with it stepping down slightly that we anticipated in fourth quarter as we stabilize and run the operation. Certainly, when you think about the supply chain as it relates to aviation, it has been \u2013 it certainly has been challenged. It's been well documented from that perspective. We certainly have seen disruptions. It's forced us to think about how we \u2013 the inventory levels that we carry. We are fortunate that our team has deep expertise and has been doing this for years, where they are able to navigate that where it hasn't impacted, in any way, entry into service or availability of aircraft in a material way. It's allowed us to fly what we wanted to fly. But it's certainly ongoing. We certainly see those disruptions. We feel them. We work closely with our OEM partners on that and to ensure that we are at the top of the list, but we are working proactively with them to increase the flow. But it's day-to-day. It cuts across both engines and components. Thanks, Dawn. Cody, we have time for one final question, and then we will turn it back over to Ed for closing comments. Thank you."

You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Bastian: Well, thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. We are proud to have raised the Ukrainian flag at our global headquarters in Atlanta in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. At Delta, we've provided meaningful financial and operational support to assist the people of the region in connection with our partnership through the International Red Cross. This morning, we reported March quarter results, marking another important step forward in our recovery. We generated $200 million of free cash flow in the quarter and a 10% operating margin in the month of March. Our revenue recovery in the March quarter reached 79% of 2019 levels, five points ahead of the midpoint of our initial guidance. As expected, January and February generated operating losses. As Omicron receded, we saw a surge in demand, supporting an inflection to a solid profit in the month of March. Delta continues to provide best-in-class operational, customer and financial results in a dynamic environment. This results from the dedication, professionalism and hard work of Delta's more than 75,000 people worldwide. Restoring capacity during a period of rapid demand recovery has proven challenging for all of us in the industry but Delta people continued to lead the way, I want to thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we navigate the challenges of ramping up operations into the peak travel period. And I know, our teams have been working incredibly hard, and I want to thank all of them for what they're doing for our customers and for each other. We rewarded our people with a special profit sharing payout in February based on the second half of 2021 profitability and announced a 4% pay increase that's going to be effective May 1. These actions align with Delta's long-standing values of shared success with our people. With the rebound in demand, the month of March was the best cash sales month in Delta's history, outpacing our prior record from spring of 2019 despite offering 10% fewer seats. In March, we had our first month in two years of positive unit revenue compared to 2019, and we achieved record co-brand acquisitions, co-brand spend and cargo revenue. Domestic consumer revenues are exceeding 2019 levels and the recovery in business travel, revenue has accelerated as offices reopen and business travelers rebuild face-to-face relationships. Demand for long-haul international is growing, as travel restrictions lift, led by the Transatlantic. To date, we have not seen an impact to travel demand from the conflict in Ukraine, but we, of course, are monitoring this closely. Nearly all European countries have now removed entry testing requirements for vaccinated customers. We continue to join the rest of the US travel industry, in urging the US government to lift predeparture testing requirements. As we prepare for the peak summer season, we continue to be very focused on operational readiness. With 4,000 new members joining the Delta team already this year, we feel good about our staffing and our ability to meet demand as we continue to restore the airline. Our customers are seeing the benefits of our ongoing investments to improve the travel experience. This spring, we are opening new, modernized terminals in Los Angeles, LaGuardia and Seattle. These generational investments enhance Delta's already leading positions in key hubs and provide an elevated ground experience for our customers. We continue to upgrade our fleet, recently taken delivery of our first Airbus 321neo. The state-of-the-art aircraft is scheduled to begin service May 20 from Boston to San Francisco and features our new domestic first-class seat design, with nearly one-third of the seats in premium cabins and improved fuel efficiency, this will be the best aircraft we fly for our customers and generate the highest returns for our owners. Our strategic decision to accelerate investments in our airports, our fleet and our technology during the pandemic will benefit Delta and our customers for years to come. As COVID shifts from a pandemic to a manageable seasonal virus, there are clear signs of pent-up demand for travel and experiences, as consumers' spending shifts from goods to services and experiences, travel restrictions lift and business travelers continue to return to the skies. Against this improving backdrop, we are building momentum in the June quarter, with expectations for a 12% to 14% operating margin and strong free cash flow despite higher fuel prices. Our revenue recovery is expected to reach 93% to 97% of the 2019 levels, with double-digit unit revenue improvement. We are successfully recapturing a significant portion of the run-up in fuel. This is occurring almost in real time, given the strong demand environment as well as Delta's growing brand preference, our premium product focus and measured approach to capacity. While we are confident in summer demand and the capacity plans that we have in place, given macro uncertainty, we will remain nimble on capacity for the second half of the year and continue to prioritize sustained profitability. I'd like to pause and put that Q2 guidance into perspective. At 12% to 14% operating profit, we are only four points behind our June 2019 quarterly operating margin, and that's despite fuel prices being up 50% from that time period and our capacity only 85% restored. So we are greatly encouraged by the momentum we are seeing, and we remain confident in our outlook for meaningful full year profit for 2022. As we take note of these achievements, I'm pleased with the progress we're making across the three core priorities we laid out at Capital Markets Day last December. First, we continue to fortify our trusted consumer brand, demonstrated by loyalty and record engagement with our customers. The strength of our brand has never been greater and has been recognized by the Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Business Travel News and many, many others. And our customers are taking note that our Net Promoter Scores consistently above 2019 coming out of the pandemic. We intend to build on the momentum we gained over the last two years. Second, we are restoring our financial performance. As revenue improves and we regain a competitive cost structure, we're returning to profitability, generating strong free cash flow and making progress on debt repayment. And our third priority is building a better future for our people and our planet, including our ongoing commitment to creating a sustainable future for aviation. We are continuing to invest in the physical, emotional and financial well-being of our people, while prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of the company. Our mission of connecting the world has never been more important than it is today, and I'm as confident as ever that we'll achieve our ambition for a leading consumer brand to transcend the industry and deliver financial outcomes that create significant and resilient long-term value for all of our stakeholders. It's been an encouraging period of recovery, and it's exciting to see our customers returning to the skies. Thank you again. And with that, I'll turn it over to Glen to update the revenue environment.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. With robust demand, growing preference for the Delta brand and quick actions to recapture higher fuel prices, we achieved significant milestones in the month of March and have momentum as we head into the summer. None of this would be possible without our people, and I couldn't be prouder of the Delta team and the results that they are delivering. A huge thank you to all. During the March quarter, we generated $8.2 billion of revenue. This was approximately $500 million higher than our initial guidance in January, resulting in a revenue recovery of 79% compared to 2019. We continue to execute a disciplined approach to keeping capacity in line with demand. For the quarter, capacity was 83% restored versus 2019 and at the low end of our initial guide and below the industry. The quarter was a tale of two halves. While Omicron depressed demand in the January and early February, we saw an unparalleled demand recovery from Presidents Day on. Our revenue recovery versus 2019 progressed from 70% in January to approximately 80% in February to 85% in March, with momentum building into April. March was the first month in two years of positive unit revenue compared to 2019 with PRASM up 1% and TRASM up 3%. Premium products once again led the way with domestic premium revenue approximately 100% restored to March of 2019 levels. We also achieved our highest ever monthly cash sales, as Ed mentioned, our highest direct sales, highest co-brand acquisitions, highest co-brand spend and highest cargo revenue in the month of March. Business travel volumes reached the highest post-pandemic levels we've seen and, importantly, in March, corporate fares inflected to positive versus 2019 for the first time. This drove an acceleration in the recovery of business revenues with improvement in both corporate contracted customers and small and medium-sized enterprises. As we exited the quarter, domestic corporate sales improved to approximately 70% recovered versus 2019, and our recent survey results show that 90% of our corporate accounts anticipate travel volumes to increase in the June quarter as offices continue to reopen. Additionally, we are seeing more corporates implement changes to travel policies. For example, domestic travel restrictions have been completely removed for all of our top corporate accounts. And increasingly, corporates are allowing upsells to premium cabins and refundable products. Strength in cash sales and seasonality drove a $2.8 billion sequential increase in our air traffic liability. The increase in advanced ticket sales outpaced normal seasonal trends, resulting in an ATL balance of $9.1 billion at the end of March, up from $6.6 billion in March of 2019. We expect the ATL will continue to build in the June quarter, albeit at a slower rate than what we saw in the March quarter. For the June quarter, we expect revenue recovery versus 2019, as Ed mentioned, to improve to 93% to 97% on 84% capacity restoration. This reflects a low double-digit TRASM growth versus 2019, with all entities expected to post positive unit revenues compared to 2019, except for the Pacific. We expect April yields to be up double-digits compared to 2019 with further strengthening as we approach June, positioning us to successfully recapture a significant portion of the higher prices -- fuel prices in the June quarter. Geographically, domestic and Latin revenues continue to lead the recovery, and fewer restrictions in major international markets are unlocking demand for long-haul travel. We expect a very strong summer in the Transatlantic based on demand trends. And in the Pacific, we are encouraged by the opening of Australia, South Korea and other countries in Southeast Asia. When countries reopen, we see a rapid restoration of demand. For example, following South Korea's border opening on April 1, we expect load factors to improve from the low 50s in March to the low 90s by June. We expect that heavily restricted regions, such as China and Japan, will continue to put pressure on overall Pacific unit revenues until borders fully reopen. A few months ago at Capital Markets Day, we outlined three commercial strategy pillars, and we've made strong progress across each of these at the start of this year. First, our premium products continue to lead the recovery and the introduction of Delta Premium Select to the Transatlantic marketplace has been a success, with early returns far exceeding our expectations. By this summer, we will have expanded Delta -- EPS to 80% of our Transatlantic flights. Over the next few years, we expect premium seat growth to continue to outpace Main Cabin, and we're confident in the consumer shift towards higher-quality products is here to stay. To-date, premium recovery has been led by consumer, and we see further upside as more and more business travelers return to the skies. Next, growing loyalty is evident across several key metrics. Our Net Promoter Score remains above 2019 even as volumes increase. And during the quarter, we acquired a record number of new SkyMiles members and our co-brand spend continues to far outpace 2019, up 39% in the month of March. Loyalty is an important driver of our third pillar, increasing our revenue diversification. Other revenue was fully recovered to 2019 levels during the March quarter, led by loyalty and cargo. Remuneration from American Express during the quarter of $1.2 billion was 25% higher than 2019, a new quarterly record that keeps us on track for our full year goal of more than $5 billion in remuneration. Cargo had an exceptional quarter, up 51% compared to 2019, with the month of March marking our best ever cargo month in the company's history. MRO revenues were 22% below 2019 as supply chain issues slowed our engine throughput. MRO margins remain healthy, and we are excited to scale this business over the next few years as the installed base of next-generation engines continues to grow. By leveraging the Delta platform, we are further diversifying our revenue mix. In the March quarter, premium products and non-ticket revenue sources generated 58% of total revenue, up three points from the same period in 2019. This improvement gives us a high level of confidence in achieving our goal of more than 60% by 2024 as we laid out in Capital Markets Day. In closing, Delta has emerged in a stronger relative position by staying true to our core competitive strengths and our commitment to our customers and employees. And as the final phase of demand recovery takes hold and preference for our brand continues to grow, I am more confident than ever in Delta's path to exceed 2019 financial performance by 2024. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk more about the financials.\nDan Janki: Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. Starting with the highlights of the March quarter. Our operating loss was $793 million, was better than our expectation. As anticipated, we saw losses in January and February due to Omicron and seasonal weakness. And we inflected to a solid profit in March, with a 9.4% adjusted operating margin. Fuel expense was $2.1 billion. It increased 32% sequentially from the December quarter. Fuel price per gallon averaged $2.79 for the quarter. This included a $0.07 per gallon benefit from the refinery. Non-fuel costs rose 6% sequentially, with non-fuel CASM up 15% compared to 2019 on 17% less capacity. We generated operating cash flow of $1.8 billion. We reinvested $1.6 billion into the business, resulting in free cash flow of $200 million. Delivering a profit in the month of March and positive cash flow for the quarter were important achievements, especially considering the impact of Omicron and higher fuel prices. We ended the quarter with adjusted net debt of $20.9 billion. This was more than $1 billion better than our initial expectations due to strength in cash receipts that Ed and Glen spoke to. We repaid $1.4 billion of gross debt, ending March with nearly $13 billion of liquidity. Now turning to the outlook. We expect the June quarter non-fuel CASM to be up 17% compared to 2019. The two point increase from the March quarter is driven by higher selling-related costs, an expected 45% sequential increase in revenue and our anticipated step-up in maintenance costs on a similar level of capacity restoration. With the first half non-fuel CASM in the mid-teens, which is two points higher than planned on lower capacity, we expect to be closer to the high end of the full range of up 7% to 10%, implying the second half will improve up to the mid-single digits. This improvement is driven by continued capacity restoration from the low to mid-80s in the first half to the mid-90s by the end of the year. The resulting scale and efficiency will drive the step function change in our non-fuel CASM. Now let me give you a little context on how we get this improvement. The recovery in international travel enables us to shift our wide-bodies from our domestic to our international, where we get better efficiency from gauge and stage and improved staffing. Narrow-body utilization will improve, with a 10-point increase expected by the end of the year, giving us a combined benefit of higher capacity and more efficient allocation of our fleet. Further, as we fill out our schedules and we create greater stability in our operations with more consistency and depth in both the domestic and the international network, this is enabling efficiency gains in our facilities and productivity of our workforce. We remain confident in our multiyear cost framework laid out at Capital Markets Day. Regaining a competitive cost structure is critical to our success. At the same time, we will continue to remain nimble on capacity as we manage for profitability in this higher fuel price environment. On fuel for the June quarter, we expect an adjusted fuel price per gallon of $3.20 to $3.35. This includes a $0.20 benefit from the refinery, and these are based on the forward curves as of last Friday. Our Monroe refinery provides a unique benefit, acting as a partial hedge to elevated cracks. This is especially true with New York Harbor Jet cracks, where our production at Monroe provides 100% offset. Based on our June quarter outlook for revenue and costs, we expect operating margins to be between 12% and 14%. With the expectations for solid profitability and further build in our air traffic liability, we expect to generate another quarter of positive free cash flow after investing $1.2 billion in the business and expect to end the June quarter with adjusted net debt of approximately $20 billion. As we achieve sustained cash generation, we will continue to opportunistically manage our balance sheet, reducing debt to return to investment-grade metrics and making progress towards our $15 billion adjusted net debt target by the end of 2024. For the year, our CapEx outlook of $6 billion is unchanged, with our reinvestment primarily driven by the continued renewal of our fleet. We expect to take delivery of approximately 70 new and gently used aircraft this year, including 26 A321neos. This large grade gauge aircraft fits well with our upgauging strategy and will be our most fuel-efficient aircraft in our fleet with the lowest seat cost. We also continue to accept delivery of new 220s, three, 3900s and three, 5900s. These aircraft are expected to contribute to the full restoration of our capacity and to our goal of using a 7% less fuel per ASM in 2022 when compared to 2019. In addition to the financial benefits, improved efficiency is an important step in our journey to a more sustainable future. During the quarter, we announced actions to scale and advance sustainable fuels. We signed an offtake agreement with Gevo for approximately 75 million gallons of SAF annually over seven years. We anticipate to start in mid-2026 progressing us towards our 2030 10% SAF commitment. We also announced a collaboration with Airbus on the research and development of hydrogen-powered aircraft and the infrastructure it requires. So in closing, we are executing against our priorities laid out at Capital Markets Day, and I'm encouraged by the momentum in our financial recovery. I would sincerely like to thank the Delta people for everything they do every day. Our people will always be our most important competitive advantage. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Julie for Q&A.\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Dan. April, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for a question and then go to our first question.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And we'll first hear from Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Oh, hey, good morning everyone. Fantastic outlook. I guess, I want to focus on capacity with -- so my question is to Glen. Look, you operated 83% of 2019 in the March quarter and things have obviously gotten a lot better for the June quarter. I mean I just sort of think about the Omicron impact in January and February, it was pretty impactful. And yet we're just moving up one point sequentially, 83% to 84%. So I guess, Glen, is this as much driven by the fact that it's all about maintaining operational reliability and really just running the best schedule that there is and that will drive not just the revenue premium, but overall revenue and less re-accommodation costs? And I guess as a sort of corollary to that question, are you watching what's going on over in Europe and seeing how several European carriers are being forced to cancel because of the spread of this other variant and so you guys want to make sure that you're just well prepared and well reserved?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think it's all of the above. I think you asked and answered your own question there. You did a great job of articulating our viewpoint is the priority is to operate reliably and the other priorities do not get ahead of demand. So this is a very recent demand increase that we've seen. The uptick just started about six to eight weeks ago, in late February and March. And so as we get through the year, if these demand trends continue, we have the opportunity to take another tick-up or we could pivot in a different direction if warranted. But I think, it has made it very clear to us that being nimble until we get to the very end of this is the key to our success. And I think we've done a very good job as a company being nimble in our offering throughout the pandemic and really been closest to actual demand if you look back at what demand was.\nMike Linenberg: Great. We and investors love the discipline. Thanks. \nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks so much for the time. So maybe a bit of a follow-up to Mike's question. I've been hearing from some of your peers and other industry folks that labor supply is continuing to weigh down on the ability to ramp up capacity. And as we enter 2Q, labor might actually be a bit tighter than we thought at the beginning of the year, just given Omicron-driven training delays and higher attrition rates. I guess, first, are you seeing the theme at Delta? And if so, did that impact your 2Q capacity plans versus your plans back Investor Day at all? Thanks.\nEd Bastian: Hi, Catie, this is Ed, I'll take that. We've been at this for the better part of the last 18 months getting ahead of it. And we hired over 10,000 people last year. We hired another 4,000 people already this year. So we've hired 15,000 people. And we are largely where we need to be on staffing. Yes, pilots have a training pipeline and it will take some time before pilots are fully in category and where we want them positioned. It'll probably take another year or two. Flight attendants, likewise, we're hiring flight attendants and there's a queue as to how much many people we can put through the training pipeline. But that's not where the real congestion is. It's in the airport, it's on the ground experience, it's making sure we have our suppliers ready and positioned. One thing we did last year, really almost two years ago now, is we took over a lot of the functions at the airport that had been outsourced, catering, cleaning, wheelchair pushing. And we have Delta people in position, and we've hired Delta people to do it to make certain that we get the best experience for our customers. And you know what? Not only are people doing a much better job at it, we're also doing it much more efficiently and effectively and customers are appreciating it. So the labor situation, you're right, has changed pretty dramatically over the course of the last two years. We've been out ahead and that's why you look at our operational stats over that time frame, we've led the industry consistently.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great. And maybe just a quick one for Glen. The AmEx remuneration is a bright spot again this quarter. But would I be correct to think maybe Omicron created some noise at the start to the Q and maybe we see that accelerate even further as we move through the year? I know you just reiterated your goal that you said at Investor Day for $5 billion plus contribution this year. But if we do see an acceleration from 1Q, might still be some upside to that. And thanks again for all the time. Congrats.\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes, I think we're always hopeful for upside. I think what we're excited about when we dissect the spend is that you can really see the spend moving from goods to services and particularly increases in the airline spend on the card. So those are very encouraging statistics for us to continue to monitor as we move through the year. But I think you\u2019ve really seeing that as the moving away from goods and the movement towards experiences and services.\nJulie Stewart: Anything further Catherine?\nCatherine O'Brien: No. That was it from me. Thank you so much for the time.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking questions. Glen, you provided an update. I think you said domestic corporate travel 70% recovered and international 50% in March. Can you just give us some insight on how those bookings are shaping up here early in 2Q? And then second to this question, how much do you think the international testing requirement is holding back trips across the Atlantic right now?\nGlen Hauenstein: First, I'll answer the second first. I think that is the next leg up that we see in the demand set, and we think we have very quite robust demand. But there certainly is, in the minds of some consumers, some hesitancy to go abroad and risk being caught, not being able to get back because of catching COVID. So hopefully, we can see that roll back in the next few weeks here. I think the \u2013 we are hearing good signs from Washington. We'll see, hopefully, that comes out here. And that would be one of the final things that we would need in place for us to really say that COVID is in our rearview mirror. So hopefully, that happens. And then your second question was what, I'm sorry.\nBrandon Oglenski: I think \u2013 when you were talking about, I think, domestic corporate travel at about 70%, international at about 50% in March, can you give us any insights into how that's improving in 2Q?\nGlen Hauenstein: Absolutely. And I think the one that we're really excited about right now is Transatlantic business which for the first time last week crossed domestic restoration in terms of volume. And so that was a big improvement from where we had been just six or eight weeks ago. So it does look like Transatlantic business is returning robustly, and that's very exciting for us. And I think what we're also excited about is this survey that we just got back that said 90% expect to travel more in 2Q than they did at 1Q. So I think when we report to you next quarter, we'll see both of those numbers continuing to move up. And of course, the big question mark is when will Japan and China reopen? And that's probably not in this next quarter and hopefully some time this fall, but that's a little bit further out. What I would say is when these countries are open, business returns quickly. So to Korea, to Australia, we've seen very rapid increases in business demand as those countries have opened.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Helane Becker of Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Thank you for the time everybody. So just a couple of questions on the cost side of the equation, I know, there's not a lot you can do about fuel. But on the labor cost side, to attract people, I mean, I think, Ed, you said you're not going to have to hire that many more people this year. But to retain people, are you finding that you have to raise salaries more than the 4% that you've already slated for May first?\nEd Bastian: Hi, Helane, no, we're not. One of the great things about our brand is throughout this period we've been able to attract and bring in the 15,000 people I talked about with fundamentally not having to change the scales we've used in select high-priced markets, some sign-on bonuses, very judiciously. But fundamentally, no, our scales are intact and the 4% increase May 1st helps.\nHelane Becker: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then my other question is like kind of unrelated, but I think \u2013 I feel like, it was Glen who mentioned that you saw a record cargo number in March, I want to say. So I'm thinking about what you're carrying and what you're seeing in air freight rates and why you think it was so strong and whether that can continue into the second quarter, and if it's meaningful. Like 18 questions in there, Glen.\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. Well, clearly, we know about supply chains trying to catch up. And clearly, airfreight has been one of the ways to relieve that pressure. And so we've seen airfreight rates continue to move in a favorable direction. I'd say the one caution I have right now is the closure of China. And China has been, of course, a very strong, strong market for us in the cargo area. And with Shanghai closed and we're literally not flying to China right now until Shanghai reopens, so that's going to weigh a little bit on cargo revenues as we move forward. But as that does reopen, then you can see that pent-up demand for goods that need to get shipped out of China and potentially even another leg up. So I'd say, we're in a temporary pause right now because of the issues in China, but I expect, as China comes back online, and I don't know the exact date, I don't think anybody does, but we could see an even stronger demand coming out of that.\nEd Bastian: Off a good year last year.\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes, off a great year last year.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Thanks team. Very helpful.\nOperator: Conor Cunningham, MKM Partners.\nConor Cunningham: Hi everyone. Thanks for the time. You've really invested in the operation over the years and just the customer experience in general. And maybe this is a follow-up to what Mike was getting to. Just, there's been a lot of meltdowns around you. And I'm just curious on how you, as Delta, go after those customers that have maybe been displaced by another airline. I think about like Boston this past week and just curious on how you attract them and make them permanent Delta passengers.\nEd Bastian: Well, thanks, Conor. I think, again, throughout the pandemic, we have, as Glen said, been the most disciplined in the return of supply and have -- probably have a better match to demand than anyone else. And it's been interesting to watch because a lot of airlines have taken different approaches over the course of the last two years. Fundamentally, our commitment and our promise to our customers is to give them a great, safe, on-time, reliable experience, and we continue to invest more and more in the premium categories of our aircraft, of our service elements and the quality of our -- of the service that our people drive and it speaks for itself. We take, very humbly, the various awards we've won over the course of the last couple of years. I think we've expanded our leadership during COVID. We had the most to lose, and I think we gained the most over that time frame, candidly. And we've got some really nice momentum as we're bringing and opening new airports. We've got the new LaGuardia opening in June, which will all be very pleased to be the new LAX that we cut the ribbon on with the mayor a couple of weeks ago and the new international facility in Seattle and continued expansions in Salt Lake and improvements in Minneapolis, many other places. So we're going after the customer experience on the ground as well as in the air with a heightened focus on premium. That's about all we can say.\nOperator: Myles Walton, UBS.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. There are some concerns about looking forward potential consumer softening through the course of the year. And obviously, you're not seeing that in 2Q. But I was wondering, Ed, if you're looking for signals of softening in your business, do you think it would sort of start to show up first in a lower uptake of premium products? Show up first in maybe leisure roads, demand drying up there or somewhere else. Maybe you can just talk to what you'd look for in your watch tower.\nEd Bastian: Well, you're right, Myles, we're not seeing it. But at the same time, we acknowledge our crystal ball is only as good as the next 60 to 90 days or whatever we have in terms of kind of a decent build of bookings on hand. And certainly, the next 60 to 90 days look good, as evidenced by our guidance. So we expect a very strong summer coming through that. Consumer -- the health of the consumer is something we spend a lot of time talking about and watching and looking at. But there's other elements at play here with respect to the consumer. One is that, consumers have not been traveling over the last two years. So this is a category that they're prioritizing as they're looking at where their spend is going into travel. You see it in credit card data, you see it all across the board. And this is not just true at Delta, this is true within our industry. Hotels are seeing it, rental car companies, et cetera. People are looking for experiences. You're seeing a pretty significant shift coming out of goods and retail into experiences and services. And that's not just the fact that people haven't traveled, they've also saved money as they've accumulated some meaningful cash and discretionary income for what they have been doing over the last couple of years. So we feel pretty strongly that we're going to continue to see the strong demand extend beyond just the normal summer surge but into the fall. At the same time, we're watching it. I think the place we've been looking for is pricing resistance. When we start to see pricing, particularly with high input costs like fuel, starting to challenge our demand and supply assumptions, then we'll take the next step-up. For now, we're feeling cautiously bullish about the summer.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Glen, if I could, on your commentary on yields improving sequentially through the balance of 2Q, I assume that is based on what you're seeing in advanced book yields. Can you just comment on like when you add it all up, not just advanced book yields but also bookings, how would you characterize kind of your visibility into May, June versus a normal time? Is it also running ahead? I mean it's not as snarky as a question as it sounds. I guess my question is, as you offer higher fares out into the any pushback, or are you seeing any hesitancy?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I'd say absolutely not. As a matter of fact, we've been trying to catch up to this robust demand. And our quest in the revenue management team, who I think has done an excellent job in managing this surge, is to not run out of seats as we get towards the peak travel, summer travel season. So we want to have reasonably priced offers in market right up to day of departure and we don't want to be running out of seats. Having said that, we are running ahead in terms of absolute bookings domestically in the rest of the quarter. And so we're actively managing that down a little bit so that we don't run out as we get very close to departure date. So I hope that gives you some color as to what we're looking at right now. But we're, right now, in the mode of trading traffic for yield.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful. And then I don't know if we've seen enough of kind of an off-peak environment yet here in 2Q, but can you contrast for us how are you seeing sort of peak yield improvement relative to 2019 versus off-peak yield improvement? Are you starting to see any, I guess, torque on off-peak? Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: No. As a matter of fact, when you look at where we're booked ahead, we have had the offers slightly ahead in peak days and peak travel periods versus off-peak. And we've seen the consumer demand that you would expect, travelers moving into the off-peak period, but at higher yields. So really, really encouraged by what we see as we head into late spring and summer and we'll see how it actually materializes. But everything we see right now points to a very, very robust travel through the remainder of spring and summer. Q \u2013  Thank you, Glen. Excellent.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Yes. Good morning. Glen, a question on premium revenue. What percent is sold at the initial time of ticketing as opposed to during the window between ticketing and departure? And how has that changed over time?\nGlen Hauenstein: We have moved more and more to ticketing, time of ticketing. So I'd say, and I don't have these numbers, I can follow-up with you, but my guess is that they're around 70% is done at time of ticketing and about 30% post-purchase.\nOperator: Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Andrew, your line is open, if you can release your mute function.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Can you hear me?\nOperator: We can hear you now.\nAndrew Didora: Glen, I know it's really early on in the corporate travel recovery, but we've been hearing from some hotel companies that the corporate booking curve has just shortened tremendously. I think they've been mentioning under two weeks versus normally 30 days to 45 days. Are you seeing a similar shortening in the corporate booking curve? And I guess, are you beginning to see any other changes to the way corporates behave here as the recovery unfolds. Thanks.\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes. I would not say that we're seeing that same phenomenon. Our corporate booking seems -- outside of 21 days now, seems to be trending similarly inside of 2021. So I'd say we're seeing very normal booking curves in terms of business. And I think what we're seeing, and this is more anecdotally than you see in the type of transaction you have, but people's reason for traveling for business is slightly different. We are seeing an increase in meetings, an increase in groups, and I think that may be why hotels are seeing further out APs because it's harder to get big blocks.\nAndrew Didora: Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: April, can we please go to the next question. \nOperator: Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good morning. Hello, everyone. Just a quick follow-up to, I think, Brandon's question earlier. So just if you look at the 2Q guide, what's the level of demand recovery that's reflected in that guide? Business demand.\nGlen Hauenstein: The business demand is in the low 70s.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Got it. And then just switching a little bit to the regional airline segment. You started a transition in that segment getting back to, I think, 2012. And kind of accelerated here during COVID. I was just curious if you kind of view the kind of the pilot supply issues of the regional industry are facing, are those kind of transitory, or is there a need to revisit the regional airline strategy at Delta?\nEd Bastian: Thanks, Savi. Yes, there is certainly a challenge to the business model that the regionals are experiencing. And you're right, we've moved pretty aggressively to transition out of the lower category, the 50-seat regional jet, over the last 10 years. So as a result of that, we have less lift coming out of the regional in terms of aggregate shelves and pilot requirements and staffing obligations than some of our other competitors in the industry. They were down to less than 150-seat regionals, probably meaningfully less, at the present time and we don't intend to grow that. It's going to continue to drop. It's a reset period. I think everyone is dealing with their partners in a certain way. Certainly, it's driving up costs on the pilot side, to keep the pilots in the regional category until we're ready to bring them up to the main lines. But fundamentally, it's still a good business for us. We've got a considerable investment in it, and we're going to do our best to continue to grow it, but not at the lower category. We're happy with our 76-seat product. And to the extent, we can get more of those, we would.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from David Vernon of Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good afternoon \u2013 or good morning. Dan, I appreciate the color the incremental cost guidance, I think we can back into what that number looks like in absolute dollar terms. Could you give us some sense of what are the risks and upside, downside risks achieving that cost guidance? Do we need international to really kind of reopen on some set schedule, or do you feel pretty good about where we're going to be? And then as a follow-up, as you think about 2022 to 2023, given that we've hired ahead, as Ed had mentioned, resourcing the network, bringing people in, getting the training up, how should we think about that incremental cost in absolute dollars for the next 5% of capacity relative to what we're seeing in the back half of this year? Not looking for guidance, just trying to get a sense for how we think about \u2013 or how we should be thinking about that cost build from 2022 to 2023 given the hiring ahead of this demand recovery that we've seen at Delta.\nDan Janki: Yeah. The -- so when you think about it, related to it, the biggest risk when you think about the step-up and step function change that we talked about an opportunity ultimately comes back to capacity. And it's the ASMs that we fly. And so that is the \u2013 and you saw that, as we talked about the first half, we're two points lower on capacity and that translates us to being higher than where we thought we'd be. So put that out there, that's the biggest element of it. That's two-thirds of three-quarters of it. The other quarter of it is driving the efficiency, it's the efficiency in the aircraft, it\u2019s the efficiency in the airport, and facilities and the people, but the biggest one is related to the restoration of ASMs. We're building this to be back restored and it's a progression of that. So we think we're \u2013 when we set the multiyear framework, if you go back to that capital markets, said where we'd be this year, would be 7% to 10%, we'd be low to mid-single digits as it relates to 2023 and then very low single digits as it relates to 2024. That again has you stepping up to being 100% restored in that period of time. So you really have, at that point in time, all that transition expense that we've talked about just now has been sunset, your pull through the restoration, now you're getting the real benefit of running it at 100%.\nOperator: Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on the previous commentary on the 1Q to 2Q transition, I mean, obviously, your 2Q guidance is pretty strong. Is it fair to say that the kind of extreme peaks that we saw in the back half of 2021 juxtaposed by extreme troughs between it, kind of that is in the past? So when you think of a spring break to summer travel transition, you're not going to see as much of a trough in between those peaks? Is that because of corporate? And kind of what does that mean for your network reliability and your abilities around the airline?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I think one of the issues is moving out of COVID, we probably will not run the peaks as peaky as we had in the past in order to create more efficiency in the network on a year-round basis. And I think we've really come -- we've instituted a lot of plans in that space to try and ease out some of the peakiness of our operational schedules. And I'll give you an example is, historically pre COVID, we operated about 20% more widebodies in the summer than we did in the winter. So when you think about the way that we utilize our pilots or our flight attendants in those categories, that they had very easy rosters in the off-peak and very tensed rosters in the peak. And what we've been really working on during COVID is to come out of this with a more deseasonalized network, so we can improve the asset utilization, flatten out the peaks and build up on the troughs. And we spent a lot of time thinking about that and creating it. And I think as we get to the fall and winter schedules, you'll see how we've dealt with that. I don't want to talk about that right now in detail, but I think those are the real things that we're looking at doing.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll hear from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning guys and thank you for the time. It's Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Can you maybe talk about your pricing strategy in this inflationary environment? How you've managed it, how that's changed. And then how you've seen the impact to load factors? I think you said in an earlier question, demand hasn't changed. But obviously, for Q2, the guidance for capacity is still 16% below 2019 level. So maybe can you talk about how you're managing all that in?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes. I mean, we don't talk about future pricing as a rule, so we'll stay away from that subject. And I'd just say that when you have stronger demand, you clearly have opportunities on the margin to improve the offer in the marketplace and see if consumers respond to that. And that's really what we've been doing as fuel prices have continued to run up and demand continues to remain strong. So, those levers alone have gotten us to where we feel very comfortable about the 2Q revenue environment.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: Sheila, did you have another question? I'm sorry. That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, to start the media questions.\nTim Mapes: Good morning, everybody. April, if you wouldn't mind reminding everybody about how to ask a question. And we have a lot of energy in the room, if we want to keep the pace of these moving, we'll try to knock out as many of these as possible.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll first hear from Leslie Josephs of CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi. Good morning everybody. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the union drive of your flight attendants. There's been a lot of attention on other companies like Amazon and Starbucks. Do you expect your flight attendants to be unionized this year? And what is the impact on Delta? Do you think it helps or hurts your recruiting? And then my second question, are you still charging $200 a month additional for unvaccinated employees' health insurance? Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Well, Leslie, on the question with respect to labor and union, this is not new at Delta. We've been the unions for many, many years looking at the Delta employees and have been actively seeking their support. So we, on the one hand, absolutely support our employees to make the best interest -- the best decision that's in their best interest. But at the same time, we know historically that the employees of Delta have been best served by having the direct relationship with our leadership. So we don't -- this is not anything new or different. It's really more of the same. So I wouldn't read too much into what the -- what's going on at Amazon or Starbucks or other places and try to equate that to Delta. It's a very different situation. And we've dropped as of this month the additional insurance surcharge given the fact that we really do believe that the pandemic has moved to a seasonal virus and any employees that haven't been vaccinated will not be paying extra insurance costs going forward.\nLeslie Josephs: Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: Hi. Thanks so much. Just curious what your take is on all the discussions of consolidation among some of the midsized airlines without asking you to comment any specific deal that may or may not happen. Just how would that sort of change the competitive landscape if you did start to see more consolidation among some of these carriers?\nEd Bastian: Ali, that's a really good try, but we're not going to bite on that either.\nAlison Sider: Okay. Thanks. \nOperator: Next, we'll hear from David Koenig of Associated Press.\nDavid Koenig: Hey, good morning. Glen, you said you were hearing good signs, as you put it about Washington perhaps rolling back the pre-departure test requirement. What exactly are you hearing and from whom? And I guess I'd ask the same question about the mask mandate.\nGlen Hauenstein : Maybe I'll turn that over to Peter, our Chief Legal Officer.\nPeter Carter: We were obviously engage throughout the administration, and I will tell you that we are getting a strong indication that the testing, the pre-departure testing will be phased out in the near future which is, of course, quite encouraging.\nOperator: Dawn Gilbertson, USA Today.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi. Good morning. Two questions. First for Glen. There are a lot of questions about pricing resistance. And just a quick check of your fares for a July trip showed $1,500 round trip from Atlanta to Maui, $750 from LAX to Orlando. Are a lot of Americans going to be priced out of vacations this summer? And do you fear any backlash? That's my first question. And the second one is, Ed, you mentioned at the top of the call about travelers' patience? Where are you still seeing issues? And how long before -- I mean, how long will travelers put up, say, with long waits on the phone and other ways to reach you guys? Thank you very much.\nGlen Hauenstein : Sure. We haven't seen a lot of resistance to the price points that we have in market, and our goal is to have reasonable price points in market up to day of departure. And as we head to the peak, there are going to be constraints on peak days. And so as you shop around, if you're looking for lower fares, you have to be flexible in terms of which days you'd be willing to fly. But as we sit today, we have a load factor cushion versus where we sat in 2019. So we have a higher percentage of our total seats already booked which is, of course, putting a little bit of pressure on the ones we have remaining to sell in terms of increasing the offers on the margin. So look, my advice to travelers is to book early and be flexible if fares are your most important attribute. But what we're seeing more and more is that, that is not the only attribute. The quality of service and that level of service counts more and more. So I hope that answered your question.\nEd Bastian: And Dawn, on the question to reservation specifically, if that's what you were asking. We have continued a very, very aggressive drumbeat of hiring in reservations to the point we're now over 50% of our total employees and reservations have been hired just within the last couple of years and we're continuing to grow that. And as our people are getting more experienced and more comfortable, the service levels continue to improve. And we've also invested aggressively in our digital self-service options where, several years ago, maybe only 20% of the reasons people would call us could -- they could actually manage it digitally through self-service channels. Today, that's over 60% of the reasons people call us can be handled digitally. And people are continuing to expand and the adoption of self-service is growing substantially. Obviously, as demand has surged, that continues to put more pressure on the phones. As international is opening, that puts more pressure on the phones. But on balance, our phones are generally even -- and we allocate based on the level of service and the dial-in category, they get responded to the quickest. But on average, the wait times in the phones are less than 30 minutes.\nGlen Hauenstein: I'd just make one -- the number of transactions that you could actually complete on digital is in the low 80s. The adoption rate is in the low 60s. So continuing to push people. And since you have a direct line to the consumer is encouraging, continue to encourage them to seek a digital answer first rather than calling and waiting on the line because most -- only very complicated transactions now can't be handled digitally.\nTim Mapes: With that, April, we have time for one final question before we turn it back over to Ed, please.\nOperator: Absolutely. Our final question will come from Niraj Chokshi of The New York Times.\nNiraj Chokshi: Hi. Thank you. I just had two questions on fuel. First, I was wondering if you could speak to the effect of the higher cost of fuel could have on fares. And the other is if there's anything more you could add about sort of the role that refinery playing and helping to offset that?\nEd Bastian: I'll take the first question, and Dan can talk to the refinery. It's really a function of demand. To the extent we continue to see very, very strong demand for our product, our ability to push on not just the increased cost of fuel, but all of our cost inputs, we're shortening the time lag between when we experience that cost and when it's in the pricing structure. But it's really a function of demand more so than any decisions that we take on our own.\nDan Janki: And then related to the role of refinery as it relates to managing the fuel. 20% of the refinery production is jet, and that jet fuel goes to our New York operations. So it is a direct hedge as it relates to the spreads associated with that. So it's really 100% hedged as it relates to how we run our operations and what it provides. The rest of the 80% production is diesel and gasoline as you go through that process. And so that provides a partial hedge related to of diesel and gas to jet. And so by and large, the refinery when you think about in aggregate as it relates to spreads, it's about a 40% to 50% hedge as it relates to our fuel costs.\nNiraj Chokshi: Thanks. And just on fares, last month at the JPMorgan Conference, Glen had given an estimate that Delta would need to recover, I think, it was 15% to 20% each way on a $400 round trip average. Are you able to kind of provide any update on that kind of figure given the higher fuel costs now?\nEd Bastian: This is Ed again. We \u2013 fares are all over the place, they move every day and fuel prices move every day, so we're not going to track to any specific comment. I think you heard in our remarks that we're actually seeing in pricing today real-time coverage for where fuel costs are.\nOperator: And now at this time, I'll turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing comments.\nEd Bastian: Well, I want to thank you all for joining us. We are thrilled with the performance of our team, the progress we've made in terms of serving the demand that is returning, we've been waiting for two years to see this, and we're ready to go, customers are ready to go, and we look forward to a very, very strong spring and summer season and look forward to speaking to you all in July, when we can report on the second quarter results. Everybody have a good day. Thanks for joining us today.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. We are proud to have raised the Ukrainian flag at our global headquarters in Atlanta in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. At Delta, we've provided meaningful financial and operational support to assist the people of the region in connection with our partnership through the International Red Cross. This morning, we reported March quarter results, marking another important step forward in our recovery. We generated $200 million of free cash flow in the quarter and a 10% operating margin in the month of March. Our revenue recovery in the March quarter reached 79% of 2019 levels, five points ahead of the midpoint of our initial guidance. As expected, January and February generated operating losses. As Omicron receded, we saw a surge in demand, supporting an inflection to a solid profit in the month of March. Delta continues to provide best-in-class operational, customer and financial results in a dynamic environment. This results from the dedication, professionalism and hard work of Delta's more than 75,000 people worldwide. Restoring capacity during a period of rapid demand recovery has proven challenging for all of us in the industry but Delta people continued to lead the way, I want to thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we navigate the challenges of ramping up operations into the peak travel period. And I know, our teams have been working incredibly hard, and I want to thank all of them for what they're doing for our customers and for each other. We rewarded our people with a special profit sharing payout in February based on the second half of 2021 profitability and announced a 4% pay increase that's going to be effective May 1. These actions align with Delta's long-standing values of shared success with our people. With the rebound in demand, the month of March was the best cash sales month in Delta's history, outpacing our prior record from spring of 2019 despite offering 10% fewer seats. In March, we had our first month in two years of positive unit revenue compared to 2019, and we achieved record co-brand acquisitions, co-brand spend and cargo revenue. Domestic consumer revenues are exceeding 2019 levels and the recovery in business travel, revenue has accelerated as offices reopen and business travelers rebuild face-to-face relationships. Demand for long-haul international is growing, as travel restrictions lift, led by the Transatlantic. To date, we have not seen an impact to travel demand from the conflict in Ukraine, but we, of course, are monitoring this closely. Nearly all European countries have now removed entry testing requirements for vaccinated customers. We continue to join the rest of the US travel industry, in urging the US government to lift predeparture testing requirements. As we prepare for the peak summer season, we continue to be very focused on operational readiness. With 4,000 new members joining the Delta team already this year, we feel good about our staffing and our ability to meet demand as we continue to restore the airline. Our customers are seeing the benefits of our ongoing investments to improve the travel experience. This spring, we are opening new, modernized terminals in Los Angeles, LaGuardia and Seattle. These generational investments enhance Delta's already leading positions in key hubs and provide an elevated ground experience for our customers. We continue to upgrade our fleet, recently taken delivery of our first Airbus 321neo. The state-of-the-art aircraft is scheduled to begin service May 20 from Boston to San Francisco and features our new domestic first-class seat design, with nearly one-third of the seats in premium cabins and improved fuel efficiency, this will be the best aircraft we fly for our customers and generate the highest returns for our owners. Our strategic decision to accelerate investments in our airports, our fleet and our technology during the pandemic will benefit Delta and our customers for years to come. As COVID shifts from a pandemic to a manageable seasonal virus, there are clear signs of pent-up demand for travel and experiences, as consumers' spending shifts from goods to services and experiences, travel restrictions lift and business travelers continue to return to the skies. Against this improving backdrop, we are building momentum in the June quarter, with expectations for a 12% to 14% operating margin and strong free cash flow despite higher fuel prices. Our revenue recovery is expected to reach 93% to 97% of the 2019 levels, with double-digit unit revenue improvement. We are successfully recapturing a significant portion of the run-up in fuel. This is occurring almost in real time, given the strong demand environment as well as Delta's growing brand preference, our premium product focus and measured approach to capacity. While we are confident in summer demand and the capacity plans that we have in place, given macro uncertainty, we will remain nimble on capacity for the second half of the year and continue to prioritize sustained profitability. I'd like to pause and put that Q2 guidance into perspective. At 12% to 14% operating profit, we are only four points behind our June 2019 quarterly operating margin, and that's despite fuel prices being up 50% from that time period and our capacity only 85% restored. So we are greatly encouraged by the momentum we are seeing, and we remain confident in our outlook for meaningful full year profit for 2022. As we take note of these achievements, I'm pleased with the progress we're making across the three core priorities we laid out at Capital Markets Day last December. First, we continue to fortify our trusted consumer brand, demonstrated by loyalty and record engagement with our customers. The strength of our brand has never been greater and has been recognized by the Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Business Travel News and many, many others. And our customers are taking note that our Net Promoter Scores consistently above 2019 coming out of the pandemic. We intend to build on the momentum we gained over the last two years. Second, we are restoring our financial performance. As revenue improves and we regain a competitive cost structure, we're returning to profitability, generating strong free cash flow and making progress on debt repayment. And our third priority is building a better future for our people and our planet, including our ongoing commitment to creating a sustainable future for aviation. We are continuing to invest in the physical, emotional and financial well-being of our people, while prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of the company. Our mission of connecting the world has never been more important than it is today, and I'm as confident as ever that we'll achieve our ambition for a leading consumer brand to transcend the industry and deliver financial outcomes that create significant and resilient long-term value for all of our stakeholders. It's been an encouraging period of recovery, and it's exciting to see our customers returning to the skies. Thank you again. And with that, I'll turn it over to Glen to update the revenue environment. Hi, Catie, this is Ed, I'll take that. We've been at this for the better part of the last 18 months getting ahead of it. And we hired over 10,000 people last year. We hired another 4,000 people already this year. So we've hired 15,000 people. And we are largely where we need to be on staffing. Yes, pilots have a training pipeline and it will take some time before pilots are fully in category and where we want them positioned. It'll probably take another year or two. Flight attendants, likewise, we're hiring flight attendants and there's a queue as to how much many people we can put through the training pipeline. But that's not where the real congestion is. It's in the airport, it's on the ground experience, it's making sure we have our suppliers ready and positioned. One thing we did last year, really almost two years ago now, is we took over a lot of the functions at the airport that had been outsourced, catering, cleaning, wheelchair pushing. And we have Delta people in position, and we've hired Delta people to do it to make certain that we get the best experience for our customers. And you know what? Not only are people doing a much better job at it, we're also doing it much more efficiently and effectively and customers are appreciating it. So the labor situation, you're right, has changed pretty dramatically over the course of the last two years. We've been out ahead and that's why you look at our operational stats over that time frame, we've led the industry consistently. Hi, Helane, no, we're not. One of the great things about our brand is throughout this period we've been able to attract and bring in the 15,000 people I talked about with fundamentally not having to change the scales we've used in select high-priced markets, some sign-on bonuses, very judiciously. But fundamentally, no, our scales are intact and the 4% increase May 1st helps. Off a good year last year. Well, thanks, Conor. I think, again, throughout the pandemic, we have, as Glen said, been the most disciplined in the return of supply and have -- probably have a better match to demand than anyone else. And it's been interesting to watch because a lot of airlines have taken different approaches over the course of the last two years. Fundamentally, our commitment and our promise to our customers is to give them a great, safe, on-time, reliable experience, and we continue to invest more and more in the premium categories of our aircraft, of our service elements and the quality of our -- of the service that our people drive and it speaks for itself. We take, very humbly, the various awards we've won over the course of the last couple of years. I think we've expanded our leadership during COVID. We had the most to lose, and I think we gained the most over that time frame, candidly. And we've got some really nice momentum as we're bringing and opening new airports. We've got the new LaGuardia opening in June, which will all be very pleased to be the new LAX that we cut the ribbon on with the mayor a couple of weeks ago and the new international facility in Seattle and continued expansions in Salt Lake and improvements in Minneapolis, many other places. So we're going after the customer experience on the ground as well as in the air with a heightened focus on premium. That's about all we can say. Well, you're right, Myles, we're not seeing it. But at the same time, we acknowledge our crystal ball is only as good as the next 60 to 90 days or whatever we have in terms of kind of a decent build of bookings on hand. And certainly, the next 60 to 90 days look good, as evidenced by our guidance. So we expect a very strong summer coming through that. Consumer -- the health of the consumer is something we spend a lot of time talking about and watching and looking at. But there's other elements at play here with respect to the consumer. One is that, consumers have not been traveling over the last two years. So this is a category that they're prioritizing as they're looking at where their spend is going into travel. You see it in credit card data, you see it all across the board. And this is not just true at Delta, this is true within our industry. Hotels are seeing it, rental car companies, et cetera. People are looking for experiences. You're seeing a pretty significant shift coming out of goods and retail into experiences and services. And that's not just the fact that people haven't traveled, they've also saved money as they've accumulated some meaningful cash and discretionary income for what they have been doing over the last couple of years. So we feel pretty strongly that we're going to continue to see the strong demand extend beyond just the normal summer surge but into the fall. At the same time, we're watching it. I think the place we've been looking for is pricing resistance. When we start to see pricing, particularly with high input costs like fuel, starting to challenge our demand and supply assumptions, then we'll take the next step-up. For now, we're feeling cautiously bullish about the summer. Thanks, Savi. Yes, there is certainly a challenge to the business model that the regionals are experiencing. And you're right, we've moved pretty aggressively to transition out of the lower category, the 50-seat regional jet, over the last 10 years. So as a result of that, we have less lift coming out of the regional in terms of aggregate shelves and pilot requirements and staffing obligations than some of our other competitors in the industry. They were down to less than 150-seat regionals, probably meaningfully less, at the present time and we don't intend to grow that. It's going to continue to drop. It's a reset period. I think everyone is dealing with their partners in a certain way. Certainly, it's driving up costs on the pilot side, to keep the pilots in the regional category until we're ready to bring them up to the main lines. But fundamentally, it's still a good business for us. We've got a considerable investment in it, and we're going to do our best to continue to grow it, but not at the lower category. We're happy with our 76-seat product. And to the extent, we can get more of those, we would. Well, Leslie, on the question with respect to labor and union, this is not new at Delta. We've been the unions for many, many years looking at the Delta employees and have been actively seeking their support. So we, on the one hand, absolutely support our employees to make the best interest -- the best decision that's in their best interest. But at the same time, we know historically that the employees of Delta have been best served by having the direct relationship with our leadership. So we don't -- this is not anything new or different. It's really more of the same. So I wouldn't read too much into what the -- what's going on at Amazon or Starbucks or other places and try to equate that to Delta. It's a very different situation. And we've dropped as of this month the additional insurance surcharge given the fact that we really do believe that the pandemic has moved to a seasonal virus and any employees that haven't been vaccinated will not be paying extra insurance costs going forward. Ali, that's a really good try, but we're not going to bite on that either. And Dawn, on the question to reservation specifically, if that's what you were asking. We have continued a very, very aggressive drumbeat of hiring in reservations to the point we're now over 50% of our total employees and reservations have been hired just within the last couple of years and we're continuing to grow that. And as our people are getting more experienced and more comfortable, the service levels continue to improve. And we've also invested aggressively in our digital self-service options where, several years ago, maybe only 20% of the reasons people would call us could -- they could actually manage it digitally through self-service channels. Today, that's over 60% of the reasons people call us can be handled digitally. And people are continuing to expand and the adoption of self-service is growing substantially. Obviously, as demand has surged, that continues to put more pressure on the phones. As international is opening, that puts more pressure on the phones. But on balance, our phones are generally even -- and we allocate based on the level of service and the dial-in category, they get responded to the quickest. But on average, the wait times in the phones are less than 30 minutes. I'll take the first question, and Dan can talk to the refinery. It's really a function of demand. To the extent we continue to see very, very strong demand for our product, our ability to push on not just the increased cost of fuel, but all of our cost inputs, we're shortening the time lag between when we experience that cost and when it's in the pricing structure. But it's really a function of demand more so than any decisions that we take on our own. This is Ed again. We \u2013 fares are all over the place, they move every day and fuel prices move every day, so we're not going to track to any specific comment. I think you heard in our remarks that we're actually seeing in pricing today real-time coverage for where fuel costs are. Well, I want to thank you all for joining us. We are thrilled with the performance of our team, the progress we've made in terms of serving the demand that is returning, we've been waiting for two years to see this, and we're ready to go, customers are ready to go, and we look forward to a very, very strong spring and summer season and look forward to speaking to you all in July, when we can report on the second quarter results. Everybody have a good day. Thanks for joining us today."

            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. With robust demand, growing preference for the Delta brand and quick actions to recapture higher fuel prices, we achieved significant milestones in the month of March and have momentum as we head into the summer. None of this would be possible without our people, and I couldn't be prouder of the Delta team and the results that they are delivering. A huge thank you to all. During the March quarter, we generated $8.2 billion of revenue. This was approximately $500 million higher than our initial guidance in January, resulting in a revenue recovery of 79% compared to 2019. We continue to execute a disciplined approach to keeping capacity in line with demand. For the quarter, capacity was 83% restored versus 2019 and at the low end of our initial guide and below the industry. The quarter was a tale of two halves. While Omicron depressed demand in the January and early February, we saw an unparalleled demand recovery from Presidents Day on. Our revenue recovery versus 2019 progressed from 70% in January to approximately 80% in February to 85% in March, with momentum building into April. March was the first month in two years of positive unit revenue compared to 2019 with PRASM up 1% and TRASM up 3%. Premium products once again led the way with domestic premium revenue approximately 100% restored to March of 2019 levels. We also achieved our highest ever monthly cash sales, as Ed mentioned, our highest direct sales, highest co-brand acquisitions, highest co-brand spend and highest cargo revenue in the month of March. Business travel volumes reached the highest post-pandemic levels we've seen and, importantly, in March, corporate fares inflected to positive versus 2019 for the first time. This drove an acceleration in the recovery of business revenues with improvement in both corporate contracted customers and small and medium-sized enterprises. As we exited the quarter, domestic corporate sales improved to approximately 70% recovered versus 2019, and our recent survey results show that 90% of our corporate accounts anticipate travel volumes to increase in the June quarter as offices continue to reopen. Additionally, we are seeing more corporates implement changes to travel policies. For example, domestic travel restrictions have been completely removed for all of our top corporate accounts. And increasingly, corporates are allowing upsells to premium cabins and refundable products. Strength in cash sales and seasonality drove a $2.8 billion sequential increase in our air traffic liability. The increase in advanced ticket sales outpaced normal seasonal trends, resulting in an ATL balance of $9.1 billion at the end of March, up from $6.6 billion in March of 2019. We expect the ATL will continue to build in the June quarter, albeit at a slower rate than what we saw in the March quarter. For the June quarter, we expect revenue recovery versus 2019, as Ed mentioned, to improve to 93% to 97% on 84% capacity restoration. This reflects a low double-digit TRASM growth versus 2019, with all entities expected to post positive unit revenues compared to 2019, except for the Pacific. We expect April yields to be up double-digits compared to 2019 with further strengthening as we approach June, positioning us to successfully recapture a significant portion of the higher prices -- fuel prices in the June quarter. Geographically, domestic and Latin revenues continue to lead the recovery, and fewer restrictions in major international markets are unlocking demand for long-haul travel. We expect a very strong summer in the Transatlantic based on demand trends. And in the Pacific, we are encouraged by the opening of Australia, South Korea and other countries in Southeast Asia. When countries reopen, we see a rapid restoration of demand. For example, following South Korea's border opening on April 1, we expect load factors to improve from the low 50s in March to the low 90s by June. We expect that heavily restricted regions, such as China and Japan, will continue to put pressure on overall Pacific unit revenues until borders fully reopen. A few months ago at Capital Markets Day, we outlined three commercial strategy pillars, and we've made strong progress across each of these at the start of this year. First, our premium products continue to lead the recovery and the introduction of Delta Premium Select to the Transatlantic marketplace has been a success, with early returns far exceeding our expectations. By this summer, we will have expanded Delta -- EPS to 80% of our Transatlantic flights. Over the next few years, we expect premium seat growth to continue to outpace Main Cabin, and we're confident in the consumer shift towards higher-quality products is here to stay. To-date, premium recovery has been led by consumer, and we see further upside as more and more business travelers return to the skies. Next, growing loyalty is evident across several key metrics. Our Net Promoter Score remains above 2019 even as volumes increase. And during the quarter, we acquired a record number of new SkyMiles members and our co-brand spend continues to far outpace 2019, up 39% in the month of March. Loyalty is an important driver of our third pillar, increasing our revenue diversification. Other revenue was fully recovered to 2019 levels during the March quarter, led by loyalty and cargo. Remuneration from American Express during the quarter of $1.2 billion was 25% higher than 2019, a new quarterly record that keeps us on track for our full year goal of more than $5 billion in remuneration. Cargo had an exceptional quarter, up 51% compared to 2019, with the month of March marking our best ever cargo month in the company's history. MRO revenues were 22% below 2019 as supply chain issues slowed our engine throughput. MRO margins remain healthy, and we are excited to scale this business over the next few years as the installed base of next-generation engines continues to grow. By leveraging the Delta platform, we are further diversifying our revenue mix. In the March quarter, premium products and non-ticket revenue sources generated 58% of total revenue, up three points from the same period in 2019. This improvement gives us a high level of confidence in achieving our goal of more than 60% by 2024 as we laid out in Capital Markets Day. In closing, Delta has emerged in a stronger relative position by staying true to our core competitive strengths and our commitment to our customers and employees. And as the final phase of demand recovery takes hold and preference for our brand continues to grow, I am more confident than ever in Delta's path to exceed 2019 financial performance by 2024. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk more about the financials. I think it's all of the above. I think you asked and answered your own question there. You did a great job of articulating our viewpoint is the priority is to operate reliably and the other priorities do not get ahead of demand. So this is a very recent demand increase that we've seen. The uptick just started about six to eight weeks ago, in late February and March. And so as we get through the year, if these demand trends continue, we have the opportunity to take another tick-up or we could pivot in a different direction if warranted. But I think, it has made it very clear to us that being nimble until we get to the very end of this is the key to our success. And I think we've done a very good job as a company being nimble in our offering throughout the pandemic and really been closest to actual demand if you look back at what demand was. Yes, I think we're always hopeful for upside. I think what we're excited about when we dissect the spend is that you can really see the spend moving from goods to services and particularly increases in the airline spend on the card. So those are very encouraging statistics for us to continue to monitor as we move through the year. But I think you've really seeing that as the moving away from goods and the movement towards experiences and services. First, I'll answer the second first. I think that is the next leg up that we see in the demand set, and we think we have very quite robust demand. But there certainly is, in the minds of some consumers, some hesitancy to go abroad and risk being caught, not being able to get back because of catching COVID. So hopefully, we can see that roll back in the next few weeks here. I think the \u2013 we are hearing good signs from Washington. We'll see, hopefully, that comes out here. And that would be one of the final things that we would need in place for us to really say that COVID is in our rearview mirror. So hopefully, that happens. And then your second question was what, I'm sorry. Absolutely. And I think the one that we're really excited about right now is Transatlantic business which for the first time last week crossed domestic restoration in terms of volume. And so that was a big improvement from where we had been just six or eight weeks ago. So it does look like Transatlantic business is returning robustly, and that's very exciting for us. And I think what we're also excited about is this survey that we just got back that said 90% expect to travel more in 2Q than they did at 1Q. So I think when we report to you next quarter, we'll see both of those numbers continuing to move up. And of course, the big question mark is when will Japan and China reopen? And that's probably not in this next quarter and hopefully some time this fall, but that's a little bit further out. What I would say is when these countries are open, business returns quickly. So to Korea, to Australia, we've seen very rapid increases in business demand as those countries have opened. Right. Well, clearly, we know about supply chains trying to catch up. And clearly, airfreight has been one of the ways to relieve that pressure. And so we've seen airfreight rates continue to move in a favorable direction. I'd say the one caution I have right now is the closure of China. And China has been, of course, a very strong, strong market for us in the cargo area. And with Shanghai closed and we're literally not flying to China right now until Shanghai reopens, so that's going to weigh a little bit on cargo revenues as we move forward. But as that does reopen, then you can see that pent-up demand for goods that need to get shipped out of China and potentially even another leg up. So I'd say, we're in a temporary pause right now because of the issues in China, but I expect, as China comes back online, and I don't know the exact date, I don't think anybody does, but we could see an even stronger demand coming out of that. Yes, off a great year last year. Well, I'd say absolutely not. As a matter of fact, we've been trying to catch up to this robust demand. And our quest in the revenue management team, who I think has done an excellent job in managing this surge, is to not run out of seats as we get towards the peak travel, summer travel season. So we want to have reasonably priced offers in market right up to day of departure and we don't want to be running out of seats. Having said that, we are running ahead in terms of absolute bookings domestically in the rest of the quarter. And so we're actively managing that down a little bit so that we don't run out as we get very close to departure date. So I hope that gives you some color as to what we're looking at right now. But we're, right now, in the mode of trading traffic for yield. No. As a matter of fact, when you look at where we're booked ahead, we have had the offers slightly ahead in peak days and peak travel periods versus off-peak. And we've seen the consumer demand that you would expect, travelers moving into the off-peak period, but at higher yields. So really, really encouraged by what we see as we head into late spring and summer and we'll see how it actually materializes. But everything we see right now points to a very, very robust travel through the remainder of spring and summer. Q \u2013  Thank you, Glen. Excellent. We have moved more and more to ticketing, time of ticketing. So I'd say, and I don't have these numbers, I can follow-up with you, but my guess is that they're around 70% is done at time of ticketing and about 30% post-purchase. Yes. I would not say that we're seeing that same phenomenon. Our corporate booking seems -- outside of 21 days now, seems to be trending similarly inside of 2021. So I'd say we're seeing very normal booking curves in terms of business. And I think what we're seeing, and this is more anecdotally than you see in the type of transaction you have, but people's reason for traveling for business is slightly different. We are seeing an increase in meetings, an increase in groups, and I think that may be why hotels are seeing further out APs because it's harder to get big blocks. The business demand is in the low 70s. Well, I think one of the issues is moving out of COVID, we probably will not run the peaks as peaky as we had in the past in order to create more efficiency in the network on a year-round basis. And I think we've really come -- we've instituted a lot of plans in that space to try and ease out some of the peakiness of our operational schedules. And I'll give you an example is, historically pre COVID, we operated about 20% more widebodies in the summer than we did in the winter. So when you think about the way that we utilize our pilots or our flight attendants in those categories, that they had very easy rosters in the off-peak and very tensed rosters in the peak. And what we've been really working on during COVID is to come out of this with a more deseasonalized network, so we can improve the asset utilization, flatten out the peaks and build up on the troughs. And we spent a lot of time thinking about that and creating it. And I think as we get to the fall and winter schedules, you'll see how we've dealt with that. I don't want to talk about that right now in detail, but I think those are the real things that we're looking at doing. Yes. I mean, we don't talk about future pricing as a rule, so we'll stay away from that subject. And I'd just say that when you have stronger demand, you clearly have opportunities on the margin to improve the offer in the marketplace and see if consumers respond to that. And that's really what we've been doing as fuel prices have continued to run up and demand continues to remain strong. So, those levers alone have gotten us to where we feel very comfortable about the 2Q revenue environment. Maybe I'll turn that over to Peter, our Chief Legal Officer. Sure. We haven't seen a lot of resistance to the price points that we have in market, and our goal is to have reasonable price points in market up to day of departure. And as we head to the peak, there are going to be constraints on peak days. And so as you shop around, if you're looking for lower fares, you have to be flexible in terms of which days you'd be willing to fly. But as we sit today, we have a load factor cushion versus where we sat in 2019. So we have a higher percentage of our total seats already booked which is, of course, putting a little bit of pressure on the ones we have remaining to sell in terms of increasing the offers on the margin. So look, my advice to travelers is to book early and be flexible if fares are your most important attribute. But what we're seeing more and more is that, that is not the only attribute. The quality of service and that level of service counts more and more. So I hope that answered your question. I'd just make one -- the number of transactions that you could actually complete on digital is in the low 80s. The adoption rate is in the low 60s. So continuing to push people. And since you have a direct line to the consumer is encouraging, continue to encourage them to seek a digital answer first rather than calling and waiting on the line because most -- only very complicated transactions now can't be handled digitally."

            "name": "Dan Janki",
            "content": "Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. Starting with the highlights of the March quarter. Our operating loss was $793 million, was better than our expectation. As anticipated, we saw losses in January and February due to Omicron and seasonal weakness. And we inflected to a solid profit in March, with a 9.4% adjusted operating margin. Fuel expense was $2.1 billion. It increased 32% sequentially from the December quarter. Fuel price per gallon averaged $2.79 for the quarter. This included a $0.07 per gallon benefit from the refinery. Non-fuel costs rose 6% sequentially, with non-fuel CASM up 15% compared to 2019 on 17% less capacity. We generated operating cash flow of $1.8 billion. We reinvested $1.6 billion into the business, resulting in free cash flow of $200 million. Delivering a profit in the month of March and positive cash flow for the quarter were important achievements, especially considering the impact of Omicron and higher fuel prices. We ended the quarter with adjusted net debt of $20.9 billion. This was more than $1 billion better than our initial expectations due to strength in cash receipts that Ed and Glen spoke to. We repaid $1.4 billion of gross debt, ending March with nearly $13 billion of liquidity. Now turning to the outlook. We expect the June quarter non-fuel CASM to be up 17% compared to 2019. The two point increase from the March quarter is driven by higher selling-related costs, an expected 45% sequential increase in revenue and our anticipated step-up in maintenance costs on a similar level of capacity restoration. With the first half non-fuel CASM in the mid-teens, which is two points higher than planned on lower capacity, we expect to be closer to the high end of the full range of up 7% to 10%, implying the second half will improve up to the mid-single digits. This improvement is driven by continued capacity restoration from the low to mid-80s in the first half to the mid-90s by the end of the year. The resulting scale and efficiency will drive the step function change in our non-fuel CASM. Now let me give you a little context on how we get this improvement. The recovery in international travel enables us to shift our wide-bodies from our domestic to our international, where we get better efficiency from gauge and stage and improved staffing. Narrow-body utilization will improve, with a 10-point increase expected by the end of the year, giving us a combined benefit of higher capacity and more efficient allocation of our fleet. Further, as we fill out our schedules and we create greater stability in our operations with more consistency and depth in both the domestic and the international network, this is enabling efficiency gains in our facilities and productivity of our workforce. We remain confident in our multiyear cost framework laid out at Capital Markets Day. Regaining a competitive cost structure is critical to our success. At the same time, we will continue to remain nimble on capacity as we manage for profitability in this higher fuel price environment. On fuel for the June quarter, we expect an adjusted fuel price per gallon of $3.20 to $3.35. This includes a $0.20 benefit from the refinery, and these are based on the forward curves as of last Friday. Our Monroe refinery provides a unique benefit, acting as a partial hedge to elevated cracks. This is especially true with New York Harbor Jet cracks, where our production at Monroe provides 100% offset. Based on our June quarter outlook for revenue and costs, we expect operating margins to be between 12% and 14%. With the expectations for solid profitability and further build in our air traffic liability, we expect to generate another quarter of positive free cash flow after investing $1.2 billion in the business and expect to end the June quarter with adjusted net debt of approximately $20 billion. As we achieve sustained cash generation, we will continue to opportunistically manage our balance sheet, reducing debt to return to investment-grade metrics and making progress towards our $15 billion adjusted net debt target by the end of 2024. For the year, our CapEx outlook of $6 billion is unchanged, with our reinvestment primarily driven by the continued renewal of our fleet. We expect to take delivery of approximately 70 new and gently used aircraft this year, including 26 A321neos. This large grade gauge aircraft fits well with our upgauging strategy and will be our most fuel-efficient aircraft in our fleet with the lowest seat cost. We also continue to accept delivery of new 220s, three, 3900s and three, 5900s. These aircraft are expected to contribute to the full restoration of our capacity and to our goal of using a 7% less fuel per ASM in 2022 when compared to 2019. In addition to the financial benefits, improved efficiency is an important step in our journey to a more sustainable future. During the quarter, we announced actions to scale and advance sustainable fuels. We signed an offtake agreement with Gevo for approximately 75 million gallons of SAF annually over seven years. We anticipate to start in mid-2026 progressing us towards our 2030 10% SAF commitment. We also announced a collaboration with Airbus on the research and development of hydrogen-powered aircraft and the infrastructure it requires. So in closing, we are executing against our priorities laid out at Capital Markets Day, and I'm encouraged by the momentum in our financial recovery. I would sincerely like to thank the Delta people for everything they do every day. Our people will always be our most important competitive advantage. So with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A. Yeah. The -- so when you think about it, related to it, the biggest risk when you think about the step-up and step function change that we talked about an opportunity ultimately comes back to capacity. And it's the ASMs that we fly. And so that is the \u2013 and you saw that, as we talked about the first half, we're two points lower on capacity and that translates us to being higher than where we thought we'd be. So put that out there, that's the biggest element of it. That's two-thirds of three-quarters of it. The other quarter of it is driving the efficiency, it's the efficiency in the aircraft, it's the efficiency in the airport, and facilities and the people, but the biggest one is related to the restoration of ASMs. We're building this to be back restored and it's a progression of that. So we think we're \u2013 when we set the multiyear framework, if you go back to that capital markets, said where we'd be this year, would be 7% to 10%, we'd be low to mid-single digits as it relates to 2023 and then very low single digits as it relates to 2024. That again has you stepping up to being 100% restored in that period of time. So you really have, at that point in time, all that transition expense that we've talked about just now has been sunset, your pull through the restoration, now you're getting the real benefit of running it at 100%. And then related to the role of refinery as it relates to managing the fuel. 20% of the refinery production is jet, and that jet fuel goes to our New York operations. So it is a direct hedge as it relates to the spreads associated with that. So it's really 100% hedged as it relates to how we run our operations and what it provides. The rest of the 80% production is diesel and gasoline as you go through that process. And so that provides a partial hedge related to of diesel and gas to jet. And so by and large, the refinery when you think about in aggregate as it relates to spreads, it's about a 40% to 50% hedge as it relates to our fuel costs."

My name is Matthew, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Matthew, and good morning. Thanks for joining us for our December quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta\u2019s performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take analyst questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we\u2019ll move to our media questions.

And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Bastian: Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported our full year and December quarter results, posting fourth quarter earnings of $1.1 billion, or $1.28 per share, on record quarterly revenue that was 11% higher than 2022 and an operating margin of 10%. I want to sincerely thank the 100,000 strong Delta team for their outstanding work in delivering these results and serving our customers. Delta carried more travelers this holiday season than any other time in our history, and we delivered industry-leading operational performance with the number one system completion factor amongst our peer set throughout the December quarter. To put that in context, we carried 9 million customers, a record 9 million customers, I\u2019d add, on 60,000 mainline flights over the holiday period, with fewer than 40 cancellations in aggregate. Our December quarter results marked a strong close to year two of our three-year plan. For the full year, we reported earnings of $6.25 per share, the second highest EPS result in our history on revenue that was 20% higher than the prior year. We delivered an 11.6% operating margin and pre-tax income of $5.2 billion, a near doubling over 2022. We generate free cash flow of $2 billion while investing $5.3 billion back into the business, and we improved our leverage by two full turns and reinstated our quarterly dividend. Return on invested capital was 13.4%, a five-point improvement from 2022, a tremendous amount of progress, especially if you consider where we sat the short three years ago, and I\u2019m so proud of our team across the board. Sharing our financial success is a long-standing pillar of Delta\u2019s culture, and I\u2019m thrilled to announce that we\u2019ll be rewarding our employees with $1.4 billion in well-earned profit sharing on Valentine\u2019s Day. For our employees, the estimated payout will be approximately 10% of eligible 2023 compensation, about double of what last year\u2019s payment was. I expect our profit sharing payments will be more than our three largest competitors combined.  Our people consistently deliver operational excellence with a relentless focus on raising the bar at every stage of the travel journey to deliver safe, reliable, and caring service for our customers. They are the reason our brand and our customer loyalty lead the industry, why Delta was recognized as the world\u2019s 12th most admired company by Fortune, and why Glassdoor named us yesterday as the 13th best employer in the country. In 2023, we made meaningful investments in our people, our operation, and our customers. We provided well-deserved pay increases for the Delta team, continuing our philosophy of industry-leading pay for industry-leading performance. In the operation, the investments that we made supported the best-in-class operational performance that Delta has long been known for. Our operational excellence was recognized by Cirium last week, which named us, yet again, the most on-time airline in North America. Our people and our operational reliability are the foundation of Delta\u2019s trusted consumer brand, and we are building on that foundation as we elevate the premium flying experience and grow our SkyMiles members\u2019 engagement with Delta. Today, we also announced an order for 20 Airbus 350-1000 aircraft, with options for 20 more, for delivery starting in 2026. These planes complement our fleet strategy and will offer a world-class customer experience for international travelers with more premium seats, higher gauge, and great customer amenities. These aircraft are over 20% more fuel-efficient than the 767s that they\u2019ll be replacing, further supporting our long-term sustainability goals. And with the successful launch of fast, free Wi-Fi and Delta Sync, we are enhancing the in-flight entertainment experience for SkyMiles members. We expect to have these products rolled out globally by the end of this year. On the ground, we are building the airports of the future in some of the most important markets and adding new Delta Sky Clubs to provide our customers a world-class airport experience. We completed our transformation at Los Angeles 18 months ahead of schedule, including a state-of-the-art facility and a new Delta Sky Club that was named North America\u2019s Best Airline Lounge for 2023 by Business Traveler. We opened the latest phase of our Salt Lake City expansion, and we\u2019ll complete the generational rebuild of LaGuardia this year. Our digital investments continue as we work to increase our agility and provide employees with better tools and customers with a more seamless experience. Customers visited the Fly Delta app over 1 billion times last year, using our self-service tools almost 10x more often than 2019, with much higher overall satisfaction. As 2024 begins, our enterprise has moved from a period of restoration to optimization. We are focused on delivering excellent reliability, elevating the customer experience, and improving efficiency across the company to support continued growth in our earnings and our cash flow. We expect demand to remain strong, particularly for the premium experiences that Delta provides. Consumer spend is continuing to shift from goods to services, and our customer base is in a healthy financial position with travel remaining a top priority. And corporate travel continues to improve with demand accelerating into year-end. On supply, industry growth is normalizing after several years of network restoration. For 2024, we plan to grow Delta\u2019s capacity 3% to 5% below the mid-single-digit range that we discussed at our June Investor Day as we\u2019ve refined our plan. Domestically, supply and demand are coming into better balance as the industry adjusts to rising costs of production, and we are seeing a positive inflection in domestic unit revenue growth. Internationally, we expect another strong year as we optimize our network and leverage our global JV partners. With that backdrop, we are providing full-year 2024 guidance for earnings of $6 to $7 per share and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. Free cash guidance is up to $2 billion higher than 2023, driven by growth and profitability, lower CapEx, and an improved mix of cash sales. As we continue to grow earnings and reduce debt, we will further reduce leverage and advance our balance sheet towards investment grade metrics. Glen and Dan will provide more details shortly, including our outlook for the March quarter.  In closing, the people of Delta delivered a remarkable 2023, leading the industry operationally and financially while providing a world-class experience for our customers. Delta is well-positioned to build on our momentum in the new year with continued growth in earnings and cash flow in 2024. I could not be more excited about what\u2019s ahead for Delta and our customers, and I am confident that our returns-focused strategy will drive significant value creation for our owners in the years to come. Thank you again for the support you show to our company, and with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Glen.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and dedication this year. For the full year, we delivered record revenues of $55 billion, about 20% higher than pre-pandemic. Strong execution on our commercial strategy resulted in significant outperformance against the industry with international delivering record margins and profits. We finished the year with unit revenues 3% higher than 2022, also about 20% above pre-pandemic levels. Diversified revenue streams, including premium and loyalty, generated 55% of revenue, reflecting Delta\u2019s differentiated strategy. Premium led all year with record paid load factors and yield growth outpacing Main Cabin. The rollout of Delta Premium Select on long-haul international is nearly complete and the revenue generation has been above our expectations. As we continue to increase our premium seat mix and segment the cabin through our five product strategy, we have structurally improved the international margins. Our loyalty program continued to exceed our expectations with record SkyMiles acquisitions in 2023. Total loyalty revenue was up 19% over the prior year with 15% growth in co-brand spend and increasing mix of premium cards in our Amex co-brand portfolio. In recognition of our commitment to the Business Traveler, Delta was named number one in Business Travel News Airline survey for an unprecedented 13th consecutive year. Delta gained corporate share during the year and successfully launched SkyMiles for business, providing small to medium sized companies new benefits to support further growth in the important SME segment. Corporate sales accelerated into year end, including double-digit year-over-year growth in the month of December. Technology and Financial Services led this momentum for the December quarter with Media and Auto sectors seeing notable traction following the strike resolutions. December quarter revenue was a record $13.7 billion, 11% higher than 2022. While unit revenues were 3% lower than last year, we are entering the year with momentum in our highest and had experienced our highest cash sales day in history this week. We expect March quarter revenue growth of 3% to 6% over 2023 on capacity growth of 6%, which includes one point from leap day, implying unit revenues will be flat to down 3% over last year. This is a two point sequential improvement on a year-over-year basis from the December quarter. Our March quarter faces headwinds from three dynamics when compared to last year. These include higher international mix, the normalization of travel credit utilization and lapping a competitor\u2019s operational challenges. Looking through these headwinds, the core fundamentals of the business are improving faster than the headline numbers suggest. With encouraging developments in the domestic environment, we expect domestic unit revenues to inflect to positive in the March quarter. The Transatlantic, our largest international entity, continues to perform well with strong demand through the shoulder period, and we expect unit revenues to grow in the March quarter. In Latin and Pacific, we are rebuilding our networks and improving connectivity with our JV partners, accounting for the majority of capacity growth in the March quarter. These investments are supporting higher short-term profitability, but with lower unit revenues. Turning to our outlook for the full year, premium consumer trends remain strong, and spending on travel experiences continues to outpace overall GDP by 2 to 3 points. We expect solid growth in business demand with nearly 95% of respondents in our recent corporate survey expecting to travel as much or more in 1Q than 4Q. This is a double digit improvement in travel intentions from our last survey. Our commercial strategy in 2024 builds on Delta\u2019s competitive advantages by optimizing our network, growing high margin revenue streams and investing in our future. First, we have a unique opportunity to further optimize Delta\u2019s network to capitalize on our strengths in core hubs and JV partner hubs and reflect evolving travel trends. This is the first time we\u2019ve been able to optimize since pre-pandemic, as we now have a good set of demand to optimize from. Second, growing revenue diversification through high margin sources remains an important differentiator for Delta. We have runway ahead as we continue adding more premium seats to our aircraft, further improve our retail capabilities and expand loyalty revenues and travel adjacent services. We expect American Express remuneration to grow 10% over 2023 levels. Finally, we are investing in the future to enhance the premium travel experience through our next-gen fleet, generational airport builds and digital transformation. With continued investment, Delta\u2019s brand strength and leadership position will extend in the years ahead. In closing, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the team\u2019s performance in 2023 and we\u2019re entering the new year with momentum. I am excited about Delta\u2019s opportunities to grow our lead in 2024. And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials.\nDan Janki: Thank you, Glen. And good morning to everyone. 2023 was another meaningful milestone in restoring our financial foundation. We delivered earnings of $6.25 per share and pretax income of $5.2 billion, nearly double our performance of last year. Operating margins of 11.6% was up four points from last year and expected to lead the industry. We generated operating cash flow of $7.2 billion, enabling reinvestment in our people, our fleet and technology. After gross CapEx of $5.3 billion, we generated free cash flow of $2 billion. During the year, we paid more than $4 billion of gross debt. This included accelerated repayment of $1.7 billion of higher cost debt. We ended the year with liquidity of $6.8 billion and grew our unencumbered assets to $26 billion. Our leverage ratio improved two turns to finish the year at three times. Return on invested capital improved to 13.4%, up five points over 2022. S&P upgraded our credit rating in the second half of last year. We are investment grade rated at Moody\u2019s and we are now only one notch away from investment grade with outlooks improving at both S&P and Fitch during the year. With this progress, we reinstated our dividend last summer, broadening our appeal to yield focused investors. We closed out the year strong, reporting a December quarter pretax profit of $1.1 billion, on operating margins of 9.7%, resulting in earnings of $2.28 per share. Non-fuel unit costs were up 1.1% year-over-year in line with our guidance. Now moving to our outlook, for the March quarter, we expect earnings of $0.25 to $0.50 per share on approximately 5% operating margin. We expect March quarter fuel price to be $2.50 to $2.70 per gallon, with a $0.05 to $0.10 refinery benefit. The refinery profit is expected to be down more than $130 million from last year due to elevated crack spreads in early 2023. For the full year, we expect to deliver earnings of $6 to $7 per share. With our reduced outlook for capacity growth, we expect full year non-fuel unit costs to be up low single digit over 2023, with the March quarter unit costs up approximately 3%. The last two years were a period of intense restoration with unnatural high growth to rebuild our network. Growth is normalizing and we\u2019ve entered a period of optimization with a focus on restoring our most profitable core hubs and delivering efficiency gains across the enterprise. The intensity of hiring and training has moderated and investments in reliability are beginning to pay off with continued improvement in operational performance. We expect to deliver efficiencies through the year that will help fund investments in our people, the customer experiences that Ed spoke to earlier. On maintenance we have a higher number of heavy airframe and engine checks this year resulting from the timing of new aircraft deliveries over the last decade and the reactivation of our flex fleets. At the same time, industry-wide supply chain constraints are continuing, driving higher costs and extended turnaround times. For the full year, we expect maintenance expense to be up $350 million over 2023, as we prioritize continued improvement in operational reliability and readying our fleet for the peak summer period. We expect the majority of this increase to be in the early part of the year. Unit cost growth is expected to improve for the March quarter levels as we deliver efficiency and lap investments we made in the second half of 2023. Now, onto cash flow. We expect cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow, including CapEx of $5 billion. The improvement in free cash flow is driven by growth and profitability, lower CapEx and a higher mix of cash sales. As cash sales are expected to compose a larger percentage of overall bookings as travel credit utilization normalizes. We plan to pay cash for $3 billion of 2024 debt maturities and for approximately 45 aircraft deliveries, growing our unencumbered asset base to $30 billion. We expect to reduce leverage to under three times, returning the balance sheet to investment grade metrics, while continued invest in the business remains our focus for capital allocation, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate shareholder returns with a focus on dividend growth as we reach our targeted leverage. In closing, Delta is well positioned as we enter the final year of our three-year plan to restore our financial foundation. We are continuing to prioritize the objectives we laid out at Investor Day with an emphasis on earnings durability, free cash flow and capital efficiency. Our industry-leading operational and financial performance is a result of the hard work and dedication of the Delta people. I\u2019d like to thank each of them for what they do every day. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Julie for Q&A.\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions?\nOperator: Certainly. At this time we\u2019ll be conducting the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.\nMichael Linenberg: Oh, hey, good morning, everyone. This is a question probably to both Dan and Glen. With the new A350-1000s coming in 2026, and knowing that you do have some additional Airbus widebodies delivering over the next few years, are you still going to be in a situation where maybe you have to extend your 767 fleet? I know that is to be fully retired. I think it was going to be by 2025. Will you have enough lift? And if not, are we going to see additional investments into maybe some of these older aircraft to keep them running through until you take deliveries of the bigger airplanes?\nGlen Hauenstein: As we move through 2025, 2024 through the back half of the decade, we expect to retire the 767-300s through that period of time on a pretty consistent basis as you step through while continuing to fly the 400s.\nMichael Linenberg: So you\u2019ll continue to fly the 400s beyond 2025, Dan?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes.\nDan Janki: Mike, I don\u2019t think\u2026\nGlen Hauenstein: [Indiscernible] in 2025.\nDan Janki: It was never our intent to have that fleet grounded by 2025. It was our intent to have them out of international long haul by 2028 and retired by 2030.\nGlen Hauenstein: 2030, yes.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Okay, makes sense. They\u2019re a bit younger. And then, Glen, just my second question, what was the headwind due to the cancellation of the Israel services in \u2013 the Israel services in the fourth quarter? And is that a good way to think about the March quarter impact if you don\u2019t restart those services by the 31st? Thanks.\nGlen Hauenstein: So, Mike, the initial hit was clearly the greatest because as we moved through the quarter, we redeployed the assets to other markets. So, I would say it was about a point of revenue in 4Q, and that really goes to very little impact in 1Q and beyond. And, of course, we\u2019re assessing the issues in Israel. Our current intent we have loaded for sale April, we\u2019ll see how that manifests as we move through. But our priority is always safety first, safety of our customers and our crews, and that\u2019s going to be our priority.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Your line is live.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, team. Thanks for the time. So, two questions. One for, I think, Ed, you mentioned this morning on CNBC that you were seeing improvement in corporate, especially in the tech sector. So I\u2019m kind of wondering if you or Glen can talk about what you\u2019re seeing in corporate by sector and maybe by geographic region.\nEd Bastian: Well, I\u2019ll start and Glen can add his color as well. We are seeing continued improvement in the corporate sector, and we had a number of laggards, tech being by far the largest in terms of that had essentially not returned to travel. And we\u2019re finally starting to see tech companies traveling again and again I think a lot of it is the return to office that is driving some of that. The consultancies as well, which have also been laggards again, given their clients have had their offices somewhat reduced, office hours opening is helping there, and we\u2019ve seen it across the board. The other thing I mentioned this morning also is the auto and entertainment sectors have rebounded nicely. Entertainment clearly and the auto is starting to rebound following the strikes in the fourth quarter.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then just for my follow-up question, as you think about International, I noticed that in your schedules, you\u2019re elongating the season with maybe just January and February in International being seasonally lower. Are you seeing travel move into those months as well so that you would extend or add especially to your coastal hubs, more international service going east?\nEd Bastian: Absolutely. I think we\u2019ve disclosed this previously, is that we\u2019ve seen the seasons elongate for leisure travel to Europe really March through October now is pretty strong. Of course, the shoulder is still not as strong as the peak summer. But in response to that, and again, this is part of our optimization of how we fly is tailoring our capacity to when demand actually exists.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks, team. Have a nice day.\nEd Bastian: Thank you.\nDan Janki: Thank you.\nHelane Becker: Of course.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live.\nJamie Baker: Good morning, everybody. Glen, on the pending inflection in domestic RASM, I appreciate we\u2019re seeing capacity plans tighten up across the industry. My question is whether you\u2019re seeing any revisions in how the growth year airlines are behaving outside of nearly cutting capacity. Anything else interesting we should be focused on, or is it simply a supply exercise that\u2019s driving the improvement?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I think Jamie, you\u2019ve got a couple of contributors to it. One is what Ed just mentioned, the improving conditions in the corporate environment. And it\u2019s been a slow and steady rebuild since the end of the pandemic. But we are at post-pandemic highs somewhere right around 90% restored to pre-pandemic levels as we head into this year. So that I think is an exciting backdrop for a domestic turnaround. Of course, we have some of the rationalization of capacity, but we also have continued improvements in segmentation and pricing. I can\u2019t talk to our competitors. I just know how we are working now. And 20 years ago, we were only compare \u2013 only worried about the lowest fares in the market, and now we\u2019re worried about the entire ladder and the relativity within those ladders and trying to get people to experience the higher quality products. And I think that\u2019s really led to our ability to continue to segment the customers in a more enlightened way moving forward. And that\u2019s going to be one of the key drivers as we head through this year.\nJamie Baker: Okay. I appreciate that. And then a second question for Ed, during your interview with Phil this morning, you mentioned you\u2019re still holding out hope for the $7 earnings outcome this year. If we fast forward to a year from today, give or take, and that indeed has been the outcome, what do you think the primary driver will have been? I guess the better way to ask is, do you think there\u2019s upside based on what Delta can control, or do you think it\u2019ll simply be exogenous factors like, hey, fuel cooperated, or, I don\u2019t know, maybe the consumer leaned even further into premium, that that sort of thing?\nEd Bastian: Sure. Thanks, Jamie. I get the question. I think the level of volatility that we see is what causes us to be a bit cautious and prudent in giving that $6 to $7 EPS guide in 2024. We\u2019ve been signaling that a bit for the last six months, and that\u2019s where we sit today. I have great confidence in us hitting that guide, which is what I think the Street wants to know, where our confidence level is. There are a bunch of macros that we look at into the year, which we\u2019ll have to see how they play out. Clearly, the geopolitical front continues to be quite testy, including the fact that this is a political election season, not just in the U.S., but around the world. Energy prices, we saw this morning just how volatile energy prices are. And to me, the supply chain both the cost and the constraints that we see in this industry continue unabated. We\u2019re not making nearly the progress on the supply chain improvements if anything. Every news we get seems to be a bit worse, not better. So that constrains growth and increased cost. That all said, my internal stretch for myself and our team is to still get to that $7 number this year. I think we have a possibility to get there, but I also think that the macro weighs on that assessment. And I think to be prudent, we should set expectations maybe a little bit lower and hope to overachieve just by the way we did in 2023. We gave a $5 to $6 guide and came in on the top end. And I\u2019d like to see a year from now that we\u2019re reporting that same type of result.\nJamie Baker: Glen and Ed, thank you very much for taking my questions. Take care.\nEd Bastian: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.\nConor Cunningham: Everyone, thank you. Just on the regions in general, you obviously sound more constructive domestically, but I think you mentioned that you still see a fair bit of upside in terms of international. If you could just level set on your overall like regional expectations in 2024, I think that would be helpful. Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Well, I think we\u2019re expecting domestic to continue to improve, the comps gets easier as we move through the year. So we should see some nice momentum there. We had a fantastic year in the Transatlantic. We\u2019re hoping to beat that, but there\u2019s a really high bar as we move through the year. What we have on the books today is really pretty exciting for the month of April, where we have about 40% of our Transatlantic bookings in place. We have unit revenue sitting at high-single digits up, which I think most people wouldn\u2019t expect. Of course, we have a lot of booking to go there, but the early returns for spring and summer are very favorable as we sit today. Pacific, where we have an incredible amount of capacity, it\u2019s being absorbed nicely, and we expect that to inflect into a positive territory as those growth rates come down, we move through the year. And last but not least, Latin, and our ambitious build of South America with our partners LATAM is paying very good strong dividends. We\u2019re improving our profitability, albeit, at lower unit revenue. So I think we\u2019re very excited about where South America sits. And the beaches this winter seem a little oversaturated that will rationalize itself out as we move through the year.\nConor Cunningham: Appreciate that. And then Dan, on 2024 costs, I was hoping if you could provide some thought just on the shape of the cost trajectory. It seems like a lot of it just has to do with timing of maintenance and really, really that type of stuff. So just any color, additional color there could be helpful. Thank you.\nDan Janki: Yes. As said maintenance was up $350 million for the year with a focus on the first part of the year. The other piece of it is you think about efficiencies, efficiencies just build as you progress through the year. One example is we\u2019re down on \u2013 we\u2019re fully staffed. One place we\u2019re hiring is pilots that will be down 50% \u2013 over 50% from last year, but again, front half centric with training associated with it as you get ready for the summer. And that really normalizes the historical levels in the back half of the year. So just a good steady drum beat of efficiencies as we pace through the year.\nConor Cunningham: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Stephen Trent from Citi. Your line is live.\nStephen Trent: Good morning, everybody, and thanks very much for taking my question. This might be for Ed or Glen, but you addressed it a little bit in an earlier response. But how deep do you think this supply chain stuff goes? First, we have the GTF engine, now the MAX 9 door plug. Do you think we\u2019ve kind of reached the bottom, or are you concerned there could be more to come 6 months to 12 months from now?\nEd Bastian: Thanks, Stephen. This is Ed. I hope there\u2019s no more surprises, but I\u2019d be lying to you if I thought that\u2019s the case. I mean I think we\u2019re continuing to work through the \u2013 in this post-pandemic world, the implications of the supply chain issues that we saw. And while the MAX 9 issue is a one off, separate issue, I\u2019m not referring to that. I am referring principally to the engine side of the business. And there\u2019s a lot of work on Pratt. We have a lot of reliance on Pratt. And their challenges that they\u2019re facing have been well chronicled. One of the things that we see on the engine side is as a lot of the incremental resources that our engine providers and suppliers have put their resources against it also strips away resources from maintenance work on their existing business with us. So we\u2019re working through as efficient a manner with Pratt. They were in this week and spent a lot of time with them. Roles and gee, everybody in the engine world has challenges, not just on the original build, but more importantly on the parts and the repair side of the business. And a lot of it\u2019s an experience factor level. All the suppliers in our industry lost a tremendous amount of experience due to the pandemic. And it\u2019s taking time to get that back, to get the turn times, down to where they need to be. And when you have higher turn times, that not only delays the entry into service, it also causes costs to go up.\nStephen Trent: I appreciate that, Ed. Thank you. And as my follow-up, I appreciate as well what you mentioned on the Latin market doing well. Any high level color respect to \u2013 with respect to sort of deep LATAM versus short haul LATAM. I mean I presume a lot of the uplift you\u2019re seeing is from the JBA spooling up, but just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly. Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes. I think you described it perfectly. There\u2019s a little pressure on the short haul LATAM, particularly on the resorts, where a lot of capacity was added by the industry year-over-year. But we\u2019re having really incredible performance into deep South America as we continue our coordination of launching the JV with LATAM. And we\u2019re very excited about the short-term and the long-term prospects there.\nStephen Trent: Great. I appreciate that, Glen, and thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. So Dan, as you think about what happened in 2023, as far as kind of the cost creep that led us to a little bit of a higher cost position than maybe you would have thought in the beginning of the year. Can you give us a kind of rundown around kind of what you missed in 2023? And then with that as kind of a backdrop, talk to some of the sources of risk that you might see for that most single-digit outlook for CASM, MAX in 2024.\nDan Janki: Yes, predominantly, yes, David, certainly, two drivers. First, we flew less capacity and kept the cost into invest back into the business. That was one. And the second piece was what we talked a lot in the second half of the year was the investment in maintenance and the cost associated with maintenance. And those were really, when you look at where we were, from what we got it to where we ended up just over plus two, those were the single two biggest drivers associated with that. When you think about that as we go into New Year, four here, a lot different backdrop as we\u2019re in a more normalized growth environment. When you\u2019re thinking and planning and the teams are executing the 3% to 5% growth versus 17% to 20% growth, the focus really less on this training and hiring and the restoration of the airline and our operating teams are focused on the operational performance and fine tuning that. And as you do that, that sets the stage to drive the efficiency. And things that we actions that we took in if we are paying off, if you look at the maintenance doing a lot of work and there\u2019s a lot to still go. But the fourth quarter performance aircraft out of service down 30%, maintenance cancels down over 80%. So that those actions that they\u2019re taking around, proactive reliability, getting the touch time on the aircraft, paying dividends, but that\u2019s really what allows us when you\u2019re in that normalized environment, you can really stay after that consistently day in and day out. That sets the stage for the execution around efficiency.\nEd Bastian: David, if I could jump in here, it\u2019s hard to overstate just how hard it was to bring the full business back up again over the last 2.5 years. And the intensity of that has been phenomenal. And our team\u2019s done a great job, but it\u2019s taken every fiber of our being and hiring and resource we have to try to get ahead of it. We\u2019re there now. Okay. And you see the results in the fourth quarter, they were remarkable. The best fourth quarter operational results I think this company has ever posted. And that is, I think, the big opportunity as we enter the year. I don\u2019t know that we know yet just how much we have available to us as we start to return to a normalized environment and start tweaking those efficiencies. I think it\u2019s going to be significant. And it\u2019s kind of hard to forecast, because this team has been for the last two plus years in a very different part of the build, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to see some great opportunities. And that\u2019s to Jamie\u2019s earlier question, some of my internal expectations of hoping that we can get through that $7 above EPS number. I\u2019m willing to put that number on paper quite yet, but I think the opportunity is there.\nDavid Vernon: Thanks for that added color. Just to maybe kind of follow-up on that point a little bit, as you think about the optimization efficiency gains that are ahead of you. I appreciate that it\u2019s hard to quantify it all, but can you give us a sense for what the driver of some of these things are kind of big picture wise? Is it about utilization of aircraft? Is it about getting the staffing optimized? Or is it more about just working some of the friction costs in the business out and sort of continuously improving, chasing down a bunch of little dogs and cats across the business? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for kind of what are we looking at here? Are we looking at a large set of projects or are there one or two things that are going to be super pivotal around the optimization side of this?\nEd Bastian: David, I think it\u2019s all the above. And it\u2019s not just what you mentioned on the cost side, it\u2019s also on the revenue side. Consumer behaviors have changed a lot. And to this point, we\u2019ve been using somewhat older models to predict behavioral patterns. And we now have actually a good baseline over the last year and a half of what \u2013 how consumers are purchasing, what they\u2019re purchasing, when they want to travel, which Glen and his team will use to drive better network and revenue outcomes for our business. It\u2019s in the cost line. The fact that we have 10% more employees today than we had at this point, pre-pandemic, essentially driving the same level of operations, tremendous amount of opportunity to get efficient. But when the operators know what they can count on and they\u2019ve got their arms around the full operation, I think you\u2019re going to see the cash register start to ring with cost and savings efficiency. So I know it\u2019s a bet on the come a little bit, but I\u2019m optimistic we\u2019ll get there. But it\u2019s really hard to quantify at the same time.\nDavid Vernon: Excellent. Thanks a lot for the added color.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning and happy New Year, everyone. I know your commentary on demand sounds pretty good, but can you unpack a little bit more detail on what you\u2019re seeing in the forward booking curve through spring break and maybe even the activity through the Paris Olympics over the summer? What kind of forward indicator do you have that people might be traveling more?\nEd Bastian: Well, I think I mentioned it as a response to one of the other questions, but we have pretty good visibility on the early bookings for the summer Transatlantic season, and we have a higher booked load factor as well as higher yield. So those are the two things you watch for and both are indicating quite positive for the Transatlantic. The U.S. has, of course, a closer in booking curve, but as far as we can see out through a spring break, things look great for the U.S. And as I mentioned earlier, some of the close in beach resorts have a little bit too much industry capacity this year. That\u2019ll probably get rationalized out over time, but still will be very profitable as we move through the peak winter season. And then as Pacific rush, as we continue to lap the buildup of our Pacific as we move through the year, we expect those unit revenues to accelerate demand, particularly strong to the [indiscernible] as well as to Japan in the spring season. So very exciting. As we look forward, I hope we can outdo our plan.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. And apologies if I missed this earlier, but do you \u2013 I mean, some of your peers are having issues with the potential extended grounding of some aircraft for inspections. Do you see any kind of spillover benefit for that in the short-term? And kind of \u2013 is any of that in your 1Q guidance?\nEd Bastian: Yes. We\u2019ve seen minimal improvements and what we have seen is mostly in Seattle, where they\u2019ve had to cancel a significant portion of their schedule out of Seattle, but we\u2019ll see how long that stays out. But right now, I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s a significant number in the grander scheme of things. It\u2019s significant for Seattle, but not significant for our whole network.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, good morning. Maybe just on the cadence of the non-op savings and the component drivers of that. Is it spread pretty evenly throughout the year or is it more kind of second half weighted?\nDan Janki: Yes. The driver is $75 million to $100 million, really driven by interest expense. And as we\u2019ve accelerated the debt reduction action that drives the benefit, we expect pension to be flat on a year-over-year basis. The team did a great job. The pension delivered at or slightly above its targeted return, so no headwind associated with that. You get some \u2013 a little bit around some of the equity earnings of our partners, but we expect to be pretty consistent throughout the year due to the interest reduction and savings coming through as you progress through the year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And then just a follow-up for Glen. You\u2019ve done a nice job taking some active steps to \u2013 on the capacity sequentially 4Q to 1Q. But could you just speak to seasonality and maybe by entity? Where is seasonality a lot different than it used to be? Where is it kind of normalized? So any sort of key trends you\u2019d highlight in change in the underlying seasonal patterns here into the first quarter?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes. I think we\u2019re at our new norm, and our new norm is different than 2019,but what I see mainly is an extension of the international seasons. So we mentioned that in an earlier question that it used to be the summer peak was just June, July, August, and now I think we\u2019re moving into April through March. All the way through October is a very strong season, particularly for southern Europe. Northern Europe starts a little bit later. And then the other thing I just mentioned, I mentioned in an earlier call as well, is that the beach Mexican and the Caribbean beaches just seem to have a little bit too much capacity this year, and we\u2019ll work through that as we go through the year. But if you look, those are up 20%, 30% across the board and having a little trouble keeping up with that \u2013 the demand keeping up with that kind of capacity increase. And I imagine, it is \u2013 people plan next year that they\u2019ll trim on the margin those back down again or let that demand catch up. So generally, I think we\u2019re in a good spot here with supply and demand as far as the I can see, we\u2019re positive in all the future months and almost all the future \u2013 in almost every entity with the exception of lab.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. I guess, Ed or Dan, I mean, looking back from your prior 2021 targets, you guys are guiding at the top end here to effectively reach that. And I think not a lot of people gave you credit. So that\u2019s the context of my question. But that said, valuation in your stock is still pretty low. I think investors are just concerned that we\u2019ve seen peak airline profitability, and your guidance would effectively say about flat profitability this year in 2024 versus 2023. So maybe coming back to some of these prior questions, what is in your control that can get profitability higher? Maybe looking beyond this year, that can give investors comfort that this business should be earning mid-teens.\nEd Bastian: Thanks, Brandon. And you\u2019re right. When you think about when we set that target, it was in December of 2021. I\u2019ll never forget we were at the exchange. I believe you were there, and Omicron was just being announced as the newest variant. So the level of knowledge that we had to the future and where this thing was going, it was candidly, kind of maybe a bit crazy for us to put out a three year plan. But I thought it was really important and instructive for us as well as our investors to let them see how we\u2019re thinking about the progress. And the great news is, through the first two years, we are at, if not ahead of plan along the headway. And I think if I was to go back and say what has changed, that maybe has given me a little bit of pause for seven, not longer term, but just in the short-term, I think it\u2019s the higher cost of labor certainly was not known back then. The higher inflation rates were not known back then. And most importantly, the supply chain constraints, the full extent, were not clearly not known, have no knowledge of the challenges we face. So when you think about all the macros we encountered, I think we\u2019ve done a very good job of controlling those things that we can control. And as you\u2019ve heard from several of the questions, I still internally am targeting us to get to that $7 number this year. And I think we can, I really do. But I think it\u2019s also prudent that we give a nod to some of those macros that we\u2019re facing. I think the optimization opportunities, as I mentioned, are significant, and they run across every single part of this business. And all of our leaders are working hard to ensure that we\u2019re delivering an excellent quality product which unleashes that optimization benefits. I think the work that we\u2019re doing on the balance sheet with all the debt reduction is derisking and taking that down is important. We\u2019re on track with our free cash flow guidance, $3 billion to $4 billion this year, and we\u2019re still looking at a $10 billion target between 2023 and 2025 for free cash. So I think you\u2019re right, there\u2019s a lot of noise that, \u201cwe were lower inguidance\u201d. I don\u2019t really look at it that way. I just think it\u2019s giving nod to some of the macro realities and wanted to give you a prudent estimate to what we are confident we can deliver this year with a nod towards there\u2019s some real upside here.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you for that, Ed. And then, Dan, the maintenance issues have been present now for probably over a year, if not longer, I guess, what are you doing longer term planning to maybe mitigate that? And is there any favorable offset longer term here in your MRO business? Thank you.\nDan Janki: The \u2013 one is, we continue as we get into a period here where we\u2019re more normalized in growth. It\u2019s allowing us to extend our planning horizon, where we\u2019re able to look out on a rolling not only 12, but 18, 24, 36 months. And I think the more visibility and stability that we get from that allows us to better plan as it relates back into how we run our fleet and how we balance that capacity with cost. And I think that will continue to give us more certainty around that. The other piece is just the heavy lift that our entire tech ops team has in working closely with the supply chain, and with all our partners across that getting clarity in regards to the things that they need to do and we can do on their behalf as it relates to Delta, in regards to continuing to improve the execution of that over time. And we\u2019ve got to work closely with those partners to continue to improve that. And then to the last piece on MRO, yes, there will be an opportunity to continue to grow. I think as we\u2019ve talked about before, we\u2019re well positioned on all these platforms. The focus has been, and we\u2019ll be right here making sure that we\u2019ve got strong foundation on Delta and Delta\u2019s fleet. But we also do have an eye to continue to grow the MRO business, and you\u2019ll start to see that. Start this year but really in earnest in the years two and three years out.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So, question for Glen. I think you started ramping up your core hub growth in the middle of 2023. Is there any way you can quantify what the benefits of this build out were to your revenue performance over the back half? And what share of your capacity growth this year will be growth in these hubs?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think we just alluded to a majority of our growth will be in our core hubs or to partner hubs. So probably 75% to 80% of our growth will be in those locations. We feel that we accelerated the coastal gateway growth earlier in the process with our once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to become the leading carriers in markets like Los Angeles and Boston. And those are paying huge dividends for us as we head into 2024, with Boston, for example, leading the unit revenue ascension for this quarter. So we\u2019re really, really pleased with the way it shaked out. And we still have some more rebuild to do in our core hubs. It\u2019ll probably take us through this year and into next year given the lower growth rates that we have, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on for the next 18 to 24 months.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just Dan, in the $3 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow, are you assuming any sort of cash taxes this year or when do you expect to become a cash taxpayer? I thought it was a number of years out, but just curious if there\u2019s any update there? Thank you.\nDan Janki: No. We don\u2019t expect cash taxes this year and would expect that potentially cash tax payments starting in 2025 and beyond.\nAndrew Didora: Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: Matthew, we\u2019ll now go to our final analyst question before then going over to the media.\nOperator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe a quick one for me; just, you talked about pilot hiring being down 50% year-over-year, and you\u2019ve heard similar comments from the industry. Just curious what that means for your kind of regional operation? And if there was much of a drag in 2023, either to cost or to revenue from that operation and what you can expect this year and next year?\nEd Bastian: So thanks for that question, and I think that plays well into some of the other themes that we\u2019ve talked about. Or what are the potential upsides to our plan that could get you towards the $7. We have planned for stability in the regionals after 2.5 years of really instability, where we didn\u2019t know how many hours we had really three to four months ahead of time. And what we\u2019ve seen is that there is a lot more stability. What we haven\u2019t accounted for is the full utilization of our fleet. So we still have 50 to 100 airplanes and less of utilization than we have on the ground in our fleet. So should that lower hiring at the main line translate into more availability in the back half of the year? That would be potential upside to our P&L.\nSavi Syth: Perfect. All right. Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: All right. That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions.\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if we could reiterate for the members of the media the instructions with regard to accessing the call and follow ups, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Ted Reed from Forbes. Your line is live.\nTed Reed: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. It\u2019s for Glen. I just wondered if the Delta passenger in 2024 looks different than the passenger in 2023. And I\u2019m also asking whether the age of revenge travel is over and are we past revenge travel? Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I mean, this is all an opinion, right, as that, revenge travel, I think has years to go, particularly in long haul international. When you look at the aging of the demographics that people in their retirement years want to travel, and they were robbed of the ability to travel for three years, and we weren\u2019t able to accommodate last year. I think as we continued accommodation of that for the next several years until that revenge travel catch up. I think domestically we\u2019ve done that. Revenge travel was early in the process, and we\u2019re kind of at our new equilibrium, and that gives us the opportunity to optimize as we move forward. And do they look different? They always look different.\nTed Reed: As for destinations are we more in unique \u2013 is it more unique transatlantic that they\u2019re looking at or more the traditional transatlantic or something else?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think it\u2019s more the traditional Italy, Spain; those are two of the Italy, Spain, Greece are such hot spots. Portugal is a hot spot, and I think during the peak summer we\u2019re really excited about the prospect of bringing SAS along with us and now having hubs in Copenhagen and Stockholm that will allow us to have even more destinations in Europe than we serve today.\nTed Reed: All right. Thank you, Glen.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kelly Yamanouchi from Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Your line is live.\nKelly Yamanouchi: Thanks. Ed, you mentioned having 10% more employees today than pre-pandemic and essentially driving the same level of operations and the opportunity to get efficient. I was wondering if that means growing operations with the same number of employees or potentially cutting the staffing level.\nEd Bastian: Hi, Kelly. No there\u2019s no plans just to cut staffing levels at all. This is about our people being able to garner more experience because a lot of the new employees that we\u2019ve added over the last few years are adding to that 10% and continuing to be a bit more efficient in productivity and the staffing levels. But no, we have no intention to make any reductions in people.\nKelly Yamanouchi: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, good morning, everyone. Wondering if you are seeing any increased bookings since United and Alaska have had to ground their Max 9s? And then separately maybe this is a question more for Glen, but do you think you\u2019re done with the measures that you had to take last year in terms of the SkyMiles program and lounges to sort of combat crowding, since this year is going to be so busy, and if you have enough premium seats to offer the market currently?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I\u2019ll take the second question first, is, we made some serious changes to our programs that were designed to really put the right people in the right categories so that we could deliver industry leading premium experiences. And as you know, while they were announced in the fall, most of them don\u2019t take into effect until 2025. And I think what we\u2019ve estimated is that should \u2013 we should be done without those kinds of major changes to our programs. Of course, those programs are always changing, but I think the changes moving forward will be much more minimal. So I think that\u2019s behind us. We\u2019ll see how that plays out by the end of this year and into 2025. And your other question was on the Max...\nLeslie Josephs: On booking. Oh yeah, since the grounding.\nGlen Hauenstein: We\u2019ve seen a small uptick specifically in Seattle, but Seattle is a small portion of our entire system. So it\u2019s kind of minimal in the grander scheme of things, but it\u2019s relevant in Seattle.\nLeslie Josephs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live.\nMary Schlangenstein: Yeah, my question was asked. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live.\nAlison Sider: Thank you. I was wondering, do you still think Delta still has the same advantage over rivals just in terms of reliability in its operation? Is that something that you\u2019re kind of working on?\nEd Bastian: Hi, Allie, this is Ed. The one thing that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years which has been great for customers is that the overall reliability in the industry has improved and carriers increasingly are competing over operational performance rather than some other things in the past that people may have been focused against. And I think that\u2019s great and I think it pushes us to be even better, and I think it\u2019s a great outcome for the industry as a whole. So, yes, the competition is definitely more focused on reliability than ever before. And I still expect Delta to maintain its premium lead in that sector.\nAlison Sider: And then if I could ask about sort of labor shortages, are you concerned at all or starting to feel the impact of a shortage of maintenance workers? Is that something you expect to come to the head this year?\nEd Bastian: We are not experiencing any issues around labor shortages. Maybe in very small isolated places we still have some additional people we\u2019d like to bring in, but we are at where we need to be. And for us it\u2019s less about the shortages, it\u2019s more about the new people that we brought on continuing to gain experience, and that\u2019s a big deal, particularly in the maintenance area.\nAlison Sider: Thanks.\nEd Bastian: Thank you, Ali. Matthew, we have time for one final question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Your last question is coming from Robert Silk from Travel Weekly. Your line is live.\nRobert Silk: Oh yeah. Good morning. Glen, you mentioned that you all had gained corporate share this year. I\u2019m wondering if you could elaborate on what caused that. You think how you gained it and there was any impact. Some of it might have come from the removing of bears from the traditional GDS channels by your main competitors?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think one of the issues were we were very inventory constrained in 2022 as we were behind the industry in our rebuild? And in 2023 we caught up back to basically a pre-pandemic level of capacity and those additional seats were enabled more corporates to get on the aircraft. I\u2019d say what\u2019s different about now versus pre-pandemic is that before the pandemic and before the segmentation of customers, the differential between the yields on corporate and the yields on non-corporate high end leisure was significant. And these days those have closed, so now you have competition for the premium seats between those two categories that didn\u2019t exist pre-pandemic. And that\u2019s exciting for us as we manage them. But I think getting more seats available is one of the key priorities in the premium sector so that we can accommodate all the demand.\nRobert Silk: Okay. Thanks. And what about seeing any sort of share shift based upon your strategy of leaving all your fares available in the traditional EDIFACT GDS?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. Clearly we think that our strategy is more customer friendly, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s part of it, but we don\u2019t want to buy it.\nRobert Silk: Okay. Thank you.\nTim Mapes: Matthew that will wrap up the call. If you want to close it up.\nOperator: Certainly, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported our full year and December quarter results, posting fourth quarter earnings of $1.1 billion, or $1.28 per share, on record quarterly revenue that was 11% higher than 2022 and an operating margin of 10%. I want to sincerely thank the 100,000 strong Delta team for their outstanding work in delivering these results and serving our customers. Delta carried more travelers this holiday season than any other time in our history, and we delivered industry-leading operational performance with the number one system completion factor amongst our peer set throughout the December quarter. To put that in context, we carried 9 million customers, a record 9 million customers, I'd add, on 60,000 mainline flights over the holiday period, with fewer than 40 cancellations in aggregate. Our December quarter results marked a strong close to year two of our three-year plan. For the full year, we reported earnings of $6.25 per share, the second highest EPS result in our history on revenue that was 20% higher than the prior year. We delivered an 11.6% operating margin and pre-tax income of $5.2 billion, a near doubling over 2022. We generate free cash flow of $2 billion while investing $5.3 billion back into the business, and we improved our leverage by two full turns and reinstated our quarterly dividend. Return on invested capital was 13.4%, a five-point improvement from 2022, a tremendous amount of progress, especially if you consider where we sat the short three years ago, and I'm so proud of our team across the board. Sharing our financial success is a long-standing pillar of Delta's culture, and I'm thrilled to announce that we'll be rewarding our employees with $1.4 billion in well-earned profit sharing on Valentine's Day. For our employees, the estimated payout will be approximately 10% of eligible 2023 compensation, about double of what last year's payment was. I expect our profit sharing payments will be more than our three largest competitors combined.  Our people consistently deliver operational excellence with a relentless focus on raising the bar at every stage of the travel journey to deliver safe, reliable, and caring service for our customers. They are the reason our brand and our customer loyalty lead the industry, why Delta was recognized as the world's 12th most admired company by Fortune, and why Glassdoor named us yesterday as the 13th best employer in the country. In 2023, we made meaningful investments in our people, our operation, and our customers. We provided well-deserved pay increases for the Delta team, continuing our philosophy of industry-leading pay for industry-leading performance. In the operation, the investments that we made supported the best-in-class operational performance that Delta has long been known for. Our operational excellence was recognized by Cirium last week, which named us, yet again, the most on-time airline in North America. Our people and our operational reliability are the foundation of Delta's trusted consumer brand, and we are building on that foundation as we elevate the premium flying experience and grow our SkyMiles members' engagement with Delta. Today, we also announced an order for 20 Airbus 350-1000 aircraft, with options for 20 more, for delivery starting in 2026. These planes complement our fleet strategy and will offer a world-class customer experience for international travelers with more premium seats, higher gauge, and great customer amenities. These aircraft are over 20% more fuel-efficient than the 767s that they'll be replacing, further supporting our long-term sustainability goals. And with the successful launch of fast, free Wi-Fi and Delta Sync, we are enhancing the in-flight entertainment experience for SkyMiles members. We expect to have these products rolled out globally by the end of this year. On the ground, we are building the airports of the future in some of the most important markets and adding new Delta Sky Clubs to provide our customers a world-class airport experience. We completed our transformation at Los Angeles 18 months ahead of schedule, including a state-of-the-art facility and a new Delta Sky Club that was named North America's Best Airline Lounge for 2023 by Business Traveler. We opened the latest phase of our Salt Lake City expansion, and we'll complete the generational rebuild of LaGuardia this year. Our digital investments continue as we work to increase our agility and provide employees with better tools and customers with a more seamless experience. Customers visited the Fly Delta app over 1 billion times last year, using our self-service tools almost 10x more often than 2019, with much higher overall satisfaction. As 2024 begins, our enterprise has moved from a period of restoration to optimization. We are focused on delivering excellent reliability, elevating the customer experience, and improving efficiency across the company to support continued growth in our earnings and our cash flow. We expect demand to remain strong, particularly for the premium experiences that Delta provides. Consumer spend is continuing to shift from goods to services, and our customer base is in a healthy financial position with travel remaining a top priority. And corporate travel continues to improve with demand accelerating into year-end. On supply, industry growth is normalizing after several years of network restoration. For 2024, we plan to grow Delta's capacity 3% to 5% below the mid-single-digit range that we discussed at our June Investor Day as we've refined our plan. Domestically, supply and demand are coming into better balance as the industry adjusts to rising costs of production, and we are seeing a positive inflection in domestic unit revenue growth. Internationally, we expect another strong year as we optimize our network and leverage our global JV partners. With that backdrop, we are providing full-year 2024 guidance for earnings of $6 to $7 per share and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. Free cash guidance is up to $2 billion higher than 2023, driven by growth and profitability, lower CapEx, and an improved mix of cash sales. As we continue to grow earnings and reduce debt, we will further reduce leverage and advance our balance sheet towards investment grade metrics. Glen and Dan will provide more details shortly, including our outlook for the March quarter.  In closing, the people of Delta delivered a remarkable 2023, leading the industry operationally and financially while providing a world-class experience for our customers. Delta is well-positioned to build on our momentum in the new year with continued growth in earnings and cash flow in 2024. I could not be more excited about what's ahead for Delta and our customers, and I am confident that our returns-focused strategy will drive significant value creation for our owners in the years to come. Thank you again for the support you show to our company, and with that, I'll turn it over to Glen. Well, I'll start and Glen can add his color as well. We are seeing continued improvement in the corporate sector, and we had a number of laggards, tech being by far the largest in terms of that had essentially not returned to travel. And we're finally starting to see tech companies traveling again and again I think a lot of it is the return to office that is driving some of that. The consultancies as well, which have also been laggards again, given their clients have had their offices somewhat reduced, office hours opening is helping there, and we've seen it across the board. The other thing I mentioned this morning also is the auto and entertainment sectors have rebounded nicely. Entertainment clearly and the auto is starting to rebound following the strikes in the fourth quarter. Absolutely. I think we've disclosed this previously, is that we've seen the seasons elongate for leisure travel to Europe really March through October now is pretty strong. Of course, the shoulder is still not as strong as the peak summer. But in response to that, and again, this is part of our optimization of how we fly is tailoring our capacity to when demand actually exists. Thank you. Sure. Thanks, Jamie. I get the question. I think the level of volatility that we see is what causes us to be a bit cautious and prudent in giving that $6 to $7 EPS guide in 2024. We've been signaling that a bit for the last six months, and that's where we sit today. I have great confidence in us hitting that guide, which is what I think the Street wants to know, where our confidence level is. There are a bunch of macros that we look at into the year, which we'll have to see how they play out. Clearly, the geopolitical front continues to be quite testy, including the fact that this is a political election season, not just in the U.S., but around the world. Energy prices, we saw this morning just how volatile energy prices are. And to me, the supply chain both the cost and the constraints that we see in this industry continue unabated. We're not making nearly the progress on the supply chain improvements if anything. Every news we get seems to be a bit worse, not better. So that constrains growth and increased cost. That all said, my internal stretch for myself and our team is to still get to that $7 number this year. I think we have a possibility to get there, but I also think that the macro weighs on that assessment. And I think to be prudent, we should set expectations maybe a little bit lower and hope to overachieve just by the way we did in 2023. We gave a $5 to $6 guide and came in on the top end. And I'd like to see a year from now that we're reporting that same type of result. Okay. Thank you. Well, I think we're expecting domestic to continue to improve, the comps gets easier as we move through the year. So we should see some nice momentum there. We had a fantastic year in the Transatlantic. We're hoping to beat that, but there's a really high bar as we move through the year. What we have on the books today is really pretty exciting for the month of April, where we have about 40% of our Transatlantic bookings in place. We have unit revenue sitting at high-single digits up, which I think most people wouldn't expect. Of course, we have a lot of booking to go there, but the early returns for spring and summer are very favorable as we sit today. Pacific, where we have an incredible amount of capacity, it's being absorbed nicely, and we expect that to inflect into a positive territory as those growth rates come down, we move through the year. And last but not least, Latin, and our ambitious build of South America with our partners LATAM is paying very good strong dividends. We're improving our profitability, albeit, at lower unit revenue. So I think we're very excited about where South America sits. And the beaches this winter seem a little oversaturated that will rationalize itself out as we move through the year. Thanks, Stephen. This is Ed. I hope there's no more surprises, but I'd be lying to you if I thought that's the case. I mean I think we're continuing to work through the \u2013 in this post-pandemic world, the implications of the supply chain issues that we saw. And while the MAX 9 issue is a one off, separate issue, I'm not referring to that. I am referring principally to the engine side of the business. And there's a lot of work on Pratt. We have a lot of reliance on Pratt. And their challenges that they're facing have been well chronicled. One of the things that we see on the engine side is as a lot of the incremental resources that our engine providers and suppliers have put their resources against it also strips away resources from maintenance work on their existing business with us. So we're working through as efficient a manner with Pratt. They were in this week and spent a lot of time with them. Roles and gee, everybody in the engine world has challenges, not just on the original build, but more importantly on the parts and the repair side of the business. And a lot of it's an experience factor level. All the suppliers in our industry lost a tremendous amount of experience due to the pandemic. And it's taking time to get that back, to get the turn times, down to where they need to be. And when you have higher turn times, that not only delays the entry into service, it also causes costs to go up. David, if I could jump in here, it's hard to overstate just how hard it was to bring the full business back up again over the last 2.5 years. And the intensity of that has been phenomenal. And our team's done a great job, but it's taken every fiber of our being and hiring and resource we have to try to get ahead of it. We're there now. Okay. And you see the results in the fourth quarter, they were remarkable. The best fourth quarter operational results I think this company has ever posted. And that is, I think, the big opportunity as we enter the year. I don't know that we know yet just how much we have available to us as we start to return to a normalized environment and start tweaking those efficiencies. I think it's going to be significant. And it's kind of hard to forecast, because this team has been for the last two plus years in a very different part of the build, but I'm confident we're going to see some great opportunities. And that's to Jamie's earlier question, some of my internal expectations of hoping that we can get through that $7 above EPS number. I'm willing to put that number on paper quite yet, but I think the opportunity is there. David, I think it's all the above. And it's not just what you mentioned on the cost side, it's also on the revenue side. Consumer behaviors have changed a lot. And to this point, we've been using somewhat older models to predict behavioral patterns. And we now have actually a good baseline over the last year and a half of what \u2013 how consumers are purchasing, what they're purchasing, when they want to travel, which Glen and his team will use to drive better network and revenue outcomes for our business. It's in the cost line. The fact that we have 10% more employees today than we had at this point, pre-pandemic, essentially driving the same level of operations, tremendous amount of opportunity to get efficient. But when the operators know what they can count on and they've got their arms around the full operation, I think you're going to see the cash register start to ring with cost and savings efficiency. So I know it's a bet on the come a little bit, but I'm optimistic we'll get there. But it's really hard to quantify at the same time. Well, I think I mentioned it as a response to one of the other questions, but we have pretty good visibility on the early bookings for the summer Transatlantic season, and we have a higher booked load factor as well as higher yield. So those are the two things you watch for and both are indicating quite positive for the Transatlantic. The U.S. has, of course, a closer in booking curve, but as far as we can see out through a spring break, things look great for the U.S. And as I mentioned earlier, some of the close in beach resorts have a little bit too much industry capacity this year. That'll probably get rationalized out over time, but still will be very profitable as we move through the peak winter season. And then as Pacific rush, as we continue to lap the buildup of our Pacific as we move through the year, we expect those unit revenues to accelerate demand, particularly strong to the [indiscernible] as well as to Japan in the spring season. So very exciting. As we look forward, I hope we can outdo our plan. Yes. We've seen minimal improvements and what we have seen is mostly in Seattle, where they've had to cancel a significant portion of their schedule out of Seattle, but we'll see how long that stays out. But right now, I wouldn't say, it's a significant number in the grander scheme of things. It's significant for Seattle, but not significant for our whole network. Thanks, Brandon. And you're right. When you think about when we set that target, it was in December of 2021. I'll never forget we were at the exchange. I believe you were there, and Omicron was just being announced as the newest variant. So the level of knowledge that we had to the future and where this thing was going, it was candidly, kind of maybe a bit crazy for us to put out a three year plan. But I thought it was really important and instructive for us as well as our investors to let them see how we're thinking about the progress. And the great news is, through the first two years, we are at, if not ahead of plan along the headway. And I think if I was to go back and say what has changed, that maybe has given me a little bit of pause for seven, not longer term, but just in the short-term, I think it's the higher cost of labor certainly was not known back then. The higher inflation rates were not known back then. And most importantly, the supply chain constraints, the full extent, were not clearly not known, have no knowledge of the challenges we face. So when you think about all the macros we encountered, I think we've done a very good job of controlling those things that we can control. And as you've heard from several of the questions, I still internally am targeting us to get to that $7 number this year. And I think we can, I really do. But I think it's also prudent that we give a nod to some of those macros that we're facing. I think the optimization opportunities, as I mentioned, are significant, and they run across every single part of this business. And all of our leaders are working hard to ensure that we're delivering an excellent quality product which unleashes that optimization benefits. I think the work that we're doing on the balance sheet with all the debt reduction is derisking and taking that down is important. We're on track with our free cash flow guidance, $3 billion to $4 billion this year, and we're still looking at a $10 billion target between 2023 and 2025 for free cash. So I think you're right, there's a lot of noise that, \u201cwe were lower inguidance\u201d. I don't really look at it that way. I just think it's giving nod to some of the macro realities and wanted to give you a prudent estimate to what we are confident we can deliver this year with a nod towards there's some real upside here. So thanks for that question, and I think that plays well into some of the other themes that we've talked about. Or what are the potential upsides to our plan that could get you towards the $7. We have planned for stability in the regionals after 2.5 years of really instability, where we didn't know how many hours we had really three to four months ahead of time. And what we've seen is that there is a lot more stability. What we haven't accounted for is the full utilization of our fleet. So we still have 50 to 100 airplanes and less of utilization than we have on the ground in our fleet. So should that lower hiring at the main line translate into more availability in the back half of the year? That would be potential upside to our P&L. Hi, Kelly. No there's no plans just to cut staffing levels at all. This is about our people being able to garner more experience because a lot of the new employees that we've added over the last few years are adding to that 10% and continuing to be a bit more efficient in productivity and the staffing levels. But no, we have no intention to make any reductions in people. Hi, Allie, this is Ed. The one thing that we've seen over the last couple of years which has been great for customers is that the overall reliability in the industry has improved and carriers increasingly are competing over operational performance rather than some other things in the past that people may have been focused against. And I think that's great and I think it pushes us to be even better, and I think it's a great outcome for the industry as a whole. So, yes, the competition is definitely more focused on reliability than ever before. And I still expect Delta to maintain its premium lead in that sector. We are not experiencing any issues around labor shortages. Maybe in very small isolated places we still have some additional people we'd like to bring in, but we are at where we need to be. And for us it's less about the shortages, it's more about the new people that we brought on continuing to gain experience, and that's a big deal, particularly in the maintenance area. Thank you, Ali. Matthew, we have time for one final question, please."

            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and dedication this year. For the full year, we delivered record revenues of $55 billion, about 20% higher than pre-pandemic. Strong execution on our commercial strategy resulted in significant outperformance against the industry with international delivering record margins and profits. We finished the year with unit revenues 3% higher than 2022, also about 20% above pre-pandemic levels. Diversified revenue streams, including premium and loyalty, generated 55% of revenue, reflecting Delta's differentiated strategy. Premium led all year with record paid load factors and yield growth outpacing Main Cabin. The rollout of Delta Premium Select on long-haul international is nearly complete and the revenue generation has been above our expectations. As we continue to increase our premium seat mix and segment the cabin through our five product strategy, we have structurally improved the international margins. Our loyalty program continued to exceed our expectations with record SkyMiles acquisitions in 2023. Total loyalty revenue was up 19% over the prior year with 15% growth in co-brand spend and increasing mix of premium cards in our Amex co-brand portfolio. In recognition of our commitment to the Business Traveler, Delta was named number one in Business Travel News Airline survey for an unprecedented 13th consecutive year. Delta gained corporate share during the year and successfully launched SkyMiles for business, providing small to medium sized companies new benefits to support further growth in the important SME segment. Corporate sales accelerated into year end, including double-digit year-over-year growth in the month of December. Technology and Financial Services led this momentum for the December quarter with Media and Auto sectors seeing notable traction following the strike resolutions. December quarter revenue was a record $13.7 billion, 11% higher than 2022. While unit revenues were 3% lower than last year, we are entering the year with momentum in our highest and had experienced our highest cash sales day in history this week. We expect March quarter revenue growth of 3% to 6% over 2023 on capacity growth of 6%, which includes one point from leap day, implying unit revenues will be flat to down 3% over last year. This is a two point sequential improvement on a year-over-year basis from the December quarter. Our March quarter faces headwinds from three dynamics when compared to last year. These include higher international mix, the normalization of travel credit utilization and lapping a competitor's operational challenges. Looking through these headwinds, the core fundamentals of the business are improving faster than the headline numbers suggest. With encouraging developments in the domestic environment, we expect domestic unit revenues to inflect to positive in the March quarter. The Transatlantic, our largest international entity, continues to perform well with strong demand through the shoulder period, and we expect unit revenues to grow in the March quarter. In Latin and Pacific, we are rebuilding our networks and improving connectivity with our JV partners, accounting for the majority of capacity growth in the March quarter. These investments are supporting higher short-term profitability, but with lower unit revenues. Turning to our outlook for the full year, premium consumer trends remain strong, and spending on travel experiences continues to outpace overall GDP by 2 to 3 points. We expect solid growth in business demand with nearly 95% of respondents in our recent corporate survey expecting to travel as much or more in 1Q than 4Q. This is a double digit improvement in travel intentions from our last survey. Our commercial strategy in 2024 builds on Delta's competitive advantages by optimizing our network, growing high margin revenue streams and investing in our future. First, we have a unique opportunity to further optimize Delta's network to capitalize on our strengths in core hubs and JV partner hubs and reflect evolving travel trends. This is the first time we've been able to optimize since pre-pandemic, as we now have a good set of demand to optimize from. Second, growing revenue diversification through high margin sources remains an important differentiator for Delta. We have runway ahead as we continue adding more premium seats to our aircraft, further improve our retail capabilities and expand loyalty revenues and travel adjacent services. We expect American Express remuneration to grow 10% over 2023 levels. Finally, we are investing in the future to enhance the premium travel experience through our next-gen fleet, generational airport builds and digital transformation. With continued investment, Delta's brand strength and leadership position will extend in the years ahead. In closing, I'm incredibly proud of the team's performance in 2023 and we're entering the new year with momentum. I am excited about Delta's opportunities to grow our lead in 2024. And with that I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. As we move through 2025, 2024 through the back half of the decade, we expect to retire the 767-300s through that period of time on a pretty consistent basis as you step through while continuing to fly the 400s. Yes. [Indiscernible] in 2025. 2030, yes. So, Mike, the initial hit was clearly the greatest because as we moved through the quarter, we redeployed the assets to other markets. So, I would say it was about a point of revenue in 4Q, and that really goes to very little impact in 1Q and beyond. And, of course, we're assessing the issues in Israel. Our current intent we have loaded for sale April, we'll see how that manifests as we move through. But our priority is always safety first, safety of our customers and our crews, and that's going to be our priority. Well, I think Jamie, you've got a couple of contributors to it. One is what Ed just mentioned, the improving conditions in the corporate environment. And it's been a slow and steady rebuild since the end of the pandemic. But we are at post-pandemic highs somewhere right around 90% restored to pre-pandemic levels as we head into this year. So that I think is an exciting backdrop for a domestic turnaround. Of course, we have some of the rationalization of capacity, but we also have continued improvements in segmentation and pricing. I can't talk to our competitors. I just know how we are working now. And 20 years ago, we were only compare \u2013 only worried about the lowest fares in the market, and now we're worried about the entire ladder and the relativity within those ladders and trying to get people to experience the higher quality products. And I think that's really led to our ability to continue to segment the customers in a more enlightened way moving forward. And that's going to be one of the key drivers as we head through this year. Yes. I think you described it perfectly. There's a little pressure on the short haul LATAM, particularly on the resorts, where a lot of capacity was added by the industry year-over-year. But we're having really incredible performance into deep South America as we continue our coordination of launching the JV with LATAM. And we're very excited about the short-term and the long-term prospects there. Yes. I think we're at our new norm, and our new norm is different than 2019,but what I see mainly is an extension of the international seasons. So we mentioned that in an earlier question that it used to be the summer peak was just June, July, August, and now I think we're moving into April through March. All the way through October is a very strong season, particularly for southern Europe. Northern Europe starts a little bit later. And then the other thing I just mentioned, I mentioned in an earlier call as well, is that the beach Mexican and the Caribbean beaches just seem to have a little bit too much capacity this year, and we'll work through that as we go through the year. But if you look, those are up 20%, 30% across the board and having a little trouble keeping up with that \u2013 the demand keeping up with that kind of capacity increase. And I imagine, it is \u2013 people plan next year that they'll trim on the margin those back down again or let that demand catch up. So generally, I think we're in a good spot here with supply and demand as far as the I can see, we're positive in all the future months and almost all the future \u2013 in almost every entity with the exception of lab. Yeah. I think we just alluded to a majority of our growth will be in our core hubs or to partner hubs. So probably 75% to 80% of our growth will be in those locations. We feel that we accelerated the coastal gateway growth earlier in the process with our once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to become the leading carriers in markets like Los Angeles and Boston. And those are paying huge dividends for us as we head into 2024, with Boston, for example, leading the unit revenue ascension for this quarter. So we're really, really pleased with the way it shaked out. And we still have some more rebuild to do in our core hubs. It'll probably take us through this year and into next year given the lower growth rates that we have, but that's what we're working on for the next 18 to 24 months. Well, I mean, this is all an opinion, right, as that, revenge travel, I think has years to go, particularly in long haul international. When you look at the aging of the demographics that people in their retirement years want to travel, and they were robbed of the ability to travel for three years, and we weren't able to accommodate last year. I think as we continued accommodation of that for the next several years until that revenge travel catch up. I think domestically we've done that. Revenge travel was early in the process, and we're kind of at our new equilibrium, and that gives us the opportunity to optimize as we move forward. And do they look different? They always look different. I think it's more the traditional Italy, Spain; those are two of the Italy, Spain, Greece are such hot spots. Portugal is a hot spot, and I think during the peak summer we're really excited about the prospect of bringing SAS along with us and now having hubs in Copenhagen and Stockholm that will allow us to have even more destinations in Europe than we serve today. Well, I'll take the second question first, is, we made some serious changes to our programs that were designed to really put the right people in the right categories so that we could deliver industry leading premium experiences. And as you know, while they were announced in the fall, most of them don't take into effect until 2025. And I think what we've estimated is that should \u2013 we should be done without those kinds of major changes to our programs. Of course, those programs are always changing, but I think the changes moving forward will be much more minimal. So I think that's behind us. We'll see how that plays out by the end of this year and into 2025. And your other question was on the Max... We've seen a small uptick specifically in Seattle, but Seattle is a small portion of our entire system. So it's kind of minimal in the grander scheme of things, but it's relevant in Seattle. Yeah. I think one of the issues were we were very inventory constrained in 2022 as we were behind the industry in our rebuild? And in 2023 we caught up back to basically a pre-pandemic level of capacity and those additional seats were enabled more corporates to get on the aircraft. I'd say what's different about now versus pre-pandemic is that before the pandemic and before the segmentation of customers, the differential between the yields on corporate and the yields on non-corporate high end leisure was significant. And these days those have closed, so now you have competition for the premium seats between those two categories that didn't exist pre-pandemic. And that's exciting for us as we manage them. But I think getting more seats available is one of the key priorities in the premium sector so that we can accommodate all the demand. Yeah. Clearly we think that our strategy is more customer friendly, and I'm sure that's part of it, but we don't want to buy it."

            "name": "Dan Janki",
            "content": "Thank you, Glen. And good morning to everyone. 2023 was another meaningful milestone in restoring our financial foundation. We delivered earnings of $6.25 per share and pretax income of $5.2 billion, nearly double our performance of last year. Operating margins of 11.6% was up four points from last year and expected to lead the industry. We generated operating cash flow of $7.2 billion, enabling reinvestment in our people, our fleet and technology. After gross CapEx of $5.3 billion, we generated free cash flow of $2 billion. During the year, we paid more than $4 billion of gross debt. This included accelerated repayment of $1.7 billion of higher cost debt. We ended the year with liquidity of $6.8 billion and grew our unencumbered assets to $26 billion. Our leverage ratio improved two turns to finish the year at three times. Return on invested capital improved to 13.4%, up five points over 2022. S&P upgraded our credit rating in the second half of last year. We are investment grade rated at Moody's and we are now only one notch away from investment grade with outlooks improving at both S&P and Fitch during the year. With this progress, we reinstated our dividend last summer, broadening our appeal to yield focused investors. We closed out the year strong, reporting a December quarter pretax profit of $1.1 billion, on operating margins of 9.7%, resulting in earnings of $2.28 per share. Non-fuel unit costs were up 1.1% year-over-year in line with our guidance. Now moving to our outlook, for the March quarter, we expect earnings of $0.25 to $0.50 per share on approximately 5% operating margin. We expect March quarter fuel price to be $2.50 to $2.70 per gallon, with a $0.05 to $0.10 refinery benefit. The refinery profit is expected to be down more than $130 million from last year due to elevated crack spreads in early 2023. For the full year, we expect to deliver earnings of $6 to $7 per share. With our reduced outlook for capacity growth, we expect full year non-fuel unit costs to be up low single digit over 2023, with the March quarter unit costs up approximately 3%. The last two years were a period of intense restoration with unnatural high growth to rebuild our network. Growth is normalizing and we've entered a period of optimization with a focus on restoring our most profitable core hubs and delivering efficiency gains across the enterprise. The intensity of hiring and training has moderated and investments in reliability are beginning to pay off with continued improvement in operational performance. We expect to deliver efficiencies through the year that will help fund investments in our people, the customer experiences that Ed spoke to earlier. On maintenance we have a higher number of heavy airframe and engine checks this year resulting from the timing of new aircraft deliveries over the last decade and the reactivation of our flex fleets. At the same time, industry-wide supply chain constraints are continuing, driving higher costs and extended turnaround times. For the full year, we expect maintenance expense to be up $350 million over 2023, as we prioritize continued improvement in operational reliability and readying our fleet for the peak summer period. We expect the majority of this increase to be in the early part of the year. Unit cost growth is expected to improve for the March quarter levels as we deliver efficiency and lap investments we made in the second half of 2023. Now, onto cash flow. We expect cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow, including CapEx of $5 billion. The improvement in free cash flow is driven by growth and profitability, lower CapEx and a higher mix of cash sales. As cash sales are expected to compose a larger percentage of overall bookings as travel credit utilization normalizes. We plan to pay cash for $3 billion of 2024 debt maturities and for approximately 45 aircraft deliveries, growing our unencumbered asset base to $30 billion. We expect to reduce leverage to under three times, returning the balance sheet to investment grade metrics, while continued invest in the business remains our focus for capital allocation, we'll continue to evaluate shareholder returns with a focus on dividend growth as we reach our targeted leverage. In closing, Delta is well positioned as we enter the final year of our three-year plan to restore our financial foundation. We are continuing to prioritize the objectives we laid out at Investor Day with an emphasis on earnings durability, free cash flow and capital efficiency. Our industry-leading operational and financial performance is a result of the hard work and dedication of the Delta people. I'd like to thank each of them for what they do every day. With that, I'd like to turn it back to Julie for Q&A. Mike, I don't think... It was never our intent to have that fleet grounded by 2025. It was our intent to have them out of international long haul by 2028 and retired by 2030. Thank you. Yes. As said maintenance was up $350 million for the year with a focus on the first part of the year. The other piece of it is you think about efficiencies, efficiencies just build as you progress through the year. One example is we're down on \u2013 we're fully staffed. One place we're hiring is pilots that will be down 50% \u2013 over 50% from last year, but again, front half centric with training associated with it as you get ready for the summer. And that really normalizes the historical levels in the back half of the year. So just a good steady drum beat of efficiencies as we pace through the year. Yes, predominantly, yes, David, certainly, two drivers. First, we flew less capacity and kept the cost into invest back into the business. That was one. And the second piece was what we talked a lot in the second half of the year was the investment in maintenance and the cost associated with maintenance. And those were really, when you look at where we were, from what we got it to where we ended up just over plus two, those were the single two biggest drivers associated with that. When you think about that as we go into New Year, four here, a lot different backdrop as we're in a more normalized growth environment. When you're thinking and planning and the teams are executing the 3% to 5% growth versus 17% to 20% growth, the focus really less on this training and hiring and the restoration of the airline and our operating teams are focused on the operational performance and fine tuning that. And as you do that, that sets the stage to drive the efficiency. And things that we actions that we took in if we are paying off, if you look at the maintenance doing a lot of work and there's a lot to still go. But the fourth quarter performance aircraft out of service down 30%, maintenance cancels down over 80%. So that those actions that they're taking around, proactive reliability, getting the touch time on the aircraft, paying dividends, but that's really what allows us when you're in that normalized environment, you can really stay after that consistently day in and day out. That sets the stage for the execution around efficiency. Yes. The driver is $75 million to $100 million, really driven by interest expense. And as we've accelerated the debt reduction action that drives the benefit, we expect pension to be flat on a year-over-year basis. The team did a great job. The pension delivered at or slightly above its targeted return, so no headwind associated with that. You get some \u2013 a little bit around some of the equity earnings of our partners, but we expect to be pretty consistent throughout the year due to the interest reduction and savings coming through as you progress through the year. The \u2013 one is, we continue as we get into a period here where we're more normalized in growth. It's allowing us to extend our planning horizon, where we're able to look out on a rolling not only 12, but 18, 24, 36 months. And I think the more visibility and stability that we get from that allows us to better plan as it relates back into how we run our fleet and how we balance that capacity with cost. And I think that will continue to give us more certainty around that. The other piece is just the heavy lift that our entire tech ops team has in working closely with the supply chain, and with all our partners across that getting clarity in regards to the things that they need to do and we can do on their behalf as it relates to Delta, in regards to continuing to improve the execution of that over time. And we've got to work closely with those partners to continue to improve that. And then to the last piece on MRO, yes, there will be an opportunity to continue to grow. I think as we've talked about before, we're well positioned on all these platforms. The focus has been, and we'll be right here making sure that we've got strong foundation on Delta and Delta's fleet. But we also do have an eye to continue to grow the MRO business, and you'll start to see that. Start this year but really in earnest in the years two and three years out. No. We don't expect cash taxes this year and would expect that potentially cash tax payments starting in 2025 and beyond."

At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, in Atlanta, we are joined by CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions, and then we'll move to our media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Bastian: Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. Before we start, I want to acknowledge the unfolding war in Israel and the tragic loss of life that has ensued. Delta is donating $1 million to the American Red Cross for the International Committee of the Red Cross to help fund humanitarian efforts in the conflict. This includes emergency assistance such as health services, emergency care, ambulance services, and other critical needs. Our inbound and outbound flights to Tel Aviv have been suspended through October 31st to ensure the safety and security of our customers and employees. We're also offering a customer waiver for travel to Tel Aviv for those who need to change their travel plans. Our hearts with everyone impacted by these tragic and horrific events. Turning to our news for the day. This morning, Delta reported September quarter results, posting earnings of $2.03 per share, a 35% increase over last year. Revenue grew 13%, and we achieved a 13.5% operating margin. This resulted in operating income of $2 billion, bringing our operating profit over the last 12 months to over $6 billion. The Delta people delivered for our customers throughout the very busy summer season. And I'm grateful to our teams for all they do for our customers and each other every day. Our people are the foundation of Delta and are our most important competitive strength. Sharing our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of Delta's culture. With this quarter's financial performance, we accrued another $420 million towards next February's profit sharing. This brings our profit sharing accrual to over $1 billion year-to-date, marking an important and exciting milestone for the Delta team. The great work of our 100,000 people was recently recognized as Delta ranked number 12 overall on Time Magazine's list of The World's Best Companies. We were the only airline to make the top 100 of this prestigious list. And USA Today readers just selected Delta as the Best Airline in the World. Our operational fundamentals remain strong, underscored by Delta's industry-leading position in on-time arrivals and blue sky operational performance that is reliably back to pre-COVID levels. Following a high number of irregular operations days early in the quarter, driven by weather and ATC constraints, we have seen consistent improvement in our operating metrics. In October, we are running a near-perfect completion factor across the mainline system, and we remain number one in on-time arrivals year-to-date. As we're now in the final phase of our recovery, we are making important forward-leaning investments in the health and reliability of our fleet. These maintenance investments will position us to consistently deliver the operational excellence that underpins Delta's brand. Running a high-quality operation is critical to being the airline of choice for our customers and driving a competitive cost structure. Dan will speak more to this shortly. During the quarter, we also made a $150 million strategic investment in Wheels Up, co-investing alongside Certares Management, Knighthead Capital and others. This new investment structure combines the number one premium commercial airline with the travel and tourism expertise of Certares and the turnaround expertise of Knighthead. Delta's relationship with Wheels Up creates a new premium product line for our customers, and I look forward to working with our co-investors and the new management team to unlock the full value of this uniquely positioned business. Turning to our outlook. Travel remains a top purchase priority and our core customer base is in a healthy financial position. We continue to see strength in bookings across Delta's global network, driven by our consumers. Demand for premium experiences, international travel, and increasing business travel further differentiate the trends that Delta is seeing within the industry. We expect our December quarter revenues to be 10% higher than 2022, with a 10% operating margin and earnings of over $1 per share. This brings our expectation for full year earnings to over $6 per share on a double-digit operating margin and free cash flow of $2 billion. Since raising full year guidance over the summer, our revenue outlook has improved, though earnings and cash flow have been impacted by higher fuel and maintenance costs. Revenue for the full year is expected to increase 20% over last year, which was the high-end of our expectations on steady domestic demand and continued strength in international. With strong top line growth and margin expansion, we expect to double earnings year-over-year and deliver a 13% return on invested capital. Our outlook for 2023 keeps revenue, earnings, cash flow and debt reduction on track with our three-year plan, which we issued in December of '21. As we progress through the recovery, we have made meaningful investments in operational reliability and our people. Delta has led the industry in setting the bar for wages, including a new pilot deal and profit sharing. We are seeing the structural step-up in operating costs amid increasing fuel prices, creating some near-term pressure on industry margins. However, I fully expect that the market will adjust to higher costs as it has historically and reestablish equilibrium. With Delta's differentiated premium revenue strategy and strong global network, we will continue to deliver industry-leading profitability and generate robust free cash flow. In closing, the strategy that we shared at Investor Day positions us well for the future. And while the operate -- the environment we operate in continues to evolve in this post-COVID world, our objectives are unchanged as we move into 2024. With our network rebuilt and growth now moderating, optimizing the airline and driving efficiency are significant opportunities. Thank you, again, for your support of our company. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen and to Dan to go through the details of the quarter.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and dedication during the busy summer travel season. In the September quarter, Delta generated revenue of $14.6 billion, up 13% over prior year. Total unit revenues were down 2.5%, including 1 point of pressure from cargo and MRO. With these results, I expect Delta to deliver a record September quarter unit revenue premium versus the industry, reflecting the continued success of our commercial strategy. Domestic passenger revenue was up 6% over prior year. Performance was steady through the quarter with strength in our coastal hubs, where we are leveraging our leading positions in generational airport bills. International passenger revenue grew 35%, with the Transatlantic and Pacific outperforming our already high expectations. We delivered record margins across all international entities this summer and strength is continuing through the fall. Demand for our premium products is very strong with revenue up 17% over prior year, outperforming main cabin by 5 points. Domestic paid load factor in our first-class cabins was a record as we continue to advance our premium merchandising and upsell capabilities. Delta Premium Select has now been rolled out to over 85% of long-haul flights, and the revenue generation from this product has been above expectations and a key contributor to our record international margins. Business travel continues to steadily improve as corporates continue with return-to-office initiatives. Less recovered sectors like technology and financial services saw double-digit growth during the quarter. Our recent corporate survey indicates continued growth in business demand with a significant majority of companies expecting their travel to stay the same or increase as we move into 4Q and into '24. SME and hybrid travelers are producing margins in line with corporate travelers and demand from these travel remains well above 2019 levels. Total loyalty revenue was up 17% over prior year, with continued strength in our American Express co-brand portfolio. Amex remuneration of $1.7 billion grew approximately 20% over prior year. We expect full year remuneration of close to $7 billion and are focused on reaching our long-term goal of $10 billion. Diversified revenue streams, including premium and loyalty, have generated 55% of revenue year-to-date, reflecting Delta's differentiated positioning to the industry. Turning to the December quarter, we expect total unit revenue to grow 9% to 12% over prior year, bringing our full-year revenues to up 20% over prior year. This is at the high end of our guidance even with a few points less capacity than we had planned for the year, reflecting robust demand for the Delta product. Capacity in the fourth quarter is expected to be up 14% to 15%, implying total unit revenues down 2.5% to 4.5% versus prior year. Domestic and Transatlantic trends are expected to be consistent with the third quarter. Pacific and Latin America unit revenue trends are expected to be modest -- excuse me, expected to modestly decelerate given capacity growth related to China reopening and investment in our LATAM JV. Domestic demand remains steady and initial bookings for the peak holiday periods are strong. The ongoing UAW and actor strikes are having a modest impact and we have incorporated those into our outlook. As we move through the fourth quarter, our Domestic capacity growth moderates and, in the first quarter of 2024, we expect domestic capacity to be flat to slightly down year-over-year. We have reallocated capacity to international leisure where we are expecting strong returns and remain focused on fully restoring our higher-margin core hubs. On international, we are seeing continued demand strength through the winter. The Transatlantic remains very strong, driven by partner hubs and southern European leisure traffic performance. We're closely monitoring the situation in Israel as we will evaluate restarting the flights as the situation stabilizes. In the Pacific, we expect to grow December quarter capacity 40% to 50% as we continue restoring the network. While this level of growth will impact unit revenue, we expect the new flying will be profit accretive. For the year, we remain confident in finishing strong with record profitability across all three international entities. In closing, I'm proud of the revenue performance our teams have delivered, and I'm confident that our integrated commercial strategy will continue to drive industry-leading profitability. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials.\nDan Janki: Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the September quarter, we delivered earnings of $2.03 per share and operating margin of 13.5%. Non-fuel unit costs were up 1.3% year-over-year, and fuel prices averaged $2.78 a gallon, including a refinery benefit of $0.11. We generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, and we invested -- reinvested $1.4 billion into the business. Liquidity ended the quarter at $7.8 billion and adjusted net debt of $20.2 billion. Year-to-date, we've repaid $3.7 billion of gross debt. This is including $1.7 billion of accelerated repayment on our higher cost debt. Our leverage ratio improved to 3 times on a trailing 12-month basis. During the quarter, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BB+, one notch away from investment grade, a recognition of our improving financial foundation. Our capital allocation priorities are reinvesting in the business and improving our balance sheet to investment-grade metrics, with a modest cash return to shareholders through our dividend. Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect non-fuel unit costs to be flat to up 2% on a year-over-year basis. With the exception of maintenance costs, our second-half unit costs are progressing as expected. As we discussed in September, there are three drivers to higher maintenance: first, investment in fleet health; second, expanded work scope on our 757 engine fleet; and third, challenges across the supply chain. On fleet health and reliability, our investments are starting to deliver improved operational performance. Our September metrics were ahead of August, and October is ahead of September. On the 757 engine, a workhorse in our fleet, we're going through a wave of overhauls. The engines we took off wing over the summer required larger work scope and a higher mix of new parts. Looking forward, we are forecasting higher new material consumption rates. On supply chain, the industry continues to face challenges that will take time to work through. Engine and airframe turnaround times remain elevated, driving inefficiency and impacting productivity. We are working closely with our partners and leveraging our deep expertise in TechOps to manage supply chain challenges. Delta has a long heritage of industry-leading operational performance driven by the best TechOps capability in the industry. Operational excellence is central to our brand promise and a key pacing item to drive out inefficiencies. Moving to fuel. Fuel prices have moved higher since July, adding roughly $400 million of expense to our outlook for the second half of the year. We expect December fuel prices to be $2.90 to $3.20 per gallon, with the refinery expected to be roughly breakeven for the quarter. The refinery turnaround is progressing as we planned, and we expect production to resume in mid-November. Based on our December quarter outlook for revenue and cost, we expect earnings of $1.05 to $1.30 per share on a 9% to 11% operating margin. This brings our full-year outlook to earnings to $6.00 to $6.25 per share on double-digit operating margin and free cash flow of $2 billion. We are focused on finishing the year strong, remain committed to delivering industry-leading margin performance, earnings growth and strong cash generation. As we progress through the 2024 planning process, our focus is shifting from restoration to optimization. Over the last two years, we've grown at an unprecedented rate for an airline of our size to restore our network. Growth is normalizing next year, and we expect operational reliability to continue to improve. This will allow us to optimize how we run the airline, reducing operational buffers, and driving out inefficiencies that have resulted from the intensity of the rebuild. Our capacity growth for 2024 will be focused on Delta's areas of strength. Domestically, we are prioritizing our core high-margin hubs, driving connectivity and gauge. Internationally, we are leveraging our best-in-class JV partnerships and increasing the mix of flying on next-generation aircraft. We are executing against the strategy and financial objectives we laid out at our Investor Day with an emphasis on free cash flow, earnings durability, and capital efficiency. In closing, Delta is well positioned to maintain industry leadership operationally and financially. I'd like to sincerely thank the Delta people for everything they do every day. With that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A.\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for a question?\nOperator: Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. So, Dan, expanding on some of your engine comments, we're obviously focused on the GTF situation. I realize you're not or at least I don't believe you're directly impacted with any groundings right now. I'm just trying to square the situation against your MRO and your GTF in-house expertise. I mean, is there a scenario where the Pratt mess ends up benefiting Delta? Or should we think more about simply reducing the downside relative to some of your peers? Also how does this impact the maintenance cost guide embedded in your 2024 CASM expectations? Thanks.\nDan Janki: Maybe I'll first start with the geared turbofan as it relates more directly to our fleet both. On the neo, we took our deliveries later, so the impact will be modest to minimal. If there are any inspections or things off-wing, it will be in the latter half of 2024 based on the analysis that we've gotten so far from Pratt. We're still waiting on the full analysis related to the 220 fleet, that should be coming later this month, and we will assess that impact appropriately. As it relates to MRO, Pratt is certainly a close partner of ours and an important one as it relates to that third-party capability and we will certainly support their efforts. We're working closely with them on that. We have capacity. It ultimately comes down to the allocation of capacity and availability of material to do the work, but we'll be working with them through the fall and into next year on that.\nJamie Baker: Okay, that's helpful. And then for Glen, I've asked about this before, a lot of Delta customers obviously took fairly lavish European vacations this year. You have SkyMiles data on these folks. What's the correlation between big summer spenders and big winter spenders? What's that, I don't know, sort of SkyMiles Venn diagram look like? Because what I'm wondering about is the potential for people scaling back on their winter trips because they've spent lavishly on their summer holidays. Any actual data you can share on that? Thanks again, guys.\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure. I think what we're really excited about is the lengthening of the European travel season. And that has really gone from primarily ending in the summer IATA season, which would be October, now through November, through the holidays, through the New Year. And really now we're only talking about a six to eight-week period that are the doldrums for Europe. So, the bookings, which most people wouldn't have expected, of course, we reduced our schedule in the fall and the winter IATA season. But our year-over-year comps are actually accelerating into the winter as we look into November, December and January. So, I think we're seeing that continuing into the fall and early parts of winter, and we're very excited about that. And we've also, of course, expanded into a lot more Latin leisure this winter than we did last winter, and the advanced demand for that seems very, very robust. So, leisure is still very strong, and even through shoulder and off-peak periods.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Thanks, Glen. Thanks, everybody. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. If I may, Glen, just your comment about domestic capacity being flat to down in the first quarter. I was just wondering if that was a decent trend for the full year or is it -- was related to also, in the last year, the way first quarter kind of turned out wasn't what you expected and you were going to make some capacity changes. So, is that related to that as well, or is it more kind of weakness that you're seeing recently, or maybe strength in international on a relative basis?\nGlen Hauenstein: It's really a reshaping of the demand patterns that we saw last year. And no shock, January and February are not in the northern tier, transcon, east-west markets, barnburner markets, so reallocating those to warmer and sunnier places. So, our total capacity will be up. Domestic capacity will be down slightly. Core hubs will actually be up with more emphasis on warm and sunny places in Latin America and South Pacific. So that's kind of how we're profiling and really optimization of the demand patterns we saw last year going into this winter.\nSavi Syth: That makes sense. And if I may also just on domestic revenue. It's been stable at Delta since kind of June. I was wondering how much of a contribution you're getting from restoring your hubs and separately perhaps the domestic portion of international trips, given what you've talked about the strength kind of continuing in Transatlantic longer than kind of historic. The reason I ask it, it seems that stable comment is a little bit different than maybe what we're hearing from kind of the purely domestic airlines.\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. I think what domestic strength is really coming from are the premium products domestically. And I'm not going to speak for the other carriers. They all have coming in the next few weeks. But it really hasn't been on domestic portion of international journey, which is de minimis in terms of the variance to what it was last year. Our employments in the Transatlantic are up low double digits, but that only represents 13% of our total travel, so really a de minimis impact to domestic. So, it's really coming from the premium products, and they're doing quite well. As I mentioned, domestic paid first-class load factors are reaching new heights every month. So, very excited about those demand trends and I think that reinforces the strategy we've been working on for the last 10 years to have a differentiated product.\nSavi Syth: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.\nConor Cunningham: Hey, everyone, thank you. Ed, in the prepared remarks, I think you touched on fuel recapture. Right now, there doesn't seem to be much of an adjustment on the capacity side from some of your indices participants, despite like erratic fuel. So, just trying to understand if there's a new calculus to how you're approaching fuel recapture right now in the current market. Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Well, obviously, fuel moved an awful lot within just the last couple of months. And it's the volatility of fuel that really hits us hard as compared to the ability to recapture it. I think traditionally, we've seen over a two to three-quarter rise. We have a pretty good success rate at recapturing it. When you think about the strength of the demand environment and the fact that across the board, everyone has -- not just fuel costs are up, but labor rates are increasing and other inflationary pressure, supply chain and maintenance costs are up. Everyone has a similar incentive to continue to be able to recalibrate those pricing -- those market pressures into pricing. So, my outlook is I'm optimistic as we're going into '24. Glen can add his own color there.\nGlen Hauenstein: No, I think you mentioned it really well. It takes time, and when we have rapid fuel price run-ups, it usually takes a few quarters for that to roll into the industry realized fares. But historically, it's always worked. So, we're looking at history to predict the future, but that's what the history would tell you.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, appreciate that. And then, Dan, just back to the maintenance costs and operational investments, just trying to understand, I know you touched on it in Jamie's question, but just trying to understand how it plays out. Are you basically assuming that maintenance and operational investments will be elevated in the first half? And then, how does that roll off? And then, when do the productivity gains that you've talked about in the past kind of kick in? I'm just trying to understand how the moving parts are changing a little bit right now. Thank you.\nDan Janki: Yeah, certainly we talked about it. We're in the middle of -- Conor, thank you. We're in the middle of the '24 planning process. When you think about maintenance, as Ed talked about, it is a foundational item as it relates to our operational reliability and the investments that we're making here related to fleet health and the work that we're doing on our engines, we're going to stay after here. And that will be with us at least into the first half of next year, and we want to drive that operational reliability. The second part of that is, as you get that operational reliability, that is really what creates the foundation to be able to start to optimize and unlock the cost, investment and inefficiencies that we talked back about at Investor Day, that $1 billion-plus. And as you see that operational reliability continue to improve, our teams will be able to lean more and more into getting those investment buffers out, those inefficiencies that are in every part of our operation. And our teams are working through that as they're building out their operating plan and financial plan for 2024.\nConor Cunningham: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, good morning. Just on the maintenance investment, I'll follow up to maybe Jamie's question there, is this at all a reflection of your thoughts on future aircraft delivery constraints? In other words, were you always thinking about using those 75s next year? And then just generally, how do you think about and measure returns on capital for investing in something like a 757 versus going out and buying new?\nDan Janki: Yeah, Glen can chime in here too. I think the 757 has been a fleet as we've gone through our restoration that we've characterized as a flexible fleet. And it's one that -- it's certainly a workhorse. The returns are very good related to how we deploy it and fly it within our network. So, we have leaned on it. When you think back of where we might have been 18, 24 months ago, the number that we're flying, we have reactivated more as we continue to see new delivery slide, and we get recalibrated year to year. So, it is one that we've leaned into. And it's one that we will be flexible on as we work through the next three, four, five years in regards to how we deploy it. The wave of overhauls that we started last year and we're doing this year and we'll have the same next year, but that gets us through a heavy wave, that then allows us really very viable engines that the Delta team has always been very good at managing the end of life of an asset. We did it on the 90s, 88s in regards to how you manage those assets and deploy them, but also get the most out of them, whether it's in whole or in the parts and how they're redeployed back in the stream. And we are always working closely then with fleet and maintenance with Glen's team on how to deploy them and get the best returns for them. But those are good returning. It's a great workhorse for our fleet with good returns.\nGlen Hauenstein: Nothing to add other than, yeah, we took a lot of late deliveries. I think our last 75 was produced -- we had the last one ever built. So, some of these planes are not that old and we have them in our fleet and we have -- but as you said, as we get to the end of life of these, towards the end of this decade, we'll be able to really start harvesting the engines, which will really improve the maintenance profile of the fleet.\nEd Bastian: And Duane, this is Ed, if I could add my perspective. Your point is right. It is related to the OEMs fundamentally. Their inability to produce engines on time, which they're having their own challenges within the supply chain, as well as parts on time. And the one thing that has been a core part of Delta's strength over at TechOps is our ability to go into the used/repair market and acquire assets and repurpose them towards our own needs. That market has largely dried up given all the large rebound in flight activity, which was running at the same time the OEMs have been having and struggling to produce new. So, I think this is something you're going to see across the industry. This isn't just at Delta. And it's one of the constraints we talked about at Investor Day. It's going to keep us all pretty limited in the amount of capacity that we can produce. But I'd put my money on the Delta TechOps team, because they're the best in the business and we'll figure this out. And we know this is a -- while it may hit the expense line, we know this is a long-term asset that's going to pay dividends for years to come.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate those thoughts. And maybe just for my follow-up on Pacific, and Glen, can you just remind us where we are in China reopen? I think there's another round of expansion here in November. And then just broadly in Pacific, what are the markets away from China that you're excited about?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I think what we're very excited about is the success of our Incheon hub with Korean. And that has really even exceeded our expectations. We think it's the best place to connect to get to Southeast Asia from any one of our hubs or as a double connect. So, really trying to leverage that, and we'll have some announcements on continuing to work to increase our capacity next year. But that's really been a lynchpin. South Pacific has been a really great surprise for us, the demand there, really in tune with that same high demand for leisure destinations. So that's been doing very well, as well as Japan. As you know, Japan was closed for a couple years and our Japanese franchise is doing quite well. So, you put the Pacific together, and if you recall, for years, we were telling our investors to hold on. We've got this restructuring coming. We had the wrong airplanes. We were at the wrong airports. And it took us many years to get to where we wanted to be, but we're finally there and we're producing great returns in the Pacific and we're excited about our opportunities moving forward.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I appreciate the detailed thoughts.\nGlen Hauenstein: Oh, China. I didn't say -- China, of course. We went from essentially double daily in Detroit -- double weekly, I'm sorry, in Detroit and Seattle to 10x a week, with Seattle moving to daily and Detroit moving to 3x. So -- and we'll see if there's another wave of this. I think the first thing we have to see is, is there a demand for the capacity that's going into market right now, and we'll keep you abreast of that as we move forward on China reopening.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Ed, a couple of questions just kind of want to bring it back to some things discussed at Investor Day. I guess maybe first just on capacity growth. I know you gave us a little color about how you're thinking about 1Q, kind of domestic versus international. But the mid-single digit growth that you talked about in 2024, I guess, in this fuel environment, would you consider that growth rate as reasonable or aspirational at this point in time?\nEd Bastian: Well, it's probably more a question for Glen than myself. But at my level, as I just said in my last comments, I hear -- my sense would be any capacity that you hear from us in terms of plans or the industry, you should read as somewhat aspirational, because there still are tremendous constraints in the marketplace in terms of delivering that growth. If all goes well and we get all the parts and we get the planes on time and we have the labor ready and ATC is not an issue and fuel prices stay reasonable, yeah, that's what's going to happen. But if you look over the last two to three years, we continue to evolve it. So those are just points-in-time estimates as to what we could do. As to what we actually will be able to do, I think we'll probably, across the board, be a little less than that.\nGlen Hauenstein: And I would just add a comment. About half of that is run rate of what's in there as we enter the first quarter of next year. So, the real number is half of low-single digits, which is very low-single digits.\nAndrew Didora: Yeah. Got it. Makes sense. And then I guess, Dan, just on costs and CASM next year. Obviously, with capacity moving around, obviously, the maintenance costs continuing into next year, can you just give us a sense of your level of confidence in 2024 CASM-Ex being able to be down kind of low-single digits, or should we think about that differently as well? Thank you.\nDan Janki: As I mentioned earlier, we're still in the middle of our planning process. So, all these pieces are coming together, right, capacity, along with all the things that we've talked about. Regarding the maintenance, we're spending certainly a lot more time on that, given all the moving pieces in the industry and elements that we talked about.\nEd Bastian: Yeah, Dan's comments earlier about -- this is going to be a pivot to optimization is a big deal and maintenance is a part of that. Maintenance unlocks the ability to drive the efficiencies across the enterprise. And we're right in the middle of the planning process. So, we're not trying to dodge the question. We will give you at the typical time at the start of the year what we think we can do.\nAndrew Didora: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. Ed, on CNBC this morning you called out a pick-up in corporate bookings. Could we just dig into that a little bit more? What have you seen since Labor Day on volumes or revenue from corporate? Any industries or regions that are bigger drivers or it's really across the board? And anything on maybe just corporate booking windows today versus maybe a couple of months ago, and they're still longer than pre-COVID? Appreciate it.\nEd Bastian: Well, we said on the last call that we anticipated post-Labor Day that we'd see volumes of corporate travel pick up. And indeed, we're seeing that. I think Glen mentioned a couple of sectors, the tech sector and the financial services sector is areas that we're seeing double-digit growth. We have, I'd say, across the board we're seeing increases. The corporate travel has come back, it comes back and then plateaus, comes back and plateaus. And I think you'll see another wave of return. I think a lot of it's being driven by the return to office and getting into the new normal work patterns, which many companies are still sorting out for themselves. But it's healthy to see, and it's one of the distinguishing factors between us and some of the carriers that are on the other end of the fare spectrum. So, one of the many differentiating factors that is enabling us to grow revenue at the pace we are.\nCatherine O'Brien: Makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much. And then one, maybe this is for Dan. Can you just speak to how the air traffic liability is trending year-to-date and into the fourth quarter versus your expectations at the start of the year? I know we kicked off the year with really strong first quarter performance on that ETL build. Should you be aware of any impact from normalization of booking windows versus last year, just given the pick-up in corporate volume you're seeing? Thanks a lot.\nDan Janki: No, I'd say it's performing as we expected. We're starting to maybe get back to a little bit more of the traditional seasonality. As we were restoring, it was a little bit different. And if you look at historical patterns, you're only down mid-teens as you go through into the fourth quarter. And that's kind of what we saw as we wrapped up the third quarter here. And so, no. The other element that you have in there is you certainly have -- we've had very friendly policies as it relates to credits and customers have gotten really used to using them. And we think that's obviously long-term beneficial that people have confidence to book and travel, but also consume when they don't travel. And those we've seen very consistent issuance and usage rates on them.\nCatherine O'Brien: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.\nMike Linenberg: Oh, yeah. Hey, good morning everyone. Glen, you called out a couple of sectors that were underperforming from a corporate perspective. I mean, I think of any carrier probably the most indexed to the automotive sector and then sort of the media sector with the writers' and actors' strike. What sort of drag do you actually think that had on your corporates, at least in the month of September and maybe what you're seeing right now?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, clearly, I'll start with Los Angeles and the entertainment production strikes that are ongoing. That has had a not insignificant change in the business travel to and from Los Angeles, as well as now the UAW strike, which has curtailed a significant amount of the business in Detroit. As you pointed out, we're very big in both of those sectors. And what I'm really encouraged about is despite those two kind of being things that we should look forward to as positives next year, that our total corporate revenues are still accelerating. So despite those two being a drag on them, and I think hopefully, those are both resolves fairly quickly here and we can get back to a normal business level. But you are right, spot on, that we are probably the most impacted by those two sectors.\nMike Linenberg: Great. And then just a quick one to Dan or Ed. I didn't see in the release a reiteration of the $7-plus for 2024. I know you're still mid-budget, but just based on the trajectory and everything you're seeing now, that number is still fine?\nEd Bastian: That's our plan, Mike. I mentioned that we gave that guide in December of 2021, as long as free cash and others and we're on track.\nMike Linenberg: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Glen, I'm probably going to ask Jamie's initial SkyMiles data mining question in a different way. And based on data that you have, do you have any evidence that traditional domestic travelers have been flying internationally more often in 2023, maybe people taking their first or kind of rare international trips? Just trying to see if there's any truth or data to back up the thesis that there has been substitution of domestic with people flying internationally this year.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I'd say that's a very broad question, and clearly, there's been an expansion of international. But if you think about domestic and the volume differential between the number of seats we have every day domestically and the number of seats we have every day to Europe, it would be very hard to track those incremental visits back to people who did not fly domestically, because it's such a small piece of domestic travel in terms of total volumes. And so, while clearly, the spend has been very robust for long-haul in general, we have not seen a diminishing of short-haul either.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. That's really helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, kind of feels like Trans-Pacific has not quite been the explosion of pent-up demand that we saw in domestic and Transatlantic when they initially opened, but it looks like 2024 might be a better year for that. Is there any way you think that the historical profitability in that region, which has not been great to say the least, can be better when that initial kind of flow-through of demand comes through with pricing the way it might potentially be?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I'd disagree with you on your premise there that Pacific has been a laggard. Pacific has been quite robust, and I think we indicated these are our record profits in terms of margins and total profitability in the Pacific. And if you look at the Pacific, absent of China, it's been fully restored. So, I think we're very pleased with the demand to the Pacific, and we're -- right now, that's where our capacity is sitting up most in the fourth quarter and where it will be in the first and through next year. And so -- and we're very enthusiastic about the results we're getting there.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thanks, Glen.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yeah, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Glen, I know you've called out your corporate travel here being up in coastal hub strength, but can you talk to maybe any areas of weakness domestically? And is there like diverging trends with your main cabin revenue?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I think we've called out diverging trends with main cabin. Those have been pretty consistent, though, throughout the recovery is it's been led by premium products and services. So that's not inconsistent between quarters. I think it's actually relatively flat in terms of the -- how much premium is driving there. And geographically, I think what we're really excited about is the coastal hub investments we've made and particularly New York, that's something we're looking for in '24. We see a lot of momentum in the Northeast and New York in particular, as things to look forward to in '24.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. And then on the outlook for next year, growing with your JVs on the international side, how does the changes in Mexico impact as they move to a Category 1 with the FAA?\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. Mexico has been a great source of strength for us through the last year, and we see continued strength in those Mexican business. And I think when you think about what we read in the press and what you all see and the onshoring and moving factories from Asia down into Mexico, we've seen really an incredible strength in demand from the business sector in Mexico, and that's looking really robust into 2024. And working with Aeromexico now, we really couldn't do much with them. These are things we wanted to do in the past. You see us coordinating with them. We have an ATI joint venture. So, we've been working very closely with them to continue to work on where we see strength and being able to serve those markets better, including the auto sector in Detroit and including Atlanta as a primary gateway to Mexico primary and secondary airports.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Your line is live.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the question. Just on -- with respect to as you think about travel next summer on the North Atlantic, especially where U.S. citizens are going to need visas, how are you thinking about communicating that to people as they book trips? Is that going to be in the reservation process or follow-ups? Or how do you avoid surprises?\nPeter Carter: Helane, hi. It's Peter Carter. Say, we will make sure our customers are aware of the visa requirement at various points along the purchasing path and the journey. And I will tell you that the nice thing about the new visa requirement is it is a e-visa, so it's a fairly straightforward process that we think will take about 24 hours.\nHelane Becker: Yeah. I think it's like Australia, right, where it's pretty quick unless it's not, I think. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then the other question I had was just on the changes to Israel. How big actually is that in your total -- in the total market? It's a lot of ASMs, but it can't be that big in terms of, I guess, exposure.\nGlen Hauenstein: It's a little over 1 point of ASMs. And we're not going to give an exact number, but it's included -- the revenue hit is included in our fourth quarter guide. So, we've extended at least through October and then we'll see what happens. The reason we're not saying how much exposure there is, is we don't know how this will evolve yet, so we're staying very fluid. But I think we feel very confident that we can get inside of our guidance ranges here with Israel kind of in a worst-case scenario.\nHelane Becker: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.\nJulie Stewart: Matthew, we'll now go to our final analyst question.\nOperator: Certainly. Your last question is coming Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Ed, I wanted to ask you a question. You made a comment about you're leaning into the cost curve and really leading the industry here with pilot pay and the like. So, the question comes, how do we think about your double-digit margins today versus low-cost carriers and what they'll report in Q3 and margin moving pieces maybe into 2024, if you want to provide that or maybe the Delta versus Delta and other carriers?\nEd Bastian: Sheila, you should look at our '24 guide that we gave you with our three-year plan. The good news at Delta is that we have all of our labor costs at the new market across the board today in posting those double-digit margins. So, to the extent other carriers need to be increasing their labor cost in future negotiations, they're just going to be chasing the Delta cost. And I think that conversion of industry rates is something we've talked about as kind of another opportunity as we look at trying to make sure we're all running a better business here, and we're not -- we have the same incentives to make sure that our costs are finding their way into our pricing.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Sure. Now it makes sense. And if I could ask one more, a lot on Delta TechOps. Obviously, a big asset for Delta right now. Anything you could talk about? I think you've previously said GTF shop visits are running at 70 to 80 engines. I don't know if that was only GTF or all engines ramping to potentially 400. Maybe if you could just give us the -- talk about the opportunity longer term with Delta TechOps and what utilization is?\nDan Janki: Yes. Talk about it at baseline this year, TechOps for geared turbofan engine overhauls would be in the 150, 160 range. We have built capacity to take that to -- up to 350 and continue to discuss long-term -- medium- and longer-term capacity needs with Pratt related to that. So, we talked about it at Investor Day. Very optimistic about our position, not only the heritage that we have and the great expertise that we have in the Delta TechOps team, but our positioning as it relates to being on all the key next-generation platforms, whether that's geared turbofan, whether that's Rolls and also the LEAP engine create a real set of opportunities for us as we think about this business and multiples of what it can be today over the medium- and long-term.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you so much.\nJulie Stewart: That will wrap the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions.\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if we could, as we transition from the analyst questions to those from the members of the media, maybe repeat the instructions for everyone, please.\nOperator: Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Dawn Gilbertson from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi, good morning. Ed, I wonder if you could give us any more color, Ed or Glen, on the reaction to the SkyMiles changes and when you expect to announce the things you might be rolling back or changing?\nEd Bastian: Hi, Dawn. I've mentioned publicly over the last couple of weeks that we're certainly receiving good feedback from our customers with respect to the changes. I have indicated that we had too many changes rolled out at the same time, and we needed to go back and reassess the planned rollout for the new qualification levels. I mentioned this morning on the CNBC interview, there's two things, though, that are common throughout all of the feedback. One is there is the intense loyalty to Delta, which is really heartwarming to see. The loyalty to this brand is great. We've worked hard to build it and we maintain that. We will continue to maintain that. There should be no question about that. And secondly, that most everyone also agrees that something has to be done, because everyone sees that the premium number of customers that we continue to build are in excess of the premium assets that we have to offer. And so figuring out how to better rationalize and make certain that the service levels for our premium customers are where they need to be is -- there's various ways to get it. We've received a lot of ideas as to different ways to think about it, and you'll be hearing from us in the coming days.\nDawn Gilbertson: Okay. If I could just have one quick follow-up on that front. What is driving -- in terms of the reaction, I mean, are you seeing just feedback or are you seeing an impact on credit card sign-ups and/or cancellations? I mean, what's driving this pretty quick change to your initial plans?\nEd Bastian: Well, it's the feedback. It's not -- no, we're not seeing any change in trajectory rather on acquisitions or changes in spend levels. Everything continues to stay intact, as Glen, I think mentioned during some of his comments. This is good feedback that we're seeing and candidly, with some of it, I agree with them.\nDawn Gilbertson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live.\nAlison Sider: Hey, thanks so much. So, there's been some analysis recently about sort of the potential impact of cost savings if people really started taking weight loss drugs like Ozempic in big numbers. Is that something you look at, at all? Do you factor that into your fuel projections or anything like that?\nEd Bastian: No, we don't, Ali.\nAlison Sider: And then if I could follow up. I was also curious on potential Israel evacuation flights. I know there's ongoing discussions with the government on this. But would Delta be open to flying Israel under a charter if the government asks or if there was a craft activation? Or would you rather just fly to points outside of Israel? Is there any openness, I guess, to flying kind of under those circumstances?\nEd Bastian: There are discussions, as I've indicated. Right now, we're looking at providing some additional lift to Europe to get people out of Europe. But no, we don't have any plans to be flying into Israel. It's considered unsafe for a U.S. carrier to operate in that airspace currently.\nAlison Sider: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live.\nMary Schlangenstein: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask real quickly, with the ongoing slot waiver situation in New York where the airlines were asked to reduce capacity because of the congestion in the air traffic controller shortage, can you talk about how much of that Delta is taking advantage of? And whether you expect that if it continues long term to start to have some significant impact? Also whether you're redeploying that capacity into other markets?\nEd Bastian: Well, thanks for that question. Yes, we're planning on using the entirety of the slot waiver which is, I believe, 10% of our flights into and out of Kennedy and LaGuardia in order to help with the airspace congestion issues that are surrounding those airports right now. So, what we're trying to do is have minimal impact. We will not withdraw from any individual markets. We will thin out some frequencies. We'll put some larger gauge in. And any of the assets that are freed up from New York will get redeployed into other parts of our network for now. But it shouldn't really be very different than the summer. As you know, that's rolled forward from the summer, which we had 10% out, and that's just extending it through the winter. So, you won't see really, I think, any dramatic changes to our schedule versus where we're sitting today.\nMary Schlangenstein: Does that become a broader problem for you if that continues to be extended?\nEd Bastian: I think the broader problem is not being able to operate in the New York airspace. And so I think we're working very closely with the government to see what we can do to improve the situation there. It was very difficult on our customers this summer, and certainly, we're all hoping for some relief by next summer.\nPeter Carter: And Mary, we really -- this is Peter Carter. We really appreciate the FAA providing that relief and acknowledging that there is a constraint in the northeast with respect to the staffing of air traffic controllers. And frankly, that's the thing that we need to really solve as an industry.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, good morning. We keep seeing air fares fall, and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what kind of discounting you're having to do in the fall. And then have you made any capacity changes on days when people might have traveled in the off-peak and maybe they're going back to more traditional bookings, if that's the case? Thanks.\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure. I think the most recent data that came out this morning had been flat to up slightly month-over-month, so I don't think that as an industry level, that's a good indication. What we've seen is that actually June was our lowest point in terms of year-over-year average fares and it's moved up for us since then. And that's really driven by the premium side and the success we've had in terms of selling more premium and the fares we're getting for our premium products and services. So yes, at the bottom end, there's some discounting. There's also some fare initiatives. So, it's always a very fluid situation. And right now, I think we're very -- we're calling it stable between third quarter and fourth quarter.\nLeslie Josephs: And the fares that you're discounting to, is that like on par with 2019 or is that -- like is there a kind of a reference point for...\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah, certain markets are, certain markets are above. So I think the market basket is there -- at the very bottom end, they may be slightly below where they were in '19, but not really. There's always a fare in a market that is below, but in general, they're not.\nLeslie Josephs: Thank.\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Leslie. Matthew, we have time for one final question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Your last question is coming from David Slotnick from TPG. Your line is live.\nDavid Slotnick: Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Coming back to the loyalty program, were you surprised by the customer reaction and I suppose the degree of it? And what were you sort of expecting instead of that effect?\nEd Bastian: We were certainly expecting some feedback. And by the way, some of the feedback we've received is very positive and encourages us not to make any changes. So, there wasn't any one cohort that was silent on the matter. We heard all of the -- a full 360 view of the perspective. But it gave us a chance to sit back, reflect on it. And there were points about the program that I thought that we could make some modifications to. There still will be changes to the program. I've been very clear about that, but we're going to make modifications to what we announced.\nDavid Slotnick: Thank you. And just a follow-up. Was American Express expecting any changes to the premium card demand just with the lounge access? Do they think that, that's potentially going to fall? And if so, will that impact your loyalty revenue?\nGlen Hauenstein: American Express, we, of course, did this with full back-and-forth knowledge, so we did this together with American Express. And if anything, since we've announced it, we've seen a shift to higher premium card acquisitions. So, I think we're well within from that perspective where we thought we'd be.\nDavid Slotnick: Great. Thank you.\nTim Mapes: Thank you, David. And Matthew, I think that will conclude our call.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. Before we start, I want to acknowledge the unfolding war in Israel and the tragic loss of life that has ensued. Delta is donating $1 million to the American Red Cross for the International Committee of the Red Cross to help fund humanitarian efforts in the conflict. This includes emergency assistance such as health services, emergency care, ambulance services, and other critical needs. Our inbound and outbound flights to Tel Aviv have been suspended through October 31st to ensure the safety and security of our customers and employees. We're also offering a customer waiver for travel to Tel Aviv for those who need to change their travel plans. Our hearts with everyone impacted by these tragic and horrific events. Turning to our news for the day. This morning, Delta reported September quarter results, posting earnings of $2.03 per share, a 35% increase over last year. Revenue grew 13%, and we achieved a 13.5% operating margin. This resulted in operating income of $2 billion, bringing our operating profit over the last 12 months to over $6 billion. The Delta people delivered for our customers throughout the very busy summer season. And I'm grateful to our teams for all they do for our customers and each other every day. Our people are the foundation of Delta and are our most important competitive strength. Sharing our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of Delta's culture. With this quarter's financial performance, we accrued another $420 million towards next February's profit sharing. This brings our profit sharing accrual to over $1 billion year-to-date, marking an important and exciting milestone for the Delta team. The great work of our 100,000 people was recently recognized as Delta ranked number 12 overall on Time Magazine's list of The World's Best Companies. We were the only airline to make the top 100 of this prestigious list. And USA Today readers just selected Delta as the Best Airline in the World. Our operational fundamentals remain strong, underscored by Delta's industry-leading position in on-time arrivals and blue sky operational performance that is reliably back to pre-COVID levels. Following a high number of irregular operations days early in the quarter, driven by weather and ATC constraints, we have seen consistent improvement in our operating metrics. In October, we are running a near-perfect completion factor across the mainline system, and we remain number one in on-time arrivals year-to-date. As we're now in the final phase of our recovery, we are making important forward-leaning investments in the health and reliability of our fleet. These maintenance investments will position us to consistently deliver the operational excellence that underpins Delta's brand. Running a high-quality operation is critical to being the airline of choice for our customers and driving a competitive cost structure. Dan will speak more to this shortly. During the quarter, we also made a $150 million strategic investment in Wheels Up, co-investing alongside Certares Management, Knighthead Capital and others. This new investment structure combines the number one premium commercial airline with the travel and tourism expertise of Certares and the turnaround expertise of Knighthead. Delta's relationship with Wheels Up creates a new premium product line for our customers, and I look forward to working with our co-investors and the new management team to unlock the full value of this uniquely positioned business. Turning to our outlook. Travel remains a top purchase priority and our core customer base is in a healthy financial position. We continue to see strength in bookings across Delta's global network, driven by our consumers. Demand for premium experiences, international travel, and increasing business travel further differentiate the trends that Delta is seeing within the industry. We expect our December quarter revenues to be 10% higher than 2022, with a 10% operating margin and earnings of over $1 per share. This brings our expectation for full year earnings to over $6 per share on a double-digit operating margin and free cash flow of $2 billion. Since raising full year guidance over the summer, our revenue outlook has improved, though earnings and cash flow have been impacted by higher fuel and maintenance costs. Revenue for the full year is expected to increase 20% over last year, which was the high-end of our expectations on steady domestic demand and continued strength in international. With strong top line growth and margin expansion, we expect to double earnings year-over-year and deliver a 13% return on invested capital. Our outlook for 2023 keeps revenue, earnings, cash flow and debt reduction on track with our three-year plan, which we issued in December of '21. As we progress through the recovery, we have made meaningful investments in operational reliability and our people. Delta has led the industry in setting the bar for wages, including a new pilot deal and profit sharing. We are seeing the structural step-up in operating costs amid increasing fuel prices, creating some near-term pressure on industry margins. However, I fully expect that the market will adjust to higher costs as it has historically and reestablish equilibrium. With Delta's differentiated premium revenue strategy and strong global network, we will continue to deliver industry-leading profitability and generate robust free cash flow. In closing, the strategy that we shared at Investor Day positions us well for the future. And while the operate -- the environment we operate in continues to evolve in this post-COVID world, our objectives are unchanged as we move into 2024. With our network rebuilt and growth now moderating, optimizing the airline and driving efficiency are significant opportunities. Thank you, again, for your support of our company. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen and to Dan to go through the details of the quarter. Well, obviously, fuel moved an awful lot within just the last couple of months. And it's the volatility of fuel that really hits us hard as compared to the ability to recapture it. I think traditionally, we've seen over a two to three-quarter rise. We have a pretty good success rate at recapturing it. When you think about the strength of the demand environment and the fact that across the board, everyone has -- not just fuel costs are up, but labor rates are increasing and other inflationary pressure, supply chain and maintenance costs are up. Everyone has a similar incentive to continue to be able to recalibrate those pricing -- those market pressures into pricing. So, my outlook is I'm optimistic as we're going into '24. Glen can add his own color there. And Duane, this is Ed, if I could add my perspective. Your point is right. It is related to the OEMs fundamentally. Their inability to produce engines on time, which they're having their own challenges within the supply chain, as well as parts on time. And the one thing that has been a core part of Delta's strength over at TechOps is our ability to go into the used/repair market and acquire assets and repurpose them towards our own needs. That market has largely dried up given all the large rebound in flight activity, which was running at the same time the OEMs have been having and struggling to produce new. So, I think this is something you're going to see across the industry. This isn't just at Delta. And it's one of the constraints we talked about at Investor Day. It's going to keep us all pretty limited in the amount of capacity that we can produce. But I'd put my money on the Delta TechOps team, because they're the best in the business and we'll figure this out. And we know this is a -- while it may hit the expense line, we know this is a long-term asset that's going to pay dividends for years to come. Well, it's probably more a question for Glen than myself. But at my level, as I just said in my last comments, I hear -- my sense would be any capacity that you hear from us in terms of plans or the industry, you should read as somewhat aspirational, because there still are tremendous constraints in the marketplace in terms of delivering that growth. If all goes well and we get all the parts and we get the planes on time and we have the labor ready and ATC is not an issue and fuel prices stay reasonable, yeah, that's what's going to happen. But if you look over the last two to three years, we continue to evolve it. So those are just points-in-time estimates as to what we could do. As to what we actually will be able to do, I think we'll probably, across the board, be a little less than that. Yeah, Dan's comments earlier about -- this is going to be a pivot to optimization is a big deal and maintenance is a part of that. Maintenance unlocks the ability to drive the efficiencies across the enterprise. And we're right in the middle of the planning process. So, we're not trying to dodge the question. We will give you at the typical time at the start of the year what we think we can do. Well, we said on the last call that we anticipated post-Labor Day that we'd see volumes of corporate travel pick up. And indeed, we're seeing that. I think Glen mentioned a couple of sectors, the tech sector and the financial services sector is areas that we're seeing double-digit growth. We have, I'd say, across the board we're seeing increases. The corporate travel has come back, it comes back and then plateaus, comes back and plateaus. And I think you'll see another wave of return. I think a lot of it's being driven by the return to office and getting into the new normal work patterns, which many companies are still sorting out for themselves. But it's healthy to see, and it's one of the distinguishing factors between us and some of the carriers that are on the other end of the fare spectrum. So, one of the many differentiating factors that is enabling us to grow revenue at the pace we are. That's our plan, Mike. I mentioned that we gave that guide in December of 2021, as long as free cash and others and we're on track. Sheila, you should look at our '24 guide that we gave you with our three-year plan. The good news at Delta is that we have all of our labor costs at the new market across the board today in posting those double-digit margins. So, to the extent other carriers need to be increasing their labor cost in future negotiations, they're just going to be chasing the Delta cost. And I think that conversion of industry rates is something we've talked about as kind of another opportunity as we look at trying to make sure we're all running a better business here, and we're not -- we have the same incentives to make sure that our costs are finding their way into our pricing. Hi, Dawn. I've mentioned publicly over the last couple of weeks that we're certainly receiving good feedback from our customers with respect to the changes.

We've received a lot of ideas as to different ways to think about it, and you'll be hearing from us in the coming days. Well, it's the feedback. It's not -- no, we're not seeing any change in trajectory rather on acquisitions or changes in spend levels. Everything continues to stay intact, as Glen, I think mentioned during some of his comments. This is good feedback that we're seeing and candidly, with some of it, I agree with them. No, we don't, Ali. There are discussions, as I've indicated. Right now, we're looking at providing some additional lift to Europe to get people out of Europe. But no, we don't have any plans to be flying into Israel. It's considered unsafe for a U.S. carrier to operate in that airspace currently. Well, thanks for that question. Yes, we're planning on using the entirety of the slot waiver which is, I believe, 10% of our flights into and out of Kennedy and LaGuardia in order to help with the airspace congestion issues that are surrounding those airports right now. So, what we're trying to do is have minimal impact. We will not withdraw from any individual markets. We will thin out some frequencies. We'll put some larger gauge in. And any of the assets that are freed up from New York will get redeployed into other parts of our network for now. But it shouldn't really be very different than the summer. As you know, that's rolled forward from the summer, which we had 10% out, and that's just extending it through the winter. So, you won't see really, I think, any dramatic changes to our schedule versus where we're sitting today. I think the broader problem is not being able to operate in the New York airspace. And so I think we're working very closely with the government to see what we can do to improve the situation there. It was very difficult on our customers this summer, and certainly, we're all hoping for some relief by next summer. We were certainly expecting some feedback. And by the way, some of the feedback we've received is very positive and encourages us not to make any changes. So, there wasn't any one cohort that was silent on the matter. We heard all of the -- a full 360 view of the perspective. But it gave us a chance to sit back, reflect on it. And there were points about the program that I thought that we could make some modifications to. There still will be changes to the program. I've been very clear about that, but we're going to make modifications to what we announced."

            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and dedication during the busy summer travel season. In the September quarter, Delta generated revenue of $14.6 billion, up 13% over prior year. Total unit revenues were down 2.5%, including 1 point of pressure from cargo and MRO. With these results, I expect Delta to deliver a record September quarter unit revenue premium versus the industry, reflecting the continued success of our commercial strategy. Domestic passenger revenue was up 6% over prior year. Performance was steady through the quarter with strength in our coastal hubs, where we are leveraging our leading positions in generational airport bills. International passenger revenue grew 35%, with the Transatlantic and Pacific outperforming our already high expectations. We delivered record margins across all international entities this summer and strength is continuing through the fall. Demand for our premium products is very strong with revenue up 17% over prior year, outperforming main cabin by 5 points. Domestic paid load factor in our first-class cabins was a record as we continue to advance our premium merchandising and upsell capabilities. Delta Premium Select has now been rolled out to over 85% of long-haul flights, and the revenue generation from this product has been above expectations and a key contributor to our record international margins. Business travel continues to steadily improve as corporates continue with return-to-office initiatives. Less recovered sectors like technology and financial services saw double-digit growth during the quarter. Our recent corporate survey indicates continued growth in business demand with a significant majority of companies expecting their travel to stay the same or increase as we move into 4Q and into '24. SME and hybrid travelers are producing margins in line with corporate travelers and demand from these travel remains well above 2019 levels. Total loyalty revenue was up 17% over prior year, with continued strength in our American Express co-brand portfolio. Amex remuneration of $1.7 billion grew approximately 20% over prior year. We expect full year remuneration of close to $7 billion and are focused on reaching our long-term goal of $10 billion. Diversified revenue streams, including premium and loyalty, have generated 55% of revenue year-to-date, reflecting Delta's differentiated positioning to the industry. Turning to the December quarter, we expect total unit revenue to grow 9% to 12% over prior year, bringing our full-year revenues to up 20% over prior year. This is at the high end of our guidance even with a few points less capacity than we had planned for the year, reflecting robust demand for the Delta product. Capacity in the fourth quarter is expected to be up 14% to 15%, implying total unit revenues down 2.5% to 4.5% versus prior year. Domestic and Transatlantic trends are expected to be consistent with the third quarter. Pacific and Latin America unit revenue trends are expected to be modest -- excuse me, expected to modestly decelerate given capacity growth related to China reopening and investment in our LATAM JV. Domestic demand remains steady and initial bookings for the peak holiday periods are strong. The ongoing UAW and actor strikes are having a modest impact and we have incorporated those into our outlook. As we move through the fourth quarter, our Domestic capacity growth moderates and, in the first quarter of 2024, we expect domestic capacity to be flat to slightly down year-over-year. We have reallocated capacity to international leisure where we are expecting strong returns and remain focused on fully restoring our higher-margin core hubs. On international, we are seeing continued demand strength through the winter. The Transatlantic remains very strong, driven by partner hubs and southern European leisure traffic performance. We're closely monitoring the situation in Israel as we will evaluate restarting the flights as the situation stabilizes. In the Pacific, we expect to grow December quarter capacity 40% to 50% as we continue restoring the network. While this level of growth will impact unit revenue, we expect the new flying will be profit accretive. For the year, we remain confident in finishing strong with record profitability across all three international entities. In closing, I'm proud of the revenue performance our teams have delivered, and I'm confident that our integrated commercial strategy will continue to drive industry-leading profitability. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. Sure. I think what we're really excited about is the lengthening of the European travel season. And that has really gone from primarily ending in the summer IATA season, which would be October, now through November, through the holidays, through the New Year. And really now we're only talking about a six to eight-week period that are the doldrums for Europe. So, the bookings, which most people wouldn't have expected, of course, we reduced our schedule in the fall and the winter IATA season. But our year-over-year comps are actually accelerating into the winter as we look into November, December and January. So, I think we're seeing that continuing into the fall and early parts of winter, and we're very excited about that. And we've also, of course, expanded into a lot more Latin leisure this winter than we did last winter, and the advanced demand for that seems very, very robust. So, leisure is still very strong, and even through shoulder and off-peak periods. It's really a reshaping of the demand patterns that we saw last year. And no shock, January and February are not in the northern tier, transcon, east-west markets, barnburner markets, so reallocating those to warmer and sunnier places. So, our total capacity will be up. Domestic capacity will be down slightly. Core hubs will actually be up with more emphasis on warm and sunny places in Latin America and South Pacific. So that's kind of how we're profiling and really optimization of the demand patterns we saw last year going into this winter. Right. I think what domestic strength is really coming from are the premium products domestically. And I'm not going to speak for the other carriers. They all have coming in the next few weeks. But it really hasn't been on domestic portion of international journey, which is de minimis in terms of the variance to what it was last year. Our employments in the Transatlantic are up low double digits, but that only represents 13% of our total travel, so really a de minimis impact to domestic. So, it's really coming from the premium products, and they're doing quite well. As I mentioned, domestic paid first-class load factors are reaching new heights every month. So, very excited about those demand trends and I think that reinforces the strategy we've been working on for the last 10 years to have a differentiated product. No, I think you mentioned it really well. It takes time, and when we have rapid fuel price run-ups, it usually takes a few quarters for that to roll into the industry realized fares. But historically, it's always worked. So, we're looking at history to predict the future, but that's what the history would tell you. Nothing to add other than, yeah, we took a lot of late deliveries. I think our last 75 was produced -- we had the last one ever built. So, some of these planes are not that old and we have them in our fleet and we have -- but as you said, as we get to the end of life of these, towards the end of this decade, we'll be able to really start harvesting the engines, which will really improve the maintenance profile of the fleet. Well, I think what we're very excited about is the success of our Incheon hub with Korean. And that has really even exceeded our expectations. We think it's the best place to connect to get to Southeast Asia from any one of our hubs or as a double connect. So, really trying to leverage that, and we'll have some announcements on continuing to work to increase our capacity next year. But that's really been a lynchpin. South Pacific has been a really great surprise for us, the demand there, really in tune with that same high demand for leisure destinations. So that's been doing very well, as well as Japan. As you know, Japan was closed for a couple years and our Japanese franchise is doing quite well. So, you put the Pacific together, and if you recall, for years, we were telling our investors to hold on. We've got this restructuring coming. We had the wrong airplanes. We were at the wrong airports. And it took us many years to get to where we wanted to be, but we're finally there and we're producing great returns in the Pacific and we're excited about our opportunities moving forward. Oh, China. I didn't say -- China, of course. We went from essentially double daily in Detroit -- double weekly, I'm sorry, in Detroit and Seattle to 10x a week, with Seattle moving to daily and Detroit moving to 3x. So -- and we'll see if there's another wave of this. I think the first thing we have to see is, is there a demand for the capacity that's going into market right now, and we'll keep you abreast of that as we move forward on China reopening. And I would just add a comment. About half of that is run rate of what's in there as we enter the first quarter of next year. So, the real number is half of low-single digits, which is very low-single digits. Well, clearly, I'll start with Los Angeles and the entertainment production strikes that are ongoing. That has had a not insignificant change in the business travel to and from Los Angeles, as well as now the UAW strike, which has curtailed a significant amount of the business in Detroit. As you pointed out, we're very big in both of those sectors. And what I'm really encouraged about is despite those two kind of being things that we should look forward to as positives next year, that our total corporate revenues are still accelerating. So despite those two being a drag on them, and I think hopefully, those are both resolves fairly quickly here and we can get back to a normal business level. But you are right, spot on, that we are probably the most impacted by those two sectors. Well, I'd say that's a very broad question, and clearly, there's been an expansion of international. But if you think about domestic and the volume differential between the number of seats we have every day domestically and the number of seats we have every day to Europe, it would be very hard to track those incremental visits back to people who did not fly domestically, because it's such a small piece of domestic travel in terms of total volumes. And so, while clearly, the spend has been very robust for long-haul in general, we have not seen a diminishing of short-haul either. Well, I'd disagree with you on your premise there that Pacific has been a laggard. Pacific has been quite robust, and I think we indicated these are our record profits in terms of margins and total profitability in the Pacific. And if you look at the Pacific, absent of China, it's been fully restored. So, I think we're very pleased with the demand to the Pacific, and we're -- right now, that's where our capacity is sitting up most in the fourth quarter and where it will be in the first and through next year. And so -- and we're very enthusiastic about the results we're getting there. Well, I think we've called out diverging trends with main cabin. Those have been pretty consistent, though, throughout the recovery is it's been led by premium products and services. So that's not inconsistent between quarters. I think it's actually relatively flat in terms of the -- how much premium is driving there. And geographically, I think what we're really excited about is the coastal hub investments we've made and particularly New York, that's something we're looking for in '24. We see a lot of momentum in the Northeast and New York in particular, as things to look forward to in '24. Right. Mexico has been a great source of strength for us through the last year, and we see continued strength in those Mexican business. And I think when you think about what we read in the press and what you all see and the onshoring and moving factories from Asia down into Mexico, we've seen really an incredible strength in demand from the business sector in Mexico, and that's looking really robust into 2024. And working with Aeromexico now, we really couldn't do much with them. These are things we wanted to do in the past. You see us coordinating with them. We have an ATI joint venture. So, we've been working very closely with them to continue to work on where we see strength and being able to serve those markets better, including the auto sector in Detroit and including Atlanta as a primary gateway to Mexico primary and secondary airports. It's a little over 1 point of ASMs. And we're not going to give an exact number, but it's included -- the revenue hit is included in our fourth quarter guide. So, we've extended at least through October and then we'll see what happens. The reason we're not saying how much exposure there is, is we don't know how this will evolve yet, so we're staying very fluid. But I think we feel very confident that we can get inside of our guidance ranges here with Israel kind of in a worst-case scenario. Sure. I think the most recent data that came out this morning had been flat to up slightly month-over-month, so I don't think that as an industry level, that's a good indication. What we've seen is that actually June was our lowest point in terms of year-over-year average fares and it's moved up for us since then. And that's really driven by the premium side and the success we've had in terms of selling more premium and the fares we're getting for our premium products and services. So yes, at the bottom end, there's some discounting. There's also some fare initiatives. So, it's always a very fluid situation. And right now, I think we're very -- we're calling it stable between third quarter and fourth quarter. Yeah, certain markets are, certain markets are above. So I think the market basket is there -- at the very bottom end, they may be slightly below where they were in '19, but not really. There's always a fare in a market that is below, but in general, they're not. American Express, we, of course, did this with full back-and-forth knowledge, so we did this together with American Express. And if anything, since we've announced it, we've seen a shift to higher premium card acquisitions. So, I think we're well within from that perspective where we thought we'd be."

            "name": "Dan Janki",
            "content": "Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the September quarter, we delivered earnings of $2.03 per share and operating margin of 13.5%. Non-fuel unit costs were up 1.3% year-over-year, and fuel prices averaged $2.78 a gallon, including a refinery benefit of $0.11. We generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, and we invested -- reinvested $1.4 billion into the business. Liquidity ended the quarter at $7.8 billion and adjusted net debt of $20.2 billion. Year-to-date, we've repaid $3.7 billion of gross debt. This is including $1.7 billion of accelerated repayment on our higher cost debt. Our leverage ratio improved to 3 times on a trailing 12-month basis. During the quarter, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BB+, one notch away from investment grade, a recognition of our improving financial foundation. Our capital allocation priorities are reinvesting in the business and improving our balance sheet to investment-grade metrics, with a modest cash return to shareholders through our dividend. Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect non-fuel unit costs to be flat to up 2% on a year-over-year basis. With the exception of maintenance costs, our second-half unit costs are progressing as expected. As we discussed in September, there are three drivers to higher maintenance: first, investment in fleet health; second, expanded work scope on our 757 engine fleet; and third, challenges across the supply chain. On fleet health and reliability, our investments are starting to deliver improved operational performance. Our September metrics were ahead of August, and October is ahead of September. On the 757 engine, a workhorse in our fleet, we're going through a wave of overhauls. The engines we took off wing over the summer required larger work scope and a higher mix of new parts. Looking forward, we are forecasting higher new material consumption rates. On supply chain, the industry continues to face challenges that will take time to work through. Engine and airframe turnaround times remain elevated, driving inefficiency and impacting productivity. We are working closely with our partners and leveraging our deep expertise in TechOps to manage supply chain challenges. Delta has a long heritage of industry-leading operational performance driven by the best TechOps capability in the industry. Operational excellence is central to our brand promise and a key pacing item to drive out inefficiencies. Moving to fuel. Fuel prices have moved higher since July, adding roughly $400 million of expense to our outlook for the second half of the year. We expect December fuel prices to be $2.90 to $3.20 per gallon, with the refinery expected to be roughly breakeven for the quarter. The refinery turnaround is progressing as we planned, and we expect production to resume in mid-November. Based on our December quarter outlook for revenue and cost, we expect earnings of $1.05 to $1.30 per share on a 9% to 11% operating margin. This brings our full-year outlook to earnings to $6.00 to $6.25 per share on double-digit operating margin and free cash flow of $2 billion. We are focused on finishing the year strong, remain committed to delivering industry-leading margin performance, earnings growth and strong cash generation. As we progress through the 2024 planning process, our focus is shifting from restoration to optimization. Over the last two years, we've grown at an unprecedented rate for an airline of our size to restore our network. Growth is normalizing next year, and we expect operational reliability to continue to improve. This will allow us to optimize how we run the airline, reducing operational buffers, and driving out inefficiencies that have resulted from the intensity of the rebuild. Our capacity growth for 2024 will be focused on Delta's areas of strength. Domestically, we are prioritizing our core high-margin hubs, driving connectivity and gauge. Internationally, we are leveraging our best-in-class JV partnerships and increasing the mix of flying on next-generation aircraft. We are executing against the strategy and financial objectives we laid out at our Investor Day with an emphasis on free cash flow, earnings durability, and capital efficiency. In closing, Delta is well positioned to maintain industry leadership operationally and financially. I'd like to sincerely thank the Delta people for everything they do every day. With that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A. Maybe I'll first start with the geared turbofan as it relates more directly to our fleet both. On the neo, we took our deliveries later, so the impact will be modest to minimal. If there are any inspections or things off-wing, it will be in the latter half of 2024 based on the analysis that we've gotten so far from Pratt. We're still waiting on the full analysis related to the 220 fleet, that should be coming later this month, and we will assess that impact appropriately. As it relates to MRO, Pratt is certainly a close partner of ours and an important one as it relates to that third-party capability and we will certainly support their efforts. We're working closely with them on that. We have capacity. It ultimately comes down to the allocation of capacity and availability of material to do the work, but we'll be working with them through the fall and into next year on that. Yeah, certainly we talked about it. We're in the middle of -- Conor, thank you. We're in the middle of the '24 planning process. When you think about maintenance, as Ed talked about, it is a foundational item as it relates to our operational reliability and the investments that we're making here related to fleet health and the work that we're doing on our engines, we're going to stay after here. And that will be with us at least into the first half of next year, and we want to drive that operational reliability. The second part of that is, as you get that operational reliability, that is really what creates the foundation to be able to start to optimize and unlock the cost, investment and inefficiencies that we talked back about at Investor Day, that $1 billion-plus. And as you see that operational reliability continue to improve, our teams will be able to lean more and more into getting those investment buffers out, those inefficiencies that are in every part of our operation. And our teams are working through that as they're building out their operating plan and financial plan for 2024. Yeah, Glen can chime in here too. I think the 757 has been a fleet as we've gone through our restoration that we've characterized as a flexible fleet. And it's one that -- it's certainly a workhorse. The returns are very good related to how we deploy it and fly it within our network. So, we have leaned on it. When you think back of where we might have been 18, 24 months ago, the number that we're flying, we have reactivated more as we continue to see new delivery slide, and we get recalibrated year to year. So, it is one that we've leaned into. And it's one that we will be flexible on as we work through the next three, four, five years in regards to how we deploy it. The wave of overhauls that we started last year and we're doing this year and we'll have the same next year, but that gets us through a heavy wave, that then allows us really very viable engines that the Delta team has always been very good at managing the end of life of an asset. We did it on the 90s, 88s in regards to how you manage those assets and deploy them, but also get the most out of them, whether it's in whole or in the parts and how they're redeployed back in the stream. And we are always working closely then with fleet and maintenance with Glen's team on how to deploy them and get the best returns for them. But those are good returning. It's a great workhorse for our fleet with good returns. As I mentioned earlier, we're still in the middle of our planning process. So, all these pieces are coming together, right, capacity, along with all the things that we've talked about. Regarding the maintenance, we're spending certainly a lot more time on that, given all the moving pieces in the industry and elements that we talked about. No, I'd say it's performing as we expected. We're starting to maybe get back to a little bit more of the traditional seasonality. As we were restoring, it was a little bit different. And if you look at historical patterns, you're only down mid-teens as you go through into the fourth quarter. And that's kind of what we saw as we wrapped up the third quarter here. And so, no. The other element that you have in there is you certainly have -- we've had very friendly policies as it relates to credits and customers have gotten really used to using them. And we think that's obviously long-term beneficial that people have confidence to book and travel, but also consume when they don't travel. And those we've seen very consistent issuance and usage rates on them. Yes. Talk about it at baseline this year, TechOps for geared turbofan engine overhauls would be in the 150, 160 range. We have built capacity to take that to -- up to 350 and continue to discuss long-term -- medium- and longer-term capacity needs with Pratt related to that. So, we talked about it at Investor Day. Very optimistic about our position, not only the heritage that we have and the great expertise that we have in the Delta TechOps team, but our positioning as it relates to being on all the key next-generation platforms, whether that's geared turbofan, whether that's Rolls and also the LEAP engine create a real set of opportunities for us as we think about this business and multiples of what it can be today over the medium- and long-term."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our June quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We please ask that you limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so we can get to as many of you as possible. And after the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions.  Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Bastian : Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. Today, thanks to the great work of our team, we announced record revenue and earnings, reflecting the strength of demand for and momentum of Delta's differentiated brand. During the June quarter, we generated earnings of $2.68 per share, a 90% increase over last year. This marks the highest quarterly earnings result in our history, an achievement that moves Delta beyond recovery and firmly on a great path forward. Revenue was 19% above last year, and we achieved a 17% operating margin. This resulted in operating income of $2.5 billion bringing our operating profit over the last 12 months to $6 billion. We generated over $1 billion of free cash during the quarter, bringing our first half free cash flow to $3 billion. We continue to repay debt and we've reinstated the quarterly dividend, signifying strong execution on our three-year plan and creating value for our owners.  At Delta, transportation is what we do, but experiences are what we deliver, and that's made possible by the exceptional service provided by the industry's best employees. The 90,000 Delta people continue to deliver for our customers during this busy summer season. Over the 4th of July weekend, our people delivered a great operation, completing over 21,000 flights with a 99.5% completion factor and industry-leading on-time performance.  The Delta people continue to be recognized. During the quarter, The Points Guy ranked Delta as the best U.S. airline for the fifth year in a row with consistently high scores for reliability, customer experience, network and loyalty. Sharing our success with our team is core to Delta's culture, and we continue to maintain a position of industry leadership on pay. During the quarter, eligible employees received a 5% pay increase on the 1st of April. And year-to-date, we have accrued over $660 million in profit sharing, in fact more than the total profit sharing paid out for full year 2022. We expect our profit sharing payout next February will continue to lead the industry by a wide margin.  We will always be guided by our values of putting our people and our customers first. They are the driving force of our success. I want to thank our entire team for all they do for Delta and our customers. As I've recently noted, the industry backdrop remains constructive. Air travel demand is strong and the consumer is in good financial shape, particularly the premium consumer base that we target. After years of spending on goods, consumers want to travel. It's their #1 big-ticket purchase priority and they desire premium experiences. No one provides this better than Delta. At the same time, aviation infrastructure is still fragile, and the industry continues to face multiple constraints across the supply chain, aircraft delivery delays and training needs. As a result, we see a significant gap between the supply that is in place and what demand could sustain. And we expect this gap will remain for an extended period of time.  Turning to our outlook. With our first half performance and visibility into the back half of the year, we are raising our full year outlook and now expect earnings of $6 to $7 per share. For the September quarter, demand momentum continues. We expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth of mid-teens operating margin and earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Glen and Dan will provide more details on the components of our outlook. As we move to 2024 and beyond, our path forward is clear. The strategy that we shared at our Investor Day just a few weeks ago positions Delta incredibly well for the future. Our long-term priorities are to run the world's best airline, unlock the power of our brand, transform through digital and deliver long-term shareholder value. Our strategy is underpinned by a commitment to financial performance, with a focus on free cash flow, return on invested capital and earnings durability. We are currently executing ahead of our three-year financial plan and are well positioned to achieve our 2024 earnings target of over $7 per share.  On free cash flow, we introduced a new goal to generate over $10 billion of free cash flow from 2023 to 2025. The strong cash generation will enable us to return our balance sheet to investment-grade metrics, while consistently reinvesting in the business.  In closing, thanks to the outstanding work of our people, Delta continues to set itself apart. We have unique opportunities to grow earnings by leveraging our powerful brand, extending our durable competitive advantages and accelerating our digital transformation.  One other point I'd like to add. While our team has been hard at work returning the level of excellence to the skies that our customers deserve, we have not let go of our commitments to our community. Our team was recently recognized as the #1 corporate blood drive donor with the American Red Cross for the sixth consecutive year with the record units of blood collected. To me, these types of achievements are as rewarding as the great financial and operational results that we are publishing today and what makes this company truly great.  Thank you again. And with that, let me turn the call over to Glen and Dan to go through the details of the quarter.\nGlen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by recognizing our people for their exceptional work during the always challenging peak summer travel period. Thank you. Delta produced record June quarter revenue of $14.6 billion, up 19% over last year. Revenues were ahead of our initial expectations with momentum in June. June 30 was a new record for industry volume and our highest summer revenue day in history.  Total unit revenues were up 1.3% over prior year on improved yield and load factor. Consumer demand strength continues to be the primary driver of our revenue growth. Business travel in the quarter improved year-over-year, primarily driven by international. Overall, international passenger revenue grew 61%, led by the TransAtlantic and Latin America. Domestic passenger revenue was 8% higher on a similar capacity increase. Premium revenue grew 25%, supporting growth in unit revenues and continuing to outperform main cabin. Delta Premium Select is now offered on over 80% of our wide-body fleet and customer response to the product has been terrific with returns outpacing our expectations. Total loyalty revenue was up 20% versus last year, with continued momentum in our American Express co-brand portfolio. Remuneration of $1.7 billion was 22% higher year-over-year with $3.4 billion through the first half. We are firmly on track to exceed the $6.5 billion target for this year and focused on reaching our new long-term goal of $10 billion. Turning to the outlook. For September quarter, we expect total revenue to be similar to 2Q, increasing 11% to 14% year-over-year. On capacity outlook of 16% growth, unit revenues are expected to be 2% to 4% lower. While a deceleration from the June quarter, this is consistent with historic performance between 2Q and 3Q when factoring in the holiday shifts and tougher international comps as we lap the removal of restrictions.  Domestically, demand remains robust, and our core hub rebuild is advancing with growth focused in Atlanta. In our coastal hubs, we are leveraging facility investments and progressively improving margins.  On international, demand strength is continuing, and we are confident in delivering record profitability and margins across all three international entities. System bookings for travel beyond Labor Day are encouraging into the fall. On corporate, we expect steady improvement in demand. Our recent corporate survey shows businesses expect to increase travel in the second half with several of the least recovered sectors conveying optimism or increased travel in the fall. Similar optimism was reflected in Morgan Stanley's recent global corporate travel survey, where respondents indicated travel was expected to grow 9% year-over-year in the second half and 8% into 2024. Delta's capacity growth will normalize to mid-single digits in 2024, enabling us to further improve reliability, optimize the network and drive efficiency to reduce unit costs and support margin expansion.  With an integrated and proven commercial strategy and the best people in the industry, we have significant opportunity ahead.  In closing, I'm so proud of the team for delivering a great first half of the year and excited about the momentum we are building.\nDan Janki : Great. Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. In the June quarter, we delivered earnings of $2.68 per share and operating margin of 17%, ahead of our guidance and a significant improvement over last year. Our nonfuel unit costs were down -- were up 2.4% year-over-year. Fuel prices for the quarter averaged $2.52 per gallon, including a refinery benefit of $0.04. We generated operating cash flow of $2.6 billion. And after reinvesting $1.6 billion into the business, free cash flow was $1.1 billion.  Liquidity ended the quarter at $8.8 billion, with adjusted net debt of $19.8 billion. During the first half of 2023, we repaid $3 billion of debt, including $1.4 billion of early repayments with a focus on our high-cost debt. For the year, we expect to repay over $4 billion of gross debt resulting in interest costs over $100 million lower than our initial expectations. Our leverage ratio improved to 3.2x on a trailing 12-month basis and this is down from 5x at the end of the year. During the quarter, we announced the reinstatement of a quarterly dividend, opening the shareholder base to yield focused investors.  Now moving on to guidance for the September quarter and full year. We expect mid-teen operating margins and earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share in the September quarter. Nonfuel unit costs have reached an important inflection point. We expect nonfuel unit costs to decline 1% to 3% year-over-year in the September quarter. This is consistent with our expectations for a low single-digit decline in the second half of 2023.  Rebuild costs are substantially behind us and capacity is returning through our most efficient core hubs. July marks our peak ASM production for the year and capacity seasonally declining in the fall and winter. As our capacity growth normalizes, it enables our operating teams to drive efficiency. We have over $1 billion opportunity from initiatives across the enterprise as hiring and training slow and our workforce gains experience. Improving our nonfuel unit cost is an enterprise-wide priority, and remains within our control. On fuel, we expect the September quarter fuel price to be between $2.50 to $2.70 per gallon. This includes a $0.04 refinery benefit. As part of our routine maintenance done once every five years, the refinery will undergo a turnaround in mid-September that will continue through November. With production offline during this period, we expect the refinery to breakeven during the second half of the year. With our second quarter performance and our third quarter outlook, we now the full year earnings to be $6 to $7 per share and an operating margin greater than 12% and free cash flow of $3 billion. Delivering these financial results also positions us to reduce our leverage ratio to 3x by the end of the year and significantly improve our return on invested capital. For the full year, we expect our return on invested capital to be approximately 14%, a 6-point improvement versus last year.  In closing, we're ahead of plan in 2023. And in 2024, we remain confident in delivering earnings per share of over $7 a share while generating over $4 billion of free cash flow and achieving our investment-grade metrics. As we shared at Investor Day, we see significant opportunities beyond 2024 as we build on the strength of the core airline, leverage our existing capital base to grow high-margin revenue streams and delivered durable earnings through a full economic cycle. We couldn't do this without the hard work of our employees who are delivering for our customers every day. I'd like to thank the Delta people for all they do. Now with that, I'd like to turn it back to Julie for Q&A.\nJulie Stewart : Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Helane Becker from TD Cowen.\nHelane Becker : I just have a point of clarification and then my question. The point of clarification is, Dan, did you just say that you're going to do more than $4 billion in free cash flow for this year, and is that an official guidance update? And then my question really has to do with as you think about your digital footprint and the technology investments that you have to make, how are you thinking about what's customer facing versus what's back office and the cost to invest in both?\nDan Janki : I'll start with the first one. And as it relates to free cash flow for this year, 2023, at Investor Day, we raised our guidance from $2 billion to $3 billion. $3 billion is the number for this year. And we expect as part of our three-year plan, we said that we'd be at $4 billion or greater in 2024. And Ed talked about the three-year collective plan that we're working towards, which is over $10 billion for the cumulative period of '23 through '25.\nEd Bastian : And Helane, on your question regarding digital, I think I mentioned a couple of weeks ago at our Investor Day, I consider this one of the most important activities and investments that we are making in the company. We are -- on the one hand, we're far along. We've been working on this for a while, but clearly, we have a lot to go as well. And most of the work that we are doing is clearly within the run rate or CapEx run rate. I don't anticipate any increase in capital as a result of that. If anything, a lot of the work that should start sunsetting by the end of \u201924 in terms of moving our infrastructure to the cloud will start to dissipate and that'll create even more capacity within the existing spend level for digital.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Stanley.\nRavi Shanker : Glen, you commented on the fall. Any chance you can expand on those comments a little bit more, especially U.S. domestic? I think you spoke about corporate a little bit. I think most folks are focused on what the demand looks like beyond the summer, which is obviously very, very strong right now?\nGlen Hauenstein : Right. We see strong demand both domestically and internationally as far as we can see. And we can see internationally, probably to the end of summer, IATA in October and see very, very strong results there. And domestically, we've seen some very positive trends. I think that was one of our increases in the June quarter, we\u2019ve talked about in the earnings, and we've seen some inflection in terms of closing build, where it's starting to look better as we move later in the summer, and we're very encouraged with those trends as well.\nRavi Shanker : Great. And as a follow-up, maybe to Ed or Dan, kind of you're going to hit your long-term EPS target of $7 at the high end of your guide this year, which obviously is very, very impressive. But I think what's the next bar here, what's the next step? Are you looking at $10? And obviously, just give us kind of the long-term outlook and the beyond Analyst Day in terms of the initiatives out there. But what are we thinking in terms of kind of financial targets for the long term?\nEd Bastian : Hi, Ravi. We're going to -- we need to get to $7 first before we talk about what's next. And\u2026\nGlen Hauenstein : We're only halfway through a three year plan. \nEd Bastian: Yes. We've already just increased the current year guide. We will most likely some point next year, hopefully the first half of the year, have our updated long-term plan conversation where we can talk about where we see the long-term financial targets for the company going. But right now, we want to focus on -- we're in a very busy part of the year. We want to deliver a great operation for our customers. And we'll talk more over the course of the next 12 months as to how far the EPS can get. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Catie O'Brien from Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien : So yesterday we had a pretty sizable month-over-month step-down in airfare CPI. I did some quick analysis that shows that, that data isn't very correlated to the industry's RASM or yield historically, but it doesn't feel quite right to fully ignore a data point like that. I guess did you see anything similar to that step down in your own data, maybe on domestic or lower end of the field - fare spectrum? I know you're guiding to a decel in 3Q versus 2Q better than what myself and the Street was forecasting but a deceleration, is it as simple as that? Or are there flaws on how that CPI data is calculated where it's relevant to Delta?\nGlen Hauenstein : Well, the methodology is a sample of a sample. And so we're not seeing the same. And it's a different data point than what we have and what we're seeing. So I'll leave it to that. If you want the definition which I think explains why there may be a big variance to what you're seeing, we can forward that to you.\nEd Bastian : Yes. One thing for the call because I know a lot of people have this question. Just think about where we were last May and June, demand had just turned on in a crazy hot way. Supply was really low. People didn't care where they were going or how much they spent, they just wanted to go somewhere. And we're seeing fares up 30%, 40%, 50%, particularly in a lot of the domestic markets where they could travel to. That's obviously not sustainable. And that's the comp set that you -- it's in the data that's being compared to as well. So we're now at a much more normalized level of stability in the fare environment, particularly domestically. And I think it's a really poor comparison to try to draw what that one CPI print was off of a survey of the survey and how that relates to Delta for the future.\nCatherine O'Brien : I very much agree. Maybe one more for Dan too. Dan, you're well on your way on your $3 billion free cash flow target, I understand fuel has been volatile to see how the ATL shapes up in the back half of the year. But if your free cash flow was to come in better, would there be upside to that $4 billion plus debt paydown you spoke to? Is that at all capped by your level of prepayable debt? Or you're happy to prepayment penalties that means you take down that interest cost burn faster and tee-up the business?\nDan Janki : Certainly. Any -- as we've talked about paying down debt is a priority here, generating cash, paying down debt, those two are head-to-head. Any additional cash that we generate, we certainly would pay down debt with it. I think you'll see us -- even in the back half of this year, we will be over that $4 billion that I talked about of gross debt paydown. And our team has been Ken and the team out there have been really good about doing what we've done year-to-date. We've done actually through open market repurchase and other activities, and we're just going to continue to work down the debt. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg : Yes. Can I -- I just want to touch back on, I think, Ed, you talked about summer being strong, maybe Glen also added to it, for international, not summer but international being strong extending into the fall. And I did note that for many of your seasonal European markets, it does look like you have extended the season into November, December instead of restarting in April and May. It seems like they are coming back in early March, maybe even February. What is -- is there a secular shift that is going on here where you're just picking up more and more international, it's a longer season. Maybe these markets are becoming more mature on one hand? And my follow-up would be, when you look at your domestic, what's the load factor points that are being driven by international? Is it 5 points of load, 8 points of load factor that are on a connecting itinerary?\nGlen Hauenstein : Sure. On the seasonality, we have extended a lot of those seasonal deferrals because of the way we did maintenance in the past, and we're adjusting that. I think what we want to accomplish for most of our markets is at least a full season of summer IATA, which is, of course [Indiscernible]. And so you've seen a lot of extensions into that period. We've seen travel patterns emerging post-pandemic to Europe that tend to see that Southern Europe has a longer season than it has had historically. And so we're taking advantage of that, while Northern Europe does have a much shorter season. And so trying to work both of those issues to create a network that produces the best returns on a year-round basis. And we have a lot of improvement. We're going to have a really great summer, and our goal is to have a great winter as well. And so that's what we are doing.  And on the domestic portion of international journey, I think in the last call, we said it was about 10. And I think that's about where it's staying. And again, that depends whether you call domestic portion of international journey to the long hauls or to the short haul, including the Caribbean and Mexico. And so the number I'm giving you includes the Caribbean and Mexico, which is really part of North America. If you took the truly long hauls out of that, it would be a lower number.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu : You have raised the margin guidance for the year for 12% for 2023, that implies 100 basis points of improvement in the second half. How much of that is coming from fuel and nonfuel cost? You mentioned that down to 1 to 3 points. Is it all just cost benefits? Or are you assuming some continued yield strength in the Atlantic like we were just talking about and benefit from domestic hub restoration?\nDan Janki : Yes. When you think about it, first half to second half, a couple of things to think about, certainly nonfuel is the biggest driver there. We were up in the first half, going to be down low single digits in the back half. That's your real benefit related to that on that basis. The other benefit you have is when you think about the halves, you really have a second quarter, pretty similar when you have a fourth quarter versus a first quarter performance in that half performance. And when you put all that together, that also drives that margin performance first half versus second half.\nSheila Kahyaoglu : Great. And then if I could just ask a follow-up on cash. The CapEx assumption, does it still remain 5.5? And should we think about the skyline at 43 aircraft for the year, given you mentioned some delivery constraints?\nDan Janki : Yes. We've held our -- even as we updated our free cash flow for the year from 2 to 3, we've held our CapEx at 5.5. We're still holding right around that 42, 43 aircrafts for the year, that can always move around as it has the year by a view.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe.\nScott Group : Glen, you said that the third quarter RASM would have been in line with seasonality if you make a few adjustments. Can you just maybe give a little bit color on the adjustments you're sort of thinking about? And then just -- I don't know if I heard it yet. So maybe just share domestic versus international RASM expectations for the third quarter?\nGlen Hauenstein : Yes. On the seasonality between 2Q and 3Q, we had some of the days shipped. The outbound 4th of July was in 2Q, which are some of the best days of the summer, as we pointed out in this. So if you take that and adjust for that, we're about 1 point off to the normal and hopefully we can make that 1 point up in a quarter. But if you look back to last year, I think that\u2019s the more important comp when you see the deceleration from 1 to a midpoint of minus 3. Last year's international RASM went between 2Q and 3Q was up 16 points as the restrictions, travel restrictions went off in 2Q so that had that big surge in demand on a limited capacity last year. So I think we're really -- we're looking at a 2Q to 3Q that\u2019s really right in line with what we think the seasonal norms are.\nScott Group : Okay. Helpful. And then, Dan, I don't know if I'm getting a little ahead of myself, but when I think about the inflection in CASM in the back half of this year, that's still with a pilot deal. So as we look ahead to next year -- I know you've already said down low single digits, but strong in thinking that the first half is going to be better than that?\nDan Janki : Well, the pilot deal you have throughout this year. And as we've talked about, you have every quarter, and it's about 4 points along with the wage increase overall for all for the entire Delta workforce that came through for the year. When you think about next year and you think about what we talked about is low single digits, really, we've out there with mid-single-digit capacity growth. You get that benefit. And then as you get into the scale and efficiency and rebuild, that is another element that we'll benefit from. So we get efficiency. You won't have the repeat of the rebuild that we had this year. And then the offset to that is the continued movement as it relates to a couple of points when you think about pilots and wages into next year. And that's what gets you to low single digits is the general framework associated with the drivers there.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker : So Glen, does your third quarter RASM guide assume any share pickup at the expense of any competitors that may be alternating their distribution strategy or rethinking their Northeast footprint? \nGlen Hauenstein : There's two questions in there. And the first question is, I think our third quarter is based on what we see in the second quarter and moving forward, and there haven't been any changes to distribution strategies in the quarter. So I'd tell you, it's what we see today just moving forward from there. And on the cessation of the NEA, listen, we compete well in New York. We've had a long history of competing well in New York, and we're really confident how that -- as it evolves, that we'll be able to continue to win in New York, which has been our long-term strategy for 10 years and we are not deviating from that. So\u2026\nJamie Baker : And on the corporate survey work, any shifts in how individual sectors are responding? For example, is the messaging from your tech customers unchanged from what it's been, that sort of thing?\nGlen Hauenstein : I think we pointed out that the laggards are the ones that are most encouraged as you get to the fall. And I think Ed has always said, and I agree with him 100%, that your propensity to travel is directly related to whether or not you're in the office. And as we see more and more offices trying to reopen or reopening and people are trying to get back into the -- corporations trying to get people back in the office, I think that's a great constructive backdrop for us as we head into the fall and the post Labor Day period.\nEd Bastian : I'd like to add one additional comment there. All these comparisons in terms of corporate travel, unfortunately, are still all made to 2019. And we lose sight of the fact that our economy is 20% plus or minus larger than it was in 2019. So what you're talking about actually is there is a lot of room to improve for corporate America on travel. And I think that's part of the underpinning why we think there's going to -- you're going to continue to see some steady improvement here this fall, and you're hearing it from the travel managers as well.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham : Just to follow up on Jamie's question. So you do sound a bit better on corporate travel recovering in the back half. But I'm just curious -- like just to be clear, is that in your guide? Or is that additional upside if those things do come in a little better?\nGlen Hauenstein : We have a continued slow and steady build in our guide. If it was to accelerate beyond what it's been doing, that would be upside. \nConor Cunningham : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the domestic RASM, I think you guys are going to be one of the best in the industry, if not the best. I was just curious if you could unpack what was the outperformance? Is that purely just your core hub rebuild and coastal investment kind of coming in at higher unit revenues? Just trying to understand maybe back to Catie's question, like the differences between regular economy seats and what Delta kind of offers out there?\nGlen Hauenstein : Well, I think we said that it's been continuing to be led by premium products and services. And our domestic rebuild has as we've spoken about earlier, initially focused on the coastal gateways and now -- right now moving back into the core. And so we have the lapping of the investments we've made in the coastal gateways coming out of COVID now producing very good returns for us as well as the investments in the core, which, of course, come in at higher unit revenues. So I think it's a combination of those two factors moving together. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Just curious on the international capacity. It's been growing at a faster pace in domestic given that that's where the restoration has been to a greater degree. I was curious how long you expect international capacity growth to kind of continue to outpace domestic here?\nGlen Hauenstein : Well, as capacity trends down, as we head out of restoration into a more normal growth cycle, I think you will see a pretty even distribution between domestic and international as we head into '24. We really haven't given any guidance on that yet. And internally, we haven't even completed our '24 plan yet, but I would expect it to be very similar split between domestic and international.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And if I might just ask on the Latin entity, Glen, just could you provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing, especially broken out between kind of near international, which recovered first in kind of the South America markets?\nGlen Hauenstein : Yes. Of course, we've been really thrilled with the results with LATAM and the improvements in our South America revenue base. So South America is moving at a great clip. And again, the short and medium haul, Latin America markets were some of the first to recover, and they're still continuing to be strong, but not posting those great -- giant gains they did in the early part of the recovery. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : On your TransAtlantic JV, I just wondered if there's any new approaches, maybe any learnings through the pandemic that will change the way you operate going forward versus maybe what you've done in the past? How much each side flies, things like that?\nGlen Hauenstein : We have a great TransAtlantic joint venture. It was the first one and the most integrated and one that we think has huge customer benefits. And it's always evolving. And that's the great -- and we have great partners that want it to evolve. So we're continuing evaluating how we approach the marketplace together. You've seen some swaps in the fall from things that we have flown to the things that our partners are now going to fly. And so I don't think there are any huge headline changes, but it's always evolving.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Okay. And then maybe just for my follow-up on seasonally shaping capacity. It looks like nominally ASMs peak in July. They stepped down a little bit in August and they stepped down a little bit again in September, which seems to make some sense. Not all your peers are kind of taking that approach. In some cases, August is bigger than July, et cetera. So is this just getting back to kind of your view on normal seasonality? Or is this more operationally driven?\nGlen Hauenstein : No, absolutely. It's more normal seasonality. Of course, in the South, you have the schools going back earlier and earlier. This year, for example, schools go back in Georgia, the 1st of August. And so we're through the summer travel period in the South where the North tends to go back after Labor Day. So if you look more granularly, you'd see the Southern, the Atlanta hub and the South trends down in the second half of August, and we keep the Northern tier operating a little bit longer and then pull that down after Labor Day. So we are actually getting much more back to where we want to be as we say we come out of restoration to a much more normal seasonality.\nJulie Stewart : We'll now go to our final analyst question.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski : Glen, so I guess -- and I know we're not guiding to 4Q here, but implied revenue in 4Q maybe feels a little bit softer from 3Q for the full year, just given your full year guidance, sorry. Is that conservatism around the off-peak periods like we were talking about back in 1Q with booking trends that have just changed and cancel fees that -- or the lack of cancel fees that have changed consumer behavior?\nGlen Hauenstein : I just think we know the least about 4Q right now. And so as we get towards the end of this quarter, I think we'll have a much better view that we could share with you on the October call.\nBrandon Oglenski : Okay. I appreciate that. But I guess can you talk maybe structurally, how are you approaching the off-peak period differently than earlier this year?\nGlen Hauenstein : Well, I think what we have left to go in the year is we have to get through Labor Day, of course, and I think we have good visibility through Labor Day. Then we have October, which is historically a very strong travel month for business. So we'll see how that unfolds. And then we have the holidays, which are the peak holidays. That's all that's really left in the year, and we have good bookings for the holidays. We have good visibility on that. So it's really going to depend on -- and I think it's potential upside, as you said earlier, it does business travel more, return more than we expect. And if so, then we have some good upside for the back half of the year. If not, we're going to trend where we see today.\nJulie Stewart : We'll wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions.\nTim Mapes : Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you would please just remind the members of the media about queuing up for the call? And we'll jump in with members of the media.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider : I wanted to ask about -- Viasat yesterday reported it had a deployment issue with its recently launched satellite. Just curious if that causes any potential problems for Delta's free WiFi plans, either for the current -- what's currently in place or the future rollouts and if you have to consider any kind of alternatives?\nEd Bastian : Obviously, we were disappointed as Viasat was with the news yesterday, but we're committed long term and they will get through this. We see no meaningful impact to our -- to where we stand currently with our domestic capacity, and we're working closely with them to make sure the domestic performance maintains what we've been seeing, which has been great. I think if anything, it may cause a delayed rollout on some of the international markets. But it's too early to tell.\nAlison Sider : And I also wanted to see if Delta has any view on some of the proposals that Congress is considering around simulator training counting towards pilot experience hours? Is that something you do favorably or if Delta would have any plans to offer a training program of its own if the Senate proposal goes through or how you're thinking about that?\nPeter Carter : Alison, it's Peter. Delta has not weighed in on those particular proposals. We think the way pilots are trained is obviously incredibly effective, and it's important to maintain those type of training requirements. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Also wondering if Delta has any view on raising the pilot age potentially to 67, if not beyond that, at some point? And then also with the affirmative action ruling from last month, is Delta reviewing or looking at its current DEI policies and you're expecting any changes that has to make?\nEd Bastian : Leslie, I'll take the first. No, we don't have a point of view on that. I think that's something that within the pilot community, there's a lot of different opinions around. So we'll stand by and observe and watch how that discussion unfolds. Peter will touch on the affirmative action.\nPeter Carter : Yes. Hello, Leslie. I will tell you at Delta, we continue to be fully committed to our DE&I objectives. And also, we don't have an affirmative action for it in Delta. We always hire the very best.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein : With your expectation that the corporate travel recovery is going to slowly continue during the fall, will that step up enough that it will make up for any decline in leisure travel after schools return? Or do you not expect to see that historical dip in leisure travel this fall?\nGlen Hauenstein : Well, I'll just give you a view of what we do see because domestic demands, of course, come a little bit later on. But for international travel post Labor Day, we see very robust leisure demand continuing through the October period. So combine that with -- hopefully, we'll get some upside surprise on the increase in business, but we're not really counting on anything more than what we see today. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Slotnick from TPG.\nDavid Slotnick: I wondered if Delta has any contingency planning or views surrounding the legislation, potentially effect in credit card fees and charges. I know that would probably have a significant impact on your MX revenue? Are you planning for if that works, it plays through? Or having a couple of that or anything else?\nPeter Carter: Hey, Dave, it\u2019s Peter. Obviously that's a legislation that we're watching carefully.

            "content": "Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. Today, thanks to the great work of our team, we announced record revenue and earnings, reflecting the strength of demand for and momentum of Delta's differentiated brand. During the June quarter, we generated earnings of $2.68 per share, a 90% increase over last year. This marks the highest quarterly earnings result in our history, an achievement that moves Delta beyond recovery and firmly on a great path forward. Revenue was 19% above last year, and we achieved a 17% operating margin. This resulted in operating income of $2.5 billion bringing our operating profit over the last 12 months to $6 billion. We generated over $1 billion of free cash during the quarter, bringing our first half free cash flow to $3 billion. We continue to repay debt and we've reinstated the quarterly dividend, signifying strong execution on our three-year plan and creating value for our owners.  At Delta, transportation is what we do, but experiences are what we deliver, and that's made possible by the exceptional service provided by the industry's best employees. The 90,000 Delta people continue to deliver for our customers during this busy summer season. Over the 4th of July weekend, our people delivered a great operation, completing over 21,000 flights with a 99.5% completion factor and industry-leading on-time performance.  The Delta people continue to be recognized. During the quarter, The Points Guy ranked Delta as the best U.S. airline for the fifth year in a row with consistently high scores for reliability, customer experience, network and loyalty. Sharing our success with our team is core to Delta's culture, and we continue to maintain a position of industry leadership on pay. During the quarter, eligible employees received a 5% pay increase on the 1st of April. And year-to-date, we have accrued over $660 million in profit sharing, in fact more than the total profit sharing paid out for full year 2022. We expect our profit sharing payout next February will continue to lead the industry by a wide margin.  We will always be guided by our values of putting our people and our customers first. They are the driving force of our success. I want to thank our entire team for all they do for Delta and our customers. As I've recently noted, the industry backdrop remains constructive. Air travel demand is strong and the consumer is in good financial shape, particularly the premium consumer base that we target. After years of spending on goods, consumers want to travel. It's their #1 big-ticket purchase priority and they desire premium experiences. No one provides this better than Delta. At the same time, aviation infrastructure is still fragile, and the industry continues to face multiple constraints across the supply chain, aircraft delivery delays and training needs. As a result, we see a significant gap between the supply that is in place and what demand could sustain. And we expect this gap will remain for an extended period of time.  Turning to our outlook. With our first half performance and visibility into the back half of the year, we are raising our full year outlook and now expect earnings of $6 to $7 per share. For the September quarter, demand momentum continues. We expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth of mid-teens operating margin and earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Glen and Dan will provide more details on the components of our outlook. As we move to 2024 and beyond, our path forward is clear. The strategy that we shared at our Investor Day just a few weeks ago positions Delta incredibly well for the future. Our long-term priorities are to run the world's best airline, unlock the power of our brand, transform through digital and deliver long-term shareholder value. Our strategy is underpinned by a commitment to financial performance, with a focus on free cash flow, return on invested capital and earnings durability. We are currently executing ahead of our three-year financial plan and are well positioned to achieve our 2024 earnings target of over $7 per share.  On free cash flow, we introduced a new goal to generate over $10 billion of free cash flow from 2023 to 2025. The strong cash generation will enable us to return our balance sheet to investment-grade metrics, while consistently reinvesting in the business.  In closing, thanks to the outstanding work of our people, Delta continues to set itself apart. We have unique opportunities to grow earnings by leveraging our powerful brand, extending our durable competitive advantages and accelerating our digital transformation.  One other point I'd like to add. While our team has been hard at work returning the level of excellence to the skies that our customers deserve, we have not let go of our commitments to our community. Our team was recently recognized as the #1 corporate blood drive donor with the American Red Cross for the sixth consecutive year with the record units of blood collected. To me, these types of achievements are as rewarding as the great financial and operational results that we are publishing today and what makes this company truly great.  Thank you again. And with that, let me turn the call over to Glen and Dan to go through the details of the quarter. And Helane, on your question regarding digital, I think I mentioned a couple of weeks ago at our Investor Day, I consider this one of the most important activities and investments that we are making in the company. We are -- on the one hand, we're far along. We've been working on this for a while, but clearly, we have a lot to go as well. And most of the work that we are doing is clearly within the run rate or CapEx run rate. I don't anticipate any increase in capital as a result of that. If anything, a lot of the work that should start sunsetting by the end of '24 in terms of moving our infrastructure to the cloud will start to dissipate and that'll create even more capacity within the existing spend level for digital. Hi, Ravi. We're going to -- we need to get to $7 first before we talk about what's next. And... Yes. We've already just increased the current year guide. We will most likely some point next year, hopefully the first half of the year, have our updated long-term plan conversation where we can talk about where we see the long-term financial targets for the company going. But right now, we want to focus on -- we're in a very busy part of the year. We want to deliver a great operation for our customers. And we'll talk more over the course of the next 12 months as to how far the EPS can get. Yes. One thing for the call because I know a lot of people have this question. Just think about where we were last May and June, demand had just turned on in a crazy hot way. Supply was really low. People didn't care where they were going or how much they spent, they just wanted to go somewhere. And we're seeing fares up 30%, 40%, 50%, particularly in a lot of the domestic markets where they could travel to. That's obviously not sustainable. And that's the comp set that you -- it's in the data that's being compared to as well. So we're now at a much more normalized level of stability in the fare environment, particularly domestically. And I think it's a really poor comparison to try to draw what that one CPI print was off of a survey of the survey and how that relates to Delta for the future. I'd like to add one additional comment there. All these comparisons in terms of corporate travel, unfortunately, are still all made to 2019. And we lose sight of the fact that our economy is 20% plus or minus larger than it was in 2019. So what you're talking about actually is there is a lot of room to improve for corporate America on travel. And I think that's part of the underpinning why we think there's going to -- you're going to continue to see some steady improvement here this fall, and you're hearing it from the travel managers as well. Obviously, we were disappointed as Viasat was with the news yesterday, but we're committed long term and they will get through this. We see no meaningful impact to our -- to where we stand currently with our domestic capacity, and we're working closely with them to make sure the domestic performance maintains what we've been seeing, which has been great. I think if anything, it may cause a delayed rollout on some of the international markets. But it's too early to tell. Leslie, I'll take the first. No, we don't have a point of view on that. I think that's something that within the pilot community, there's a lot of different opinions around. So we'll stand by and observe and watch how that discussion unfolds. Peter will touch on the affirmative action."

            "name": "Glen Hauenstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by recognizing our people for their exceptional work during the always challenging peak summer travel period. Thank you. Delta produced record June quarter revenue of $14.6 billion, up 19% over last year. Revenues were ahead of our initial expectations with momentum in June. June 30 was a new record for industry volume and our highest summer revenue day in history.  Total unit revenues were up 1.3% over prior year on improved yield and load factor. Consumer demand strength continues to be the primary driver of our revenue growth. Business travel in the quarter improved year-over-year, primarily driven by international. Overall, international passenger revenue grew 61%, led by the TransAtlantic and Latin America. Domestic passenger revenue was 8% higher on a similar capacity increase. Premium revenue grew 25%, supporting growth in unit revenues and continuing to outperform main cabin. Delta Premium Select is now offered on over 80% of our wide-body fleet and customer response to the product has been terrific with returns outpacing our expectations. Total loyalty revenue was up 20% versus last year, with continued momentum in our American Express co-brand portfolio. Remuneration of $1.7 billion was 22% higher year-over-year with $3.4 billion through the first half. We are firmly on track to exceed the $6.5 billion target for this year and focused on reaching our new long-term goal of $10 billion. Turning to the outlook. For September quarter, we expect total revenue to be similar to 2Q, increasing 11% to 14% year-over-year. On capacity outlook of 16% growth, unit revenues are expected to be 2% to 4% lower. While a deceleration from the June quarter, this is consistent with historic performance between 2Q and 3Q when factoring in the holiday shifts and tougher international comps as we lap the removal of restrictions.  Domestically, demand remains robust, and our core hub rebuild is advancing with growth focused in Atlanta. In our coastal hubs, we are leveraging facility investments and progressively improving margins.  On international, demand strength is continuing, and we are confident in delivering record profitability and margins across all three international entities. System bookings for travel beyond Labor Day are encouraging into the fall. On corporate, we expect steady improvement in demand. Our recent corporate survey shows businesses expect to increase travel in the second half with several of the least recovered sectors conveying optimism or increased travel in the fall. Similar optimism was reflected in Morgan Stanley's recent global corporate travel survey, where respondents indicated travel was expected to grow 9% year-over-year in the second half and 8% into 2024. Delta's capacity growth will normalize to mid-single digits in 2024, enabling us to further improve reliability, optimize the network and drive efficiency to reduce unit costs and support margin expansion.  With an integrated and proven commercial strategy and the best people in the industry, we have significant opportunity ahead.  In closing, I'm so proud of the team for delivering a great first half of the year and excited about the momentum we are building. Right. We see strong demand both domestically and internationally as far as we can see. And we can see internationally, probably to the end of summer, IATA in October and see very, very strong results there. And domestically, we've seen some very positive trends. I think that was one of our increases in the June quarter, we've talked about in the earnings, and we've seen some inflection in terms of closing build, where it's starting to look better as we move later in the summer, and we're very encouraged with those trends as well. We're only halfway through a three year plan. Well, the methodology is a sample of a sample. And so we're not seeing the same. And it's a different data point than what we have and what we're seeing. So I'll leave it to that. If you want the definition which I think explains why there may be a big variance to what you're seeing, we can forward that to you. Sure. On the seasonality, we have extended a lot of those seasonal deferrals because of the way we did maintenance in the past, and we're adjusting that. I think what we want to accomplish for most of our markets is at least a full season of summer IATA, which is, of course [Indiscernible]. And so you've seen a lot of extensions into that period. We've seen travel patterns emerging post-pandemic to Europe that tend to see that Southern Europe has a longer season than it has had historically. And so we're taking advantage of that, while Northern Europe does have a much shorter season. And so trying to work both of those issues to create a network that produces the best returns on a year-round basis. And we have a lot of improvement. We're going to have a really great summer, and our goal is to have a great winter as well. And so that's what we are doing.  And on the domestic portion of international journey, I think in the last call, we said it was about 10. And I think that's about where it's staying. And again, that depends whether you call domestic portion of international journey to the long hauls or to the short haul, including the Caribbean and Mexico. And so the number I'm giving you includes the Caribbean and Mexico, which is really part of North America. If you took the truly long hauls out of that, it would be a lower number. Yes. On the seasonality between 2Q and 3Q, we had some of the days shipped. The outbound 4th of July was in 2Q, which are some of the best days of the summer, as we pointed out in this. So if you take that and adjust for that, we're about 1 point off to the normal and hopefully we can make that 1 point up in a quarter. But if you look back to last year, I think that's the more important comp when you see the deceleration from 1 to a midpoint of minus 3. Last year's international RASM went between 2Q and 3Q was up 16 points as the restrictions, travel restrictions went off in 2Q so that had that big surge in demand on a limited capacity last year. So I think we're really -- we're looking at a 2Q to 3Q that's really right in line with what we think the seasonal norms are. There's two questions in there. And the first question is, I think our third quarter is based on what we see in the second quarter and moving forward, and there haven't been any changes to distribution strategies in the quarter. So I'd tell you, it's what we see today just moving forward from there. And on the cessation of the NEA, listen, we compete well in New York. We've had a long history of competing well in New York, and we're really confident how that -- as it evolves, that we'll be able to continue to win in New York, which has been our long-term strategy for 10 years and we are not deviating from that. So... I think we pointed out that the laggards are the ones that are most encouraged as you get to the fall. And I think Ed has always said, and I agree with him 100%, that your propensity to travel is directly related to whether or not you're in the office. And as we see more and more offices trying to reopen or reopening and people are trying to get back into the -- corporations trying to get people back in the office, I think that's a great constructive backdrop for us as we head into the fall and the post Labor Day period. We have a continued slow and steady build in our guide. If it was to accelerate beyond what it's been doing, that would be upside. Well, I think we said that it's been continuing to be led by premium products and services. And our domestic rebuild has as we've spoken about earlier, initially focused on the coastal gateways and now -- right now moving back into the core. And so we have the lapping of the investments we've made in the coastal gateways coming out of COVID now producing very good returns for us as well as the investments in the core, which, of course, come in at higher unit revenues. So I think it's a combination of those two factors moving together. Well, as capacity trends down, as we head out of restoration into a more normal growth cycle, I think you will see a pretty even distribution between domestic and international as we head into '24. We really haven't given any guidance on that yet. And internally, we haven't even completed our '24 plan yet, but I would expect it to be very similar split between domestic and international. Yes. Of course, we've been really thrilled with the results with LATAM and the improvements in our South America revenue base. So South America is moving at a great clip. And again, the short and medium haul, Latin America markets were some of the first to recover, and they're still continuing to be strong, but not posting those great -- giant gains they did in the early part of the recovery. We have a great TransAtlantic joint venture. It was the first one and the most integrated and one that we think has huge customer benefits. And it's always evolving. And that's the great -- and we have great partners that want it to evolve. So we're continuing evaluating how we approach the marketplace together. You've seen some swaps in the fall from things that we have flown to the things that our partners are now going to fly. And so I don't think there are any huge headline changes, but it's always evolving. No, absolutely. It's more normal seasonality. Of course, in the South, you have the schools going back earlier and earlier. This year, for example, schools go back in Georgia, the 1st of August. And so we're through the summer travel period in the South where the North tends to go back after Labor Day. So if you look more granularly, you'd see the Southern, the Atlanta hub and the South trends down in the second half of August, and we keep the Northern tier operating a little bit longer and then pull that down after Labor Day. So we are actually getting much more back to where we want to be as we say we come out of restoration to a much more normal seasonality. I just think we know the least about 4Q right now. And so as we get towards the end of this quarter, I think we'll have a much better view that we could share with you on the October call. Well, I think what we have left to go in the year is we have to get through Labor Day, of course, and I think we have good visibility through Labor Day. Then we have October, which is historically a very strong travel month for business. So we'll see how that unfolds. And then we have the holidays, which are the peak holidays. That's all that's really left in the year, and we have good bookings for the holidays. We have good visibility on that. So it's really going to depend on -- and I think it's potential upside, as you said earlier, it does business travel more, return more than we expect. And if so, then we have some good upside for the back half of the year. If not, we're going to trend where we see today. Well, I'll just give you a view of what we do see because domestic demands, of course, come a little bit later on. But for international travel post Labor Day, we see very robust leisure demand continuing through the October period. So combine that with -- hopefully, we'll get some upside surprise on the increase in business, but we're not really counting on anything more than what we see today."

            "content": "Great. Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. In the June quarter, we delivered earnings of $2.68 per share and operating margin of 17%, ahead of our guidance and a significant improvement over last year. Our nonfuel unit costs were down -- were up 2.4% year-over-year. Fuel prices for the quarter averaged $2.52 per gallon, including a refinery benefit of $0.04. We generated operating cash flow of $2.6 billion. And after reinvesting $1.6 billion into the business, free cash flow was $1.1 billion.  Liquidity ended the quarter at $8.8 billion, with adjusted net debt of $19.8 billion. During the first half of 2023, we repaid $3 billion of debt, including $1.4 billion of early repayments with a focus on our high-cost debt. For the year, we expect to repay over $4 billion of gross debt resulting in interest costs over $100 million lower than our initial expectations. Our leverage ratio improved to 3.2x on a trailing 12-month basis and this is down from 5x at the end of the year. During the quarter, we announced the reinstatement of a quarterly dividend, opening the shareholder base to yield focused investors.  Now moving on to guidance for the September quarter and full year. We expect mid-teen operating margins and earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share in the September quarter. Nonfuel unit costs have reached an important inflection point. We expect nonfuel unit costs to decline 1% to 3% year-over-year in the September quarter. This is consistent with our expectations for a low single-digit decline in the second half of 2023.  Rebuild costs are substantially behind us and capacity is returning through our most efficient core hubs. July marks our peak ASM production for the year and capacity seasonally declining in the fall and winter. As our capacity growth normalizes, it enables our operating teams to drive efficiency. We have over $1 billion opportunity from initiatives across the enterprise as hiring and training slow and our workforce gains experience. Improving our nonfuel unit cost is an enterprise-wide priority, and remains within our control. On fuel, we expect the September quarter fuel price to be between $2.50 to $2.70 per gallon. This includes a $0.04 refinery benefit. As part of our routine maintenance done once every five years, the refinery will undergo a turnaround in mid-September that will continue through November. With production offline during this period, we expect the refinery to breakeven during the second half of the year. With our second quarter performance and our third quarter outlook, we now the full year earnings to be $6 to $7 per share and an operating margin greater than 12% and free cash flow of $3 billion. Delivering these financial results also positions us to reduce our leverage ratio to 3x by the end of the year and significantly improve our return on invested capital. For the full year, we expect our return on invested capital to be approximately 14%, a 6-point improvement versus last year.  In closing, we're ahead of plan in 2023. And in 2024, we remain confident in delivering earnings per share of over $7 a share while generating over $4 billion of free cash flow and achieving our investment-grade metrics. As we shared at Investor Day, we see significant opportunities beyond 2024 as we build on the strength of the core airline, leverage our existing capital base to grow high-margin revenue streams and delivered durable earnings through a full economic cycle. We couldn't do this without the hard work of our employees who are delivering for our customers every day. I'd like to thank the Delta people for all they do. Now with that, I'd like to turn it back to Julie for Q&A. I'll start with the first one. And as it relates to free cash flow for this year, 2023, at Investor Day, we raised our guidance from $2 billion to $3 billion. $3 billion is the number for this year. And we expect as part of our three-year plan, we said that we'd be at $4 billion or greater in 2024. And Ed talked about the three-year collective plan that we're working towards, which is over $10 billion for the cumulative period of '23 through '25. Certainly. Any -- as we've talked about paying down debt is a priority here, generating cash, paying down debt, those two are head-to-head. Any additional cash that we generate, we certainly would pay down debt with it. I think you'll see us -- even in the back half of this year, we will be over that $4 billion that I talked about of gross debt paydown. And our team has been Ken and the team out there have been really good about doing what we've done year-to-date. We've done actually through open market repurchase and other activities, and we're just going to continue to work down the debt. Yes. When you think about it, first half to second half, a couple of things to think about, certainly nonfuel is the biggest driver there. We were up in the first half, going to be down low single digits in the back half. That's your real benefit related to that on that basis. The other benefit you have is when you think about the halves, you really have a second quarter, pretty similar when you have a fourth quarter versus a first quarter performance in that half performance. And when you put all that together, that also drives that margin performance first half versus second half. Yes. We've held our -- even as we updated our free cash flow for the year from 2 to 3, we've held our CapEx at 5.5. We're still holding right around that 42, 43 aircrafts for the year, that can always move around as it has the year by a view. Well, the pilot deal you have throughout this year. And as we've talked about, you have every quarter, and it's about 4 points along with the wage increase overall for all for the entire Delta workforce that came through for the year. When you think about next year and you think about what we talked about is low single digits, really, we've out there with mid-single-digit capacity growth. You get that benefit. And then as you get into the scale and efficiency and rebuild, that is another element that we'll benefit from. So we get efficiency. You won't have the repeat of the rebuild that we had this year. And then the offset to that is the continued movement as it relates to a couple of points when you think about pilots and wages into next year. And that's what gets you to low single digits is the general framework associated with the drivers there."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our March quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta\u2019s performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take analyst questions. We ask you please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, so we can get to as many of you as possible.

Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. 2023 is off to a strong start for Delta with record advance summer bookings, the launch of free Wi-Fi and continued recognition as the industry leader, not only by our customers but by Fortune, Cirium and the Wall Street Journal. During the March quarter, we generated earnings of $0.25 per share on revenue that was 45% above last year and a record for the March quarter. Delta\u2019s operating income was $550 million, a more than $1 billion improvement year-over-year, bringing our trailing 12-month operating profit to nearly $5 billion. We generated close to $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, reflecting robust demand for summer travel. Better-than-expected cash generation enabled us to accelerate that reduction, moving us closer to our goal of returning to investment-grade metrics. All-in, a very solid performance by our team in the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. Delivering safe and reliable service remains our top priority, and no airline does this better than Delta. I\u2019d like to thank our teams for all they do for our customers each and every day. The dedication, professionalism and hard work of Delta\u2019s 90,000 people worldwide are the foundation of our company. Sharing our financial success with our people has always been an important part of our DNA. Our industry-leading profitability in 2022 enabled us to pay out more than $550 million in profit sharing in February. More profit sharing than the rest of the industry combined. And we\u2019re looking forward to larger payouts next year as we expect to deliver significant earnings improvement. We also rewarded eligible employees with a 5% pay increase on the 1st of April, and received strong ratification from our pilots on the new four-year contract, providing well-deserved increases for all of our people. The performance of our people and the momentum of our brand was recognized when Delta was ranked number 12 overall of Fortune\u2019s World\u2019s Most Admired Company list, a remarkable statement about the resiliency of our company, given the pandemic challenges of the last few years. Our brand is built on a foundation of service and operational reliability, and we are committed to delivering the level of service our customers expect as we ramp operations for the coming summer season. The operating teams have done a great job getting ready and we are planning to grow June quarter capacity 17% over last year to meet strong customer demand. This growth is, though, a couple of points below our initial plan to fully restore capacity this summer, as we focus on delivering the best operation in the industry and remain prudent in our capacity restoration. As I mentioned at last December\u2019s Capital Markets Day, aviation infrastructure is still fragile. But collectively, we\u2019re working to ensure resiliency as we manage constraints around the supply chain, aircraft delivery delays and training needs. I want to commend the FAA for collaborating with the industry to help improve the customer experience in New York by temporarily relaxing minimum flight requirements given ATC staffing challenges. Turning to our outlook. With solid first quarter performance and visibility into the strength of summer travel demand, we are confident in our full year guidance for revenue growth of 15% to 20% year-over-year, earnings of $5 to $6 per share and free cash flow of over $2 billion, the three main guideposts we shared with you last December. For the June quarter, we expect to deliver the highest quarterly revenue in our history, a 15% operating margin and EPS of $2 to $2.25 a share. Our forecast operating profit of $2 billion matches Q2 of 2019, demonstrating that the earnings power of this franchise is intact. Glen and Dan will provide more details on the components of our outlook. As we look to our upcoming Investor Day in June, we will outline the long-term opportunities that we\u2019ve cultivated through years of investment, building on our industry leadership position and further enhancing our long-term financial profile. One focus area will be innovation and digital technology, where we continue to grow our leadership position. Increasingly, it\u2019s one of the reasons customers are choosing Delta with significant growth in direct bookings and higher engagement through our digital channels. We have reached an important step in our digital transformation with the rollout of fast, free, high-quality Wi-Fi, which has been a tremendous success. We began this effort several years before the pandemic, and it has required significant investment and resources to achieve. In addition, this month, we began rolling out Delta Sync for SkyMiles members, which will unlock a more personalized customer experience in the air and on the ground. When customers join the SkyMiles loyalty program, it enables us to deepen our trusted relationship and create stronger brand preference. As we\u2019ve rolled out fast, free Wi-Fi as well as other benefits, new SkyMiles memberships have accelerated at a record pace. Growth has been particularly strong among younger customers with a record 3 million total enrollments during the quarter. Thanks to the size and growth of our loyalty program, the value of our Amex co-brand card portfolio continues to reach new highs and leading brands are joining our consumer ecosystem, creating further opportunities. I look forward to discussing this and more about how Delta is transforming the customer experience on June 27th in Atlanta. Hope you all can join us that day. In closing, the industry backdrop remains constructive, and we are well positioned to grow earnings and cash flow in 2023, 2024 and beyond. Delta continues to set itself apart. We are on our way to transcend the industry with our leading consumer brand and deliver financial outcomes that create significant long-term value for our owners. Thank you again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed. I\u2019d like to start by thanking our employees for the difference that they make every day. We delivered record March quarter revenue at $11.8 billion, 14% higher than 2019 on 2% less capacity. Total unit revenues, or TRASM was 16% higher than the same period in 2019. These results include approximately 1-point impact from flying less capacity than initially planned. Consumer demand was well ahead of pre-pandemic levels and drove strength in domestic and international travel. Business travel improved in the quarter with small and medium businesses ahead of \u201819 levels while managed corporate travel showed steady progress led by international. Diverse revenue streams, including premium and loyalty, generated 56% of total revenue in 1Q. Premium revenue growth continued to outpace the main cabin. Total loyalty and revenue grew 28% versus the prior year, with continued momentum in our American Express co-brand portfolio. We saw card spend up more than 20% year-over-year. This supported a record $1.7 billion of remuneration from American Express during the quarter, keeping us on track to deliver over $6.5 billion in 2023. Throughout the recovery, travel behaviors and patterns continue to evolve. The hybrid workplace is blurring the lines between business and leisure trips while the removal of change fees has increased customer flexibility, allowing them to book trips earlier. This dynamic was more pronounced in the March quarter, and so we are continuing to adopt and see opportunities to further optimize our revenue management approach to these new travel behaviors in future months. We expect June quarter revenue to be up 15% to 17% year-over-year on capacity that is 17% higher. This implies unit revenues will be flat to down 2% compared to prior year, including a couple of point impact from higher international mix as well as lapping record cargo revenues. For comparison to the March quarter, the midpoint of this outlook is a 3-point sequential improvement in total unit revenues versus 2019, driven by improvements in both, domestic and international. Moving forward, we are sunsetting the comparisons to 2019 and returning to year-over-year metrics. Domestically, we are growing our seats mid-single digits over last year with our core hub rebuild beginning to take hold in June and accelerating through the fall. On international, we are excited with the momentum we\u2019re seeing and expect record revenues and profitability for the summer travel season. To meet increasing demand, we are growing our international seats by more than 20% in the June quarter compared to prior year, and we already have about 75% of our bookings on hand. In the transatlantic, we\u2019re seeing strong demand on our largest ever summer schedule. Our Amsterdam hub performance continues to improve, and we are pleased with the outlook for all of our new markets. In Latin America, momentum is continuing to build. The breadth of Delta\u2019s long-haul network to South America continues to improve as we begin to leverage our partnership with LATAM. Pacific demand is accelerating, and we expect record margins meaningfully ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Our multiyear restructuring efforts in the Pacific are paying dividends, and our partnership with Korean Air is performing extremely well, providing us future growth opportunities. In closing, consistent execution of our long-term commercial strategy is supporting industry-leading margin performance and demonstrating the resiliency of our business model. The long-term investments we\u2019ve made in our fleet, global network and technology pave the way for future growth and margin expansion. Thank you. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dan to talk about the financials.\nDan Janki: Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the March quarter, we delivered earnings of $0.25 per share and a 4.6% operating margin in line with our guidance. Our nonfuel costs were 4.7% higher than the first quarter of 2022. It is including a 1-point impact from lower capacity, primarily due to winter storms. Fuel price for the quarter averaged $3.06 per gallon, this including a $0.25 benefit from our refinery, which continues to provide a unique hedge to fuel volatility. Our operating cash flow was $2.9 billion. That was the highest March quarter result in Delta\u2019s history. After investing $1.1 billion back into the business, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow. Strong cash generation enabled $1.2 billion of debt reduction. This including accelerated debt repayment of $700 million with an average interest rate of 7%. Liquidity ended the quarter at $9.5 billion and adjusted net debt of $21 billion. Our leverage ratio improved from 5 times at year-end to 3.9 times at the end of March on a trailing 12-month basis. We now expect to complete our full year planned debt reduction in the first half of the year, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunistic debt repayment. Over the last year, we accelerated more than $3 billion in debt reduction, targeting our highest cost debt and reducing our interest expense. Recognizing this progress we are making, S&P and Fitch both upgraded their outlook for our ratings. Returning to investment-grade metrics is a key priority. We remain focused on reducing net debt and achieving our targeted 2 to 3 times leverage ratio in 2024, while continuing to consistently reinvest in the business. Now, moving to guidance for the June quarter. On fuel, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be $2.55 to $2.80, including a $0.10 to $0.15 contribution from the refinery. While lower than that last year, I\u2019d note that fuel prices remain volatile and are still approximately 30% higher than in 2019. On nonfuel, we expect unit cost to be 1% to 3% higher than prior year. For the first half, we expect to grow capacity 17%, approximately 2 points less than our initial expectations, with a similar 2-point impact expected on our unit cost. More than three months into the year, our absolute costs are tracking as expected. Higher labor rates are fully incorporated across the mainline and regionals. Inflation is stabilizing and we are in the final stages of our rebuild. By the end of June, aircraft reactivations will largely be complete and training is starting to step down with a third of our pilots moving into production. As I outlined on our call in January, core maintenance is higher year-over-year in the first half of the year. We expect it to decline in the second half, resulting in a 5-point year-over-year progression in our unit cost from the beginning of the year to the end. Secondly, achieving scale while restoring efficiency are Delta\u2019s largest CASM levers. The pace of capacity restoration remains the primary level. In summary, we are confident in our year-over-year decline in the second half and expect a 10-point improvement in our unit cost progression as we progress through the year. Running the most reliable operation in the industry is key to delivering a competitive cost structure and underpins our industry-leading margins. Combined with our outlook for revenue, we expect the June quarter operating margin to be 14% to 16% and earnings to be between $2 and $2.25 per share. With a quarter behind us and the visibility we have in the summer, we have higher confidence in our full year guidance for significant improvement in earnings and free cash flow. We are reaffirming our full year guidance for operating margins of 10% to 12%, earnings of $5 to $6 per share and more than $2 billion of free cash flow. And we remain on track to earn over $7 per share in 2024 with more than $4 billion of free cash flow. So in closing, I\u2019d like to thank the Delta people for the elevated service they provide to our customers every day. Our people will always be the delta difference. Now with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Julie for Q&A.\nJulie Stewart: Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: I have one question, but it\u2019s a two-part sort of pronged revenue question maybe for Glen or Ed. There is this ongoing debate about the pace of revenue growth and whether it\u2019s moderating in domestic versus international. I know, Glen, you gave some color on that. But you did also talk about a shift in the booking curve, which I think you referred to as being pronounced. One, can you dig into that a little bit deeper and maybe how that could be having some impact on the data? And then, number two, when I think about Delta and your network, I mean, you do have the most exposure to the industrial heartland. And you look at the ISM number over the last 5 months, we\u2019ve been contracting, right? The manufacturing sector may now be in a recession and that\u2019s a part of the world that you have a decent amount of exposure to. What both corporate and/or discretionary that flow through sort of Detroit mini -- is there any additional color that you can -- that you\u2019ve seen that you can sort of elaborate with respect to that comment?\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure, Mike. Let me try and answer the first one. And I\u2019d like to just mention that on Tuesday, we had our second highest cash sales day ever. Seasonality that\u2019s starting to decline, usually those occur earlier in the year. So I think that just points to the strength of the core demand for our products and services, be it domestic or international, just at a combined level, the number two sales day in our total history occurring this week. And so, behind that backdrop of really strong consumer demand across the board, I think what we\u2019ve seen is travel patterns changing and shifting a little bit more than they did pre-pandemic. We had a lot of stability, pre-pandemic, and we\u2019re adjusting here into what I would call a new normal, and we\u2019ll figure out exactly where that lands over time. What that meant in the quarter was materialization rates actually went down a bit throughout the quarter and materialization rates to us is book to flown ratios. Normally just a couple of points, accelerating a couple of points more than usual, probably attributing that to the flexibility without change fees that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. And so, that\u2019s really easy to accommodate as we just turn up slightly our overbooking levels to make sure that we capture the higher load factors. And then secondly is the booking trends inside of 30 days. And we were knowing that inside of 30 days was declining, and the strong demand was just outside of 30 days. And so the demand is very strong, and it\u2019s a matter of how many you let through the gate at what point in time. And we had, for example, wanted to go into month 3 to 4 points ahead. We\u2019re tiling that up a little bit to be more like 5 to 6 points ahead, given that the combination of materialization rates, which has some impact on that, of course, but also where consumers are booking. I think those are just RM tactics that we\u2019re using to adjust to this new demand set. And I don\u2019t think that it indicates that there is any softness in core demand strength. So I think we feel really confident in the summer and what we have on the books and what we\u2019re seeing real time in terms of demand. And so, I feel very good about that. Relating to industrial recession, we don\u2019t really see that. As a matter of fact, if you look at Minneapolis and Detroit, they\u2019re actually ahead. Now they\u2019re the least restored of our hubs right now, particularly in Detroit is one tick below the rest of the system. But you\u2019ve also had rationalization in competing hubs in the region. And so, they\u2019re willing to say, okay, well, maybe some of the industrials. These hubs are not point-to-point like Boston or New York, they\u2019re really the connecting flow within the U.S. So, there\u2019s opportunity as we continue to restore those networks to put more flow on the network. Not 100% resilient -- reliant, of course, on Detroit, mostly relying on the flow traffic that flows over to Detroit. So I think what we\u2019re seeing, we see strength in all of our core hubs. Our core hubs are less restored than our coastal gateways, and that\u2019s one of the upsides that we have for the rest of the year as we move through the year. And they\u2019re producing incredible returns and incredibly strong demand sets.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JP Morgan.\nJamie Baker: Glen, as we think about the swing year-on-year in the second quarter from domestic strength last year to international momentum this year. Do you recall what the domestic portion of the international journey contributed to last year\u2019s second quarter domestic revenue, what it\u2019s likely to contribute this year and what the normal second quarter contribution used to be?\nGlen Hauenstein: Domestic portion of international journey is right around 10% of domestic travel. So, it\u2019s not that big of an impact. And last year was probably 7% or 8%, and this year is probably going to be 8% or 9%. So I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s significant changes in that. The summer, of course, is highly reliant on the local demand since we sit in very big local markets for our international marketplace, so New York and JFK being the largest in particular. And generally, if you can take locally, you prefer local because yields are higher. So -- and JFK is largely 80% local for international travel. So maybe let\u2019s rely on Atlanta, of course, has more flow on it, but still a large local component.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Helpful. And as we assess the, I guess, achievability of the second quarter revenue guide, could you disclose what percent of revenue is already booked by entity? International tends to book further in advance. So, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s your highest confidence. Are we 70% booked internationally and 40% domestically, 60-30?\nGlen Hauenstein: We are 75% internationally, and we\u2019re significantly less than that domestically.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Glen, please don\u2019t drop the mic. A question for you. Can you walk us through why revenues maybe came in at the lower end of the 1Q range, and talk to whether there\u2019s anything in there that was trailing off through the quarter? I ask this because the market is really struggling with whether Delta is limping or leaping into the June quarter. And any color on what drove the source of weakness in 1Q and whether that may carry forward in the 2Q could help a lot. Thanks.\nGlen Hauenstein: Clearly, I think we talked a little bit about the two components. One was we had 1 point less of capacity, driven by some weather events and recovering from those weather events. The second is the fact that the lower materialization rates in the RM systems adapting to those that we couldn\u2019t do it real time because you have to see if they\u2019re stable before you adjust for them. So I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at in the second quarter. And as we mentioned in the -- versus \u201819, we have positive momentum in 1Q to 2Q, both domestically and internationally. So, I think we\u2019re feeling -- I know there\u2019s a lot of anxiety about domestic demand for the summer, but we don\u2019t share that anxiety.\nDavid Vernon: And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. You mentioned sort of corporate domestic or core domestic sort of corporate bookings is 85% recovered. Is the expectation -- can you talk a little bit bigger picture about how you expect that to trend throughout the rest of this year based on the research work you\u2019ve done based on what your bigger corporate flyers are telling you right now and the level of certainty that maybe they have on some of those plans?\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. Our corporate travelers are telling us they expect that to continue to accelerate. The -- we are not counting that in our -- we\u2019re counting a stable 85% revenue, 75% of traffic.\nDavid Vernon: That\u2019s in the 2Q guidance?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Maybe switching gears a little bit. It looks like capacity in 2Q is a couple of points lower than you were thinking back in December. Where is that? Is that mostly coming out of the domestic market? And along those lines, as you go into the summer months, how do you kind of think about the four entities? I know you gave a little color on international and domestic for 2Q, but just a little bit further in.\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes. It\u2019s being driven by our desire to ensure that we have an industry-leading operational -- and what we saw in the March quarter was we had a little bit longer than we would like in recovering from weather events. So, we can -- as weather shortfalls were and they were primarily in the domestic narrowbodies that we want to ensure we have all the right resources behind them because we know we\u2019ll have weather events in the summer as we always do. So, it was just a bit of a step back, not really by demand, but really by supply, our supply was a little bit more constrained than we had hoped. And that should provide us the ability to provide whatever level we want of capacity in the fall depending on how the global environment shapes up.\nSavi Syth: Understood. And then maybe a question for Dan. There seems to be less kind of cost of prices this year. Could you talk a little bit about what\u2019s leading to that better predictability?\nDan Janki: We\u2019re just deeper into the restoration. And I think as we\u2019ve gotten deeper in, we continue to have better visibility to that. We have all the labor dialed in as we\u2019ve talked about, you\u2019re seeing stabilization in the regionals. That was 1 that we chased last year. As it relates to third-party suppliers, the peak of contract inquiries and repricing was heavy in fourth quarter of \u201821 begin in the first half of \u201822. And if you look at those requests, coming in, they\u2019ve dropped up meaningfully for that. So, I think you\u2019re starting to see that stabilization in the inflation component of third-party and coming in very in line with what we expected from that perspective. So just better visibility. I think we\u2019re deeper into the restoration. So operationally, arms on it related to that. So, our absolute cost visibility is good at this point in time. Certainly, the unit cost metric, as we\u2019ve talked about, is impacted by the ultimate capacity that we fly.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Most of the sort of short-term revenue questions have been asked. But just on corporate, can you talk a little bit about maybe the changes, if any, that you saw since mid-March, any commentary on financial services or banking in particular? And then relatedly, there\u2019s so much -- there\u2019s so many headlines around technology and layoffs, and I know you\u2019re less levered to that. But could you just contrast how recovered is the technology vertical from a corporate travel perspective relative to other industries that you serve?\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure. Technology is one of the least recovered. Financial services is actually showing some momentum, surprisingly. And so, I think as we think about our geographic pull, one of the things we\u2019re excited about is New York was really not back last year. And of course, we have a lot of exposure to New York, and we\u2019re seeing really good -- New York not only as an origin market improvement, but New York is a destination market improvements as well. So, that should bode well for us for the summer. And again, I think what\u2019s really interesting is more of the forward lines between the yields of corporate and high-yield leisure that didn\u2019t exist back pre-pandemic 5 years ago. And so where we\u2019re not selling those premium seats to corporates, we are selling them at near corporate rates to high-end leisure customers, and that\u2019s really providing a very nice insulation for us.\nEd Bastian: Duane, one thing I\u2019d add to that is that you\u2019re seeing corporately a pretty significant push to get workers back in the office. And we have seen a high correlation between the opening of offices with the return of corporate travel, principally with consultancies, advisers, people being available to take meetings. And so, that underlies the strength. And I think you\u2019re going to continue to see that over the course of the year is going to be, I think, a good tailwind for us on the corporate revenue front.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then just on -- for my follow-up, with respect to the core hub restoration and maybe getting back some of your RASM premium to the extent that you see that as a driver. Where are we on core hub restoration and sort of what part of the calendar as we think about the balance of 2023, would you expect that to really contribute? And thanks for taking the questions.\nGlen Hauenstein: No, thanks for that question because I think it\u2019s very important. I think when we outlined back in December, core restoration is one of the highlights of 2023 that is distinctive about Delta\u2019s. What we didn\u2019t say is when that occurred in \u201823 and kind of a mea culpa on that because in the first half of the year, that really wasn\u2019t what happened. It starts right around now and it goes through the fall. So that should be really a key driver for us as we move through the back half of the year, both on cost and revenue.\nDan Janki: Yes, revenue and costs. Yes.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: So, the range of outcomes on revenue is still pretty wide for the full year. I was just curious if you could unpack the high and low assumptions. Presumably, you have pretty good visibility on the first half. Just curious on the swing factors as you think about the second half for your revenue.\nGlen Hauenstein: I think we see the same reports that all everybody sees. I think Ed outlined very well that we think there is still remaining pent-up demand from the $300 billion that was not spent on airline travel during the pandemic. So, we\u2019ll see how that plays out in the fall, and we have a lot of flexibility in terms of what we offer as we get out of the summer. What we\u2019re saying today is we are confident through the summer. And then, we\u2019ll take another look as we get closer to it, do we see any demand trends changing. I think what we hear from the marketplace, everybody is looking for those lines. We don\u2019t see them right now. So we would tell you if we did. And if we do see them, we\u2019ll make the adjustments that would be required for the fall.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then maybe following up on Savi\u2019s earlier question. Dan, I think you mentioned that you have 2 points lower capacity in the first half, which is certain CASM ex. And I don\u2019t think you changed your 2023 capacity and cost guidance. So, just curious like what the offsets might be, or is the first half impact just going to impact the full year from that level? Thank you.\nDan Janki: Yes. We -- sure, Conor. We had the 2-point impact on capacity. That had a 2-point impact on unit cost. We\u2019re still sitting here in April. So, we have a lot of the year to play out as it relates to capacity. And as we progress through the year and set that that will ultimately determine it. If you went through the year and you made that up, you pick that up. If not, it would have a corresponding impact on unit cost as you progress. But as we talked about on the point with Savi is our visibility to absolute cost is clear and better than it\u2019s been in the restoration. And as you go through the back half, you get that inflection point, the points that we\u2019ve talked about with core maintenance stepping down from being a headwind to a 2- to 3-point benefit. And as Glen talked about with the restoration of the hubs you start to pick up scale and efficiency associated with that. And the rebuild steps down. So that gives us confidence in the progression ultimately will be where on a unit basis, where do you fall out as it relates to capacity impact that has. But as you know here, we\u2019re focused on running a great operation and the alignment is to the primary financial outcomes, which is margins, earnings and cash.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Catherine O\u2019Brien from Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Maybe just a follow-up [Technical Difficulty] just a clarification on that 10-point cost progression. Is March quarter up just under 5%? Does that mean we should be modeling December quarter to be down 5%, or how should we be thinking about that 10 points? And then that improvement -- that\u2019s driven by cost, you have really good visibility on, right? So timing of maintenance events, I think you said that\u2019s a 5-point swing and then some benefit from planned training decelerating. If you could just talk a little bit more about that that would be great.\nDan Janki: Yes. That\u2019s right. You think about the 10-point progression from beginning to end, and that would be down mid-single digits from that perspective. The maintenance is the 5 points -- 4 to 5 points related to first half being up to back half being down. The other drivers there is rebuild, those transition rebuild costs. We incur about 80%, 85% of them in the first half of the year, really aircraft reactivations, it\u2019s training, it\u2019s hiring components. Those step down and I mentioned that in the prepared remarks, pilots being one and the crews being one of them. We\u2019re putting 600 pilots into production. So, it\u2019s really the first time over the last 18 months that are actually -- school house will step down here during the second quarter. And then the other components are the efficiency, scale and efficiency that starts to step in as you get the core rebuild, about 5 points of aircraft utilization, and we just get a better use of our facilities and our people as we progress through the back half.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Great. Makes a lot of sense. Then maybe one for Glen. Can we just dig into the corporate sales international ex-China, 90% recovered? Can you just walk us through how that looks from your different cabins? Are your business class cabins running at a similar level restored? And then by type of trip, are you still seeing a similar number like out and back Road Warrior type trips as you were pre-COVID?\nGlen Hauenstein: Great question. Most of the business travel internationally is in the front cabin. So, I\u2019d say 75% to 80% is in the front cabin. So, that\u2019s fueling front cabin strength. I\u2019d say all of our premium products in the long-haul international markets are doing incredibly well. This is really the first year we have premium economy at scale. About 85% of our flights long-haul now have -- that will be 100% by next year. But -- so we\u2019re flying this for the first time with ubiquity in the international arena, and we\u2019re seeing amazing results on the premium economy count at the Premium Select. So, very excited about the rebound in international travel, both leisure as well as business. Now, what was the second part of your question? I\u2019m sorry.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Yes. Just like on the type of trip, are you still seeing those kind of like shorter Road Warrior out-and-back type trips to the same degree, or are you seeing the length of trip change at all here?\nGlen Hauenstein: We are seeing the length of trip change and Road Warriors are not staying one day, day trips are down. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to harness here as we move forward is normally, we would use AP, advanced purchase as one of the big key drivers for separating our business versus leisure. Now it\u2019s really stay. And even with stay, it\u2019s not as defined as it used to be. So, those are the fences we\u2019re trying to rearrange how we think about our pricing systems and fencing. We don\u2019t want to get too much into how we think about that. But clearly, AP is one that we\u2019re leading out of.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: I got just a couple of near-term follow-ups and then a longer-term question. So, the 70% booked for Europe and significantly less domestically, how does that compare with pre-pandemic sort of levels entering Q2? And then, the overall unit revenue flat to down slightly, is there a difference domestically, internationally on the year-over-year trend?\nGlen Hauenstein: We are -- 75% is about where we would expect to be at this point in time for international long haul. Domestic, we are within a couple of points where we would expect to be. It\u2019s really the -- how much you want to take in advance. And when you think about 90 days, it\u2019s not all 90 days. Inside of 30 days, we want to be ahead. So, that\u2019s the difference. Second question, I\u2019m sorry.\nScott Group: There was just like the RASM for the unit revenue flat to down slightly for Q2, is there a difference domestic, international?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes. It\u2019s a mix difference. International is up significantly and domestic is relatively flat versus year-over-year.\nScott Group: And then, Ed, you -- on the prepared comments, you said you expect strong earnings growth again in 2024. Is that a market macro comment, or are there company-specific tailwinds that you have that you can share? Just like when I look at the second half guide, right, it\u2019s sort of flattish year-over-year. So, what changes in \u201824 to get back to strong earnings growth, anything company-specific?\nEd Bastian: Well, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re inferring on the second half guide. We really haven\u2019t given a second half guide. I think you\u2019re just backing into the overall -- we haven\u2019t updated our full year. I think it\u2019s too early in the year to give an updated \u201823 guide, but if you look at our \u201824 guide, it\u2019s to get to north of $7 a share. And that\u2019s the trajectory we\u2019re on. And to -- one comment I made, which I haven\u2019t heard anyone pick up on, for the second quarter forecast we are forecasting to be already at $2 billion of operating profit, which is the same amount that we were at the second quarter of \u201819. It\u2019s quite a statement in terms of how the recovery is going and you consider that at a much higher fuel price, it\u2019s at much higher labor rates, and it\u2019s also with the system not restored. So, I think all of that gives you continued opportunities. We\u2019re looking to take the nonfuel CASM down in the back half of the year, which is going to be a meaningful tailwind for us. We don\u2019t see revenue declines in terms of demand strength. I know everyone has their own point of view on that, and we don\u2019t have a great crystal ball beyond the next four or five months. But from what we\u2019re hearing from our travelers, what we\u2019re hearing from the market, what we\u2019re hearing from agencies, this is a very different recovery trajectory than other consumer businesses are experiencing.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: So, the $11 billion air traffic liability, pretty staggering number here versus the $6 billion to $7 billion that you had in 2019. I assume it\u2019s this number that gives you a lot of the confidence in your outlook. But I guess my question, just curious if any of the dynamics within the APL have changed today versus a pre-pandemic where maybe a lower percentage gets translated into revenues because of no change fees or something else? Just curious there.\nDan Janki: Yes, let me -- a few things. One, I think the level of it is what gives us confidence in the second quarter and the second quarter revenue and revenue through this summer, the strength that we\u2019re seeing both internationally and domestic. You get the benefit of the people more comfortable booking longer elongation of the curve. You certainly have fares that are up. But I also think with the policies that we\u2019ve taken during this period of time being customer-focused, customer-friendly, people have gotten comfortable with no change fees and booking out, and that\u2019s driven the elongation of the curve. And we\u2019ve seen the behavior within that to be very consistent in regards to how it\u2019s been performing. So yes, it\u2019s a step up, but I think it\u2019s a sign of strength, and in regards to the customers feeling comfortable with the policies and changes that we\u2019ve made.\nAndrew Didora: Thanks. And just as a follow-up, Ed, we spoke about kind of -- I know you\u2019ve been tweaking down capacity a little bit. But what have you done from an operational perspective to minimize the risk of having the disruptions that you saw during last year\u2019s summer peak? Thanks.\nDan Janki: The teams have -- well, we spent a lot of time in regards to just ensuring that we have the right resources in the right places with the right level of training. So, a lot of effort\u2019s gone into this over the past, month after month after month across the operating teams, everything from the crew activity and ensuring that we\u2019re aligned network to crewing all the way down into tech operations in regards to the staffing that we have in place as it relates to line maintenance, they\u2019re continuing to focus on turnaround time regarding aircraft out of service and the associated items. So, we continue to be ensuring that we\u2019re putting those types of capabilities, buffers in place for the readiness and then the proactive actions that we talked about with adjusting June capacity based on -- Glen mentioned it, the resiliency and the ability to recover from storms. We know that they will happen in the summer, and we\u2019re targeting that around areas that we want to ensure that we have deeper resilience around, and the teams are focused on that.\nEd Bastian: If I could add to Dan\u2019s comments, one major thing in addition is that our team has another year under their belt of experience. We have a very young team out there and leaders as well as frontline employees and getting through another year gives you a lot more confidence in terms of what we\u2019re seeing. Secondly, we are pretty much through the hiring. We\u2019ve been still higher, but the hiring rates that we\u2019re at now are just normal hiring rates for normal attrition, not the massive bulge that we needed to go through to restore the business. And so not only are we able to reduce the focus on getting out and hiring people we can take the people that have been doing the training and put them back in the business because our employees train and we have some of the very best employees that do the training. So getting them back focused into the business for the summer will also be a very nice benefit as we go through this. But there\u2019s a list of 50 steps and 50 things that we\u2019re doing that we review in great detail. And we\u2019re confident it\u2019s going to be a very, very strong operational summer for Delta customers.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Glen, I\u2019m going to ask kind of a nerdy one, but your load factor did seem to step down sequentially in the first quarter. Did that have an impact from this actualization factor that you\u2019re talking about? And I guess, can you expand on how you control for that in the future with your RM system? Do we even get to like backwardation on yields or no?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think, really, there\u2019s two things I talk about in that realm. One I just want to mention, even though it wasn\u2019t in the question was there\u2019s two things we need to do better next year. One is harness the demand set better that is the new norm and post-pandemic world. And I think we\u2019re getting that real time now, and we\u2019ll make those adjustments. And so materialization rate is relatively easy to combat because it just relates to your overbooking model. So, if you were at 103% on average, and you have two extra points, you just go to 105 in terms of what your ability to take is. There\u2019s a little bit of risk in that. And so we probably won\u2019t go to 105 right away. We go to 104, see how that works, 4.5. [Ph] And that\u2019s why you have to retrain yourself and see what the actual events happen. Because these are changing in relatively condensed time periods, we don\u2019t want to overshoot and cause a disruption. So we\u2019re going to be a little bit more careful on getting that real time. But the other piece is doing the whole network over better next year, right, is that we saw travel patterns of all that are very different than pre-pandemic and where people are flying. And so, as we get to -- one of the things that gives us real confidence about improving next year over this year is when we look at what we did in January, being able to do that better in terms of where we have our capacity placed. And that\u2019s the part I think I\u2019m really excited about is we now have the real post-pandemic travel patterns, which are very different in terms of cities that fly to in places they want to go. If you take New York to Florida, which has never been bigger, there\u2019s a reason why, right, as people have decided that they can live in Florida and work in New York. And those are the things that we\u2019re now incorporating into our analysis as we move forward and things I think we\u2019re really excited about in the future.\nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate that, Glen. And then very quickly related to the ATL being close to $11 billion in your free cash flow guidance for $2 billion this year. Does that guidance incorporate the payment to the pilots? And how do we think about free cash as the year progresses now?\nDan Janki: Free cash flow, the -- as we mentioned in December and on first quarter, the one-time ratification payment that was made was not a special item. You see it this quarter, it\u2019s not in the free cash flow. And certainly, going back to the ATL, the cash performance in total, as it relates to the operating cash and where we are in free cash flow gives us confidence in being greater than $2 billion for the year -- first quarter and through the half. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Helane Becker from TD Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Ed, you talked about something I had a question about actually, and that was productivity improvements, which you mentioned that so many people have a year or more worth of experience. Can you -- is there any way you or Dan can put any numbers around that and just say, it\u2019s like X percent of CASM improvement or cost improvement?\nDan Janki: When you -- when -- yes, there\u2019s a lot of different benchmarks used, and you certainly look at this at every operating group. And things have changed. We used 2019 as a benchmark as a way marker, but I don\u2019t know that, that\u2019s always your operations changed how the teams execute has changed. But it\u2019s an anchoring point that we use and we look at our operating groups, each of those by where they were, what\u2019s changed, how are they tracking to those levels. And we certainly have by group metrics, and we know where we\u2019re at. But when you look at the total, when you bring it back up and you think about what\u2019s in our run rate, take out the rebuild component, but just around efficiency, there\u2019s 2 to 3 points, 4 points of opportunity in there as it relates to us getting better as we move forward through the back half of the year into next year. And those are all going to move at different paces in regards to it. The one that\u2019s going to be, for instance, probably the slowest here will be around regionals and the regional flying that we do. We know we\u2019re -- elevated levels were underutilized by almost 30% as it relates to the aircraft and capability, and that one will cure over the \u201824 period and in into \u201825. And then other ones will have a different pace associated with it.\nEd Bastian: Helane, couple of added points. We mentioned in past calls, the amount of incremental training that we\u2019re doing is in the hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Obviously, a lot of that\u2019s going to dissipate, now that we get into a more normalized pattern. We\u2019re going to get the employees not just the cost of the training, but the instructors are doing the training back into the operation and providing that leadership. The other thing is that, as Glen mentioned, the network is continuing to evolve. And what we\u2019ve seen is the staffing has been a bit lumpy during this recovery from the pandemic and getting your employees and your shifts to the schedule and understanding what the schedule looks like. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity in there at the airport level and efficiency across the board. So, I think efficiency is certainly a big part of the reason why we expect in the second half of this year to bend the trajectory on nonfuel CASM and start taking it down relative to prior year versus the continued upward push we\u2019ve been seeing.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s hugely helpful. Thanks, Ed. And then just for my follow-up question, as you know, being in New York, the FAA asked you to cut capacity by 10% this summer. So, that adds to your inability to be back to where you really want to be. Does that continue into the fourth quarter? And then, have you talked to them about getting more experienced controllers in the region? A. And B, is this something we need to look forward to every single summer? I mean, don\u2019t they have to do their part too in terms of improving their infrastructure?\nPeter Carter: Hi. It\u2019s Peter Carter. Thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So that release is until September 15th. So, it does not get into the fourth quarter. But what I would say is that it is hopefully going to be only something we would need to do this summer because we are engaged in ongoing discussions with the FAA precisely on the topic of ensuring that they have the appropriate staffing for that New York -- and frankly, it\u2019s beyond New York, but for our national air system. And I think the one thing you\u2019ve probably seen from them in their granting this waiver is that they are acknowledging that they have an issue that they need to solve, which is really an important, I think, acknowledgment because it allows us to work together to try to solve it, help them solve it together. So, we\u2019re -- it is the most efficient and safest air traffic control system in the world, and we need to continue to invest in it.\nHelane Becker: Thank you, Peter. Thanks, everybody.\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Helane. Now, we\u2019ll go to our final analyst question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your final analyst is going to be Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Just to switch gears a little bit, maybe talking about the loyalty program, it continues to be pretty successful. Revenue is up 27% year-over-year in the quarter. And I know you\u2019ve laid out 2024 targets. But generally, how are you thinking about growth runway from here, what levers are there to pull? And how do you think about the correlation to the broader economy and the broader macro? And if there\u2019s any metrics you watch more carefully with that.\nGlen Hauenstein: I think there are two components of that. One is the accounts in force, and that is, of course, related to our ability to bring new customers in. And we have posted record acquisitions in the last year, and we just had another -- in the month of March, it was a record monthly acquisition for -- in the history of the cards. So, I\u2019d say we see real strength in the brand, and that\u2019s really what drives the acquisitions. People want to associate with Delta, and they want associate with the SkyMiles program because it does apply great value to those customers. So, put that in one side and then put them the actual spend on the accounts in force. And that, I think, is more of a fluctuation in the economy. We see that continuing to be strong as we sit here today. But that\u2019s the piece I think that could shift up or down a little bit depending on how the economy rolls out in the second half of the year. But what we\u2019re counting on is that being more than offset by our new acquisitions, accounts in force, and really, more and more premium customers. And I think that\u2019s an exciting thing that we\u2019ll talk about in June. So, stay tuned on details on that. We\u2019ll -- go to give you some more details on how we see that evolving.\nJulie Stewart: That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Trebor Banstetter from our Corporate Communications department to start the media questions.\nTrebor Banstetter: Thank you, Julie. And just to remind everyone, we\u2019ve got time for one question and one follow-up each, and we\u2019ll get to as many as we can in the time remaining. Matthew, if you could please reiterate for the members of the media, the instructions for joining the question queue.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the recent near-miss or safety incidents that we\u2019ve been seeing. Has Delta -- have you looked at your own data? Have you noticed any anything concerning or any kind of trends or anything that would suggest if there\u2019s sort of a cause behind some of these incidents?\nEd Bastian: Hi Ali, it\u2019s Ed. We talked about this several weeks ago around the time of the summit that the FAA convened. We thought it was a very positive step to bring all the stakeholders together to talk about what we\u2019re seeing and what we can do to continue to improve upon the very best safety aviation system in the world. Yes, there\u2019s no question that we\u2019ve had some additional incidents than you would see that are a bit out of the norm in terms of timing. Fortunately, the safety systems caught those incidents, but we\u2019ve got to be vigilant at all times and continue to find ways to get better in that environment. So, nothing that gives us pause. It is, by far, the safest form of travel period -- of any form of travel. But we want to make certain the stakeholders are all focused as this industry works through, the infrastructure rebuild that FAA is seeing as well as the airlines are seeing.\nAlison Sider: And then you mentioned sort of like the relative newness or experience of the workforce as a factor in the operational issues. Do you think that that has played a role in kind of that uptick in safety incidents as well?\nEd Bastian: There\u2019s no evidence that that is necessarily the case. Listen, we have the world\u2019s foremost safety management systems and risk mitigation focus in the aviation community. And we knew that we have younger people. And so, we get out ahead of that. We don\u2019t wait for something to happen. We are on the front end of that with training and added procedures, added buffers, added focus in the operations. So no, I would not lay it necessarily at the hands of experience.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein: I wanted to get one quick clarification, and then I have a quick question. When you were talking about corporate recovery, and you were saying you\u2019ve recovered 85% of revenue, 75% of traffic in the second quarter, is that like total overall domestic and international corporate, or was that a segment of that?\nGlen Hauenstein: That\u2019s system. [Ph]\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. Okay. And then the second question I had was on high-end leisure travelers continuing to buy up. Are you seeing these folks buy up into what you would normally see business or first-class seats? Are they buying up only to the top premium economy level? And if it\u2019s the former, is that something that you expect to continue long term where these passengers are buying up into your ultimate highest classes?\nGlen Hauenstein: They\u2019re buying all the way up to domestic first and Delta One on the long-haul international. So -- and this is a phenomenon that we\u2019ve seen in making it more accessible. I think that\u2019s really been part of our long-term journey that we\u2019ve been talking about for many years. It is something we wanted to achieve is to make those products more accessible to people. And I think we\u2019ve seen success through the pandemic and coming out of the pandemic, once we see high stickiness to those products. So once you start flying in those cabins, you tend not to go back.\nMary Schlangenstein: And you expect them to be durable to maintain well beyond the pandemic or post-pandemic years?\nGlen Hauenstein: Absolutely.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from David Slotnick from TPG.\nDavid Slotnick: Thank you for the question. You touched on this a little bit in the analyst portion, but I wondered if you could talk a bit about staffing levels, both on the flight deck elsewhere throughout the operation and really with your third-party vendors. Have you had any disruption? And do you expect any disruption because of short staffing, say, with caterers or refuelers or anything like that?\nEd Bastian: We said on the call that we\u2019re getting into our normal staffing ranges and the amount of churn and turnover we\u2019re seeing both on the third-party support staff as well as the added staffing we\u2019ve hired is starting to get in a pretty good place. So no, I don\u2019t -- again, there\u2019s always a one-off pocket where you have some unique pressure. But on balance, no, that\u2019s not a problem.\nDavid Slotnick: And then you say that you\u2019re 75% booked for international travel this summer. Just with change -- change fees and everything, what percent of that would you normally expect to see change their flights or maybe canceling those ones for a later point?\nEd Bastian: That will be in the high single digits.\nTrebor Banstetter: Thank you, David. And that covers our media questions for today. So we can go ahead and wrap the call. We want to thank everyone for their time and participation.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you, everyone, for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. 2023 is off to a strong start for Delta with record advance summer bookings, the launch of free Wi-Fi and continued recognition as the industry leader, not only by our customers but by Fortune, Cirium and the Wall Street Journal. During the March quarter, we generated earnings of $0.25 per share on revenue that was 45% above last year and a record for the March quarter. Delta's operating income was $550 million, a more than $1 billion improvement year-over-year, bringing our trailing 12-month operating profit to nearly $5 billion. We generated close to $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, reflecting robust demand for summer travel. Better-than-expected cash generation enabled us to accelerate that reduction, moving us closer to our goal of returning to investment-grade metrics. All-in, a very solid performance by our team in the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. Delivering safe and reliable service remains our top priority, and no airline does this better than Delta. I'd like to thank our teams for all they do for our customers each and every day. The dedication, professionalism and hard work of Delta's 90,000 people worldwide are the foundation of our company. Sharing our financial success with our people has always been an important part of our DNA. Our industry-leading profitability in 2022 enabled us to pay out more than $550 million in profit sharing in February. More profit sharing than the rest of the industry combined. And we're looking forward to larger payouts next year as we expect to deliver significant earnings improvement. We also rewarded eligible employees with a 5% pay increase on the 1st of April, and received strong ratification from our pilots on the new four-year contract, providing well-deserved increases for all of our people. The performance of our people and the momentum of our brand was recognized when Delta was ranked number 12 overall of Fortune's World's Most Admired Company list, a remarkable statement about the resiliency of our company, given the pandemic challenges of the last few years. Our brand is built on a foundation of service and operational reliability, and we are committed to delivering the level of service our customers expect as we ramp operations for the coming summer season. The operating teams have done a great job getting ready and we are planning to grow June quarter capacity 17% over last year to meet strong customer demand. This growth is, though, a couple of points below our initial plan to fully restore capacity this summer, as we focus on delivering the best operation in the industry and remain prudent in our capacity restoration. As I mentioned at last December's Capital Markets Day, aviation infrastructure is still fragile. But collectively, we're working to ensure resiliency as we manage constraints around the supply chain, aircraft delivery delays and training needs. I want to commend the FAA for collaborating with the industry to help improve the customer experience in New York by temporarily relaxing minimum flight requirements given ATC staffing challenges. Turning to our outlook. With solid first quarter performance and visibility into the strength of summer travel demand, we are confident in our full year guidance for revenue growth of 15% to 20% year-over-year, earnings of $5 to $6 per share and free cash flow of over $2 billion, the three main guideposts we shared with you last December. For the June quarter, we expect to deliver the highest quarterly revenue in our history, a 15% operating margin and EPS of $2 to $2.25 a share. Our forecast operating profit of $2 billion matches Q2 of 2019, demonstrating that the earnings power of this franchise is intact. Glen and Dan will provide more details on the components of our outlook. As we look to our upcoming Investor Day in June, we will outline the long-term opportunities that we've cultivated through years of investment, building on our industry leadership position and further enhancing our long-term financial profile. One focus area will be innovation and digital technology, where we continue to grow our leadership position. Increasingly, it's one of the reasons customers are choosing Delta with significant growth in direct bookings and higher engagement through our digital channels. We have reached an important step in our digital transformation with the rollout of fast, free, high-quality Wi-Fi, which has been a tremendous success. We began this effort several years before the pandemic, and it has required significant investment and resources to achieve. In addition, this month, we began rolling out Delta Sync for SkyMiles members, which will unlock a more personalized customer experience in the air and on the ground. When customers join the SkyMiles loyalty program, it enables us to deepen our trusted relationship and create stronger brand preference. As we've rolled out fast, free Wi-Fi as well as other benefits, new SkyMiles memberships have accelerated at a record pace. Growth has been particularly strong among younger customers with a record 3 million total enrollments during the quarter. Thanks to the size and growth of our loyalty program, the value of our Amex co-brand card portfolio continues to reach new highs and leading brands are joining our consumer ecosystem, creating further opportunities. I look forward to discussing this and more about how Delta is transforming the customer experience on June 27th in Atlanta. Hope you all can join us that day. In closing, the industry backdrop remains constructive, and we are well positioned to grow earnings and cash flow in 2023, 2024 and beyond. Delta continues to set itself apart. We are on our way to transcend the industry with our leading consumer brand and deliver financial outcomes that create significant long-term value for our owners. Thank you again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance. Duane, one thing I'd add to that is that you're seeing corporately a pretty significant push to get workers back in the office. And we have seen a high correlation between the opening of offices with the return of corporate travel, principally with consultancies, advisers, people being available to take meetings. And so, that underlies the strength. And I think you're going to continue to see that over the course of the year is going to be, I think, a good tailwind for us on the corporate revenue front. Well, I don't know what you're inferring on the second half guide. We really haven't given a second half guide. I think you're just backing into the overall -- we haven't updated our full year. I think it's too early in the year to give an updated \u201823 guide, but if you look at our \u201824 guide, it's to get to north of $7 a share. And that's the trajectory we're on. And to -- one comment I made, which I haven't heard anyone pick up on, for the second quarter forecast we are forecasting to be already at $2 billion of operating profit, which is the same amount that we were at the second quarter of \u201819. It's quite a statement in terms of how the recovery is going and you consider that at a much higher fuel price, it's at much higher labor rates, and it's also with the system not restored. So, I think all of that gives you continued opportunities. We're looking to take the nonfuel CASM down in the back half of the year, which is going to be a meaningful tailwind for us. We don't see revenue declines in terms of demand strength. I know everyone has their own point of view on that, and we don't have a great crystal ball beyond the next four or five months. But from what we're hearing from our travelers, what we're hearing from the market, what we're hearing from agencies, this is a very different recovery trajectory than other consumer businesses are experiencing. If I could add to Dan's comments, one major thing in addition is that our team has another year under their belt of experience. We have a very young team out there and leaders as well as frontline employees and getting through another year gives you a lot more confidence in terms of what we're seeing. Secondly, we are pretty much through the hiring. We've been still higher, but the hiring rates that we're at now are just normal hiring rates for normal attrition, not the massive bulge that we needed to go through to restore the business. And so not only are we able to reduce the focus on getting out and hiring people we can take the people that have been doing the training and put them back in the business because our employees train and we have some of the very best employees that do the training. So getting them back focused into the business for the summer will also be a very nice benefit as we go through this. But there's a list of 50 steps and 50 things that we're doing that we review in great detail. And we're confident it's going to be a very, very strong operational summer for Delta customers. Helane, couple of added points. We mentioned in past calls, the amount of incremental training that we're doing is in the hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Obviously, a lot of that's going to dissipate, now that we get into a more normalized pattern. We're going to get the employees not just the cost of the training, but the instructors are doing the training back into the operation and providing that leadership. The other thing is that, as Glen mentioned, the network is continuing to evolve. And what we've seen is the staffing has been a bit lumpy during this recovery from the pandemic and getting your employees and your shifts to the schedule and understanding what the schedule looks like. There's a lot of opportunity in there at the airport level and efficiency across the board. So, I think efficiency is certainly a big part of the reason why we expect in the second half of this year to bend the trajectory on nonfuel CASM and start taking it down relative to prior year versus the continued upward push we've been seeing. Hi Ali, it's Ed. We talked about this several weeks ago around the time of the summit that the FAA convened. We thought it was a very positive step to bring all the stakeholders together to talk about what we're seeing and what we can do to continue to improve upon the very best safety aviation system in the world. Yes, there's no question that we've had some additional incidents than you would see that are a bit out of the norm in terms of timing. Fortunately, the safety systems caught those incidents, but we've got to be vigilant at all times and continue to find ways to get better in that environment. So, nothing that gives us pause. It is, by far, the safest form of travel period -- of any form of travel. But we want to make certain the stakeholders are all focused as this industry works through, the infrastructure rebuild that FAA is seeing as well as the airlines are seeing. There's no evidence that that is necessarily the case. Listen, we have the world's foremost safety management systems and risk mitigation focus in the aviation community. And we knew that we have younger people. And so, we get out ahead of that. We don't wait for something to happen. We are on the front end of that with training and added procedures, added buffers, added focus in the operations. So no, I would not lay it necessarily at the hands of experience. We said on the call that we're getting into our normal staffing ranges and the amount of churn and turnover we're seeing both on the third-party support staff as well as the added staffing we've hired is starting to get in a pretty good place. So no, I don't -- again, there's always a one-off pocket where you have some unique pressure. But on balance, no, that's not a problem. That will be in the high single digits."

But what I would say is that it is hopefully going to be only something we would need to do this summer because we are engaged in ongoing discussions with the FAA precisely on the topic of ensuring that they have the appropriate staffing for that New York -- and frankly, it's beyond New York, but for our national air system. And I think the one thing you've probably seen from them in their granting this waiver is that they are acknowledging that they have an issue that they need to solve, which is really an important, I think, acknowledgment because it allows us to work together to try to solve it, help them solve it together. So, we're -- it is the most efficient and safest air traffic control system in the world, and we need to continue to invest in it."

            "name": "Glen Hauenstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed. I'd like to start by thanking our employees for the difference that they make every day. We delivered record March quarter revenue at $11.8 billion, 14% higher than 2019 on 2% less capacity. Total unit revenues, or TRASM was 16% higher than the same period in 2019. These results include approximately 1-point impact from flying less capacity than initially planned. Consumer demand was well ahead of pre-pandemic levels and drove strength in domestic and international travel. Business travel improved in the quarter with small and medium businesses ahead of \u201819 levels while managed corporate travel showed steady progress led by international. Diverse revenue streams, including premium and loyalty, generated 56% of total revenue in 1Q. Premium revenue growth continued to outpace the main cabin. Total loyalty and revenue grew 28% versus the prior year, with continued momentum in our American Express co-brand portfolio. We saw card spend up more than 20% year-over-year. This supported a record $1.7 billion of remuneration from American Express during the quarter, keeping us on track to deliver over $6.5 billion in 2023. Throughout the recovery, travel behaviors and patterns continue to evolve. The hybrid workplace is blurring the lines between business and leisure trips while the removal of change fees has increased customer flexibility, allowing them to book trips earlier. This dynamic was more pronounced in the March quarter, and so we are continuing to adopt and see opportunities to further optimize our revenue management approach to these new travel behaviors in future months. We expect June quarter revenue to be up 15% to 17% year-over-year on capacity that is 17% higher. This implies unit revenues will be flat to down 2% compared to prior year, including a couple of point impact from higher international mix as well as lapping record cargo revenues. For comparison to the March quarter, the midpoint of this outlook is a 3-point sequential improvement in total unit revenues versus 2019, driven by improvements in both, domestic and international. Moving forward, we are sunsetting the comparisons to 2019 and returning to year-over-year metrics. Domestically, we are growing our seats mid-single digits over last year with our core hub rebuild beginning to take hold in June and accelerating through the fall. On international, we are excited with the momentum we're seeing and expect record revenues and profitability for the summer travel season. To meet increasing demand, we are growing our international seats by more than 20% in the June quarter compared to prior year, and we already have about 75% of our bookings on hand. In the transatlantic, we're seeing strong demand on our largest ever summer schedule. Our Amsterdam hub performance continues to improve, and we are pleased with the outlook for all of our new markets. In Latin America, momentum is continuing to build. The breadth of Delta's long-haul network to South America continues to improve as we begin to leverage our partnership with LATAM. Pacific demand is accelerating, and we expect record margins meaningfully ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Our multiyear restructuring efforts in the Pacific are paying dividends, and our partnership with Korean Air is performing extremely well, providing us future growth opportunities. In closing, consistent execution of our long-term commercial strategy is supporting industry-leading margin performance and demonstrating the resiliency of our business model. The long-term investments we've made in our fleet, global network and technology pave the way for future growth and margin expansion. Thank you. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to talk about the financials. Sure, Mike. Let me try and answer the first one. And I'd like to just mention that on Tuesday, we had our second highest cash sales day ever. Seasonality that's starting to decline, usually those occur earlier in the year. So I think that just points to the strength of the core demand for our products and services, be it domestic or international, just at a combined level, the number two sales day in our total history occurring this week. And so, behind that backdrop of really strong consumer demand across the board, I think what we've seen is travel patterns changing and shifting a little bit more than they did pre-pandemic. We had a lot of stability, pre-pandemic, and we're adjusting here into what I would call a new normal, and we'll figure out exactly where that lands over time. What that meant in the quarter was materialization rates actually went down a bit throughout the quarter and materialization rates to us is book to flown ratios. Normally just a couple of points, accelerating a couple of points more than usual, probably attributing that to the flexibility without change fees that we're seeing in the marketplace. And so, that's really easy to accommodate as we just turn up slightly our overbooking levels to make sure that we capture the higher load factors. And then secondly is the booking trends inside of 30 days. And we were knowing that inside of 30 days was declining, and the strong demand was just outside of 30 days. And so the demand is very strong, and it's a matter of how many you let through the gate at what point in time. And we had, for example, wanted to go into month 3 to 4 points ahead. We're tiling that up a little bit to be more like 5 to 6 points ahead, given that the combination of materialization rates, which has some impact on that, of course, but also where consumers are booking. I think those are just RM tactics that we're using to adjust to this new demand set. And I don't think that it indicates that there is any softness in core demand strength. So I think we feel really confident in the summer and what we have on the books and what we're seeing real time in terms of demand. And so, I feel very good about that. Relating to industrial recession, we don't really see that. As a matter of fact, if you look at Minneapolis and Detroit, they're actually ahead. Now they're the least restored of our hubs right now, particularly in Detroit is one tick below the rest of the system. But you've also had rationalization in competing hubs in the region. And so, they're willing to say, okay, well, maybe some of the industrials. These hubs are not point-to-point like Boston or New York, they're really the connecting flow within the U.S. So, there's opportunity as we continue to restore those networks to put more flow on the network. Not 100% resilient -- reliant, of course, on Detroit, mostly relying on the flow traffic that flows over to Detroit. So I think what we're seeing, we see strength in all of our core hubs. Our core hubs are less restored than our coastal gateways, and that's one of the upsides that we have for the rest of the year as we move through the year. And they're producing incredible returns and incredibly strong demand sets. Domestic portion of international journey is right around 10% of domestic travel. So, it's not that big of an impact. And last year was probably 7% or 8%, and this year is probably going to be 8% or 9%. So I wouldn't say there's significant changes in that. The summer, of course, is highly reliant on the local demand since we sit in very big local markets for our international marketplace, so New York and JFK being the largest in particular. And generally, if you can take locally, you prefer local because yields are higher. So -- and JFK is largely 80% local for international travel. So maybe let's rely on Atlanta, of course, has more flow on it, but still a large local component. We are 75% internationally, and we're significantly less than that domestically. Clearly, I think we talked a little bit about the two components. One was we had 1 point less of capacity, driven by some weather events and recovering from those weather events. The second is the fact that the lower materialization rates in the RM systems adapting to those that we couldn't do it real time because you have to see if they're stable before you adjust for them. So I think that's what we're looking at in the second quarter. And as we mentioned in the -- versus \u201819, we have positive momentum in 1Q to 2Q, both domestically and internationally. So, I think we're feeling -- I know there's a lot of anxiety about domestic demand for the summer, but we don't share that anxiety. Right. Our corporate travelers are telling us they expect that to continue to accelerate. The -- we are not counting that in our -- we're counting a stable 85% revenue, 75% of traffic. Yes. Yes. It's being driven by our desire to ensure that we have an industry-leading operational -- and what we saw in the March quarter was we had a little bit longer than we would like in recovering from weather events. So, we can -- as weather shortfalls were and they were primarily in the domestic narrowbodies that we want to ensure we have all the right resources behind them because we know we'll have weather events in the summer as we always do. So, it was just a bit of a step back, not really by demand, but really by supply, our supply was a little bit more constrained than we had hoped. And that should provide us the ability to provide whatever level we want of capacity in the fall depending on how the global environment shapes up. Sure. Technology is one of the least recovered. Financial services is actually showing some momentum, surprisingly. And so, I think as we think about our geographic pull, one of the things we're excited about is New York was really not back last year. And of course, we have a lot of exposure to New York, and we're seeing really good -- New York not only as an origin market improvement, but New York is a destination market improvements as well. So, that should bode well for us for the summer. And again, I think what's really interesting is more of the forward lines between the yields of corporate and high-yield leisure that didn't exist back pre-pandemic 5 years ago. And so where we're not selling those premium seats to corporates, we are selling them at near corporate rates to high-end leisure customers, and that's really providing a very nice insulation for us. No, thanks for that question because I think it's very important. I think when we outlined back in December, core restoration is one of the highlights of 2023 that is distinctive about Delta's. What we didn't say is when that occurred in \u201823 and kind of a mea culpa on that because in the first half of the year, that really wasn't what happened. It starts right around now and it goes through the fall. So that should be really a key driver for us as we move through the back half of the year, both on cost and revenue. I think we see the same reports that all everybody sees. I think Ed outlined very well that we think there is still remaining pent-up demand from the $300 billion that was not spent on airline travel during the pandemic. So, we'll see how that plays out in the fall, and we have a lot of flexibility in terms of what we offer as we get out of the summer. What we're saying today is we are confident through the summer. And then, we'll take another look as we get closer to it, do we see any demand trends changing. I think what we hear from the marketplace, everybody is looking for those lines. We don't see them right now. So we would tell you if we did. And if we do see them, we'll make the adjustments that would be required for the fall. Great question. Most of the business travel internationally is in the front cabin. So, I'd say 75% to 80% is in the front cabin. So, that's fueling front cabin strength. I'd say all of our premium products in the long-haul international markets are doing incredibly well. This is really the first year we have premium economy at scale. About 85% of our flights long-haul now have -- that will be 100% by next year. But -- so we're flying this for the first time with ubiquity in the international arena, and we're seeing amazing results on the premium economy count at the Premium Select. So, very excited about the rebound in international travel, both leisure as well as business. Now, what was the second part of your question? I'm sorry. We are seeing the length of trip change and Road Warriors are not staying one day, day trips are down. And that's really what we're trying to harness here as we move forward is normally, we would use AP, advanced purchase as one of the big key drivers for separating our business versus leisure. Now it's really stay. And even with stay, it's not as defined as it used to be. So, those are the fences we're trying to rearrange how we think about our pricing systems and fencing. We don't want to get too much into how we think about that. But clearly, AP is one that we're leading out of. We are -- 75% is about where we would expect to be at this point in time for international long haul. Domestic, we are within a couple of points where we would expect to be. It's really the -- how much you want to take in advance. And when you think about 90 days, it's not all 90 days. Inside of 30 days, we want to be ahead. So, that's the difference. Second question, I'm sorry. Yes. It's a mix difference. International is up significantly and domestic is relatively flat versus year-over-year. I think, really, there's two things I talk about in that realm. One I just want to mention, even though it wasn't in the question was there's two things we need to do better next year. One is harness the demand set better that is the new norm and post-pandemic world. And I think we're getting that real time now, and we'll make those adjustments. And so materialization rate is relatively easy to combat because it just relates to your overbooking model. So, if you were at 103% on average, and you have two extra points, you just go to 105 in terms of what your ability to take is. There's a little bit of risk in that. And so we probably won't go to 105 right away. We go to 104, see how that works, 4.5. [Ph] And that's why you have to retrain yourself and see what the actual events happen. Because these are changing in relatively condensed time periods, we don't want to overshoot and cause a disruption. So we're going to be a little bit more careful on getting that real time. But the other piece is doing the whole network over better next year, right, is that we saw travel patterns of all that are very different than pre-pandemic and where people are flying. And so, as we get to -- one of the things that gives us real confidence about improving next year over this year is when we look at what we did in January, being able to do that better in terms of where we have our capacity placed. And that's the part I think I'm really excited about is we now have the real post-pandemic travel patterns, which are very different in terms of cities that fly to in places they want to go. If you take New York to Florida, which has never been bigger, there's a reason why, right, as people have decided that they can live in Florida and work in New York. And those are the things that we're now incorporating into our analysis as we move forward and things I think we're really excited about in the future. I think there are two components of that. One is the accounts in force, and that is, of course, related to our ability to bring new customers in. And we have posted record acquisitions in the last year, and we just had another -- in the month of March, it was a record monthly acquisition for -- in the history of the cards. So, I'd say we see real strength in the brand, and that's really what drives the acquisitions. People want to associate with Delta, and they want associate with the SkyMiles program because it does apply great value to those customers. So, put that in one side and then put them the actual spend on the accounts in force. And that, I think, is more of a fluctuation in the economy. We see that continuing to be strong as we sit here today. But that's the piece I think that could shift up or down a little bit depending on how the economy rolls out in the second half of the year. But what we're counting on is that being more than offset by our new acquisitions, accounts in force, and really, more and more premium customers. And I think that's an exciting thing that we'll talk about in June. So, stay tuned on details on that. We'll -- go to give you some more details on how we see that evolving. That's system. [Ph] They're buying all the way up to domestic first and Delta One on the long-haul international. So -- and this is a phenomenon that we've seen in making it more accessible. I think that's really been part of our long-term journey that we've been talking about for many years. It is something we wanted to achieve is to make those products more accessible to people. And I think we've seen success through the pandemic and coming out of the pandemic, once we see high stickiness to those products. So once you start flying in those cabins, you tend not to go back. Absolutely."

            "name": "Dan Janki",
            "content": "Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the March quarter, we delivered earnings of $0.25 per share and a 4.6% operating margin in line with our guidance. Our nonfuel costs were 4.7% higher than the first quarter of 2022. It is including a 1-point impact from lower capacity, primarily due to winter storms. Fuel price for the quarter averaged $3.06 per gallon, this including a $0.25 benefit from our refinery, which continues to provide a unique hedge to fuel volatility. Our operating cash flow was $2.9 billion. That was the highest March quarter result in Delta's history. After investing $1.1 billion back into the business, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow. Strong cash generation enabled $1.2 billion of debt reduction. This including accelerated debt repayment of $700 million with an average interest rate of 7%. Liquidity ended the quarter at $9.5 billion and adjusted net debt of $21 billion. Our leverage ratio improved from 5 times at year-end to 3.9 times at the end of March on a trailing 12-month basis. We now expect to complete our full year planned debt reduction in the first half of the year, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunistic debt repayment. Over the last year, we accelerated more than $3 billion in debt reduction, targeting our highest cost debt and reducing our interest expense. Recognizing this progress we are making, S&P and Fitch both upgraded their outlook for our ratings. Returning to investment-grade metrics is a key priority. We remain focused on reducing net debt and achieving our targeted 2 to 3 times leverage ratio in 2024, while continuing to consistently reinvest in the business. Now, moving to guidance for the June quarter. On fuel, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be $2.55 to $2.80, including a $0.10 to $0.15 contribution from the refinery. While lower than that last year, I'd note that fuel prices remain volatile and are still approximately 30% higher than in 2019. On nonfuel, we expect unit cost to be 1% to 3% higher than prior year. For the first half, we expect to grow capacity 17%, approximately 2 points less than our initial expectations, with a similar 2-point impact expected on our unit cost. More than three months into the year, our absolute costs are tracking as expected. Higher labor rates are fully incorporated across the mainline and regionals. Inflation is stabilizing and we are in the final stages of our rebuild. By the end of June, aircraft reactivations will largely be complete and training is starting to step down with a third of our pilots moving into production. As I outlined on our call in January, core maintenance is higher year-over-year in the first half of the year. We expect it to decline in the second half, resulting in a 5-point year-over-year progression in our unit cost from the beginning of the year to the end. Secondly, achieving scale while restoring efficiency are Delta's largest CASM levers. The pace of capacity restoration remains the primary level. In summary, we are confident in our year-over-year decline in the second half and expect a 10-point improvement in our unit cost progression as we progress through the year. Running the most reliable operation in the industry is key to delivering a competitive cost structure and underpins our industry-leading margins. Combined with our outlook for revenue, we expect the June quarter operating margin to be 14% to 16% and earnings to be between $2 and $2.25 per share. With a quarter behind us and the visibility we have in the summer, we have higher confidence in our full year guidance for significant improvement in earnings and free cash flow. We are reaffirming our full year guidance for operating margins of 10% to 12%, earnings of $5 to $6 per share and more than $2 billion of free cash flow. And we remain on track to earn over $7 per share in 2024 with more than $4 billion of free cash flow. So in closing, I'd like to thank the Delta people for the elevated service they provide to our customers every day. Our people will always be the delta difference. Now with that, I'd like to turn it back to Julie for Q&A. We're just deeper into the restoration. And I think as we've gotten deeper in, we continue to have better visibility to that. We have all the labor dialed in as we've talked about, you're seeing stabilization in the regionals. That was 1 that we chased last year. As it relates to third-party suppliers, the peak of contract inquiries and repricing was heavy in fourth quarter of \u201821 begin in the first half of \u201822. And if you look at those requests, coming in, they've dropped up meaningfully for that. So, I think you're starting to see that stabilization in the inflation component of third-party and coming in very in line with what we expected from that perspective. So just better visibility. I think we're deeper into the restoration. So operationally, arms on it related to that. So, our absolute cost visibility is good at this point in time. Certainly, the unit cost metric, as we've talked about, is impacted by the ultimate capacity that we fly. Yes, revenue and costs. Yes. Yes. We -- sure, Conor. We had the 2-point impact on capacity. That had a 2-point impact on unit cost. We're still sitting here in April. So, we have a lot of the year to play out as it relates to capacity. And as we progress through the year and set that that will ultimately determine it. If you went through the year and you made that up, you pick that up. If not, it would have a corresponding impact on unit cost as you progress. But as we talked about on the point with Savi is our visibility to absolute cost is clear and better than it's been in the restoration. And as you go through the back half, you get that inflection point, the points that we've talked about with core maintenance stepping down from being a headwind to a 2- to 3-point benefit. And as Glen talked about with the restoration of the hubs you start to pick up scale and efficiency associated with that. And the rebuild steps down. So that gives us confidence in the progression ultimately will be where on a unit basis, where do you fall out as it relates to capacity impact that has. But as you know here, we're focused on running a great operation and the alignment is to the primary financial outcomes, which is margins, earnings and cash. Yes. That's right. You think about the 10-point progression from beginning to end, and that would be down mid-single digits from that perspective. The maintenance is the 5 points -- 4 to 5 points related to first half being up to back half being down. The other drivers there is rebuild, those transition rebuild costs. We incur about 80%, 85% of them in the first half of the year, really aircraft reactivations, it's training, it's hiring components. Those step down and I mentioned that in the prepared remarks, pilots being one and the crews being one of them. We're putting 600 pilots into production. So, it's really the first time over the last 18 months that are actually -- school house will step down here during the second quarter. And then the other components are the efficiency, scale and efficiency that starts to step in as you get the core rebuild, about 5 points of aircraft utilization, and we just get a better use of our facilities and our people as we progress through the back half. Yes, let me -- a few things. One, I think the level of it is what gives us confidence in the second quarter and the second quarter revenue and revenue through this summer, the strength that we're seeing both internationally and domestic. You get the benefit of the people more comfortable booking longer elongation of the curve. You certainly have fares that are up. But I also think with the policies that we've taken during this period of time being customer-focused, customer-friendly, people have gotten comfortable with no change fees and booking out, and that's driven the elongation of the curve. And we've seen the behavior within that to be very consistent in regards to how it's been performing. So yes, it's a step up, but I think it's a sign of strength, and in regards to the customers feeling comfortable with the policies and changes that we've made. The teams have -- well, we spent a lot of time in regards to just ensuring that we have the right resources in the right places with the right level of training. So, a lot of effort's gone into this over the past, month after month after month across the operating teams, everything from the crew activity and ensuring that we're aligned network to crewing all the way down into tech operations in regards to the staffing that we have in place as it relates to line maintenance, they're continuing to focus on turnaround time regarding aircraft out of service and the associated items. So, we continue to be ensuring that we're putting those types of capabilities, buffers in place for the readiness and then the proactive actions that we talked about with adjusting June capacity based on -- Glen mentioned it, the resiliency and the ability to recover from storms. We know that they will happen in the summer, and we're targeting that around areas that we want to ensure that we have deeper resilience around, and the teams are focused on that. Free cash flow, the -- as we mentioned in December and on first quarter, the one-time ratification payment that was made was not a special item. You see it this quarter, it's not in the free cash flow. And certainly, going back to the ATL, the cash performance in total, as it relates to the operating cash and where we are in free cash flow gives us confidence in being greater than $2 billion for the year -- first quarter and through the half. Thank you. When you -- when -- yes, there's a lot of different benchmarks used, and you certainly look at this at every operating group. And things have changed. We used 2019 as a benchmark as a way marker, but I don't know that, that's always your operations changed how the teams execute has changed. But it's an anchoring point that we use and we look at our operating groups, each of those by where they were, what's changed, how are they tracking to those levels. And we certainly have by group metrics, and we know where we're at. But when you look at the total, when you bring it back up and you think about what's in our run rate, take out the rebuild component, but just around efficiency, there's 2 to 3 points, 4 points of opportunity in there as it relates to us getting better as we move forward through the back half of the year into next year. And those are all going to move at different paces in regards to it. The one that's going to be, for instance, probably the slowest here will be around regionals and the regional flying that we do. We know we're -- elevated levels were underutilized by almost 30% as it relates to the aircraft and capability, and that one will cure over the \u201824 period and in into \u201825. And then other ones will have a different pace associated with it."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our September quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. Please note that Page 2 of the earnings release today outlines the impact of the CrowdStrike-caused outage on our Q3 profitability and unit metrics, consistent with our initial disclosure on August 8th. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Bastian: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we begin, I want to provide a quick update on Hurricane Milton. Safety of our people, customers and communities is always paramount. And to that end, we've issued a fee waiver and implemented fair caps for those who need to change their travel plans or fly out of the storm's path. We've also added additional flights and up gauged aircraft into Florida this week to accommodate those evacuating the state. Between yesterday and today, we have canceled approximately 600 flights in total, but we'll have a better sense of the impact as we learn of how our airports fared overnight. Our hearts are with all those in the Southeast who have been affected during the storm season. Now turning to our earnings report. Earlier this morning, we reported our September quarter results, consistent with our latest guidance. On an earnings per share basis, our results would have been at the high end of initial guidance, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. Delta continues to lead the industry, operationally and financially, while delivering on our 2024 plan. Year-to-date, our on-time performance is best in the industry, and our completion factor leads the network carriers even when including the impact of the outage. Financially, we have delivered double-digit operating margins with nearly $3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. And following the Fitch upgrade in July, our balance sheet now has two investment-grade ratings and our dividend yield is in line with the S&P 500. Delta's year-to-date profitability is expected to represent 50% of the industry's total profits with a double-digit return on invested capital that is more than twice the industry average, reflecting the durability of our business model. I'm incredibly proud of the Delta people for delivering these results. I want to thank them for their outstanding work during this busy summer period and their dedication to providing best-in-class service for our customers. Sharing our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of our culture. With this quarter's financial performance, we've accrued nearly $1 billion year-to-date towards next February's profit sharing. We expect this will be among our top profit sharing payments in Delta's history and more than the rest of the industry combined. The combination of our industry-leading reliability and best-in-class service from our people has firmly established Delta as the premium airline of choice empowers our brand momentum. The new Delta One Lounge in JFK has been an incredible success with very high customer satisfaction. Building on this momentum, this morning, we opened our new Delta One Lounge at LAX and we will be opening our third Delta One Lounge in Boston this December and a fourth in Seattle early next year. By year-end, Delta will have over 700,000 square feet across 55 Sky Clubs and three Delta One Lounges, a one-of-a-kind position across many of the largest airports in the country. On board, we are enhancing the customer experience with the rollout of our popular Delta Sync product to more than 330 aircraft, offering SkyMiles members a personalized experience that provides a smart TV on the seat back screen. More than 90% of our domestic mainline network now offers fast free Wi-Fi. And this summer, we began introducing fast-free Wi-Fi -- excuse me, fast-free in-flight Wi-Fi on long-haul international flights. Across the network, Delta's advantages continue to build. Core hubs are nearing full restoration as we close out the year, and we are harvesting the investments we've made in coastal gateways to improve margins and support profitable international growth. Around the world, we're continuing to develop our JV partnerships and leveraging our strengths. Our recently announced summer 2025 Transatlantic schedule will build on our strong performance and our largest and most profitable international region. As brand preference continues to grow, we are driving deeper levels of engagement and our SkyMiles membership is attracting a younger consumer. We have seen a significant evolution in our active member base post-COVID, with 3 million more active members under 40 years of age, more than doubling member engagement with non-air partnerships allowing us to earn a higher share of wallet. Deeper engagement with Delta drives higher customer satisfaction, reinforces loyalty and creates greater lifetime customer value. Turning to our outlook. Consumers are continuing to prioritize premium experiences, and our core customer base is in a healthy financial position with travel remaining a top spend category. Corporate travel continues to improve and Delta is well-positioned as the business carrier of choice. And importantly, domestic supply growth continues to rationalize. Across much of the industry, there has been an accelerated pace of change and we are encouraged by the actions the industry is taking to improve profitability and returns. In the December quarter, the improved revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing. And we expect to grow earnings 30% over last year, with pre-tax income of $1.4 billion, which would mark one of the best, if not the best, fourth quarters in our history. With this, our full year outlook for earnings is expected to be around the midpoint of our initial $6 to $7 EPS guidance from the start of the year, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. As we approach the end of our three-year plan that we laid out in late 2021, we have delivered consistent financial performance, restoring our financial foundation while navigating ever changing macro in industry environments from a position of strength. Our performance is a testament to the durability we are creating at Delta, built on years of investing in our people and our product, while continuing to restore our balance sheet strength. Delta has built unmatched competitive advantages and structurally improved our business for the long-term. Next month, at our Investor Day, we will introduce an updated long-term financial framework that builds on our durability and reflects the opportunities that we see ahead to create sustainable long-term value for our owners. As we approach our 100-year anniversary next year, I've never been more excited about Delta's position and the opportunity that lies ahead. Thank you, again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work during this busy summer travel season. They are the Delta difference. Delta delivered September quarter revenue consistent with our latest guidance despite the impact from Hurricane Helene. During the quarter, unit revenue improved sequentially in all geographic entities reflecting the strength in travel demand and an improving industry backdrop. In the month of September, unit revenue inflected to positive in both domestic and transatlantic. Domestic industry seat growth moderated significantly from the peak in June, with the industry now growing seats in line with demand. Transatlantic benefited from ongoing strength in U.S. point of sale and a rebound in Paris demand as soon as the Olympics ended. Corporate travel sales were up 7% during the quarter, led by double-digit growth in coastal hubs with broad-based strength across sectors. Delta is the clear industry leader in offering premium experiences and more choices for our customers with significant investment across the travel experience over the last 15 years. Our new Delta One Lounges in New York and LA with dedicated check-in and private TSA security truly differentiate Delta's premium offering in the two largest revenue markets in the United States. We also introduced Delta Premium Select on TransCon flights between JFK and LA and we'll expand this offering to all daily frequencies next month. Similar to our international rollout, the initial customer reception to Delta Premium Select has far exceeded our expectations. Consistently delivering elevated experience that customers value is driving outperformance in premium products across geographies. During the quarter, premium revenue growth outperformed the main cabin by 9 points. At the same time, Delta is growing SkyMiles membership and deepening our customer engagement. The success of our strategy is best illustrated by our unit revenue premium relative to the industry, the growing loyalty of our brand and our increasingly diversified revenue base. Year-to-date, 57% of our revenue has been generated outside of selling main cabin seats, underpinning Delta's financial leadership and supporting durable performance that significantly outpaces the industry. Royalty revenue was up 6% versus last year, with growth in our SkyMiles membership and strengthen our American Express co-brand portfolio. American Express remuneration for the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 6% year-over-year, delivering solid performance and a backdrop of moderating inflation. Cargo revenue was 27% higher than last year with double-digit growth across all international regions. I am encouraged by the results and the opportunity to better leverage our increasingly cargo capable fleet. Looking forward, demand for travel on Delta remains healthy with continued preference for our premium offerings. Our recent corporate survey indicates a positive outlook for business demand with 85% of respondents indicating they expect their travel spend to grow in 2025. For the December quarter, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 4% over prior year on a 3% to 4% higher capacity level. The improved unit revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing into the December quarter with healthy bookings for the holiday. As we've seen historically, domestic travel demand is impacted in the weeks surrounding the election, resulting in an expected 1 point impact to system unit revenue for the quarter. With favorable industry capacity dynamics and a strong demand set, we are well positioned as we close out the year and head into 2025. Our industry leadership and differentiation has never been greater creating the foundation for us to unlock the value of our trusted customer brand and further diversify our revenue base. In closing, I'm excited about our opportunities ahead, and I look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day next month. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan.\nDan Janki: Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. Operationally, our teams delivered through a busy summer travel season. Year-to-date, Delta has achieved 60 days of zero cancellations, nearly twice all of last year. Today, we reported another quarter of strong financial performance with $1.3 billion of pretax income for the September quarter. On non-fuel unit costs, performance was in line with our expectations. Unit costs grew 5.7%, including a 3.2 point impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage and a 0.5 point impact from the decision to reward employees with travel passes for their hard work through the summer. Now fuel prices declined 9% over prior year, averaging $2.53 per gallon for the quarter, including a $0.03 loss from the refinery. Fuel efficiency improved approximately 1% year-over-year. During the quarter, we took delivery of nine next-gen Airbus aircraft and retired six aircraft. We continue to expect our fleet growth to be less than 2% this year with 20 net aircraft additions as half of our new deliveries are replacements. Operating cash flow year-to-date was $6.2 billion. After reinvesting $3.6 billion back into the business, we generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Strong cash generation has supported debt repayment of $2.4 billion year-to-date, including $900 million of early repayments. Gross leverage ended the quarter at 2.9 times. For the year, we expect to repay nearly $4 billion of debt, bringing our cumulative debt paydown to more than $12 billion over the last three years. As we retire secured debt, and pay cash for our aircraft, our unencumbered asset base is expected to grow to $30 billion by year end. Our financial foundation continues to strengthen. We achieved a meaningful milestone during the quarter with our balance sheet receiving an upgrade to investment grade from Fitch. Delta is now investment grade rated at Moody's and Fitch and one notch away at S&P with a positive outlook. Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect to deliver 2 points of margin, operating margin expansion and earnings growth of 30% compared to the prior year. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.20 to $2.40 per gallon, more than 20% lower year-over-year, including a few cent impact from a modest loss at the refinery. Unit costs are expected to be up 3% from last year as capacity growth moderates to 3% to 4%, keeping our full year outlook for non-fuel costs in line with our initial guidance of up low-single digit. With hiring and training normalizing, we are growing into our resources and gaining traction on efficiency and initiatives, helping fund continued investments in our people and brand. December quarter earnings are expected to be $1.60 to $1.85 per share on 11% to 13% operating margins. We are focused on finishing the year strong, delivering industry leading performance with a return to earnings growth and margin expansion, positioning us well as we head into 2025. Delta's differentiation has never been greater. Our brand and financial performance are transcending the industry, and we are generating a return on invested capital that is 5 points ahead of our cost of capital and better than half of the S&P 500. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering durable earnings and cash generation that enable us to further strengthen our balance sheet and create long-term value for our shareholders. I look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day next month. In closing, our performance is a result of the hard work of our employees. I want to thank the Delta people for continuing to go above and beyond for our customers and each other every day. Now with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A.\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please go to the first analyst question?\nOperator: Certainly, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live.\nDavid Vernon: So Glen, first question for you on the election. Can you just help us get comfortable with how you're separating out that impact from what you're seeing internally? And maybe talk to what gives you confidence that this isn't just a weakness in the consumer that's showing up in some of the forward revenue data? Thanks.\nGlen Hauenstein: Absolutely. I think it's -- if you were looking at our internal numbers, it's really obvious to see the trend lines where you have markets that are performing incredibly well with positive momentum in October. And then again, as soon as the week after the election is complete, and on into December and really all the way into January. So if you took a trend line, you would see these two weeks just being way off trend. And I think it's -- we said in the comments that it's domestic, but it's also short haul Latin. It's pretty much across the board that those two weeks are underperforming the trends before and after those weeks.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. And then maybe just, Ed, can you talk at a high level about how Delta is thinking about domestic capacity kind of going forward, lower cost airlines cutting capacity? Does that make you think about share any differently here?\nEd Bastian: Well, David, that's a great prelude into next month's Investor Day, where we'll be giving you our perspective on that. We did, is file our summer schedule last week and Atlanta is one of the markets where we are finally at a position to be at, if not better, than pre-COVID levels in capacity. So very excited about that.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live.\nJamie Baker: Thanks and good morning, everyone. A couple for Glen. So Glen, when I think about the phenomenon of tightening domestic capacity, my assumption has always been that the first routes that are culled provide the greatest uplift to RASM and from there RASM benefits still accrue over time, but at sort of a declining rate of improvement. Is that the right way to be thinking about it that the benefits are front end loaded or is the reality of something different?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, Jamie, I'm trying to understand whose perspective you're looking at that from? Are you looking at it from the perspective of the people who are cutting the capacity or the people who are the beneficiary of those capacity cuts?\nJamie Baker: The latter, the beneficiary, so Delta in this case.\nGlen Hauenstein: I would say, if you think about how it it was just normal course of business, and this is just hypothetical, that if you're cutting capacity, you're cutting your worse routes first, so the upside accrual from that to the remaining capacity is actually the least. And as you move through and go up to better and better capacity cuts that more and more accrues to the remaining capacity.\nJamie Baker: Okay. All right. That's very helpful. And then second, on corporate demand, I'm curious what sort of recovery you're thinking about for 2025? But more importantly, does it influence how you think about the network? I mean, hypothetically, I'm not arguing that this would happen. But if we saw a full restoration to where corporate trends would be had COVID not occurred would you need to rebalance the network much or would it simply be an exercise of potentially allocating less capacity to lower fare buckets? Thanks.\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I would suggest it's the latter.\nJamie Baker: Okay.\nGlen Hauenstein: As we pointed out that premium products are really doing much better currently than coach. And as we move through the next couple of schedule changes and adjustments heading into the tail end of the year, we expect that momentum to pick up as the carriers that have primarily coach products begin rationalizing capacity. So I think we always have room for our business customers onboard our network. And clearly, if certain companies pick up business or start new factories, we're always talking to our clients to see where they might need additional capacity. But generally, I think we're in a very good spot.\nJamie Baker: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live.\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Glen, I was wondering, if you could give a little bit more color on how you're thinking about kind of the unit revenue projection in the fourth quarter by entities and just the kind of the trends beyond the elections?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I got -- something is wrong with your phone there. So you're asking about trends after the election by entity?\nDan Janki: For unit revenue?\nSavi Syth: What your expectations are?\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. I think, we certainly said that domestic and transatlantic are leading the way, and I think that will continue as we head into the back half of the year. Actually, I'm most excited about this winter in the transatlantic where we've done some capacity adjustments and underperforming capacity last year, and we see really encouraging signs of where we've allocated that capacity, along with robust demand in the off-season. So really looking forward to the transatlantic results. Pacific, we had some more -- some additional capacity. And as we head out of this year, I think it's -- Japan looks strong, the South Pacific looks strong. China is looking stronger as we lapse the big increase in capacity last year. And we're seeing a little weakness in South Korea, but nothing major, and so we'll keep an eye on that. And then Latin is continuing its improvement as we move through the quarter. And hopefully, we can inflect that into positive as we move into January and beyond. So I think we're sitting in a pretty good spot with all entities as we head out of this year and into 2025 and very encouraged by the trends when you look beyond the election.\nSavi Syth: Very helpful. Thank you. And if I might, just on the -- follow-up on the Hurricane Helene impact. You called out, the impact of $0.03. I know it's really early days. I was just kind of curious if you have kind of the impact of Hurricane Milton in your guidance and how you're thinking about it?\nEd Bastian: It's too early to give you that, Savi. We'll have to see what happens. If we're fortunate and it's moved out quickly, it will be modest, but we really have to see.\nSavi Syth: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.\nMike Linenberg: Yeah. Hey, Glen. I recall -- I want to say this was either the last conference call or maybe it was a conference where I think you were asked about where organic demand was relative to the fact that we were seeing demand up 7%, 8% in the summer. And I think you had indicated that actually a lot of it was promotional \u2013 driven by promotions and then our organic demand was maybe closer to about 4% domestically. When I heard you talk about in the comments in your script, you talked about domestic where it seems like supply and demand are now in sync. And if I look at where domestic supply is right now, it is about 1.5%, 2%. Are you sort of indicating that maybe domestic demand organically is around 2%? Are we running a little bit better than that? Can you just \u2013 some additional color on that?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think we haven't gotten there yet. So it's really impossible for me to say. But I would -- I think we are still in that kind of 4%-ish. So we'll see, if capacity is up 1.5% or 2% as we get through these next few months. And we see continued positive momentum in yield that will tell. And I think that's what we're encouraged about. And that's what we're excited about as we head to the end of this year as we think this balance has been -- has not been as good in quite some time.\nMike Linenberg: Great. And then just my second question, I think, on the distribution front, it does look like you've -- I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, you may have recently sort of renewed your agreements with all of the GDSs. And I know that you've been moving more into sort of the -- on the NDC side with respect to distribution. How should we think about that, your cost of distribution. Is that going to be maybe a potential tailwind as we head into 2025? Thanks for taking my question.\nGlen Hauenstein: I think our strategy is really one, we want to meet customers where they want to be and if they're going to use -- if they want to use OTAs, if they want to use GDS, we want to have the best suite of products in each one of those. And over time, I think you've seen a decrease in distribution costs and will that continue? I don't know, that's what consumers want to do. And I think our job is to make sure that we have best-in-class products on the shelves at all of our distributors.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Really outside of you guys and United, the industry continues to try to reinvent itself through product and network changes. When you think about the opportunity that presents to you, just how aggressive do you like pretend -- like thinking -- or thinking about being just given the turmoil and others, like, you\u2019re already deepening your moat like in real time. I\u2019m just trying to understand how deep it is or how deep you can get it from here? Thanks.\nGlen Hauenstein: First, I think we'll have much more to talk about that at Investor Day because that really goes to the strategy in the next three years. But I think our strategy is consistent to develop free cash flow, pay down our debt and that to be a great moat in the long-term. So maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about that.\nDan Janki: I think as you -- Conor, as you -- we want to build off of our success that we had. And if you look at it even over the last decade, but even over the last 18 months, that durability of earnings to be double-digit when the industry has been down and to deliver double-digit margins over that period of time, I think, continue to speak to the durability of the franchise and the ability to create the profitability but generate the cash. And Glen picked up on a word there, which is consistency. You're just going to consistently see us do it, whether it's how we execute commercially, where we put our aircraft, the amount of aircraft that we're taking, the investment back in the business, we're just -- that consistency of executing the strategy has always been core to Delta and will continue to be core.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. That's helpful. And then we're starting to hear a little bit more or see the products that the domestic leisure carriers are offering. And when you look at Delta Comfort+ in that offering and compare it to what the industry is announcing, you talked a little bit about Delta Sync, but what else is there to kind of to widen that gap to the new products that are already out there or that are being announced, I should say? Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: I hope you're available in November to come to our Investor Day because I think we'll have a lot of exciting things for you to take a look at.\nDan Janki: Coming out theme today.\nEd Bastian: Hey, Conor. This is Ed. And Glen is right. We'll be spending a lot of time talking about that next month. But this is a platform we've been on for 15 years, right? So I understand how others are now looking to adapt. It's really hard to change course and to try to catch what is a train that's moving at a pretty good speed. I should say, a plane really moving at a pretty good speed or whether it's the investment in the lounges that you're seeing and the Delta One experience, the free Wi-Fi, and I know everybody wants to do free Wi-Fi now. And we\u2019ve been out on this for years. And so we\u2019ll continue on the pace we\u2019re on. We\u2019re not going to change course. If anything, we\u2019re just going to continue to accelerate.\nConor Cunningham: See you in a month. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on seasonality, obviously, there's a lot of or a bit of noise right now in the baseline with hurricane impacts and with holiday shifts here in October. But as we look at volume growth for the industry, it looks like trends are following much more 2019 baseline than they are really last year. And so I wanted to ask you, do you see seasonality changing on the leisure side or on the corporate travel side, and was there anything about this time last year that was an anomaly?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, you mentioned one, it was the shift of the Jewish holidays into October for September, of course, the hurricanes. But I think if you take a broader longer-term vision, we have seen really, August, in particular, but to a slightly lesser extent, July become less peaky, particularly in long-haul international and that September and October are becoming prime travel months. And I think that's something that will continue as schools continue to go back earlier in a lot of the country. And the weather in Europe in August is really hot and that people who have choices when they can take their vacations, are moving into, let's call it, more temperate months. Corporate, we haven't seen much change year-over-year, but I think it's continuing to shift travel to Europe, in particular, from July and August peak to a September and October peak.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful. And then just -- thanks, Glen. Just for my follow-up, as you think about more modest fleet growth, less training investment, less maintenance investment, maybe there should be a question mark at the end of that one, going forward. What inning are we in for productivity recovery at Delta and what metrics should we be watching on that front? Thank you.\nDan Janki: We are -- thanks, Duane. Yes. We're still in the early innings of where we -- and we're pleased with the progress, if you look at how we ended last year in the last six months and you look at this year up, low-single digits. We expect to be 2% for the year on non-fuel cost. You're starting to see that. I think one of the proxies that we've always talked about is that we put the workforce in ahead of the operation and growth and that you'd see efficiency come off of that. So if I point you to something, look at third quarter workforce year-over-year, it's up 1.5% and the network is up over 5%, right? So you're starting to grow into those resources and drive that efficiency across your work groups. But as I talked about, different parts of our operation are a different journey and we're just starting. As you know this year, we made an incremental investment in maintenance that we talked about, the $350 million, that's having the impact that we wanted, maintenance cancels are down 75% year-to-date year-over-year. And so -- but that part of the productivity will start as we get into next year and the year beyond and the year beyond, as we make progress against that. The same with our crews. And so you're seeing it in operations that have already started, airport operations, our customer care operations, making good progress on efficiency and more will kick in as we go through next year. And we'll get the benefit of the full year of having our core hubs restored, which are a low-cost -- that will be the full impact next year, and we're going to continue to get utilization out of the fleet and better utilization out of the regional aircraft will be by next summer, 100% restored on those and continue to get better wide-body utilization as we get this extended flying season and counter seasonal flying. So all those are -- the things that you saw started today are things that you're going to hear us talk about at our Investor Day, and you're going to hear us through '25 and '26 just be components that we can build on.\nEd Bastian: And Duane, technology also plays a big role in that continued productivity opportunity as we now have our team fully up to speed and the development, the experience set where we want it to be, we'll be able to leverage those tools a little better going forward.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Great. Appreciate the thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So I know, Glen, you don't typically talk much about like monthly trends, but just directionally, just so we understand, can you maybe give some color, like, is October in your view of December, right, if we eliminate the November and the elections, are October and December positive on unit revenue?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. We're not going to give that level of detail, but I would say that October and December are significantly better than November.\nScott Group: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Dan, can you just maybe talk about some of the puts and takes to be thinking about for CASM next year? I know we'll get probably more of a guide at the Analyst Day, but just directionally just puts and takes to be thinking about?\nDan Janki: Yeah. I\u2019d say building off of \u2013 thanks, Scott. Building off the previous question, and we will share more at Investor Day. But the context is, again, consistency, right? Things that you saw this year, we\u2019re going to continue to invest back into our workforce, continue to invest back into our brand. You\u2019re going to see those consistently. But at the same time, you\u2019re going to have the benefits of efficiency growing into that workforce. You\u2019ve got the elements that I talked about with maintenance. We know \u2013 we put the incremental investment in, we\u2019ll start to get those elements back the crew, the other components associated with that. And then as Ed mentioned, longer term, technology, you start to get it next year, but that will come for years to come, the industry is built for it and we\u2019re built for it.\nScott Group: All right. Thank you, guys.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So Ed or Glen, you guys did volunteer, so maybe I'll try to provide a little bit of a preview of Investor Day out of here. But you did talk about Atlanta being up in the summer schedule next year. I think you even have a news article saying flights could be up high-single digit levels. Can you maybe specifically speak to that aspect of the strategy as you look forward without maybe giving too much away?\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure. We have really wanted, as we've said earlier in the -- coming out of COVID to solidify our positions in the coastal cities. And I think as you look at where we are today, clearly the leader in Boston, we assert ourselves as the leader in New York, made incremental improvements in Seattle and widened our lead in Los Angeles. So I put a checkmark on those. At -- to the detriment of the core hubs because we just didn't have enough assets to do it all at once. And so we're really focused, and we'll talk much more about this next week. Next year is really about some incremental adds, of course, that are key to continuing our journey in the coastal gateways. But a vast majority of that going back into our core hubs as the regional jets come back to full utilization as we can push utilization up. And I think if you take a long-term view of Atlanta over the -- not just last year or the year before, but where we've come, it's really about driving efficiency through our core hub, which represents about 30% to 35% of our total unit revenues that flow through here and really driving efficiency through that with larger gauge with actually fewer frequencies still than we had in '19, but seats that will be above that level. So another push through gauge through Atlanta as well as then taking those smaller airplanes and building our feed network back in Detroit and Minneapolis. So we're really excited about where we're going to go next year. We're going to have much more details about that all next month, but we're pumped about where we're headed for '25.\nBrandon Oglenski: Really appreciate that, Glen. And then, Dan, maybe just as a quick follow-up on that. I mean does this have broader implications for your airport costs because those seem to be part of the inflationary pressures here on the industry at whole. Going back to your core hubs, does that have a positive impact looking ahead?\nDan Janki: Yeah. When you look at that airport line, you see it in the SEC filings, right, for the quarter and year-to-date, it's up over 20%. And a third of that is these investments we made that we're making in these generational assets. And as Glen always reminds me, they're always the most expensive on day one and you grow into them over time. So the opportunity in front of us is to grow in and get better utilization out of those assets that we've invested in over this period of time. And you see it throughout the network. It's all the places that Glen talked about in regards to the New York markets with both LaGuardia, JFK, LA, Salt Lake City, but also the investment we consistently make year-in and year-out through Atlanta and continue to make that the flagship of Delta. So it will give us continued leverage.\nEd Bastian: The thing I would add, Brandon, is that the bulk of those investments are behind us. And as we see what's going on in the industry, we know there's other airports, not necessarily Delta core hubs that still have work to go. So this is something that we're going to be able to leverage over the next few years, having made the investment and starting to drive better efficiency. And I think it will be a unique opportunity for us.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom Fitzgerald from TD Cowen. Your line is live.\nTom Fitzgerald: Thanks very much for the time. This past summer, United launched an advertising network, depending on the success of that, is that something you'd look to be a fast-follower on?\nEd Bastian: This is Ed. We'll have to see what it is. There's a lot of advertising and promotion being talked about. There's not a lot of doing on that front. We're very comfortable with where we sit in that space with the free Wi-Fi, Delta Sync and the continued investment in personalization. We're not looking to push ads or try to monetize our customers as much as provide greater value to them. And I think that's the sustainable strategy over time.\nTom Fitzgerald: Thanks very much. And then just if I may, a quick modeling question. Does your fuel guide include a refinery -- or assume a refinery benefit or a refinery headwind? Thanks again for the time everyone.\nDan Janki: Yes, Tom. It has a few cents loss so a headwind as it relates to the guide.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. You guys were pretty vocal on the 2Q call that the industry had to take out capacity in 3Q and 4Q. From where you sit right now, looking at 1Q capacity, how do you feel about that? And do you feel like it's in a good spot or maybe there's more to come out or kind of how does that evolve?\nGlen Hauenstein: I don't think we want to comment about any individual. But in aggregate, I think we're encouraged by where the industry is finishing this year and likely that the way things have been loading into the schedule availability tapes, that there's probably more to come out of the first quarter, but that's a hypothesis, not a fact.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. And maybe just a follow-up for Dan. Congrats on the investment grade here. Obviously, kind of big change from the pandemic time. Where does that lead the balance sheet kind of going into '25 and how do you think about continued debt paydown versus cash return?\nDan Janki: Yeah. That's another one we'll spend time within next month, so stay tuned on that. But again, back to consistency, we're going to be continuing to be focused on cash generation, consistent reinvestment back into the business and with a primary focus on debt and debt paydown, continue to strengthen the balance sheet, and effectively returning capital that way to investors through the accretion of the equity value of enterprise value.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. Lots went back next month looking forward to it\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning, Ed, Glen, Dan. Maybe two questions on premium. So if you look at premium cabin, it's outperformed main cabin by 9 points over the past two quarters versus the previous trend of about 5 points. So first, I guess, can we talk about the spread? How long does that continue? Does main cabin catch up or does premium have more to go?\nGlen Hauenstein: I'll take a stab at it, and Dan, feel free to add your comments. I think it's a little bit of both. I think we've got main cabin underperforming, and that was really what drove capacity rationalization, I think, by the industry because if all you have is main cabin you need to fix supply so you can get your unit revenues moving in the right direction. So I think we've seen that occurring right now and through the end of the year is that those incremental cuts -- capacity cuts come into play. So I would assume that main cabin, as we exit this year, is starting to improve on the margin. But we also think there's more to go on the premium products. And I think not to keep harping in on saying, come next month and join us for our Investor Day. But I think we'll be able to unveil why and how we think those can continue to improve over the medium and long term.\nDan Janki: Yes. I agree with both.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe the second question on that same topic. How do we think about the margin implications of the benefit in the main cabin catch-up, which is clearly underperforming? Does it have a lesser impact on margins as we head into '25 or do you see premium and main continuing to grow at the same rate?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think, yeah, I think that's hard to say that we parse that out at this point in time. But I think what we're seeing is a much more constructive backdrop in both, whether or not it's the continued increase in business travel as well as better distribution of our products and services in the premium cabins or whether or not it's the better supply/demand balance and coach. But I think all of those are coming into play as we head towards the end of this year.\nDan Janki: Yes.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live.\nAndrew Didora: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have already been asked. But I know I've kind of asked this on some past calls, but as we prepare for Investor Day next month, and we think about the long-term free cash flow generation potential at Delta. Dan, can you just give us a sense of kind of when you become a cash taxpayer? And I think when you were a cash taxpayer pre-pandemic, your cash tax rate was in the low to mid-teens. Does that still hold? Any color around that would be helpful. Thank you.\nDan Janki: Certainly, I'm happy to talk about cash taxes. It's a pleasure to actually be in a position where in a plan and horizon, we will be a cash taxpayer. We expect to start paying some cash taxes next year as we burn through the deferred tax asset positions that we've had, and we'll step into that over the next three years. And as you think about that -- the stabilized cash tax rate, it really depends also on where tax policy goes, legislation goes, but think of it as it will progress to the high-teens, maybe the low 20s, but we still have many years in front of us related to that.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a second one for Glen. Just from transatlantic commentary seems very positive. It seems like competitive capacity there looks pretty constructive over -- from what we can see in schedules. How would you rank the potential for transatlantic revenue generation amongst all of your entities as we head into 2025? Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: Yeah. I think domestic is going to be quite strong given the capacity levels that we're exiting the year from, and I think transatlantic will follow right behind. We have a lot of lapsing in Pacific in terms of capacity that we've added up this year that I think will be better next year. So we have some uplift there. And then, there's been -- again, we haven't talked about it much on this call, but there's been a significant amount of capacity rationalization in the leisure markets in Latin America, which I think should serve us well. So hopefully, we're looking at all of them turning into positives sometime next year, but I'd say probably domestic and transatlantic being the strongest of the two.\nAndrew Didora: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: [indiscernible] I'm sorry.\nJulie Stewart: Matthew, we will now go to our final analyst question.\nOperator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Stephen Trent from Citi. Your line is live.\nStephen Trent: Good morning, everyone and thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to dig in a little more. You mentioned your technology investments. I think I recall seeing Delta TechOps is using drones to help with -- in equipment inspections. And could you mention maybe sort of broadly thinking how you may deploy innovative solutions across your business? Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Sure, Stephen. Again, we'll talk a little bit about this next month. But we have, I think, great opportunities with the technology foundation that we've built. We are in the very early stages of understanding the potential of AI for our business, and there's no question that there are some really interesting applications to drive better predictive modeling and opportunities, whether that's on the revenue front or on the efficiency and the cost front. And the thing with AI is that you need to -- especially as you scale it, you need to make sure that your foundation is clean and reliable. And that's what we've been working on doing. So big opportunities to come, and stay tuned.\nStephen Trent: Super. Well, I'm looking forward to November and thank you very much for the time.\nJulie Stewart: That will wrap the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions.\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you don't mind, while we transition from the analysts to members of the media, if we could repeat the instructions and for the call queue, please.\nOperator: Certainly. At this time, we will be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live.\nLeslie Josephs: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the shoulder season, you mentioned, Glen, I just wanted to clarify, you said that September and October are more like the previous July and August because of the weather changes. And then, I also wanted to ask about your premium product offerings. You've been investing a lot, obviously, the LA and New York Delta One Lounges and just lounges in general. What are you thinking about for hard products, specifically Delta One? And what are some of the features that customers are asking for that maybe you're not offering now or what are some of the areas that you'd like to improve there in the cabin? Thanks.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, Leslie, I think what I said was, October and December are the better months in November is the one that's off trend because of the election. So I think that's what I said on the earlier call. Yeah, September 2. And October looked a lot like September.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. I thought you mentioned talking about the heat in Europe. I wasn't sure if that's like a permanent shift.\nGlen Hauenstein: The transatlantic demand profile is switching from July and August being super peak to more of a -- not having as big a peak in July and August and moving that travel into September and October. So it's an interesting change.\nLeslie Josephs: Got it. It is hot. And then on the hard product, what's your thinking there, especially for the [Multiple Speakers]?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think you have the whole Investor Day next month that we want to talk about it. So I don't think we want to unveil it here on this call, but hopefully, you have time to join us, and we'll talk a lot about where we want to take premium products in the next four to five years at that meeting.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live.\nAlison Sider: Thanks so much. Curious, I had an air traffic control airspace question. Curious, what you're seeing in New York, if the shift to Philadelphia is kind of how that's working out for your other New York operations, if you're seeing the hope for benefits or if you've had any problems there?\nPeter Carter: Hey, Ali. It's Peter Carter. So we were with the FAA about a week ago talking about all of this. And what I would say is that the N90s shift seems to have gone well, but we still have the same constraints in the New York aerospace that we've had for the last couple of years. So as we all know, there's a shortage of air traffic controllers. And I think the FAA is obviously engaged in trying to solve that, but it's going to take some time.\nAlison Sider: And is New York kind of still the major -- that airspace is kind of like the major bottleneck in the system? Like, how much does that ripple out to the rest of the country?\nPeter Carter: It's New York -- Florida, we're seeing some constraints as well.\nAlison Sider: Thank you.\nTim Mapes: Thanks, Ali. Matthew, we have time for one final question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. Earlier when you were talking about the rebuilding of the core hubs and you made a reference to getting all of your regional feedback up, can you give just sort of an overview of what happened with your regional feed since the pandemic and how that like maybe what level it dropped to and how it's rebuilt?\nGlen Hauenstein: Certainly, as you know, pilot constraints as the majors were hiring early in the recovery period put a lot of strain on availability of pilot crews for the regional carriers, all of them and we've been working very closely with them. And now that the industry growth are patterns are back to more normalized requirements or next year, we think the industry will generate about 5,000 new pilot jobs, which is about what it did in 2019. So returning to more normalized pilot hiring across the industry. The dearth of capacity in terms of pilots available for regionals is dissipating very quickly. And so, in the beginning, we probably had only 35% to 40% of our capacity available. Most recently, this past year, it\u2019s been more like 65% to 70%. And by next summer, we think that will be back to 100% of the capacity that we had available in 2019.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you.\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Mary. Matthew, that will wrap us up on the media questions, please.\nOperator: Certainly.\nJulie Stewart: Thank you for joining the call today, and we look forward to talking to you again in January. I think many of you next month at our Investor Day. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Glen Hauenstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work during this busy summer travel season. They are the Delta difference. Delta delivered September quarter revenue consistent with our latest guidance despite the impact from Hurricane Helene. During the quarter, unit revenue improved sequentially in all geographic entities reflecting the strength in travel demand and an improving industry backdrop. In the month of September, unit revenue inflected to positive in both domestic and transatlantic. Domestic industry seat growth moderated significantly from the peak in June, with the industry now growing seats in line with demand. Transatlantic benefited from ongoing strength in U.S. point of sale and a rebound in Paris demand as soon as the Olympics ended. Corporate travel sales were up 7% during the quarter, led by double-digit growth in coastal hubs with broad-based strength across sectors. Delta is the clear industry leader in offering premium experiences and more choices for our customers with significant investment across the travel experience over the last 15 years. Our new Delta One Lounges in New York and LA with dedicated check-in and private TSA security truly differentiate Delta's premium offering in the two largest revenue markets in the United States. We also introduced Delta Premium Select on TransCon flights between JFK and LA and we'll expand this offering to all daily frequencies next month. Similar to our international rollout, the initial customer reception to Delta Premium Select has far exceeded our expectations. Consistently delivering elevated experience that customers value is driving outperformance in premium products across geographies. During the quarter, premium revenue growth outperformed the main cabin by 9 points. At the same time, Delta is growing SkyMiles membership and deepening our customer engagement. The success of our strategy is best illustrated by our unit revenue premium relative to the industry, the growing loyalty of our brand and our increasingly diversified revenue base. Year-to-date, 57% of our revenue has been generated outside of selling main cabin seats, underpinning Delta's financial leadership and supporting durable performance that significantly outpaces the industry. Royalty revenue was up 6% versus last year, with growth in our SkyMiles membership and strengthen our American Express co-brand portfolio. American Express remuneration for the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 6% year-over-year, delivering solid performance and a backdrop of moderating inflation. Cargo revenue was 27% higher than last year with double-digit growth across all international regions. I am encouraged by the results and the opportunity to better leverage our increasingly cargo capable fleet. Looking forward, demand for travel on Delta remains healthy with continued preference for our premium offerings. Our recent corporate survey indicates a positive outlook for business demand with 85% of respondents indicating they expect their travel spend to grow in 2025. For the December quarter, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 4% over prior year on a 3% to 4% higher capacity level. The improved unit revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing into the December quarter with healthy bookings for the holiday. As we've seen historically, domestic travel demand is impacted in the weeks surrounding the election, resulting in an expected 1 point impact to system unit revenue for the quarter. With favorable industry capacity dynamics and a strong demand set, we are well positioned as we close out the year and head into 2025. Our industry leadership and differentiation has never been greater creating the foundation for us to unlock the value of our trusted customer brand and further diversify our revenue base. In closing, I'm excited about our opportunities ahead, and I look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day next month. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan. Absolutely. I think it's -- if you were looking at our internal numbers, it's really obvious to see the trend lines where you have markets that are performing incredibly well with positive momentum in October. And then again, as soon as the week after the election is complete, and on into December and really all the way into January. So if you took a trend line, you would see these two weeks just being way off trend. And I think it's -- we said in the comments that it's domestic, but it's also short haul Latin. It's pretty much across the board that those two weeks are underperforming the trends before and after those weeks. Well, Jamie, I'm trying to understand whose perspective you're looking at that from? Are you looking at it from the perspective of the people who are cutting the capacity or the people who are the beneficiary of those capacity cuts? I would say, if you think about how it it was just normal course of business, and this is just hypothetical, that if you're cutting capacity, you're cutting your worse routes first, so the upside accrual from that to the remaining capacity is actually the least. And as you move through and go up to better and better capacity cuts that more and more accrues to the remaining capacity. Yeah. I would suggest it's the latter. As we pointed out that premium products are really doing much better currently than coach. And as we move through the next couple of schedule changes and adjustments heading into the tail end of the year, we expect that momentum to pick up as the carriers that have primarily coach products begin rationalizing capacity. So I think we always have room for our business customers onboard our network. And clearly, if certain companies pick up business or start new factories, we're always talking to our clients to see where they might need additional capacity. But generally, I think we're in a very good spot. Yeah. I got -- something is wrong with your phone there. So you're asking about trends after the election by entity? Right. I think, we certainly said that domestic and transatlantic are leading the way, and I think that will continue as we head into the back half of the year. Actually, I'm most excited about this winter in the transatlantic where we've done some capacity adjustments and underperforming capacity last year, and we see really encouraging signs of where we've allocated that capacity, along with robust demand in the off-season. So really looking forward to the transatlantic results. Pacific, we had some more -- some additional capacity. And as we head out of this year, I think it's -- Japan looks strong, the South Pacific looks strong. China is looking stronger as we lapse the big increase in capacity last year. And we're seeing a little weakness in South Korea, but nothing major, and so we'll keep an eye on that. And then Latin is continuing its improvement as we move through the quarter. And hopefully, we can inflect that into positive as we move into January and beyond. So I think we're sitting in a pretty good spot with all entities as we head out of this year and into 2025 and very encouraged by the trends when you look beyond the election. Yeah. I think we haven't gotten there yet. So it's really impossible for me to say. But I would -- I think we are still in that kind of 4%-ish. So we'll see, if capacity is up 1.5% or 2% as we get through these next few months. And we see continued positive momentum in yield that will tell. And I think that's what we're encouraged about. And that's what we're excited about as we head to the end of this year as we think this balance has been -- has not been as good in quite some time. I think our strategy is really one, we want to meet customers where they want to be and if they're going to use -- if they want to use OTAs, if they want to use GDS, we want to have the best suite of products in each one of those. And over time, I think you've seen a decrease in distribution costs and will that continue? I don't know, that's what consumers want to do. And I think our job is to make sure that we have best-in-class products on the shelves at all of our distributors. First, I think we'll have much more to talk about that at Investor Day because that really goes to the strategy in the next three years. But I think our strategy is consistent to develop free cash flow, pay down our debt and that to be a great moat in the long-term. So maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about that. I hope you're available in November to come to our Investor Day because I think we'll have a lot of exciting things for you to take a look at. Well, you mentioned one, it was the shift of the Jewish holidays into October for September, of course, the hurricanes. But I think if you take a broader longer-term vision, we have seen really, August, in particular, but to a slightly lesser extent, July become less peaky, particularly in long-haul international and that September and October are becoming prime travel months. And I think that's something that will continue as schools continue to go back earlier in a lot of the country. And the weather in Europe in August is really hot and that people who have choices when they can take their vacations, are moving into, let's call it, more temperate months. Corporate, we haven't seen much change year-over-year, but I think it's continuing to shift travel to Europe, in particular, from July and August peak to a September and October peak. Yeah. We're not going to give that level of detail, but I would say that October and December are significantly better than November. Thank you. Sure. We have really wanted, as we've said earlier in the -- coming out of COVID to solidify our positions in the coastal cities. And I think as you look at where we are today, clearly the leader in Boston, we assert ourselves as the leader in New York, made incremental improvements in Seattle and widened our lead in Los Angeles. So I put a checkmark on those. At -- to the detriment of the core hubs because we just didn't have enough assets to do it all at once. And so we're really focused, and we'll talk much more about this next week. Next year is really about some incremental adds, of course, that are key to continuing our journey in the coastal gateways. But a vast majority of that going back into our core hubs as the regional jets come back to full utilization as we can push utilization up. And I think if you take a long-term view of Atlanta over the -- not just last year or the year before, but where we've come, it's really about driving efficiency through our core hub, which represents about 30% to 35% of our total unit revenues that flow through here and really driving efficiency through that with larger gauge with actually fewer frequencies still than we had in '19, but seats that will be above that level. So another push through gauge through Atlanta as well as then taking those smaller airplanes and building our feed network back in Detroit and Minneapolis. So we're really excited about where we're going to go next year. We're going to have much more details about that all next month, but we're pumped about where we're headed for '25. I don't think we want to comment about any individual. But in aggregate, I think we're encouraged by where the industry is finishing this year and likely that the way things have been loading into the schedule availability tapes, that there's probably more to come out of the first quarter, but that's a hypothesis, not a fact. I'll take a stab at it, and Dan, feel free to add your comments. I think it's a little bit of both. I think we've got main cabin underperforming, and that was really what drove capacity rationalization, I think, by the industry because if all you have is main cabin you need to fix supply so you can get your unit revenues moving in the right direction.

But I think we'll be able to unveil why and how we think those can continue to improve over the medium and long term. I think, yeah, I think that's hard to say that we parse that out at this point in time. But I think what we're seeing is a much more constructive backdrop in both, whether or not it's the continued increase in business travel as well as better distribution of our products and services in the premium cabins or whether or not it's the better supply/demand balance and coach. But I think all of those are coming into play as we head towards the end of this year. Yeah. I think domestic is going to be quite strong given the capacity levels that we're exiting the year from, and I think transatlantic will follow right behind. We have a lot of lapsing in Pacific in terms of capacity that we've added up this year that I think will be better next year. So we have some uplift there. And then, there's been -- again, we haven't talked about it much on this call, but there's been a significant amount of capacity rationalization in the leisure markets in Latin America, which I think should serve us well. So hopefully, we're looking at all of them turning into positives sometime next year, but I'd say probably domestic and transatlantic being the strongest of the two. [indiscernible] I'm sorry. Well, Leslie, I think what I said was, October and December are the better months in November is the one that's off trend because of the election. So I think that's what I said on the earlier call. Yeah, September 2. And October looked a lot like September. The transatlantic demand profile is switching from July and August being super peak to more of a -- not having as big a peak in July and August and moving that travel into September and October. So it's an interesting change. I think you have the whole Investor Day next month that we want to talk about it. So I don't think we want to unveil it here on this call, but hopefully, you have time to join us, and we'll talk a lot about where we want to take premium products in the next four to five years at that meeting.

            "name": "Dan Janki",
            "content": "Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. Operationally, our teams delivered through a busy summer travel season. Year-to-date, Delta has achieved 60 days of zero cancellations, nearly twice all of last year. Today, we reported another quarter of strong financial performance with $1.3 billion of pretax income for the September quarter. On non-fuel unit costs, performance was in line with our expectations. Unit costs grew 5.7%, including a 3.2 point impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage and a 0.5 point impact from the decision to reward employees with travel passes for their hard work through the summer. Now fuel prices declined 9% over prior year, averaging $2.53 per gallon for the quarter, including a $0.03 loss from the refinery. Fuel efficiency improved approximately 1% year-over-year. During the quarter, we took delivery of nine next-gen Airbus aircraft and retired six aircraft. We continue to expect our fleet growth to be less than 2% this year with 20 net aircraft additions as half of our new deliveries are replacements. Operating cash flow year-to-date was $6.2 billion. After reinvesting $3.6 billion back into the business, we generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Strong cash generation has supported debt repayment of $2.4 billion year-to-date, including $900 million of early repayments. Gross leverage ended the quarter at 2.9 times. For the year, we expect to repay nearly $4 billion of debt, bringing our cumulative debt paydown to more than $12 billion over the last three years. As we retire secured debt, and pay cash for our aircraft, our unencumbered asset base is expected to grow to $30 billion by year end. Our financial foundation continues to strengthen. We achieved a meaningful milestone during the quarter with our balance sheet receiving an upgrade to investment grade from Fitch. Delta is now investment grade rated at Moody's and Fitch and one notch away at S&P with a positive outlook. Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect to deliver 2 points of margin, operating margin expansion and earnings growth of 30% compared to the prior year. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.20 to $2.40 per gallon, more than 20% lower year-over-year, including a few cent impact from a modest loss at the refinery. Unit costs are expected to be up 3% from last year as capacity growth moderates to 3% to 4%, keeping our full year outlook for non-fuel costs in line with our initial guidance of up low-single digit. With hiring and training normalizing, we are growing into our resources and gaining traction on efficiency and initiatives, helping fund continued investments in our people and brand. December quarter earnings are expected to be $1.60 to $1.85 per share on 11% to 13% operating margins. We are focused on finishing the year strong, delivering industry leading performance with a return to earnings growth and margin expansion, positioning us well as we head into 2025. Delta's differentiation has never been greater. Our brand and financial performance are transcending the industry, and we are generating a return on invested capital that is 5 points ahead of our cost of capital and better than half of the S&P 500. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering durable earnings and cash generation that enable us to further strengthen our balance sheet and create long-term value for our shareholders. I look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day next month. In closing, our performance is a result of the hard work of our employees. I want to thank the Delta people for continuing to go above and beyond for our customers and each other every day. Now with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A. For unit revenue? I think as you -- Conor, as you -- we want to build off of our success that we had. And if you look at it even over the last decade, but even over the last 18 months, that durability of earnings to be double-digit when the industry has been down and to deliver double-digit margins over that period of time, I think, continue to speak to the durability of the franchise and the ability to create the profitability but generate the cash. And Glen picked up on a word there, which is consistency. You're just going to consistently see us do it, whether it's how we execute commercially, where we put our aircraft, the amount of aircraft that we're taking, the investment back in the business, we're just -- that consistency of executing the strategy has always been core to Delta and will continue to be core. Coming out theme today. We are -- thanks, Duane. Yes. We're still in the early innings of where we -- and we're pleased with the progress, if you look at how we ended last year in the last six months and you look at this year up, low-single digits. We expect to be 2% for the year on non-fuel cost. You're starting to see that. I think one of the proxies that we've always talked about is that we put the workforce in ahead of the operation and growth and that you'd see efficiency come off of that. So if I point you to something, look at third quarter workforce year-over-year, it's up 1.5% and the network is up over 5%, right? So you're starting to grow into those resources and drive that efficiency across your work groups. But as I talked about, different parts of our operation are a different journey and we're just starting. As you know this year, we made an incremental investment in maintenance that we talked about, the $350 million, that's having the impact that we wanted, maintenance cancels are down 75% year-to-date year-over-year. And so -- but that part of the productivity will start as we get into next year and the year beyond and the year beyond, as we make progress against that. The same with our crews. And so you're seeing it in operations that have already started, airport operations, our customer care operations, making good progress on efficiency and more will kick in as we go through next year. And we'll get the benefit of the full year of having our core hubs restored, which are a low-cost -- that will be the full impact next year, and we're going to continue to get utilization out of the fleet and better utilization out of the regional aircraft will be by next summer, 100% restored on those and continue to get better wide-body utilization as we get this extended flying season and counter seasonal flying. So all those are -- the things that you saw started today are things that you're going to hear us talk about at our Investor Day, and you're going to hear us through '25 and '26 just be components that we can build on. Yeah. I'd say building off of \u2013 thanks, Scott. Building off the previous question, and we will share more at Investor Day. But the context is, again, consistency, right? Things that you saw this year, we're going to continue to invest back into our workforce, continue to invest back into our brand. You're going to see those consistently. But at the same time, you're going to have the benefits of efficiency growing into that workforce. You've got the elements that I talked about with maintenance. We know \u2013 we put the incremental investment in, we'll start to get those elements back the crew, the other components associated with that. And then as Ed mentioned, longer term, technology, you start to get it next year, but that will come for years to come, the industry is built for it and we're built for it. Yeah. When you look at that airport line, you see it in the SEC filings, right, for the quarter and year-to-date, it's up over 20%. And a third of that is these investments we made that we're making in these generational assets. And as Glen always reminds me, they're always the most expensive on day one and you grow into them over time. So the opportunity in front of us is to grow in and get better utilization out of those assets that we've invested in over this period of time. And you see it throughout the network. It's all the places that Glen talked about in regards to the New York markets with both LaGuardia, JFK, LA, Salt Lake City, but also the investment we consistently make year-in and year-out through Atlanta and continue to make that the flagship of Delta. So it will give us continued leverage. Yes, Tom. It has a few cents loss so a headwind as it relates to the guide. Yeah. That's another one we'll spend time within next month, so stay tuned on that. But again, back to consistency, we're going to be continuing to be focused on cash generation, consistent reinvestment back into the business and with a primary focus on debt and debt paydown, continue to strengthen the balance sheet, and effectively returning capital that way to investors through the accretion of the equity value of enterprise value. Yes. I agree with both. Yes. Certainly, I'm happy to talk about cash taxes. It's a pleasure to actually be in a position where in a plan and horizon, we will be a cash taxpayer. We expect to start paying some cash taxes next year as we burn through the deferred tax asset positions that we've had, and we'll step into that over the next three years. And as you think about that -- the stabilized cash tax rate, it really depends also on where tax policy goes, legislation goes, but think of it as it will progress to the high-teens, maybe the low 20s, but we still have many years in front of us related to that."

            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we begin, I want to provide a quick update on Hurricane Milton. Safety of our people, customers and communities is always paramount. And to that end, we've issued a fee waiver and implemented fair caps for those who need to change their travel plans or fly out of the storm's path. We've also added additional flights and up gauged aircraft into Florida this week to accommodate those evacuating the state. Between yesterday and today, we have canceled approximately 600 flights in total, but we'll have a better sense of the impact as we learn of how our airports fared overnight. Our hearts are with all those in the Southeast who have been affected during the storm season. Now turning to our earnings report. Earlier this morning, we reported our September quarter results, consistent with our latest guidance. On an earnings per share basis, our results would have been at the high end of initial guidance, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. Delta continues to lead the industry, operationally and financially, while delivering on our 2024 plan. Year-to-date, our on-time performance is best in the industry, and our completion factor leads the network carriers even when including the impact of the outage. Financially, we have delivered double-digit operating margins with nearly $3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. And following the Fitch upgrade in July, our balance sheet now has two investment-grade ratings and our dividend yield is in line with the S&P 500. Delta's year-to-date profitability is expected to represent 50% of the industry's total profits with a double-digit return on invested capital that is more than twice the industry average, reflecting the durability of our business model. I'm incredibly proud of the Delta people for delivering these results. I want to thank them for their outstanding work during this busy summer period and their dedication to providing best-in-class service for our customers. Sharing our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of our culture. With this quarter's financial performance, we've accrued nearly $1 billion year-to-date towards next February's profit sharing. We expect this will be among our top profit sharing payments in Delta's history and more than the rest of the industry combined. The combination of our industry-leading reliability and best-in-class service from our people has firmly established Delta as the premium airline of choice empowers our brand momentum. The new Delta One Lounge in JFK has been an incredible success with very high customer satisfaction. Building on this momentum, this morning, we opened our new Delta One Lounge at LAX and we will be opening our third Delta One Lounge in Boston this December and a fourth in Seattle early next year. By year-end, Delta will have over 700,000 square feet across 55 Sky Clubs and three Delta One Lounges, a one-of-a-kind position across many of the largest airports in the country. On board, we are enhancing the customer experience with the rollout of our popular Delta Sync product to more than 330 aircraft, offering SkyMiles members a personalized experience that provides a smart TV on the seat back screen. More than 90% of our domestic mainline network now offers fast free Wi-Fi. And this summer, we began introducing fast-free Wi-Fi -- excuse me, fast-free in-flight Wi-Fi on long-haul international flights. Across the network, Delta's advantages continue to build. Core hubs are nearing full restoration as we close out the year, and we are harvesting the investments we've made in coastal gateways to improve margins and support profitable international growth. Around the world, we're continuing to develop our JV partnerships and leveraging our strengths. Our recently announced summer 2025 Transatlantic schedule will build on our strong performance and our largest and most profitable international region. As brand preference continues to grow, we are driving deeper levels of engagement and our SkyMiles membership is attracting a younger consumer. We have seen a significant evolution in our active member base post-COVID, with 3 million more active members under 40 years of age, more than doubling member engagement with non-air partnerships allowing us to earn a higher share of wallet. Deeper engagement with Delta drives higher customer satisfaction, reinforces loyalty and creates greater lifetime customer value. Turning to our outlook. Consumers are continuing to prioritize premium experiences, and our core customer base is in a healthy financial position with travel remaining a top spend category. Corporate travel continues to improve and Delta is well-positioned as the business carrier of choice. And importantly, domestic supply growth continues to rationalize. Across much of the industry, there has been an accelerated pace of change and we are encouraged by the actions the industry is taking to improve profitability and returns. In the December quarter, the improved revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing. And we expect to grow earnings 30% over last year, with pre-tax income of $1.4 billion, which would mark one of the best, if not the best, fourth quarters in our history. With this, our full year outlook for earnings is expected to be around the midpoint of our initial $6 to $7 EPS guidance from the start of the year, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. As we approach the end of our three-year plan that we laid out in late 2021, we have delivered consistent financial performance, restoring our financial foundation while navigating ever changing macro in industry environments from a position of strength. Our performance is a testament to the durability we are creating at Delta, built on years of investing in our people and our product, while continuing to restore our balance sheet strength. Delta has built unmatched competitive advantages and structurally improved our business for the long-term. Next month, at our Investor Day, we will introduce an updated long-term financial framework that builds on our durability and reflects the opportunities that we see ahead to create sustainable long-term value for our owners. As we approach our 100-year anniversary next year, I've never been more excited about Delta's position and the opportunity that lies ahead. Thank you, again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance. Well, David, that's a great prelude into next month's Investor Day, where we'll be giving you our perspective on that. We did, is file our summer schedule last week and Atlanta is one of the markets where we are finally at a position to be at, if not better, than pre-COVID levels in capacity. So very excited about that. It's too early to give you that, Savi. We'll have to see what happens. If we're fortunate and it's moved out quickly, it will be modest, but we really have to see. Hey, Conor. This is Ed. And Glen is right. We'll be spending a lot of time talking about that next month. But this is a platform we've been on for 15 years, right? So I understand how others are now looking to adapt. It's really hard to change course and to try to catch what is a train that's moving at a pretty good speed. I should say, a plane really moving at a pretty good speed or whether it's the investment in the lounges that you're seeing and the Delta One experience, the free Wi-Fi, and I know everybody wants to do free Wi-Fi now. And we've been out on this for years. And so we'll continue on the pace we're on. We're not going to change course. If anything, we're just going to continue to accelerate. And Duane, technology also plays a big role in that continued productivity opportunity as we now have our team fully up to speed and the development, the experience set where we want it to be, we'll be able to leverage those tools a little better going forward. The thing I would add, Brandon, is that the bulk of those investments are behind us. And as we see what's going on in the industry, we know there's other airports, not necessarily Delta core hubs that still have work to go. So this is something that we're going to be able to leverage over the next few years, having made the investment and starting to drive better efficiency. And I think it will be a unique opportunity for us. This is Ed. We'll have to see what it is. There's a lot of advertising and promotion being talked about. There's not a lot of doing on that front. We're very comfortable with where we sit in that space with the free Wi-Fi, Delta Sync and the continued investment in personalization. We're not looking to push ads or try to monetize our customers as much as provide greater value to them. And I think that's the sustainable strategy over time. Sure, Stephen. Again, we'll talk a little bit about this next month. But we have, I think, great opportunities with the technology foundation that we've built. We are in the very early stages of understanding the potential of AI for our business, and there's no question that there are some really interesting applications to drive better predictive modeling and opportunities, whether that's on the revenue front or on the efficiency and the cost front. And the thing with AI is that you need to -- especially as you scale it, you need to make sure that your foundation is clean and reliable. And that's what we've been working on doing. So big opportunities to come, and stay tuned."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning everyone and welcome to the Delta Air Lines June Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Matthew and I'll be your coordinator. At this time all participants are on a listen-only mode until a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJulie Stewart : Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our June Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining us from Atlanta today are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible. And after the analyst Q&A, we'll move to our media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or our expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filing. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Bastian : Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported our June quarter results, posting pre-tax earnings of $2 billion or $2.36 per share, on record quarterly revenue up 5.4% over last year. These results are the second highest quarterly earnings in our history. We achieved a 15% operating margin and generated $1.3 billion of free cash during the quarter, bringing our first half free cash flow to $2.7 billion. With strong cash generation, we continued to progress our balance sheet back towards investment grade metrics and announced a 50% increase to our quarterly dividend. We delivered a return on invested capital of 13%, 5 points above our cost of capital and in the top half of the S&P 500. Delta's leadership is increasingly being recognized alongside some of the world's best companies. Just last month, Delta was ranked fourth in the Fortune 500 return on leadership by Fortune and Indigo, just behind Nvidia and Microsoft. Through the year, our teams have delivered industry-leading operational performance month in and month out, with Delta leading across all key metrics, including completion factor, on-time departures, and arrivals. This performance builds on our long-standing position as the most reliable airline in the US, and I'd like to thank all 100,000 members of our team for their exceptional work taking care of our customers each and every day. They are truly the best in the business. Recognizing the extraordinary skill and care of our people, Delta was named the 2024 Global Airline of the Year by Air Transport World at the recent IATA Annual Meeting. And for the sixth year in a row, The Points Guy ranked Delta as the best US Airline. Delta was also recently named the top-ranked carrier across all premium cabins in J.D. Power's North American Airline Satisfaction study. Sharing our success with our people is core to our culture and we are at the forefront on total rewards for our employees. We provided a 5% pay raise on the 1st of June to eligible employees and we have accrued more than $640 million in profit sharing through the first half of the year. I am confident our profit sharing payout next February will continue to lead the industry by a wide margin. Our people are the foundation that enables Delta to deliver elevated experiences to our customers. To further differentiate our service excellence, we are making high return investments that make travel more seamless and connected, including generational airport rebuilds, the most comprehensive Lounge network in the industry, expanded premium offerings, and fast free Wi-Fi on board. Just a few weeks ago, we opened our new Delta One Lounge in JFK, the first of its kind. It offers a variety of world-class amenities for our customers, from fine dining to spa treatments. And later this year, we'll open Delta One Lounges in Boston and Los Angeles and in Seattle early next year. We're also enhancing existing Delta Sky clubs with the recent expansion of the Miami and LaGuardia clubs. On board, we have upgraded service in our Delta Premium Select Cabin and will expand this popular product to select transcontinental flights this fall. We recently released the most comprehensive refresh of the Fly Delta app in the last five years. Updates to the app added new features and functionality to save customers time and manage their travel even when the unexpected happens. Since the launch a record number of customers have visited the app with self-service usage during periods of disruption up five full points, improving the customer experience. And more and more customers are joining our SkyMiles loyalty program and deepening engagement beyond flight, with about 30% of our active members carrying a Delta SkyMiles American Express credit card in their wallet. New card acquisitions are skewing younger, and the overall portfolio continues to shift to a more premium mix, positioning us well to achieve our long-term remuneration goal of $10 billion. Finally, just this week we are excited to announce an exclusive partnership with Riyadh Air, a new global carrier that will begin service in Saudi Arabia next year. Riyadh Air will be the Premier International Airline for Saudi Arabia, and its partnership will expand connectivity and premium travel options for both airlines across North America, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and beyond. The agreement comes amid large-scale investments in the region that are rapidly transforming the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia into a popular destination for leisure and business travel with tremendous opportunity for growth. All of our continued investments across the travel ribbon strengthen Delta's trusted brand and build on our long-term journey to elevate the travel experience and increase our financial durability. Delta's industry leadership has never been greater, and while demand for air travel remains strong, with record TSA travel volumes up 7% from last year's levels, domestic industry [seat] (ph) growth has accelerated through the summer months, impacting yield performance in the main cabin. As the carrier of choice with a diversified revenue base, Delta is the most insulated from this dynamic. We are delivering double-digit margins and strong returns in this environment, with Delta expected to generate 50% of the industry's profitability in the first half of the year, despite only representing 20% of the market capacity. That said, we are encouraged by the actions the industry is taking. Seat growth is decelerating, and there appears to be increased focus on improving financial performance. While our returns are strong, I'm confident that we'll see an even more constructive industry backdrop through the back half of the year and into 2025. Turning to our outlook, travel remains a top purchase priority, and Delta's core customers are in a healthy position. The secular shift in consumer spend to prioritize experiences align perfectly with Delta's strategy and premium focus across our global network. Air travel demand is at record levels with this past Sunday marking Delta's highest-ever summer revenue day. For the September quarter, we expect continued demand strength, a double-digit operating margin, and a pre-tax profit of approximately $1.5 billion. Glen and Dan will provide more details on our third quarter outlook. With strong first half performance and good visibility into the second half, we remain confident in our full year guidance for earnings of $6 to $7 per share, free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion, and leverage of 2.5 times. In closing, as we approach our 100-year anniversary in 2025, Delta is in a stronger position than ever before. Our industry-leading performance reflects the strength of Delta's differentiated brand and returns-focused strategy. And with our clear prioritization of free cash flow and debt reduction, Delta is exceptionally well-positioned to deliver significant shareholder value. We look forward to sharing more about our long-term strategic and financial goals at our upcoming Investor Day in New York this November. Thank you again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance.\nGlen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication. They are the Delta difference. Revenue for the June quarter increased 5.4% year-over-year to a record $15.4 billion. Total unit revenue was down 2.6% compared to last year, below our guidance due to three dynamics. First, domestic industry seat growth accelerated into the summer months beyond normal demand growth. This has impacted main cabin unit revenue trends through the summer. With scheduled seat growth decelerating into the fall, June and July will be the low point with unit revenue trends expected to significantly improve in August and beyond. Second, we are seeing about a $100 million impact on travel to Paris for the Olympics from June to August. Outside of this temporary event, summer travel demand to Europe is strong and consistent with our expectations. And lastly, as Ed noted, we ran a great operation with a high completion factor. Premium continued to outperform and differentiate our results. Premium revenue was up 10% over prior year with positive unit revenue growth. We have runway ahead as we continue adding more premium seats to our aircraft, improving our retailing capabilities, and further segmenting our products. Loyalty has also outperformed with revenue up 8% as our SkyMiles member base continues to expand. Spend growth in our co-brand card portfolio is expected to continue outpacing the credit card industry. American Express Renumeration for the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Cargo revenue was 16% higher than the previous year, a significant improvement from the last 12 months, and we are encouraged by the trends we're seeing. Diverse revenue streams generated 56% of total revenue. These valuable revenue streams led by premium and loyalty are continuing higher growth and margins underpinning Delta's industry-leading financial performance and increasing our financial durability. Domestic passenger revenue was up 5% over the prior year, and international passenger revenue grew up 4% over last year's record June quarter. As the business carrier of choice, Delta benefited from double-digit volume growth in this high-value segment with broad demand and growth across all sectors. Looking forward, demand for travel on Delta remains robust. Our core customer base is healthy, and demand for premium products continues to outperform the main cabin. We expect the strong growth in business travel to continue, with 90% of companies in our recent corporate survey saying they intend to maintain or increase travel volumes in the back half of the year. International demand is strong and continues to benefit from demographic shifts, US point-of-sale changes, and an extension of the leisure travel season. As our international network and core hubs approach full restoration and we return to a more normal cadence of retiring aircraft, Delta's capacity growth decelerates into the second half of the year. For the September quarter, we expect capacity growth of 5% to 6% and revenue growth of 2% to 4%. Total unit revenue is expected to sequentially improve each month. In domestic, we expect an inflection to positive unit revenue growth in the month of September. We also expect transatlantic unit revenue trends to improve into the fall. And in Latin America, we expect unit revenue trends to progressively improve through the back half of the year. Lastly, in the Pacific, we are continuing to restore our network and are very pleased with the early results from our new service to Taipei and the success of our partnership with Korean Air. Pacific margins are sustaining at a meaningfully higher level than pre-pandemic due to our multi-year restructuring driving sustainable profitability. For the full year, we expect to deliver a sustained unit revenue premium, double-digit margins and returns well in excess of our cost of capital. Our ability to deliver these outstanding results while the industry works to reestablish equilibrium reflects Delta's growing differentiation and leadership. In closing, I want to congratulate the Delta team for an outstanding first half of 2024. We are well positioned to continue our momentum through the second half and for years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials.\nDan Janki : Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the June quarter, we delivered pre-tax income of $2 billion on a 15% operating margin. Earnings of $2.36 per share was in-line with our guidance and in-line with 2019 despite fuel prices that were more than 25% higher. Non-fuel CASM was up 0.6% year-over-year, more than 1 point better than guidance primarily on stronger completion factor. A great operation is the foundation of a competitive cost structure. And in the June quarter, we delivered a 99.5% system completion factor, including 13 cancel-free brand-perfect days. For the first half, Delta has delivered 39 brand perfect days, more than all of last year combined. Fuel prices average $2.64 per gallon for the quarter. This included a $0.06 benefit from a refinery profit of $60 million. Fuel efficiency was 1.1% better than last year, benefiting from the continued renewal of our fleet and running a great operation. Operating cash flow in the first half was $4.9 billion, and after reinvesting $2.3 billion back into the business, we generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Strong cash generation has supported debt repayment of $2.1 billion year-to-date, including $900 million of early repayments. Gross leverage ended the quarter at 2.8 times. We remain on track to repay $4 billion of debt this year and are committed to further strengthening our balance sheet with a focus on returning to full investment grade. Delta is currently investment-grade rated at Moody's and BB+ at both S&P and Fitch with all agencies with a positive outlook. With strong results and cash flow through the first half, we announced a 50% increase in our quarterly dividend. This puts our annualized dividend yield at just over 1%, in-line with the S&P 500. Now moving to the September quarter guidance. Combined with our outlook for top-line growth, we expect an operating margin of 11% to 13% with earnings of $1.70 to $2 per share. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.60 to $2.80 per gallon, including an approximately $0.05 contribution from the refinery. Refinery margins have normalized and profits are expected to be $60 million lower compared to the third quarter of last year. Non-fuel unit costs are expected to be 1% to 2% higher than last year on 5% to 6% capacity growth. With normalized growth and consistency in delivering a great operation, we are making progress in driving efficiency and growing into our resources. On maintenance, the investment in fleet health we made since last summer are paying off, with maintenance cancellations in the first half down 77% over prior years. We continue to expect full year maintenance expense to be up $350 million over 2023, as we progress through elevated volume of heavy airframe and engine checks and continue to manage industry-wide supply constraints. The majority of this increase was in the first half of the year, with second half maintenance expense expected to be similar on a year-over-year basis. Total non-fuel unit costs in the second half are expected to increase in the low single digits, as we fund investments in our people and brand and capacity growth decelerates. For the year, our fleet growth is expected to be less than 2%, including approximately 40 aircraft deliveries and 20 retirements. Our unencumbered asset base is expected to grow to $30 billion by year-end, as we continue to pay cash for our new deliveries. We remain confident in our full year outlook of earnings of $6 to $7 per share and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion with full year CapEx expected to be $5 billion. With a continued focus on margin and returns to drive sustained cash flow generation, Delta is well-positioned to improve our balance sheet to investment-grade metrics and deliver shareholder value. In closing, Delta's industry-leading performance is a direct result of the hard work of our employees. I want to thank the Delta people for continuing to go above and beyond for our customers and each other every day. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ed for a final remark.\nEd Bastian: Thank you, Dan. And before we begin to Q&A, I want to personally recognize and congratulate Helane Becker on a very accomplished career as an analyst covering this industry for four decades. Helane, I have a great amount of respect for you and for all the work that you've done through the years. And while I know you'll be continuing in an advisory role, we will miss working with you and wish you all the best. May the golf gods be good to you. Operator, please begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.\nConor Cunningham: Hi everyone thank you. And yeah, congrats, Helane. Good luck on the golf game. In terms of the comment on September for the US domestic market, can you just help bridge the gap there? My guess is that you are pretty minimally booked for September. So is it just an industry supply getting better? Just given the discounting that's happening right now, it's just a little hard to wrap my head around. So just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: Sure, Conor. I wouldn't say we are minimally booked. We probably have about [one-third] (ph) of September bookings domestically on hand, so we have a good base. And the base we have is substantially better than the base we had going into July and August at minus 60 days. So we see a much better base. And then of course, the core economics of the industry's capacity continuing to come down and going back into a more normalized business season where business tends to tick up from August to September. So I think when you think about one of our core strengths being business, July and August, that's not ever been peak for business. So as we move back into the business season given the trends we've seen in business demand, we think that will be another uplift. So really confident about our September numbers and really confident that not only is domestic improving substantially but international is also improving dramatically.\nConor Cunningham: Helpful. And then maybe bigger picture, the issue that we've been grappling with is just like the overall structure of the industry over the next couple of years. I get the idea that the current state of industry margins need to change outside of you and United. But can you just give us -- how confident are you that there will actually be structural changes going forward? Because the pushback we get is that this is kind of just the same old industry that just continues to oversupply the market from time-to-time. So just any thoughts on the bigger industry picture there. Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I'll comment on the capacity and then let Ed take the broader question. On capacity, I do think, listen this is an industry that's always challenging itself for how much capacity can it be in the marketplace. And I've been doing this for 40 years and I've never seen the industry react so quickly to an oversupply. So we've really only been in an oversupply situation for a couple of months here, and the industry has already reacted. And I think that's very different than it was years ago where it would stay for prolonged periods of time. So I'm really excited about how the industry is behaving at this point. And for the broader question, I'll turn it back to Ed.\nEd Bastian: Yes, Conor. To Glen's point the law of economics or physics, whatever you want to say, is going to have to work. You cannot, if you are on the lower end of the industry's food chain, continue to post losses, particularly given the health of the demand set we've all seen over these last couple of years. So I don't know what form that will take, but I guarantee you, and you're already starting to see, capacity is usually the first thing that you -- lever you have available, but there will be more levers available as well. The health of the industry broadly is in pretty good shape. Now I recognize what I just said. The lower half is struggling. But if you look at where we all need to go as an industry is that we need to continue to better differentiate and provide value to our customers. Value in this industry for many years was defined as having the lowest fare in the market. That's changed. That's changed dramatically. The experience economy that we've seen that is taken hold, that's driven the high demand set that we are seeing and continue to see and even with the third quarter revenue \"disappointment\" is still going to be a record set of revenues that we are going to see this quarter. I'm convinced across the industry is rewarding those that are providing real value, meaning a better quality experience, better value for money in terms of the product we are offering and reliability. Couple that with the higher cost of entry, higher than we've ever seen, whether it is labor, whether it's the constraints in the environment, the infrastructure, OEM, engine supply, this is turning into an industry that is going to be needing to return its cost of capital or it will not be -- those that don't will not be given the opportunity to continue to run the business models they have. So I realize I'm talking my own book. And I appreciate that there is a lot of other work that others need to lift. Listen, we are driving 50% of the overall industry profitability here at Delta. There's only so much more we can do on our own. And as things get better, Delta is only going to be a beneficiary.\nConor Cunningham : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live.\nSavi Syth: Hi, good morning everyone. Just I think kind of the Boeing challenges are well understood but the update from Airbus a few weeks ago was surprising. And -- I wonder if you could talk about how you are managing through the supply chain issues. And any early thoughts on how you're thinking things evolve in 2025 in terms of just managing the operation but also in terms of kind of planning for growth.\nEd Bastian: Savi, this is Ed. I'll take that. Airbus, like Boeing continues to have certain delivery challenges, obviously nowhere close to the challenges that Boeing has experienced. And as one of Airbus' largest and best customers, Delta again is insulated somewhat from that. We are going to take largely the delivery schedule that we anticipated for the year. Yes, some may slip but you're talking about slip meaning in terms of weeks and months, not years of delay. And as long as we have, as we do have, pretty good notice of where the delays in delivery are coming, we will be just fine. In 2025, I don't anticipate us having any problems with the aircraft that we are going to need for the capacity we'd like to deploy.\nSavi Syth: And I'm guessing then on an operational standpoint, maybe not expecting any improvements either, just having just extra buffers will continue?\nEd Bastian: Well, we have a large fleet and our maintenance capabilities continue to improve. The challenge we face on the maintenance front tend to be more parts supply than anything else, as well as all these new engine platforms that are out there from the GTF to the lead to the trend stabilizing, but they continue to get better. And I think the opportunities for us, as things stabilize and as parts become more available and as new aircraft continue to deliver, will be for us to resume the retirement of our older fleet, which we indicated in the release we are already starting to do and which will create even more part availability back to our maintenance team.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. Thanks Ed. And if I might, Glen ask about on the LATAM side, you mentioned kind of encouraged about what you are seeing there. I was kind of curious on the unit revenue pressure. Is that still coming from short-haul with long-haul still largely flattish even despite the growth? And where are you expecting the improvement as you go through?\nGlen Hauenstein: Actually, long-haul south has inflected to positive and it is remaining solidly positive throughout the third quarter here. So we're pretty excited about those results. And yes, still not lapping the reduction in capacity in the leisure short-haul portfolio. But that is in play, and it looks that the industry is going to be much more disciplined in terms of capacity levels this winter versus last winter. So we are looking at really positive momentum of that moving forward and that continuing.\nSavi Syth: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live.\nJamie Baker: Good morning everybody. So Glen, there is a concept of unbundling the front cabin is one that I've been thinking about in part because unbundling and segmenting the rear cabin has been such a success for Delta and a few others. I want to be careful about asking about future pricing on that. But I'm curious what the pros and cons are in terms of possibly going down this path? Or is one price for all how we should continue to think about the D One cabin?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think you're going to have to come to Investor Day to hear more about that. We've talked conceptually about that. I think we'll be giving you more details as we get, but we are not ready to talk about the details of those plans moving forward. I think the Investor Day this year should be very exciting.\nJamie Baker: I'm confident I will work it into my schedule. And then maybe for Ed or for Glen, but at a high level, it seems that those airlines that are currently under duress, are sort of beginning to lean into premium, and maybe premium is too strong of a term, but some of the more punitive ancillary charges, change fees are disappearing. There is an option of an empty middle seat. Southwest has said they're looking at some sort of enhancement to their product. I'm just curious if this is something you and the team think about. The conventional wisdom is that premium spoils belong to Delta. But what we're seeing today is that Delta is not entirely isolated from low-end overcapacity. I'm just thinking down the road if we could find Delta isn't as isolated from, let's call it pseudo-premium overcapacity. Any thoughts there? Thanks in advance.\nEd Bastian: Well, Jamie, it's a good question. It's certainly something that we all look at. Premium is more than just putting more seats -- excuse me, more room in seats. And it's the overall experience, right? And yes, I think all of those experiments that we hear about some of the lower fare airlines or the discount airlines are considering, you can't blame them. I would -- if I was consider some of those as well. But premium is also based on a foundation of overall reliability and service, first and foremost, and that's what we have focused on and specialized and done better over the last 15 years and then the airline, we continue to get better. In fact, the operations we've run this year are the best in the industry across every measure, every month, month in and month out. That gives you then freedom to actually deliver true premium experience as compared to somewhat maybe more superficial experience. And that, to me is what we are best at. That's why business travelers choose Delta. That's why we have the opportunities internationally that we do. That's why American Express, the top credit card provider in the world, in my opinion chooses Delta as their exclusive partner. So I think there is room for more. And I would -- the industry needs to continue to find better ways in which to manage the higher costs that they are facing. Remember, the cost to serve has gone up for everybody but especially for the discounters. And the only way you can cover that is providing a better experience.\nJamie Baker: That\u2019s great, Ed. Thank you very much for that response. Take care. See you at Investor Day.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Tom Fitzgerald from TD. Your line is live.\nTom Fitzgerald: Hi everyone. Thanks very much for the time. So sticking with the premium cabin for a little bit, would you mind just unpacking just some of the trends in the first half and outlook in the second half, just among the different buckets like D One, Premium Select, domestic first class and Comfort+, paid load factors, booking, anything else notable you'd call out? Thanks.\nGlen Hauenstein: That's a lot. I think what we are very excited about this year is this is the first year that we have ubiquity in Delta Premium Select. And that program has exceeded our internal expectations with load factors in the mid-to-high 80s and fare structures that are more than 2 times what coach fares are. So really great margins there, great margins continuing in D One, domestic first leading the pack in domestic industry. We're really excited to start rolling out DPS in the [TransCon] (ph) this fall with all of our JFK-LA for those of you who follow this industry. The largest revenue market in the country is JFK-LA and having a full suite of products in that marketplace, we think will be very accretive. And we're out selling it now and September, October, advances already look very strong there. So I think continuing that elevation, the margins continue to be really in sequence with the best products continuing to have the highest margins and the Main Cabin coach having the lowest margins.\nTom Fitzgerald: That's really helpful. Thanks for that color Glen. And then just quickly, if I may, one for Dan. How should we think of, and this is a topic for the whole industry, I think but just how are you and the team thinking about the PSP loans resetting to a variable rate? I think it's SOFR plus 2 in 2025 and 2026 and just in the context of the broader deleveraging story. Thanks again for that time.\nDan Janki: Yes. As you know, we continue to focus on deleveraging. We've made a lot of progress since October [\u201820] (ph), $24 billion of debt. So deleveraging will continue to be at the forefront. When you think about those particular tranches, our first one doesn't come due. It's April of second quarter of next year. And then we have another tranche in first quarter and second quarter of 2026. We'll look at market conditions at that point in time, where we are on short-term rates versus long-term rates and whether that would be long part term part of the capital structure, it makes more sense to put in other types of debt and refi that out. And those will be things that we'll probably talk more about in detail as we get closer, especially at Investor Day, but as we get to the end of the year and the beginning of next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Hi, good morning everyone. I guess this is a question to Dan and even the team. It's always very helpful when you guys call out where your air traffic liability is and how much it's up at least since year-end. I sort of think we are at a point in the year where over the next few weeks, that's going to shift the other way. And I think it's going to be a bit more pronounced for some of those who maybe have a more seasonal Northern Hemisphere type route network. When I think about, maybe Glen, you talk about the extension of like transatlantic and also the strength that you're seeing to deep South America and how that's going to improve in the back part of the year combined with corporate. How should we think about your swings in your air traffic liability? I mean, in the past it used to be a much bigger hit to cash. And I still think for some carriers, it is going to be a bit of a wake-up call as we get into the back half of the year. But I think for you guys, like how should we think about it and maybe some of the measures that you've done to sort of mitigate that? Thanks and I have a follow-up.\nDan Janki: Through the first half, it is up. You can see that it's up $2.4 billion. It's up a few hundred million dollars over last year where it supports our revenue forecast for third quarter. As you get into the back half of the year, certainly the elongation of the tattled season helps as it relates to balance that as you go through third quarter and into fourth quarter. And also the fact that corporate continues to outgrow consumer, that is also bringing it back into what I'd say is a more normalized curve as it relates to historical perspective. When you look at it year-over-year, you still got the oddity of last year, you had multiple years of travel cut. So this is the first year that it's much cleaner as we go through and create a better base as you think about it for '24 and '25 and start to evaluate it.\nMike Linenberg : Great. And then just my second question. I think Ed or Glen, you talked about capacity cuts being one of the first levers that we'll see from other carriers. As we think about where they cut back and maybe certain airports in particular, is there an opportunity maybe for you to pick up additional gate space in some of your bigger airports? I sort of think of some of the cutbacks coming back potentially in Atlanta, Orlando, opportunities where things are tight you'll get additional real estate. Any thoughts on that?\nEd Bastian: Thanks, Mike. Listen, all I can say on that is we're always interested in serving underserved communities.\nMike Linenberg : Okay, very good.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\nScott Group: Hi, thanks. Good morning. So we've talked a lot about just the overall industry capacity outlook, but I want to try and get a little bit of Delta color, right? So your capacity was up 8% in the second quarter, you're saying 5% to 6% in the third quarter. I guess, any color you can share on your capacity plans entering 2025 just to help get the industry supply-demand more in balance? Do you anticipate getting to a GDP or sub-GDP type capacity growth? Or do you think as you plan for Delta specifically, do you think you stay above GDP?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think we are not going to give capacity growth for 2025 at this point. We've got a lot of runway left in this year. I\u2019d point out one thing that I think is really important that we ought to just note is that the difference between seats and ASMs. And many of you work your models on ASMs. Others work on seats. And I would think when you're looking within an entity, it's really the seat count that is most important because we don't sell ASMs, we sell seats. And when you think about our capacity growth although it was 8%, we only grew our seats at about 5% or less. So there is a stage length difference. And our stage length is actually a little bit longer than we had in the plan because we saw some opportunities on some of the longer-haul flying as people restructure through the year. So I'd call it back to, let's not talk about ASMs. Let's talk about seats within theater. So I think that's a much better representation of what the industry is facing and one we ought to all key in on as we move forward and trying to figure out where the industry is going. So too early for '25 in terms of capacity. That will be clearly over the back half of the year, we'll reveal more about that. But secondly, try to think about seats as our measure domestically is what we're trying to sell.\nDan Janki: And the thing I'd add on to that Glen, is that 80% of that domestic capacity growth is going into our core hubs. And to Glen's point, important point on seats, as we get into the back half of this year and fourth quarter is the first time we'll have our core hubs, restored to levels that they were from a seat perspective versus 2019.\nGlen Hauenstein: Still versus '19, we are the least restored in terms of seats.\nDan Janki: Yes.\nScott Group: Okay. And then Dan, I just want to -- when I think about the guide, right, if I just take the midpoint of the Q3 guide and then the midpoint of the full year guide, it basically implies fourth quarter earnings, just absolute earnings, pretty similar with the third quarter, and that's pretty atypical, right? It's usually -- we usually see a step down. Any color on how to think about that dynamic this year might be different?\nDan Janki: Yes. Well, fourth quarter last year was the only quarter we were down year-over-year. You also had very high fuel in the fourth quarter last year at $3. The current -- we'll have to see where that plays out, but the current forward of that is much lower so you get that benefit. And I think it's also with regards to the components that Glen's talked about is the inflection in unit revenue as you exit September moving positive and the elongated travel season and that strong international demand.\nScott Group: Thank you guys. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning and thank you guys. Maybe just taking the last two questions and putting it together, your Q4 guide is a bit wide. And how do you think about the industry capacity issues? Does it get better? Does it get more rational or does it get worse in '25 if Boeing gets the delivery cadence back?\nEd Bastian: Sheila, hi this is Ed. I just want to be clear, we haven't given explicit Q4 guide. So I appreciate your models driving us there. We still have our full year guide with a pretty wide range as you noted in there. You may recall last year at this time, when things were really starting to look promising, we upped our full year guide and we got punished a few months later as the fuel [guides] (ph) worked against us. So we're confident we'll end up in a good point within the full year range. But I don't really want to get into trying to figure out what Q4 is here.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Can you maybe comment on how you think about Boeing's delivery cadence improving next year and how that impacts the industry?\nEd Bastian: Well, as I mentioned, we are confident in our Airbus delivery stream. We have no Boeing aircraft coming over the next handful of years I anticipate. I think it will take some time before Boeing gets their cadence back. I know they're slowly starting to improve and we'll see.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hi, thanks good morning. Just a follow-up on corporate travel into September and beyond. Can you remind us what the headwind was in the fourth quarter of last year from strikes in the auto and entertainment industries?\nGlen Hauenstein: So if you recall, yes we were heading into the writers' strike right about this time last year, and we were in the auto in the -- really in October time frame at its peak. So that was a -- I believe, we think that's about $100 million in terms of a headwind for us or a tailwind this year as we come into the fourth quarter.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And Glen, maybe just to stick with you. Can you talk a little bit about your outlook for transatlantic in 3Q overall, maybe overall and ex-Paris? Any bookings commentary you could point to post the Olympics? Appreciate you taking the questions.\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes. Well, ex Paris, we were positive. And so for those of you who follow my bet with -- and I lost my bet because Paris was a little bit bigger than we thought. So actually--.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I didn't want to remind you of it on the call but I'm glad you brought it up.\nGlen Hauenstein: That was an expensive miss for me, so good for the employee care fund though. And so as we look at past the Olympics, we see a very robust fall demand for transatlantic. And we're too early to say that it's inflected to positive yet because we have -- but it could very well inflect to positive. I would be disappointed if it didn't, but that's a personal opinion, not an official guide.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hi, good morning everyone. And thanks for taking my question. Ed or Glen, if I can come back to Scott's first question, thinking about things you can control, especially as margins aren't at your target yet. Ed, I know you talked a lot about industry capacity coming down into the fourth quarter. But maybe beyond your own capacity in the seats discussion, what are other levers you guys are pulling behind the scenes here to help drive improvement?\nEd Bastian: Well, I think there is quite a bit. Clearly, as the demand set that we see in our specific customer base continues to look healthy, we are going to continue investing there. We've got a pretty robust set of new offerings coming in, in the premium space. Wi-Fi is going to be free and fast and fully available -- and largely fully available on the transatlantic by the end of the summer, which is a big deal for us. On the cost side, we had really good cost performance in the first half of the year. I anticipate that we're going to continue to hold that. I realize the third quarter [guide's had] (ph) touch larger than what we saw in Q2, but we're going to work hard to get that back down. I think we've all talked about the opportunity this year on the cost front to continue to grow into our larger headcount. We are not there yet. We still have more growth opportunities to get there. So I think across the board, Brandon, we have opportunities. And we are certainly not sitting back waiting for the industry to fix itself. If that was the case, we wouldn't be delivering the outstanding level of profitability that we are. But we hope that, that's going to be another tailwind for Delta.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate that response. And maybe, Dan as a follow-up, can you talk about headcount trends into next year and if you are seeing efficiencies as you restore your core hubs?\nDan Janki: Yes, we are. And just this year alone, we will have headcount that will grow -- our resources will grow just under 2% while we are growing the network at mid-single digits. And I think -- and that's been the case even versus trailing 12 months, we're up only 3% on our resources versus the growth that we've demonstrated. And I think that -- and delivered. So I think that is kind of the leading edge of us, the step here, first few steps here of us growing back into those resources and those capabilities. And it is just not people, right? It's the aircraft and the utilization of the aircraft. It's growing into the airports and the investment that we made. Glen always reminds me, the most expensive day is the first day that you open it. So it's across the board.\nEd Bastian: And one other thing, Brandon this is Ed again. Don't lose sight of the free cash we're throwing off. This year, we'll throw off between $3 billion and $4 billion. I'm confident in that guide which we gave at the start of the year. I expect at least as good next year again. The compounded effect of all that cash and we'll continue to delever the balance sheet is once again going to differentiate Delta within this industry.\nBrandon Oglenski : Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, good morning everyone. I just want to follow up -- a couple of follow-ups here. One is on the international commentary. You guys said a couple of times international is looking pretty strong through the fall. Is that just spillover, like from the air pocket for the Olympics kind of spreading to other periods? Are you seeing an acceleration there in any particular geographies? If you can unpack that, that would be great.\nGlen Hauenstein: I think generally, we see the season extending as a whole group of people, whether or not it's retirees, whether or not it's people with double incomes and without children, who don't have the school concerns. It is actually a better time to go to Europe in September and October than it is potentially in July and August when the weather is so hot and everything is so packed. So we are really seeing an extension into September and October and really into through November that European demand across the Board is remaining strong. So that's very exciting for us. The same thing is happening in the leisure markets in the Pacific. Interestingly enough, Japan has turned into a US point-of-sale leisure market with the Yen hitting at JPY160. So we have really record numbers of US tourists heading to Japan, which is such a great destination. And again, that has a very strong fall season. So really looking at US origin, high-end leisure extending the season through October and into November.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. That's great color. And maybe a follow-up on the previous discussion on the premiumization of the industry. Kind of as the lower-cost carriers push towards premium, I just wanted to kind of clarify your comments. Are you saying that there is more opportunity for you guys to kind of push up kind of as the bottom comes up? And kind of do you have a sense of how high you can go? Or I mean, there is also some concern that as others premiumize, there is going to be more competition for a fixed set of premium demand. How do you see that playing out?\nEd Bastian: Well, I think it's both. We have and we continue to have opportunities to grow premium. Premium's growing double digit for us and we don't see that slowing down. So Delta, on its own right, continues to grow there. And what will happen is, as others, if they do choose to continue to upgrade their products, it is going to force them to also upgrade their price points, which will help our Main Cabin revenues as well.\nGlen Hauenstein: That was the point, I think we should continue to reinforce is when you take away revenue streams, you have to replace them with other revenue streams. And so as the ULCCs look to make their product more value, they have to increase their base fares just to remain constant in terms of revenue. And I think that is maybe a missed point here is that's actually good for the industry.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: We'll now go to the final analyst Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Certainly. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe Dan, helpful commentary on the 2% fleet growth this year. And I know you aren't prepared to give the 2025 capacity growth now, but can you maybe help us think about the 2025 fleet or seat growth based on kind of where you see deliveries and expected retirements over the next 18 months?\nDan Janki: Yes. I think you -- as we're taking about 40 deliveries this year, as I mentioned, give or take, one or two and how it falls out. On average, when you look forward into next year, it's around 50. We're right in that 40 to 50 range associated with that and you're going to continue to see a steady drumbeat of retirements, probably in the mid-20s as we go through 2025. We'll finalize that as we get through our final plan and tweak that regards to what it is, but it's older fleets, right, the 75s starting to see some of the 76s and the 320s. And as we've all talked about, those -- as we've been trying to grow, we haven't been able to retire it what we are used to. This is the first time we're actually meaningfully retiring aircraft over the last two years to three years. And that then benefits us, right, because that then is a material stream back into our tech-ops operation, maintenance operations that can use that material and improve efficiency, which they've been so good at through the years when you look at the last decade.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. That's actually very helpful. And just as my follow-up, Ed, I know you mentioned on the last call that you feel like you still have more debt than you're comfortable with. Is there any framework you can outline in terms of just give us a sense of how you think about the proper level of debt that gets you to a much more comfortable place? Thank you.\nEd Bastian: Andrew, I think that's a perfect question for November. We'll answer that at that time.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions.\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you don\u2019t mind, as we transition from the analysts to the members of the media, if you could please repeat just the instructions for getting into the call queue, please.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, good morning everybody. Just a couple of questions. For premium economy, are you seeing most travelers buy that at the onset or the outset of their booking or are they doing buy-ups after? And is that still the most profitable part of the cabin? And then on Wi-Fi, when do you expect the entire mainline fleet to have the fast and free Wi-Fi for SkyMiles members? Thanks.\nEd Bastian: You want to take the first one?\nGlen Hauenstein: So the question was on Delta Premium Select?\nLeslie Josephs: Yes.\nGlen Hauenstein: Premium economy? We're just Premium Select. So that is mostly being bought like all of our products, at initial purchase. And as you know, we designed that to be flexible so people could do it post purchase. And they could do it with multiple forms of payment, including miles, as they upgrade for people whose companies might not allow them to buy those, that they could use their miles to upgrade into those. But still, over 80% come at initial booking.\nLeslie Josephs: And it's still the most profitable cabin?\nGlen Hauenstein: Delta Premium Select, I think in terms of profitability, it is the third most profitable, right? Our Delta One is the most profitable. It really goes down, domestic first and then Delta Premium Select. So really in terms of the hierarchy, the more premium the product, the higher the margin.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. Delta One, first class domestic and then Delta Premium Select on all routes?\nEd Bastian: And Leslie, on the Wi-Fi question, we are continuing to roll it out, making good progress. The focus right at the moment is getting our international fleet equipped. We'll have largely the transatlantic pretty well fully up and running by the end of the summer over the next couple of months. And our remaining focus after that is getting the regionals, as well as our any remaining domestic aircraft, which is principally the 717 fleet, up and running over the next 12 months to 18 months. So we are getting there. Certainly, on a passenger count level, we're well over 50% at the present time.\nLeslie Josephs: Perfect, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live.\nMary Schlangenstein: Hi, thank you. I, thaI wanted to see if you could just give us a little bit more detail on the Japan situation that you mentioned. Is that just primarily leisure? Or what is your business looking like between the US and Japan as well?\nGlen Hauenstein: The US and Japan business is quite strong. It has been since the end of the pandemic. And what we've seen is really a new Japan as a destination market. I think when the yen was JPY83, it was very difficult to be able to afford to go see Japan and all the great things that Japan has to offer. With the yen at JPY160, it's a very different world for US travelers, and they seem to be taking great advantage of that.\nMary Schlangenstein: And what about on the business side?\nGlen Hauenstein: Business continues to remain strong.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. And the other question I had was you all haven't talked for some time about the refinery and whether you're still in any sort of discussions to develop a partnership or sell the refinery. Can you give us an update on that?\nDan Janki: We're not. The refinery has been running very well. The team is doing a great job. A key part of Delta.\nMary Schlangenstein : Great, thank you.\nDan Janki: Thank you, Mary. With that, Matthew, we're right at the hour. We'll conclude the call.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported our June quarter results, posting pre-tax earnings of $2 billion or $2.36 per share, on record quarterly revenue up 5.4% over last year. These results are the second highest quarterly earnings in our history. We achieved a 15% operating margin and generated $1.3 billion of free cash during the quarter, bringing our first half free cash flow to $2.7 billion. With strong cash generation, we continued to progress our balance sheet back towards investment grade metrics and announced a 50% increase to our quarterly dividend. We delivered a return on invested capital of 13%, 5 points above our cost of capital and in the top half of the S&P 500. Delta's leadership is increasingly being recognized alongside some of the world's best companies. Just last month, Delta was ranked fourth in the Fortune 500 return on leadership by Fortune and Indigo, just behind Nvidia and Microsoft. Through the year, our teams have delivered industry-leading operational performance month in and month out, with Delta leading across all key metrics, including completion factor, on-time departures, and arrivals. This performance builds on our long-standing position as the most reliable airline in the US, and I'd like to thank all 100,000 members of our team for their exceptional work taking care of our customers each and every day. They are truly the best in the business. Recognizing the extraordinary skill and care of our people, Delta was named the 2024 Global Airline of the Year by Air Transport World at the recent IATA Annual Meeting. And for the sixth year in a row, The Points Guy ranked Delta as the best US Airline. Delta was also recently named the top-ranked carrier across all premium cabins in J.D. Power's North American Airline Satisfaction study. Sharing our success with our people is core to our culture and we are at the forefront on total rewards for our employees. We provided a 5% pay raise on the 1st of June to eligible employees and we have accrued more than $640 million in profit sharing through the first half of the year. I am confident our profit sharing payout next February will continue to lead the industry by a wide margin. Our people are the foundation that enables Delta to deliver elevated experiences to our customers. To further differentiate our service excellence, we are making high return investments that make travel more seamless and connected, including generational airport rebuilds, the most comprehensive Lounge network in the industry, expanded premium offerings, and fast free Wi-Fi on board. Just a few weeks ago, we opened our new Delta One Lounge in JFK, the first of its kind. It offers a variety of world-class amenities for our customers, from fine dining to spa treatments. And later this year, we'll open Delta One Lounges in Boston and Los Angeles and in Seattle early next year. We're also enhancing existing Delta Sky clubs with the recent expansion of the Miami and LaGuardia clubs. On board, we have upgraded service in our Delta Premium Select Cabin and will expand this popular product to select transcontinental flights this fall. We recently released the most comprehensive refresh of the Fly Delta app in the last five years. Updates to the app added new features and functionality to save customers time and manage their travel even when the unexpected happens. Since the launch a record number of customers have visited the app with self-service usage during periods of disruption up five full points, improving the customer experience. And more and more customers are joining our SkyMiles loyalty program and deepening engagement beyond flight, with about 30% of our active members carrying a Delta SkyMiles American Express credit card in their wallet. New card acquisitions are skewing younger, and the overall portfolio continues to shift to a more premium mix, positioning us well to achieve our long-term remuneration goal of $10 billion. Finally, just this week we are excited to announce an exclusive partnership with Riyadh Air, a new global carrier that will begin service in Saudi Arabia next year. Riyadh Air will be the Premier International Airline for Saudi Arabia, and its partnership will expand connectivity and premium travel options for both airlines across North America, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and beyond. The agreement comes amid large-scale investments in the region that are rapidly transforming the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia into a popular destination for leisure and business travel with tremendous opportunity for growth. All of our continued investments across the travel ribbon strengthen Delta's trusted brand and build on our long-term journey to elevate the travel experience and increase our financial durability. Delta's industry leadership has never been greater, and while demand for air travel remains strong, with record TSA travel volumes up 7% from last year's levels, domestic industry [seat] (ph) growth has accelerated through the summer months, impacting yield performance in the main cabin. As the carrier of choice with a diversified revenue base, Delta is the most insulated from this dynamic. We are delivering double-digit margins and strong returns in this environment, with Delta expected to generate 50% of the industry's profitability in the first half of the year, despite only representing 20% of the market capacity. That said, we are encouraged by the actions the industry is taking. Seat growth is decelerating, and there appears to be increased focus on improving financial performance. While our returns are strong, I'm confident that we'll see an even more constructive industry backdrop through the back half of the year and into 2025. Turning to our outlook, travel remains a top purchase priority, and Delta's core customers are in a healthy position. The secular shift in consumer spend to prioritize experiences align perfectly with Delta's strategy and premium focus across our global network. Air travel demand is at record levels with this past Sunday marking Delta's highest-ever summer revenue day. For the September quarter, we expect continued demand strength, a double-digit operating margin, and a pre-tax profit of approximately $1.5 billion. Glen and Dan will provide more details on our third quarter outlook. With strong first half performance and good visibility into the second half, we remain confident in our full year guidance for earnings of $6 to $7 per share, free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion, and leverage of 2.5 times. In closing, as we approach our 100-year anniversary in 2025, Delta is in a stronger position than ever before. Our industry-leading performance reflects the strength of Delta's differentiated brand and returns-focused strategy. And with our clear prioritization of free cash flow and debt reduction, Delta is exceptionally well-positioned to deliver significant shareholder value. We look forward to sharing more about our long-term strategic and financial goals at our upcoming Investor Day in New York this November. Thank you again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance. Thank you, Dan. And before we begin to Q&A, I want to personally recognize and congratulate Helane Becker on a very accomplished career as an analyst covering this industry for four decades. Helane, I have a great amount of respect for you and for all the work that you've done through the years. And while I know you'll be continuing in an advisory role, we will miss working with you and wish you all the best. May the golf gods be good to you. Operator, please begin the Q&A. Yes, Conor. To Glen's point the law of economics or physics, whatever you want to say, is going to have to work. You cannot, if you are on the lower end of the industry's food chain, continue to post losses, particularly given the health of the demand set we've all seen over these last couple of years. So I don't know what form that will take, but I guarantee you, and you're already starting to see, capacity is usually the first thing that you -- lever you have available, but there will be more levers available as well. The health of the industry broadly is in pretty good shape. Now I recognize what I just said. The lower half is struggling. But if you look at where we all need to go as an industry is that we need to continue to better differentiate and provide value to our customers. Value in this industry for many years was defined as having the lowest fare in the market. That's changed. That's changed dramatically. The experience economy that we've seen that is taken hold, that's driven the high demand set that we are seeing and continue to see and even with the third quarter revenue \"disappointment\" is still going to be a record set of revenues that we are going to see this quarter. I'm convinced across the industry is rewarding those that are providing real value, meaning a better quality experience, better value for money in terms of the product we are offering and reliability. Couple that with the higher cost of entry, higher than we've ever seen, whether it is labor, whether it's the constraints in the environment, the infrastructure, OEM, engine supply, this is turning into an industry that is going to be needing to return its cost of capital or it will not be -- those that don't will not be given the opportunity to continue to run the business models they have. So I realize I'm talking my own book. And I appreciate that there is a lot of other work that others need to lift. Listen, we are driving 50% of the overall industry profitability here at Delta. There's only so much more we can do on our own. And as things get better, Delta is only going to be a beneficiary. Savi, this is Ed. I'll take that. Airbus, like Boeing continues to have certain delivery challenges, obviously nowhere close to the challenges that Boeing has experienced. And as one of Airbus' largest and best customers, Delta again is insulated somewhat from that. We are going to take largely the delivery schedule that we anticipated for the year. Yes, some may slip but you're talking about slip meaning in terms of weeks and months, not years of delay. And as long as we have, as we do have, pretty good notice of where the delays in delivery are coming, we will be just fine. In 2025, I don't anticipate us having any problems with the aircraft that we are going to need for the capacity we'd like to deploy. Well, we have a large fleet and our maintenance capabilities continue to improve. The challenge we face on the maintenance front tend to be more parts supply than anything else, as well as all these new engine platforms that are out there from the GTF to the lead to the trend stabilizing, but they continue to get better. And I think the opportunities for us, as things stabilize and as parts become more available and as new aircraft continue to deliver, will be for us to resume the retirement of our older fleet, which we indicated in the release we are already starting to do and which will create even more part availability back to our maintenance team. Well, Jamie, it's a good question. It's certainly something that we all look at. Premium is more than just putting more seats -- excuse me, more room in seats. And it's the overall experience, right? And yes, I think all of those experiments that we hear about some of the lower fare airlines or the discount airlines are considering, you can't blame them. I would -- if I was consider some of those as well. But premium is also based on a foundation of overall reliability and service, first and foremost, and that's what we have focused on and specialized and done better over the last 15 years and then the airline, we continue to get better. In fact, the operations we've run this year are the best in the industry across every measure, every month, month in and month out. That gives you then freedom to actually deliver true premium experience as compared to somewhat maybe more superficial experience. And that, to me is what we are best at. That's why business travelers choose Delta. That's why we have the opportunities internationally that we do. That's why American Express, the top credit card provider in the world, in my opinion chooses Delta as their exclusive partner. So I think there is room for more. And I would -- the industry needs to continue to find better ways in which to manage the higher costs that they are facing. Remember, the cost to serve has gone up for everybody but especially for the discounters. And the only way you can cover that is providing a better experience. Thanks, Mike. Listen, all I can say on that is we're always interested in serving underserved communities. Sheila, hi this is Ed. I just want to be clear, we haven't given explicit Q4 guide. So I appreciate your models driving us there. We still have our full year guide with a pretty wide range as you noted in there. You may recall last year at this time, when things were really starting to look promising, we upped our full year guide and we got punished a few months later as the fuel [guides] (ph) worked against us. So we're confident we'll end up in a good point within the full year range. But I don't really want to get into trying to figure out what Q4 is here. Well, as I mentioned, we are confident in our Airbus delivery stream. We have no Boeing aircraft coming over the next handful of years I anticipate. I think it will take some time before Boeing gets their cadence back. I know they're slowly starting to improve and we'll see. Well, I think there is quite a bit. Clearly, as the demand set that we see in our specific customer base continues to look healthy, we are going to continue investing there. We've got a pretty robust set of new offerings coming in, in the premium space. Wi-Fi is going to be free and fast and fully available -- and largely fully available on the transatlantic by the end of the summer, which is a big deal for us. On the cost side, we had really good cost performance in the first half of the year. I anticipate that we're going to continue to hold that. I realize the third quarter [guide's had] (ph) touch larger than what we saw in Q2, but we're going to work hard to get that back down. I think we've all talked about the opportunity this year on the cost front to continue to grow into our larger headcount. We are not there yet. We still have more growth opportunities to get there. So I think across the board, Brandon, we have opportunities. And we are certainly not sitting back waiting for the industry to fix itself. If that was the case, we wouldn't be delivering the outstanding level of profitability that we are. But we hope that, that's going to be another tailwind for Delta. And one other thing, Brandon this is Ed again. Don't lose sight of the free cash we're throwing off. This year, we'll throw off between $3 billion and $4 billion. I'm confident in that guide which we gave at the start of the year. I expect at least as good next year again. The compounded effect of all that cash and we'll continue to delever the balance sheet is once again going to differentiate Delta within this industry. Well, I think it's both. We have and we continue to have opportunities to grow premium. Premium's growing double digit for us and we don't see that slowing down. So Delta, on its own right, continues to grow there. And what will happen is, as others, if they do choose to continue to upgrade their products, it is going to force them to also upgrade their price points, which will help our Main Cabin revenues as well. Andrew, I think that's a perfect question for November. We'll answer that at that time. You want to take the first one? And Leslie, on the Wi-Fi question, we are continuing to roll it out, making good progress. The focus right at the moment is getting our international fleet equipped. We'll have largely the transatlantic pretty well fully up and running by the end of the summer over the next couple of months. And our remaining focus after that is getting the regionals, as well as our any remaining domestic aircraft, which is principally the 717 fleet, up and running over the next 12 months to 18 months. So we are getting there. Certainly, on a passenger count level, we're well over 50% at the present time."

            "name": "Glen Hauenstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication. They are the Delta difference. Revenue for the June quarter increased 5.4% year-over-year to a record $15.4 billion. Total unit revenue was down 2.6% compared to last year, below our guidance due to three dynamics. First, domestic industry seat growth accelerated into the summer months beyond normal demand growth. This has impacted main cabin unit revenue trends through the summer. With scheduled seat growth decelerating into the fall, June and July will be the low point with unit revenue trends expected to significantly improve in August and beyond. Second, we are seeing about a $100 million impact on travel to Paris for the Olympics from June to August. Outside of this temporary event, summer travel demand to Europe is strong and consistent with our expectations. And lastly, as Ed noted, we ran a great operation with a high completion factor. Premium continued to outperform and differentiate our results. Premium revenue was up 10% over prior year with positive unit revenue growth. We have runway ahead as we continue adding more premium seats to our aircraft, improving our retailing capabilities, and further segmenting our products. Loyalty has also outperformed with revenue up 8% as our SkyMiles member base continues to expand. Spend growth in our co-brand card portfolio is expected to continue outpacing the credit card industry. American Express Renumeration for the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Cargo revenue was 16% higher than the previous year, a significant improvement from the last 12 months, and we are encouraged by the trends we're seeing. Diverse revenue streams generated 56% of total revenue. These valuable revenue streams led by premium and loyalty are continuing higher growth and margins underpinning Delta's industry-leading financial performance and increasing our financial durability. Domestic passenger revenue was up 5% over the prior year, and international passenger revenue grew up 4% over last year's record June quarter. As the business carrier of choice, Delta benefited from double-digit volume growth in this high-value segment with broad demand and growth across all sectors. Looking forward, demand for travel on Delta remains robust. Our core customer base is healthy, and demand for premium products continues to outperform the main cabin. We expect the strong growth in business travel to continue, with 90% of companies in our recent corporate survey saying they intend to maintain or increase travel volumes in the back half of the year. International demand is strong and continues to benefit from demographic shifts, US point-of-sale changes, and an extension of the leisure travel season. As our international network and core hubs approach full restoration and we return to a more normal cadence of retiring aircraft, Delta's capacity growth decelerates into the second half of the year. For the September quarter, we expect capacity growth of 5% to 6% and revenue growth of 2% to 4%. Total unit revenue is expected to sequentially improve each month. In domestic, we expect an inflection to positive unit revenue growth in the month of September. We also expect transatlantic unit revenue trends to improve into the fall. And in Latin America, we expect unit revenue trends to progressively improve through the back half of the year. Lastly, in the Pacific, we are continuing to restore our network and are very pleased with the early results from our new service to Taipei and the success of our partnership with Korean Air. Pacific margins are sustaining at a meaningfully higher level than pre-pandemic due to our multi-year restructuring driving sustainable profitability. For the full year, we expect to deliver a sustained unit revenue premium, double-digit margins and returns well in excess of our cost of capital. Our ability to deliver these outstanding results while the industry works to reestablish equilibrium reflects Delta's growing differentiation and leadership. In closing, I want to congratulate the Delta team for an outstanding first half of 2024. We are well positioned to continue our momentum through the second half and for years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. Sure, Conor. I wouldn't say we are minimally booked. We probably have about [one-third] (ph) of September bookings domestically on hand, so we have a good base. And the base we have is substantially better than the base we had going into July and August at minus 60 days. So we see a much better base. And then of course, the core economics of the industry's capacity continuing to come down and going back into a more normalized business season where business tends to tick up from August to September. So I think when you think about one of our core strengths being business, July and August, that's not ever been peak for business. So as we move back into the business season given the trends we've seen in business demand, we think that will be another uplift. So really confident about our September numbers and really confident that not only is domestic improving substantially but international is also improving dramatically. Well, I'll comment on the capacity and then let Ed take the broader question. On capacity, I do think, listen this is an industry that's always challenging itself for how much capacity can it be in the marketplace. And I've been doing this for 40 years and I've never seen the industry react so quickly to an oversupply. So we've really only been in an oversupply situation for a couple of months here, and the industry has already reacted. And I think that's very different than it was years ago where it would stay for prolonged periods of time. So I'm really excited about how the industry is behaving at this point. And for the broader question, I'll turn it back to Ed. Actually, long-haul south has inflected to positive and it is remaining solidly positive throughout the third quarter here. So we're pretty excited about those results. And yes, still not lapping the reduction in capacity in the leisure short-haul portfolio. But that is in play, and it looks that the industry is going to be much more disciplined in terms of capacity levels this winter versus last winter. So we are looking at really positive momentum of that moving forward and that continuing. I think you're going to have to come to Investor Day to hear more about that. We've talked conceptually about that. I think we'll be giving you more details as we get, but we are not ready to talk about the details of those plans moving forward. I think the Investor Day this year should be very exciting. That's a lot. I think what we are very excited about this year is this is the first year that we have ubiquity in Delta Premium Select. And that program has exceeded our internal expectations with load factors in the mid-to-high 80s and fare structures that are more than 2 times what coach fares are. So really great margins there, great margins continuing in D One, domestic first leading the pack in domestic industry. We're really excited to start rolling out DPS in the [TransCon] (ph) this fall with all of our JFK-LA for those of you who follow this industry. The largest revenue market in the country is JFK-LA and having a full suite of products in that marketplace, we think will be very accretive. And we're out selling it now and September, October, advances already look very strong there. So I think continuing that elevation, the margins continue to be really in sequence with the best products continuing to have the highest margins and the Main Cabin coach having the lowest margins. I think we are not going to give capacity growth for 2025 at this point. We've got a lot of runway left in this year. I'd point out one thing that I think is really important that we ought to just note is that the difference between seats and ASMs. And many of you work your models on ASMs. Others work on seats. And I would think when you're looking within an entity, it's really the seat count that is most important because we don't sell ASMs, we sell seats. And when you think about our capacity growth although it was 8%, we only grew our seats at about 5% or less. So there is a stage length difference. And our stage length is actually a little bit longer than we had in the plan because we saw some opportunities on some of the longer-haul flying as people restructure through the year. So I'd call it back to, let's not talk about ASMs. Let's talk about seats within theater. So I think that's a much better representation of what the industry is facing and one we ought to all key in on as we move forward and trying to figure out where the industry is going. So too early for '25 in terms of capacity. That will be clearly over the back half of the year, we'll reveal more about that. But secondly, try to think about seats as our measure domestically is what we're trying to sell. Still versus '19, we are the least restored in terms of seats. So if you recall, yes we were heading into the writers' strike right about this time last year, and we were in the auto in the -- really in October time frame at its peak. So that was a -- I believe, we think that's about $100 million in terms of a headwind for us or a tailwind this year as we come into the fourth quarter. Yes. Well, ex Paris, we were positive. And so for those of you who follow my bet with -- and I lost my bet because Paris was a little bit bigger than we thought. So actually--. That was an expensive miss for me, so good for the employee care fund though. And so as we look at past the Olympics, we see a very robust fall demand for transatlantic. And we're too early to say that it's inflected to positive yet because we have -- but it could very well inflect to positive. I would be disappointed if it didn't, but that's a personal opinion, not an official guide. I think generally, we see the season extending as a whole group of people, whether or not it's retirees, whether or not it's people with double incomes and without children, who don't have the school concerns. It is actually a better time to go to Europe in September and October than it is potentially in July and August when the weather is so hot and everything is so packed. So we are really seeing an extension into September and October and really into through November that European demand across the Board is remaining strong. So that's very exciting for us. The same thing is happening in the leisure markets in the Pacific. Interestingly enough, Japan has turned into a US point-of-sale leisure market with the Yen hitting at JPY160. So we have really record numbers of US tourists heading to Japan, which is such a great destination. And again, that has a very strong fall season. So really looking at US origin, high-end leisure extending the season through October and into November. That was the point, I think we should continue to reinforce is when you take away revenue streams, you have to replace them with other revenue streams. And so as the ULCCs look to make their product more value, they have to increase their base fares just to remain constant in terms of revenue. And I think that is maybe a missed point here is that's actually good for the industry. So the question was on Delta Premium Select? Premium economy? We're just Premium Select. So that is mostly being bought like all of our products, at initial purchase. And as you know, we designed that to be flexible so people could do it post purchase. And they could do it with multiple forms of payment, including miles, as they upgrade for people whose companies might not allow them to buy those, that they could use their miles to upgrade into those. But still, over 80% come at initial booking. Delta Premium Select, I think in terms of profitability, it is the third most profitable, right? Our Delta One is the most profitable. It really goes down, domestic first and then Delta Premium Select. So really in terms of the hierarchy, the more premium the product, the higher the margin. The US and Japan business is quite strong. It has been since the end of the pandemic. And what we've seen is really a new Japan as a destination market. I think when the yen was JPY83, it was very difficult to be able to afford to go see Japan and all the great things that Japan has to offer. With the yen at JPY160, it's a very different world for US travelers, and they seem to be taking great advantage of that. Business continues to remain strong."

            "content": "Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the June quarter, we delivered pre-tax income of $2 billion on a 15% operating margin. Earnings of $2.36 per share was in-line with our guidance and in-line with 2019 despite fuel prices that were more than 25% higher. Non-fuel CASM was up 0.6% year-over-year, more than 1 point better than guidance primarily on stronger completion factor. A great operation is the foundation of a competitive cost structure. And in the June quarter, we delivered a 99.5% system completion factor, including 13 cancel-free brand-perfect days. For the first half, Delta has delivered 39 brand perfect days, more than all of last year combined. Fuel prices average $2.64 per gallon for the quarter. This included a $0.06 benefit from a refinery profit of $60 million. Fuel efficiency was 1.1% better than last year, benefiting from the continued renewal of our fleet and running a great operation. Operating cash flow in the first half was $4.9 billion, and after reinvesting $2.3 billion back into the business, we generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Strong cash generation has supported debt repayment of $2.1 billion year-to-date, including $900 million of early repayments. Gross leverage ended the quarter at 2.8 times. We remain on track to repay $4 billion of debt this year and are committed to further strengthening our balance sheet with a focus on returning to full investment grade. Delta is currently investment-grade rated at Moody's and BB+ at both S&P and Fitch with all agencies with a positive outlook. With strong results and cash flow through the first half, we announced a 50% increase in our quarterly dividend. This puts our annualized dividend yield at just over 1%, in-line with the S&P 500. Now moving to the September quarter guidance. Combined with our outlook for top-line growth, we expect an operating margin of 11% to 13% with earnings of $1.70 to $2 per share. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.60 to $2.80 per gallon, including an approximately $0.05 contribution from the refinery. Refinery margins have normalized and profits are expected to be $60 million lower compared to the third quarter of last year. Non-fuel unit costs are expected to be 1% to 2% higher than last year on 5% to 6% capacity growth. With normalized growth and consistency in delivering a great operation, we are making progress in driving efficiency and growing into our resources. On maintenance, the investment in fleet health we made since last summer are paying off, with maintenance cancellations in the first half down 77% over prior years. We continue to expect full year maintenance expense to be up $350 million over 2023, as we progress through elevated volume of heavy airframe and engine checks and continue to manage industry-wide supply constraints. The majority of this increase was in the first half of the year, with second half maintenance expense expected to be similar on a year-over-year basis. Total non-fuel unit costs in the second half are expected to increase in the low single digits, as we fund investments in our people and brand and capacity growth decelerates. For the year, our fleet growth is expected to be less than 2%, including approximately 40 aircraft deliveries and 20 retirements. Our unencumbered asset base is expected to grow to $30 billion by year-end, as we continue to pay cash for our new deliveries. We remain confident in our full year outlook of earnings of $6 to $7 per share and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion with full year CapEx expected to be $5 billion. With a continued focus on margin and returns to drive sustained cash flow generation, Delta is well-positioned to improve our balance sheet to investment-grade metrics and deliver shareholder value. In closing, Delta's industry-leading performance is a direct result of the hard work of our employees. I want to thank the Delta people for continuing to go above and beyond for our customers and each other every day. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ed for a final remark. Yes. As you know, we continue to focus on deleveraging. We've made a lot of progress since October [\u201820] (ph), $24 billion of debt. So deleveraging will continue to be at the forefront. When you think about those particular tranches, our first one doesn't come due. It's April of second quarter of next year. And then we have another tranche in first quarter and second quarter of 2026. We'll look at market conditions at that point in time, where we are on short-term rates versus long-term rates and whether that would be long part term part of the capital structure, it makes more sense to put in other types of debt and refi that out. And those will be things that we'll probably talk more about in detail as we get closer, especially at Investor Day, but as we get to the end of the year and the beginning of next year. Through the first half, it is up. You can see that it's up $2.4 billion. It's up a few hundred million dollars over last year where it supports our revenue forecast for third quarter. As you get into the back half of the year, certainly the elongation of the tattled season helps as it relates to balance that as you go through third quarter and into fourth quarter. And also the fact that corporate continues to outgrow consumer, that is also bringing it back into what I'd say is a more normalized curve as it relates to historical perspective. When you look at it year-over-year, you still got the oddity of last year, you had multiple years of travel cut. So this is the first year that it's much cleaner as we go through and create a better base as you think about it for '24 and '25 and start to evaluate it. And the thing I'd add on to that Glen, is that 80% of that domestic capacity growth is going into our core hubs. And to Glen's point, important point on seats, as we get into the back half of this year and fourth quarter is the first time we'll have our core hubs, restored to levels that they were from a seat perspective versus 2019. Yes. Yes. Well, fourth quarter last year was the only quarter we were down year-over-year. You also had very high fuel in the fourth quarter last year at $3. The current -- we'll have to see where that plays out, but the current forward of that is much lower so you get that benefit. And I think it's also with regards to the components that Glen's talked about is the inflection in unit revenue as you exit September moving positive and the elongated travel season and that strong international demand. Yes, we are. And just this year alone, we will have headcount that will grow -- our resources will grow just under 2% while we are growing the network at mid-single digits. And I think -- and that's been the case even versus trailing 12 months, we're up only 3% on our resources versus the growth that we've demonstrated. And I think that -- and delivered. So I think that is kind of the leading edge of us, the step here, first few steps here of us growing back into those resources and those capabilities. And it is just not people, right? It's the aircraft and the utilization of the aircraft. It's growing into the airports and the investment that we made. Glen always reminds me, the most expensive day is the first day that you open it. So it's across the board. Yes. I think you -- as we're taking about 40 deliveries this year, as I mentioned, give or take, one or two and how it falls out. On average, when you look forward into next year, it's around 50. We're right in that 40 to 50 range associated with that and you're going to continue to see a steady drumbeat of retirements, probably in the mid-20s as we go through 2025. We'll finalize that as we get through our final plan and tweak that regards to what it is, but it's older fleets, right, the 75s starting to see some of the 76s and the 320s. And as we've all talked about, those -- as we've been trying to grow, we haven't been able to retire it what we are used to. This is the first time we're actually meaningfully retiring aircraft over the last two years to three years. And that then benefits us, right, because that then is a material stream back into our tech-ops operation, maintenance operations that can use that material and improve efficiency, which they've been so good at through the years when you look at the last decade. We're not. The refinery has been running very well. The team is doing a great job. A key part of Delta. Thank you, Mary. With that, Matthew, we're right at the hour. We'll conclude the call."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJulie Stewart: Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our March quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are: CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, and Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We ask you to please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so we can get to as many of you as possible. And after the analyst Q&A, we'll move to our media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Bastian: Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported our March quarter results posting pre-tax earnings of $380 million or $0.45 per share, a $0.20 improvement over last year, and revenue that was 6% higher and a new record for first quarter. Free cash flow was $1.4 billion and we delivered a return on invested capital of nearly 14%, putting Delta's returns in the top half of the S&P 500. We are delivering industry-leading operational reliability and have widened the gap to our competition. Last summer, we made forward-leaning investments in the operation. And since then, our teams have delivered operational performance that is among the best in our history, with mainline cancellations down 85%, setting new records for completion factor in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter. I'd like to sincerely thank Delta's 100,000 people for your dedication, professionalism, and hard work in delivering these outstanding results. In February, we recognized the efforts of our people with $1.4 billion in profit-sharing, more than the rest of the industry combined, and continuing Delta's longstanding philosophy to reward industry-leading performance with industry-leading compensation. Reflecting our people-first culture, Forbes ranked Delta the fifth-best large employer in America, and Delta was recently named the 2024 Global Airline of the Year by Air Transport World for our outstanding commitment to safety, operational performance, and premium customer service. While airline travel and transportation is what we do, it's the experiences on Delta that set us apart as a leading consumer brand and why Delta was recognized as number 11 on Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies. Exciting customer-facing enhancements are on the near horizon, including the opening of new Delta One lounges in JFK, Los Angeles, and Boston, the continued introduction of modern and fuel-efficient aircraft, new premium cabin service offerings, upgrades to the Fly Delta app, and the international expansion of fast free Wi-Fi across our fleet. The rollout of Wi-Fi and Delta Sync continues to be a tremendous success. Since launching last year, customers have logged more than 45 million free streaming quality sessions on-board and millions have joined the SkyMiles program through this channel. Recognizing our investment to ensure the future of travel is connected, we took the number two spot in the travel category, a Fast Company's list of the Most Innovative Companies, the only airline to be recognized in the ranking. Loyalty to our brand has never been stronger. We continue to set new records with our remuneration from American Express, our most important commercial relationship and are well on our way to our long-term target of $10 billion. On February the 1, we announced enhanced and refreshed benefits for our Delta Sky Miles American Express Cards, providing more direct value and the customer response has been very positive. Turning to our outlook. With strong first-quarter performance and visibility into the strength of summer travel demand, we remain confident in our full year guidance for earnings of $6 -- $6 to $7 per share, free-cash-flow of $3 billion to $4 billion, and leverage of 2.5 times, the three main guideposts that we shared with you in January. For the June quarter, we expect to deliver the highest quarterly revenue in our history of mid-teens operating margin and earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Our forecast for pre-tax profit of approximately $2 billion is on par with 2019 and just shy of last year, due to higher fuel prices. Demand continues to be strong and we see a record spring and summer travel season with our 11 highest sales days in our history, all occurring this calendar year. Spending on services recently surpassed goods for the first time in five years and there is further runway to return to their long-term trends. Delta's core consumers are in a healthy position and travel remains a top purchase priority. Generational shifts and evolving consumer preferences are driving secular growth in premium experiences. And business travel demand has taken another meaningful step forward this year with growth accelerating into the mid-teens over last year. When you put this level of demand strength together with the industry's increased focus on improving financial returns, this may be the most constructive backdrop that I've seen in my airline career. Our industry-leading performance continues to demonstrate the strength of Delta's differentiated brand and returns-focused strategy. And with our disciplined approach to capital investment and focus on free cash flow, Delta is exceptionally well-positioned to further strengthen our balance sheet and deliver significant shareholder value. In closing, the momentum in the business continues to build. We are focused on delivering excellent reliability, elevating the customer experience, and improving efficiency across the Company to support growth in our earnings and cash flow. I am excited for Delta's opportunities ahead, and we'll talk more about that and provide new long-term financial targets at our Investor Day, which we are scheduling for November 19 and 20 in New York City. Please put that on your calendar. Thank you again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance.\nGlen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking our employees for providing the best service and reliability in the industry to our customers every single day. 2024 is off to a great start and we're delivering on our commercial priorities to optimize our network, grow higher-margin revenue streams, and invest in our future. Revenue for the March quarter increased 6% year-over-year to a record $12.6 billion on capacity growth of 6.8%. This result is at the high-end of our initial guidance with upside driven by industry-leading operational performance and strength in close-in bookings. Since the start of the year, we've seen a sustained acceleration in business travel. Managed corporate travel sales grew 14% over the prior year, with Technology, Consumer Services and Financial Services leading that momentum. We delivered positive unit revenues in our two largest entities, domestic and transatlantic, reflecting the continued optimization of our network. Total unit revenue growth improved 3 points sequentially to down 0.7%, including nearly a one-point headwind from cargo and MRO. Domestic revenue grew 5% with record March quarter unit revenues, up 3% over the prior year. The more than 7 point improvement from 4Q to 1Q reflects strong demand trends improving industry backdrop. International revenues grew 12% on a unit revenue decline of 3% as unit revenue growth in the transatlantic was muted by capacity investments from the continued rebuild of our Latin and Pacific franchises. Diverse high-margin revenue streams generated 57% of total revenue, differentiating Delta and underpinning industry-leading financial performance. Premium revenue was up 10% over prior year, and we have runway ahead as we continue adding more premium seats to our aircraft, improving our retailing capabilities, and further segmenting our products. Total loyalty revenue grew 12% on continued strength in the American Express co-brand portfolio with record quarterly remuneration of $1.7 billion. Following the refreshed co-brand benefits, we saw our card applications reach new records as we are seeing the highest premium acquisitions mix in our program's history. Turning to our outlook, consumer demand is robust and premium trends remain strong. The outlook for corporate travel is positive. 90% of companies in our recent survey intend to maintain or increase travel volumes in 2Q, putting us back on track to deliver record corporate revenues in the back half of this year. For the June quarter, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% on capacity growth of 6% to 7%, with unit revenues flat to down 2% from last year's very strong performance. Similar to the March quarter, 2Q faces a headwind from the normalization of travel credits. Domestically, we expect unit revenues to be flattish over the prior year, with growth focused on restoring our core hubs where departures and seats are not yet fully restored. The final stage of our core hub restoration will be the full return of regional flying. Pilot hiring has stabilized, increasing the capacity we expect to fly over the summer. We expect progressive improvement through 2025, driving higher asset utilization and improving our profitability. In the transatlantic, we are looking forward to another strong summer with record revenues. 2Q unit revenues are expected to be similar to the last year as we lock record performance and benefit from the healthy demand for our premium cabins and improved corporate trends. In Latin America, profitability remains solid. Unit revenues are expected to be down double-digits due to pressure in shortfall leisure markets. These markets are expected to see healthy improvements in the second-half of the year as supply and demand comes back into balance. And while flying into deep South America, we are very pleased with the results. We are increasing capacity about 40% with minimal impact to unit revenues as we continue to deepen our ties with our JV partner LATAM. We expect Pacific unit revenues to be in line with the prior year on 30% growth in capacity, driven by a strong demand for Korea and Japan, offsetting lower unit revenues in China. Profitability is expected to set a record as we continue to harvest the benefits of our multi-year restructuring. In closing, I'm pleased with how we have started 2024. Delta is continuing to lead on all fronts, with industry-leading margins and returns highlighting the strength of our trusted brand and differentiated commercial strategy. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials.\nDan Janki: Great. Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the March quarter, we delivered pre-tax income of $380 million, an improvement of $163 million over last year. Earnings of $0.45 per share was at the upper end of our guidance as great operational performance and strong demand more than offset higher-than-expected fuel prices. Operational excellence is central to Delta's brand promise, and I couldn't be prouder of how our teams are delivering record reliability for our customers. A strong completion factor drove a 1 point of higher capacity and non-fuel unit cost favorability. Non-fuel CASM was 1.5% above last year and ahead of guidance. Fuel prices averaged $2.76 per gallon, $0.16 higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The refinery provided a $0.05 benefit, generating a profit of $49 million. This was down $173 million from last year on more normalized refining margins. Fuel efficiency was 1.9% better than last year, benefiting from the continued renewal of our fleet and running a strong operation. Operating margin of 5.1% was a 0.5 point higher year-over-year. Our pre-tax margin improved over a point, benefiting from reduced interest, pension expense, and higher earnings from our equity investments. We generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion. This was after paying $1.4 billion in profit-sharing to our employees and investing $1.1 billion into the business. Debt reduction remains a top priority. Our leverage ratio improved to 2.9 times during the quarter. We repaid $700 million of debt, including $400 million of scheduled maturities and $300 million of additional debt initiatives. We expect to repay at least $4 billion of debt this year and continue to be opportunistic in accelerating debt reduction. We are currently investment-grade rated at Moody's and BB+ at both S&P and Fitch, with all agencies now on positive outlook following updates from Fitch and Moody's during the quarter. Moving to the June quarter guidance. Combined with our outlook for top-line growth, we expect an operating margin of 14% to 15% with earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.70 to $2.90 per gallon, including a $0.10 contribution from the refinery. At the midpoint of this range, our all-in fuel price is expected to be over 10% higher than last year. Non-fuel unit costs are expected to be approximately 2% higher than last year, consistent with our full-year outlook of low-single-digit. Growth is normalizing, and we've entered a period of optimization with a focus on restoring our most profitable core hubs and delivering efficiency gains across the enterprise. The investments we made in fleet health and reliability in the second-half of 2023 are paying off, supporting industry-leading operational performance. As we discussed with you in January, these investments are expected to continue through 2024 as we complete an elevated volume of heavy airframe and engine checks, while managing through industry-wide supply chain constraints. The intensity of hiring and training has moderated. The teams have good momentum in delivering on our efficiency goals for the year. This will help fund the investment in our people, in our operations, and the customer experience that support our revenue premium. In closing, we continue to be confident in our full-year outlook of earnings of $6 to $7 per share and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our industry-leading operational and financial performance is a result of the hard work and dedication of the Delta people. I'd like to thank each of them for what they do every day. With that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A.\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions and go to our first analyst question from Duane Pfennigwerth.\nOperator: Certainly. And at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Just on the improved cost execution, you just touched on it in the script there, Dan, but can you speak to maintenance expense and the outlook relative to your expectations? The tone sounds like you're turning a corner on maintenance, and how do you think about that line into the second-half and perhaps into next year?\nDan Janki: Well, maintenance is -- Duane, thank you. Maintenance is on plan and performing as we expected. As we talked to you at the beginning part of the year, maintenance we expect it to be up year-over-year $350 million. We expect that for the full-year, the first quarter was on plan, and the team is executing well. And those investments, as I mentioned, that we made in fleet health will continue as we go through this year, those proactive visits along touching the aircraft. You're seeing the impact. Cancellations from a maintenance perspective year-over-year were down 80% sequentially, they improved 30%. So team is doing a good job. They're on plan and as expected.\nEd Bastian: Duane, if I could add on to that, I want to congratulate the Tech Ops team, John Laughter, whose leadership over there in terms of helping to make that turn. We are seeing a renewed set of confidence back in the team. It's been a tough few years on the rebuild. Too early to declare victory. We know the supply chain continues to have a tremendous amount of constraint in it. But I'm confident that we're on a good journey. It's a good path here.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate those thoughts. And then maybe more of a conceptual one for my follow-up on corporate and the continued recovery in corporate you're pointing to. I assume that's generally close in. And I wonder if you could comment on if you're seeing a decrease in average trip length. So maybe more trips but fewer days on the road per trip. Any commentary on those trends?\nGlen Hauenstein: No, I'd just say we're seeing both. We're seeing some shorter and we're seeing some longer where people are blending the leisure trip with the business trip. So -- and generally, they are purchasing a little bit further out than they had and I think that's related to not having change fees any longer. So, we've seen some changes in the booking curve but really encouraged by what we see in terms of corporate bookings as we look forward through this quarter and as we look forward into the next couple of quarters.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.\nMike Linenberg: Oh, yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Glen, I just -- I want to get back -- you talked about the normalization of travel credits and how that still represents a bit of a headwind. What -- can you quantify what that impact is on June TRASM?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think we said in our previous that we faced headwinds in up to a couple of points. And I think we're not going to go into the details of that, but that's generally what we've disclosed in the past. Yes.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. And then just my second question to Ed. Ed, can you just give us an update on the status of the -- I guess it's an appeal process with the DOT on Aeromexico? How does that play out or I should say, what is the timeline of that and any milestones we should look forward with respect to that? Thanks.\nPeter Carter: Hey, Mike, it's Peter Carter. Thanks for the question. That was a tentative order. And I think, as you know, our strong view is, the DOT really struck out on that one. They're typically a great partner. But this was an example of regulatory overreach, which is why we've challenged it. It's bad for consumers. It's bad for competition. It's bad for the local economies that those flights have served. We are currently engaged with the administration and discussing, I'll say, less punitive solutions than the tentative order that was proposed. And I would say, we've had hundreds of our, I'll say, allies with respect to the connection between Mexico and America weigh in, in support of this joint venture. So, we think this is going to take some time before the DOT issues a final order, a number of months, but we're cautiously optimistic that they are going to come up with a better solution.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thanks for that, Peter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, Glen, when I think about the original guide for the year or three months ago, I think it was sort of flat RASM for the year. So, we're down slightly in Q1, midpoint of guide for Q2 down slightly. So, what's the -- what's your visibility to second half RASM inflection? I guess ultimately, at this point, do you see more upside or downside risk to that flat RASM? And maybe just with that like the travel credit headwind, is that bigger or smaller in second-half?\nGlen Hauenstein: No, I think it's pretty -- first on the travel credit headwinds, it's consistent through the year. But what I would say is that we're ahead of our internal plan to get to flattish for the year and the comps get easier as we move through the year. And if you look at the back half of guidance as well as what people have loaded in their schedules, it looks like industry capacity is reaching a peak in 2Q. So, I think we see a great setup for the back half of this year and we're on plan or ahead of plan for where we sit right now.\nScott Group: Okay. And then, I just want to follow-up just on RASM a little bit. So, if you just -- last year, your absolute RASM in the second quarter just meaningfully outperformed seasonality, and then you underperformed in Q3, right? If you look this year, you're guiding again like to really outperform like pre-pandemic seasonality. I'm wondering, do you think that there is a seasonal shift from Q3 into Q2 relative to what we used to see and does that help in Q2? Does it potentially hurt Q3? I'm just curious your thoughts on that.\nEd Bastian: I have thoughts, some very -- yes, it has changed. And it's related to schools coming back in the South in particular earlier and earlier into August. As a matter of fact, here I believe schools in Georgia go back the first week of August now. And so, that has materially changed, I think over the years, making the second quarter stronger and making the third quarter a bit weaker. But I think we're -- as we think about how we plan that now, we're incorporating that into our capacity plans moving forward.\nScott Group: Okay. All right. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, it looks like your leverage is getting to be in a pretty good place. When do you think you can start flexing the balance sheet for other use of cash, kind of CapEx, cash return kind of over the next 12 months?\nEd Bastian: Well, thanks, Ravi. We're not in a position yet to make any comments or any decisions around that. We still have more debt than we're comfortable with and that continues to be the first call on cash to continue to take risk off the table. Interesting, I was looking at some numbers preparing for this call, if you look at our target for the end of this year and you factor in that we actually have eliminated the Pension H obligation, which we had at the end of 2019. We're actually pretty close to the leverage ratio we were at the end of 2019 entering the pandemic. So, we have made a lot of progress. That said, we'll be talking a bit about that at our Investor Day in November. And -- but the first call will be and will be for some time to pay down the debt. Yes.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up and a little bit of a nuanced detail question here, kind of obviously, with the Paris Olympics kind of being a pretty big catalyst for transatlantic travel in this summer, kind of are we thinking of that potentially bringing on some noise towards end of 2Q, early 3Q? Kind of is that something that you would caution us in terms of modeling our cadence versus seasonality?\nEd Bastian: Well, generally, the Olympics are not good for airline revenues, and this year I think is no exception to that. So, while we see a very favorable backdrop for Europe in its totality, there are some challenges for Paris as generally business travel ceases to and from the local markets as the Olympics approach. So, I wouldn't say that that's going to be a windfall. It's actually going to be a bit of a headwind for us in the numbers we shared with you.\nGlen Hauenstein: That said, we are very excited as the sponsor of Team USA for the Paris Olympics and we'll get through it.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Your line is live.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. So, hi, team. I just have two questions. In the first quarter, your landing fee seemed a little bit higher than I would normally expect to see for a first quarter. Is that -- maybe you can explain that rather than me suggesting what it could be? And then for my follow-up question, one of the issues that American Express cardholders have, of which I am one, is acceptance rate, especially in Europe. And I'm wondering if you're starting to see an improvement in that area as well. Thank you.\nDan Janki: Yes. On landing fees, when you look at it year-over-year, yes, they're up, volume, one; two related to the cut-in as it relates to our generational redevelopment projects, you're picking up some of that expense. And then I would say the third item, airports across the country in 2022 and 2023 benefited from Cares. And as those have now gone away, they're adjusting their rates and you're seeing that come through.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's very helpful.\nEd Bastian: And on American Express global acceptance rates, we worked very hard years back with American Express on improving the domestic acceptance rates and right now they're at all-time highs in terms of the number of merchants that you can use American Express at domestically and they are also doing that internationally. So, particularly places that we're strong and we work with them on prioritizing those places that Americans like to go for vacations.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Well, that's very helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live.\nAndrew Didora: Hey, good morning, everyone. So, Glen, I had a question just with regards to your capacity. How are you thinking about the cadence as we move into the back half of the year? Obviously, with the first half capacity up north of 6%, 3Q schedules are still sort of above your 3% to 5% original guide. How should we think about your growth as we move through the back of the year, because it would imply-based on 3Q schedules that 4Q would be down. I kind of find that hard to believe, but just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: I think we're going to -- first of all, thanks to our operating teams who have given us such exceptional completion factors that accounted for even higher than we had planned for. So, I'd say if those continue, which I imagine they will or hope they will, that we would be at the high of the 3% to 5%. And I think it's a bit early to say, but I think that we will be right at that 5% depending on how the completion factor comes in.\nAndrew Didora: That's helpful. Thank you. And then, I think in your prepared remarks, you spoke to MRO -- MRO headwinds in the ancillary revenue line in the quarter. What is driving that? I just would have thought, given everyone's elevated maintenance expense, it would have been a little bit more of a tailwind. Any thoughts there? Thank you.\nDan Janki: Yes. I'd say two things. One is, as it relates to our third-party activity, it's just -- we're always -- we're constrained by what the industry is constrained by, which is material and ability to generate that output. And as we've talked about, our Tech Ops team, John, and the team are focused on the Delta fleet. So -- but I would say the constraint continues to be immaterial and turnaround times associated with it.\nAndrew Didora: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from J.P. Morgan. Your line is live.\nJamie Baker: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. A couple for Glen. First on the topic of RASM premiums. Pre-COVID, you were running about a 20% domestic premium to the industry and I think you were roughly flat on international. You and I spoke on one of the earnings calls as to what that -- what the path to achieving an international RASM premium might look like. Can we revisit that topic? Where is Delta currently both domestic and international? And where do you see that heading from here in a post-COVID world?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, thanks for the question, Jamie. I think right now, we believe we are running international RASM premiums that are primarily been driven by higher load factors on the fleet. But as the fleet continues to evolve and we continue to put more premium seats in the mix, we believe that is one of the key drivers for us to continue to accelerate our relative performance to our industry peers. So, I think we're on a journey there and I think we are now generating premiums consistently and hopefully, we can accelerate those over the next several years as we execute on our plans to differentiate Delta.\nJamie Baker: And as a follow-up, Glen, on premium, so premium revenue was up 10% in the quarter, main cabin was up 4%. What can you tell us about the constitution of that 4%? For example, what's the trend with basic economy, what percent of main cabin passengers are SkyMiles members compared to the premium cabins, that sort of thing? I'm just trying to understand where the 4% is coming from. Are those new customers? Are you taking share from discounters, that sort of thing? Thanks.\nGlen Hauenstein: I think in the quarter, we ran a record domestic load factor in the first quarter. So, what I believe drove that was the incremental traffic that we took over historical levels. So, pretty excited about doing that in the first quarter, as you know, the first quarter is the most challenging in terms of loads. And for us to come through that quarter with the premiums that we took, I think really is a testament to the strength of our brand. And of course, as we get through the year, there'll be less and less discounted seats available as you get towards peak, but generally, we're most open in 1Q. Yes.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So, Glen, I guess I wanted to come back to domestic growth this summer because it looks like you're jumping up to 6% or 7% from about 2% in the first quarter. And the context around this, I think investors were a little bit concerned that, that growth could lead to lower RASMs, but obviously, you're guiding to flat. So, can you dig a little bit deeper on your domestic network priorities and maybe a little bit more on regional expansion?\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. I think there -- what we've said in the past and I would like to go back to is, we kind of coming out of COVID, we had to allocate the resources that had -- we had available. And those resources went to our once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to take leading positions in places like Boston and Los Angeles at the expense of rebuilding our core hubs and we're still not done building our core hubs. And so, our ability now to go back and to put seats back into our core where our cost structure is most advantaged and where our profitability is highest is where we're focused for the rest of this year.\nDan Janki: And seat growth is about a point below, some growth that they see. Yes.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate that. And then Glen, on the Latin differentiation, I think you were talking separately about short-haul and long-haul. Can you unpack that a little bit more for us?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, we are really pleased with our South America performance. As I said in the prepared remarks, our capacity is up in the 30% to 40% range and we're doing that with minimal degradation of our unit revenue. So we're really off to a great start with LATAM and I think we have a really great future of working with them to continue to evolve as the leading carrier between the United States and South America in our joint venture. So, put that aside and then say the -- particularly, leisure destinations, there was an oversupply in the first quarter. I think in first quarter of '23, the industry saw historically higher returns. And so when there are historically high returns, everybody wants to do more of it. We did considerably more of it. The industry did considerably more of it. And listen, it was quite profitable for us, but at the expense of unit revenues. And so, as we move through next year, I'd say there's going to be probably a moderation of capacity as there always is when those things happen as well as easier comps as we get to next year. So, I'm looking forward to actually next year's comps in Latin America.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Just if we play back the performance in the US domestic market in 1Q, it was pretty fantastic when you started off saying just expecting to inflect positive in March and you saw some improvement in quarter, then an outcome of plus 3%. You've highlighted corporate momentum in premium, but I think there's a disparity in just your hub performance. Can you just talk about coastal gateways versus core hub rebuild and how things are playing out there, just in general? Thank you.\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I think we're very pleased with our coastal gateways and really they're moving in a pretty tight band right now with more capacity going to our core hubs and our core hubs generally having a higher unit revenue base than our coastal gateways, that should have a positive inflection on total revenues. And I think that gets accelerated in the second and third quarters. Again, we had probably a little bit more in Boston than we had planned on because there were some opportunities there for us to move airplanes in. But generally, we're really pleased with where we sit today and how the back half of this year should play out for us.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then, it seems like there's a potential for regulatory oversight to potentially pick up here. When you have conversations with the FAA, what are some changes that they're talking to you about just given the operating environment? And maybe what are you asking them in general? It just seems like it could be a wildcard to potential growth, maybe medium-to-long term. So, just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.\nPeter Carter: Hey, Conor, this is Peter. So, just I'd say, fundamentally with the FAA, we're working very closely with them around staffing models, because as you know, there's an air traffic control shortage. And we're also engaged in Washington trying to help solve some of those, I'll say, more structural challenges around infrastructure. You probably have seen that the industry has made a request off the FAA to extend the New York Slot Waiver another season. And that's what I would call responsible partnership with our regulator in light of the staffing challenges they've had. So, a great relationship, deep partnership with them.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. Just a follow-up to Jamie's question on the premium revenue. Just kind of curious if you could share how much of that 10% is coming from volume versus yield, and I think you mentioned continuing to grow the premium offering. So just curious what the trend might be.\nGlen Hauenstein: Right. I would say, right now, the premium is probably 50-50 split between traffic and yield.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And then in terms of the volume growth in offering, how should we think about that?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I think we've said that, if you look at the longer-term trends, that we really haven't been adding coach seats into the domestic arena over the past 10 years. And so, all of our growth has been in the premium products and services. And I think on Investor Day, we're going to talk a little bit more about where we see that going, but I think we see a long runway for that in the coming years.\nDan Janki: Yes. Premium product while pace main cabin all the way as you look at our fleet deliveries through 2030.\nSavi Syth: Helpful. And if I might on another follow-up, just on the domestic capacity growth with building back the hubs, is that then where the capacity comes a lot in this kind of regional-type markets or should I think of it as kind of growth in regional then shift some of those aircraft on to kind of other bigger markets that you could use those aircraft?\nGlen Hauenstein: I think little of both. We've been very short on our regionals. We still have probably at least 50 regionals either not flying or underutilized, probably almost 100 when you include the underutilization. So, that's a lot of seats and a lot of departures that we need in our hubs and we're missing a lot of the core feed from the regional feed in the local vicinity. So, right now, some of that's being done by Mainline and those planes can gravitate out, but mostly we'll be adding frequencies back in that historically have been there from feeder markets into our core hubs.\nSavi Syth: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live.\nDavid Vernon: Maybe just following up on that point of thought there, Glen, as you think about the improvements in the regional utilization, is there also some room for improving utilization to prior pre-COVID levels on the narrow body fleet as well? Or is this primarily just a regional issue?\nGlen Hauenstein: No, I would hope so. If we look at our wide bodies, we're now at or above where we were in '19 in terms of annual utilization. And this is going to be a game of working with our operators to improve asset utilization across the network, whatever they are, planes, airports. And that's the game we're playing, that's the long game and I think that's been a really exciting challenge for us all.\nDavid Vernon: Yes. Okay. And then I guess as you think about the yield management, it's a problem sort of through the summer months, you seem to have a lot more premium capacity into the mix. Does that change the way you guys go about sort of the day-to-day in managing pricing? Are there other opportunities in there that you see to continue to kind of work the segmented cabin differently than you may have done in the past? I'm just trying to get a sense for -- as this new sort of model is being marketed at a higher level of volume and a greater distribution of the number of seats you have on each aircraft, is that changing sort of the upper frontier on what you might be able to get out of yield management?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I think what we said is that, what really pushed us to do this journey several years back was the fact that on the premium products and experiences side, we controlled more of our destiny than we did on the commodity side. And so absolutely, that's been our journey, is to continue to play the game against ourselves as opposed to playing against the lowest common denominator. And I think we'll have a lot again on our Investor Day to talk about what we see the next evolution. But we see a lot of runway -- not to tease it out, but we see a lot of runway in taking this even further and using new tools and using things that we'll be talking about in November that I think will be very exciting for our investor base.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. And then last one for me is that you mentioned something about sort of improvements in retailing. Could you elaborate a little bit around what you're talking about there?\nGlen Hauenstein: Well, I think that that's the holy grail is, why did we wind up in a commoditized environment was because we couldn't distribute products and services. We weren't -- the industry was not geared to this. And this has been our long journey. And every day, I think we get better and better and better at it, whether or not we're working internally to improve our own internal displays where we're 65% direct-to-consumer right now or whether we're working with online booking tools to improve their display of products and services and making progress on that front as well. So, this has been a very, very long journey and every day we're working on improving it.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thanks very much for the time, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for the time. Maybe just a follow-up on Latin America. The large capacity growth there in partnership with LATAM obviously magnifies the unit revenue decline, but you've, of course, talked about making these investments profitably. So maybe can you talk about where you are with -- today relative to your expectations in Latin America and how you expect that profitability curve to shape up in the coming quarters and years?\nGlen Hauenstein: Yes. I think we still see opportunity. We've got -- a lot of the opportunities now are in our baseline and we'll continue to work with LATAM to refine that moving forward. But I don't think you'll see this kind of dramatic growth in the out years as we'll be more focused on turning that into more of a harvest mode as opposed to an investment mode as we continue to work on bridging the two networks together.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. And then maybe one on cost, just to sum it up, Q1 TRASM performance was really good, Ed, and you talked about completion factors and just operations helping that. So, the Q2 guide assumes a bit more normalized putting you guys at 2% cost growth. So, is it just fair to think about that run rate in the context of the year with a low-single-digit guide? And what are the moving pieces as we think about headcount, maintenance costs, and any other noise you'd highlight throughout the year?\nDan Janki: Yes. I think the 2% is in line with the low-single-digit. I think when you think about the variables inside of that run -- it starts with running a great operation. When you run a great operation, that sets the foundation. You get those frictional costs out and it really allows the operators and you're seeing it in two quarters in a row to have the confidence and really lean in and continue to drive not only better improvement in the operation but also get after those efficiencies. And as you do that, in a lot -- we said that we're carrying headcount higher than historical for what we ran in 2019, about 10%, and we'll grow into that and that drives the efficiency associated with that. And no change to maintenance. Maintenance is as we expected and -- but we'll continue to manage the supply chain. It's going to be the one that is -- has the largest constraint still associated with it as we execute through the year.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.\nJulie Stewart: Matthew, we'll now go to our final analyst question before moving to the media.\nOperator: Certainly. Your last question is coming from Stephen Trent from Citi. Your line is live.\nStephen Trent: Good morning, everybody, and thanks very much for squeezing me in. Just a follow-up question to Sheila's, if I may. When we think about probably the -- across the industry fleets getting older, could you give us a high-level sense about how valuable Delta TechOps is going to be for you guys over the next 10 years, for example, and that competitive advantage you have versus your legacy competitors? Thank you.\nDan Janki: Yes, we can. I think it is a unique advantage, that along with our fleet, our fleet has actually gotten younger over the last few years. But we've also given the constraints in the industry around the OEMs, have leaned into restore the network into our flex fleets. So, flying 80 717s, flying the 757s longer than we anticipated, and that puts demand on our TechOps teams, and their ability to ensure that we have those aircraft, that they're reliable, is -- really allows us to flex and be more nimble. And as we go through this period and it gets more normalized, we're in a period of more normalized growth and more consistency around equipment, it's also going to allow us to go into a period of more natural retirements. We haven't retired any aircraft in 2022 and 2023. We'll start that at the back half of this year and that's really where our team has always shined, the ability to naturally retire but then recoup that equipment and reuse that used material and run out the fleets and they did it with the MD-88s and 90s. They've done it for a decade and they have that history. And that's really what we have in front of us.\nEd Bastian: Stephen, if I could add on the back end of Dan's comments, two things. In the first quarter, our overall mainline reliability and completion factor was the strongest first quarter in our history. And that's quite a statement given where we've been through and the supply-chain constraints that still exist and I attribute a lot of that to the maintenance team -- the TechOps team, having the product ready every day and responding to the opportunities that we see in front of us. So that's going to continue to be a positive green arrow forward as we move forward these next couple of years, as Dan was saying. Second thing is the MRO, while we've taken, I'd say, a pause given that we've had to focus our energies on our own fleet as compared to our customer's fleets. Going forward in the next couple of years, that's going to start turning back on again. And that growth rate that we've talked about is still there. It's just waiting for us. And I'm very, very excited as to what you talk about a five to 10-year timeline on that. That business is, I think is going to be -- our ability to capture that business is going to be even stronger than we were thinking pre-pandemic given what we've all been through. So, hats off to the TechOps team, a lot more work to go, but we are absolutely on the right path.\nStephen Trent: Thank you very much, Ed and Dan. I appreciate the time.\nJulie Stewart: Thanks, Steve. That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions.\nTim Mapes: Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you don't mind, as we transition from the analysts to reporters, could you repeat the instructions for one question and a follow-up, please?\nOperator: Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. On operations, just wondering if you saw any benefit from the fact that a lot of your hubs this past winter got rain and not blizzards? It seems like if it was 10, 15 degrees cooler, we have been talking about grounding the airline for a little bit at those hubs. And then separately, on the mechanical issues that some airlines have been having recently, have you reminded your employees or put out any kind of communication just to ensure that they're following all protocols and just kind of reemphasize safety at Delta? Thanks.\nEd Bastian: Hi, Leslie, it's Ed. With respect to weather, we certainly have had a nice run of weather broadly across our system, candidly, across our country. And that certainly has helped with respect to the overall operational performance. But what we like to do is neutralize for weather events and we see the performance of the airline weather-adjusted within our own system and we're outperforming our prior performance even weather-adjusted. So, the improved weather just adds nice icing to the cake, but the fundamental, the core is running at a much, much better clip. And as the communications, safety is job one at all times, every single day. We don't send out special messages around safety. We -- every day is Safety Day around here.\nLeslie Josephs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask on the request for an addition of the Slot Waivers through another year. Have you seen any improvement at all in the ATC issues in the New York area? And does the Slot Waiver extension also include the DC area?\nPeter Carter: So, Mary, thank you. It's Peter Carter. It does traditionally include the DC area. That's the way the FAA likes to view it. And we still have a shortage of ATC controllers. So, it's still an incredibly challenging environment.\nMary Schlangenstein: Have you seen any improvement at all?\nPeter Carter: Well, we've had the waivers -- we've had the waivers in place. So of course, with those waivers, there would be improvement because there's less capacity in that marketplace. But absent the waiver, I think we'd have some -- as an industry, some real challenges in New York.\nMary Schlangenstein: Great. Thank you very much.\nTim Mapes: Thank you for the question, Mary. Matthew, I believe that wraps up our time, if you want to close out the call.\nOperator: Certainly. Thank you. That completes our Q&A session. And everyone, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking our employees for providing the best service and reliability in the industry to our customers every single day. 2024 is off to a great start and we're delivering on our commercial priorities to optimize our network, grow higher-margin revenue streams, and invest in our future. Revenue for the March quarter increased 6% year-over-year to a record $12.6 billion on capacity growth of 6.8%. This result is at the high-end of our initial guidance with upside driven by industry-leading operational performance and strength in close-in bookings. Since the start of the year, we've seen a sustained acceleration in business travel. Managed corporate travel sales grew 14% over the prior year, with Technology, Consumer Services and Financial Services leading that momentum. We delivered positive unit revenues in our two largest entities, domestic and transatlantic, reflecting the continued optimization of our network. Total unit revenue growth improved 3 points sequentially to down 0.7%, including nearly a one-point headwind from cargo and MRO. Domestic revenue grew 5% with record March quarter unit revenues, up 3% over the prior year. The more than 7 point improvement from 4Q to 1Q reflects strong demand trends improving industry backdrop. International revenues grew 12% on a unit revenue decline of 3% as unit revenue growth in the transatlantic was muted by capacity investments from the continued rebuild of our Latin and Pacific franchises. Diverse high-margin revenue streams generated 57% of total revenue, differentiating Delta and underpinning industry-leading financial performance. Premium revenue was up 10% over prior year, and we have runway ahead as we continue adding more premium seats to our aircraft, improving our retailing capabilities, and further segmenting our products. Total loyalty revenue grew 12% on continued strength in the American Express co-brand portfolio with record quarterly remuneration of $1.7 billion. Following the refreshed co-brand benefits, we saw our card applications reach new records as we are seeing the highest premium acquisitions mix in our program's history. Turning to our outlook, consumer demand is robust and premium trends remain strong. The outlook for corporate travel is positive. 90% of companies in our recent survey intend to maintain or increase travel volumes in 2Q, putting us back on track to deliver record corporate revenues in the back half of this year. For the June quarter, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% on capacity growth of 6% to 7%, with unit revenues flat to down 2% from last year's very strong performance. Similar to the March quarter, 2Q faces a headwind from the normalization of travel credits. Domestically, we expect unit revenues to be flattish over the prior year, with growth focused on restoring our core hubs where departures and seats are not yet fully restored. The final stage of our core hub restoration will be the full return of regional flying. Pilot hiring has stabilized, increasing the capacity we expect to fly over the summer. We expect progressive improvement through 2025, driving higher asset utilization and improving our profitability. In the transatlantic, we are looking forward to another strong summer with record revenues. 2Q unit revenues are expected to be similar to the last year as we lock record performance and benefit from the healthy demand for our premium cabins and improved corporate trends. In Latin America, profitability remains solid. Unit revenues are expected to be down double-digits due to pressure in shortfall leisure markets. These markets are expected to see healthy improvements in the second-half of the year as supply and demand comes back into balance. And while flying into deep South America, we are very pleased with the results. We are increasing capacity about 40% with minimal impact to unit revenues as we continue to deepen our ties with our JV partner LATAM. We expect Pacific unit revenues to be in line with the prior year on 30% growth in capacity, driven by a strong demand for Korea and Japan, offsetting lower unit revenues in China. Profitability is expected to set a record as we continue to harvest the benefits of our multi-year restructuring. In closing, I'm pleased with how we have started 2024. Delta is continuing to lead on all fronts, with industry-leading margins and returns highlighting the strength of our trusted brand and differentiated commercial strategy. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. No, I'd just say we're seeing both. We're seeing some shorter and we're seeing some longer where people are blending the leisure trip with the business trip. So -- and generally, they are purchasing a little bit further out than they had and I think that's related to not having change fees any longer. So, we've seen some changes in the booking curve but really encouraged by what we see in terms of corporate bookings as we look forward through this quarter and as we look forward into the next couple of quarters. I think we said in our previous that we faced headwinds in up to a couple of points. And I think we're not going to go into the details of that, but that's generally what we've disclosed in the past. Yes. No, I think it's pretty -- first on the travel credit headwinds, it's consistent through the year. But what I would say is that we're ahead of our internal plan to get to flattish for the year and the comps get easier as we move through the year. And if you look at the back half of guidance as well as what people have loaded in their schedules, it looks like industry capacity is reaching a peak in 2Q. So, I think we see a great setup for the back half of this year and we're on plan or ahead of plan for where we sit right now. That said, we are very excited as the sponsor of Team USA for the Paris Olympics and we'll get through it. I think we're going to -- first of all, thanks to our operating teams who have given us such exceptional completion factors that accounted for even higher than we had planned for. So, I'd say if those continue, which I imagine they will or hope they will, that we would be at the high of the 3% to 5%. And I think it's a bit early to say, but I think that we will be right at that 5% depending on how the completion factor comes in. Well, thanks for the question, Jamie. I think right now, we believe we are running international RASM premiums that are primarily been driven by higher load factors on the fleet. But as the fleet continues to evolve and we continue to put more premium seats in the mix, we believe that is one of the key drivers for us to continue to accelerate our relative performance to our industry peers. So, I think we're on a journey there and I think we are now generating premiums consistently and hopefully, we can accelerate those over the next several years as we execute on our plans to differentiate Delta. I think in the quarter, we ran a record domestic load factor in the first quarter. So, what I believe drove that was the incremental traffic that we took over historical levels. So, pretty excited about doing that in the first quarter, as you know, the first quarter is the most challenging in terms of loads. And for us to come through that quarter with the premiums that we took, I think really is a testament to the strength of our brand. And of course, as we get through the year, there'll be less and less discounted seats available as you get towards peak, but generally, we're most open in 1Q. Yes. Right. I think there -- what we've said in the past and I would like to go back to is, we kind of coming out of COVID, we had to allocate the resources that had -- we had available. And those resources went to our once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to take leading positions in places like Boston and Los Angeles at the expense of rebuilding our core hubs and we're still not done building our core hubs. And so, our ability now to go back and to put seats back into our core where our cost structure is most advantaged and where our profitability is highest is where we're focused for the rest of this year. Well, we are really pleased with our South America performance. As I said in the prepared remarks, our capacity is up in the 30% to 40% range and we're doing that with minimal degradation of our unit revenue. So we're really off to a great start with LATAM and I think we have a really great future of working with them to continue to evolve as the leading carrier between the United States and South America in our joint venture. So, put that aside and then say the -- particularly, leisure destinations, there was an oversupply in the first quarter. I think in first quarter of '23, the industry saw historically higher returns. And so when there are historically high returns, everybody wants to do more of it. We did considerably more of it. The industry did considerably more of it. And listen, it was quite profitable for us, but at the expense of unit revenues. And so, as we move through next year, I'd say there's going to be probably a moderation of capacity as there always is when those things happen as well as easier comps as we get to next year. So, I'm looking forward to actually next year's comps in Latin America. Well, I think we're very pleased with our coastal gateways and really they're moving in a pretty tight band right now with more capacity going to our core hubs and our core hubs generally having a higher unit revenue base than our coastal gateways, that should have a positive inflection on total revenues. And I think that gets accelerated in the second and third quarters. Again, we had probably a little bit more in Boston than we had planned on because there were some opportunities there for us to move airplanes in. But generally, we're really pleased with where we sit today and how the back half of this year should play out for us. Right. I would say, right now, the premium is probably 50-50 split between traffic and yield.

            "content": "Hey, Mike, it's Peter Carter. Thanks for the question. That was a tentative order. And I think, as you know, our strong view is, the DOT really struck out on that one. They're typically a great partner. But this was an example of regulatory overreach, which is why we've challenged it. It's bad for consumers. It's bad for competition. It's bad for the local economies that those flights have served. We are currently engaged with the administration and discussing, I'll say, less punitive solutions than the tentative order that was proposed. And I would say, we've had hundreds of our, I'll say, allies with respect to the connection between Mexico and America weigh in, in support of this joint venture. So, we think this is going to take some time before the DOT issues a final order, a number of months, but we're cautiously optimistic that they are going to come up with a better solution. Hey, Conor, this is Peter. So, just I'd say, fundamentally with the FAA, we're working very closely with them around staffing models, because as you know, there's an air traffic control shortage. And we're also engaged in Washington trying to help solve some of those, I'll say, more structural challenges around infrastructure. You probably have seen that the industry has made a request off the FAA to extend the New York Slot Waiver another season. And that's what I would call responsible partnership with our regulator in light of the staffing challenges they've had. So, a great relationship, deep partnership with them. So, Mary, thank you. It's Peter Carter. It does traditionally include the DC area. That's the way the FAA likes to view it. And we still have a shortage of ATC controllers. So, it's still an incredibly challenging environment. Well, we've had the waivers -- we've had the waivers in place. So of course, with those waivers, there would be improvement because there's less capacity in that marketplace. But absent the waiver, I think we'd have some -- as an industry, some real challenges in New York."

            "content": "Great. Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the March quarter, we delivered pre-tax income of $380 million, an improvement of $163 million over last year. Earnings of $0.45 per share was at the upper end of our guidance as great operational performance and strong demand more than offset higher-than-expected fuel prices. Operational excellence is central to Delta's brand promise, and I couldn't be prouder of how our teams are delivering record reliability for our customers. A strong completion factor drove a 1 point of higher capacity and non-fuel unit cost favorability. Non-fuel CASM was 1.5% above last year and ahead of guidance. Fuel prices averaged $2.76 per gallon, $0.16 higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The refinery provided a $0.05 benefit, generating a profit of $49 million. This was down $173 million from last year on more normalized refining margins. Fuel efficiency was 1.9% better than last year, benefiting from the continued renewal of our fleet and running a strong operation. Operating margin of 5.1% was a 0.5 point higher year-over-year. Our pre-tax margin improved over a point, benefiting from reduced interest, pension expense, and higher earnings from our equity investments. We generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion. This was after paying $1.4 billion in profit-sharing to our employees and investing $1.1 billion into the business. Debt reduction remains a top priority. Our leverage ratio improved to 2.9 times during the quarter. We repaid $700 million of debt, including $400 million of scheduled maturities and $300 million of additional debt initiatives. We expect to repay at least $4 billion of debt this year and continue to be opportunistic in accelerating debt reduction. We are currently investment-grade rated at Moody's and BB+ at both S&P and Fitch, with all agencies now on positive outlook following updates from Fitch and Moody's during the quarter. Moving to the June quarter guidance. Combined with our outlook for top-line growth, we expect an operating margin of 14% to 15% with earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.70 to $2.90 per gallon, including a $0.10 contribution from the refinery. At the midpoint of this range, our all-in fuel price is expected to be over 10% higher than last year. Non-fuel unit costs are expected to be approximately 2% higher than last year, consistent with our full-year outlook of low-single-digit. Growth is normalizing, and we've entered a period of optimization with a focus on restoring our most profitable core hubs and delivering efficiency gains across the enterprise. The investments we made in fleet health and reliability in the second-half of 2023 are paying off, supporting industry-leading operational performance. As we discussed with you in January, these investments are expected to continue through 2024 as we complete an elevated volume of heavy airframe and engine checks, while managing through industry-wide supply chain constraints. The intensity of hiring and training has moderated. The teams have good momentum in delivering on our efficiency goals for the year. This will help fund the investment in our people, in our operations, and the customer experience that support our revenue premium. In closing, we continue to be confident in our full-year outlook of earnings of $6 to $7 per share and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our industry-leading operational and financial performance is a result of the hard work and dedication of the Delta people. I'd like to thank each of them for what they do every day. With that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A. Well, maintenance is -- Duane, thank you. Maintenance is on plan and performing as we expected. As we talked to you at the beginning part of the year, maintenance we expect it to be up year-over-year $350 million. We expect that for the full-year, the first quarter was on plan, and the team is executing well. And those investments, as I mentioned, that we made in fleet health will continue as we go through this year, those proactive visits along touching the aircraft. You're seeing the impact. Cancellations from a maintenance perspective year-over-year were down 80% sequentially, they improved 30%. So team is doing a good job. They're on plan and as expected. Yes. On landing fees, when you look at it year-over-year, yes, they're up, volume, one; two related to the cut-in as it relates to our generational redevelopment projects, you're picking up some of that expense. And then I would say the third item, airports across the country in 2022 and 2023 benefited from Cares. And as those have now gone away, they're adjusting their rates and you're seeing that come through. Yes. I'd say two things. One is, as it relates to our third-party activity, it's just -- we're always -- we're constrained by what the industry is constrained by, which is material and ability to generate that output. And as we've talked about, our Tech Ops team, John, and the team are focused on the Delta fleet. So -- but I would say the constraint continues to be immaterial and turnaround times associated with it. And seat growth is about a point below, some growth that they see. Yes. Yes. Premium product while pace main cabin all the way as you look at our fleet deliveries through 2030. Yes. I think the 2% is in line with the low-single-digit. I think when you think about the variables inside of that run -- it starts with running a great operation. When you run a great operation, that sets the foundation. You get those frictional costs out and it really allows the operators and you're seeing it in two quarters in a row to have the confidence and really lean in and continue to drive not only better improvement in the operation but also get after those efficiencies. And as you do that, in a lot -- we said that we're carrying headcount higher than historical for what we ran in 2019, about 10%, and we'll grow into that and that drives the efficiency associated with that. And no change to maintenance. Maintenance is as we expected and -- but we'll continue to manage the supply chain. It's going to be the one that is -- has the largest constraint still associated with it as we execute through the year. Yes, we can. I think it is a unique advantage, that along with our fleet, our fleet has actually gotten younger over the last few years. But we've also given the constraints in the industry around the OEMs, have leaned into restore the network into our flex fleets. So, flying 80 717s, flying the 757s longer than we anticipated, and that puts demand on our TechOps teams, and their ability to ensure that we have those aircraft, that they're reliable, is -- really allows us to flex and be more nimble. And as we go through this period and it gets more normalized, we're in a period of more normalized growth and more consistency around equipment, it's also going to allow us to go into a period of more natural retirements. We haven't retired any aircraft in 2022 and 2023. We'll start that at the back half of this year and that's really where our team has always shined, the ability to naturally retire but then recoup that equipment and reuse that used material and run out the fleets and they did it with the MD-88s and 90s. They've done it for a decade and they have that history. And that's really what we have in front of us."

            "name": "Ed Bastian",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported our March quarter results posting pre-tax earnings of $380 million or $0.45 per share, a $0.20 improvement over last year, and revenue that was 6% higher and a new record for first quarter. Free cash flow was $1.4 billion and we delivered a return on invested capital of nearly 14%, putting Delta's returns in the top half of the S&P 500. We are delivering industry-leading operational reliability and have widened the gap to our competition. Last summer, we made forward-leaning investments in the operation. And since then, our teams have delivered operational performance that is among the best in our history, with mainline cancellations down 85%, setting new records for completion factor in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter. I'd like to sincerely thank Delta's 100,000 people for your dedication, professionalism, and hard work in delivering these outstanding results. In February, we recognized the efforts of our people with $1.4 billion in profit-sharing, more than the rest of the industry combined, and continuing Delta's longstanding philosophy to reward industry-leading performance with industry-leading compensation. Reflecting our people-first culture, Forbes ranked Delta the fifth-best large employer in America, and Delta was recently named the 2024 Global Airline of the Year by Air Transport World for our outstanding commitment to safety, operational performance, and premium customer service. While airline travel and transportation is what we do, it's the experiences on Delta that set us apart as a leading consumer brand and why Delta was recognized as number 11 on Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies. Exciting customer-facing enhancements are on the near horizon, including the opening of new Delta One lounges in JFK, Los Angeles, and Boston, the continued introduction of modern and fuel-efficient aircraft, new premium cabin service offerings, upgrades to the Fly Delta app, and the international expansion of fast free Wi-Fi across our fleet. The rollout of Wi-Fi and Delta Sync continues to be a tremendous success. Since launching last year, customers have logged more than 45 million free streaming quality sessions on-board and millions have joined the SkyMiles program through this channel. Recognizing our investment to ensure the future of travel is connected, we took the number two spot in the travel category, a Fast Company's list of the Most Innovative Companies, the only airline to be recognized in the ranking. Loyalty to our brand has never been stronger. We continue to set new records with our remuneration from American Express, our most important commercial relationship and are well on our way to our long-term target of $10 billion. On February the 1, we announced enhanced and refreshed benefits for our Delta Sky Miles American Express Cards, providing more direct value and the customer response has been very positive. Turning to our outlook. With strong first-quarter performance and visibility into the strength of summer travel demand, we remain confident in our full year guidance for earnings of $6 -- $6 to $7 per share, free-cash-flow of $3 billion to $4 billion, and leverage of 2.5 times, the three main guideposts that we shared with you in January. For the June quarter, we expect to deliver the highest quarterly revenue in our history of mid-teens operating margin and earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Our forecast for pre-tax profit of approximately $2 billion is on par with 2019 and just shy of last year, due to higher fuel prices. Demand continues to be strong and we see a record spring and summer travel season with our 11 highest sales days in our history, all occurring this calendar year. Spending on services recently surpassed goods for the first time in five years and there is further runway to return to their long-term trends. Delta's core consumers are in a healthy position and travel remains a top purchase priority. Generational shifts and evolving consumer preferences are driving secular growth in premium experiences. And business travel demand has taken another meaningful step forward this year with growth accelerating into the mid-teens over last year. When you put this level of demand strength together with the industry's increased focus on improving financial returns, this may be the most constructive backdrop that I've seen in my airline career. Our industry-leading performance continues to demonstrate the strength of Delta's differentiated brand and returns-focused strategy. And with our disciplined approach to capital investment and focus on free cash flow, Delta is exceptionally well-positioned to further strengthen our balance sheet and deliver significant shareholder value. In closing, the momentum in the business continues to build. We are focused on delivering excellent reliability, elevating the customer experience, and improving efficiency across the Company to support growth in our earnings and cash flow. I am excited for Delta's opportunities ahead, and we'll talk more about that and provide new long-term financial targets at our Investor Day, which we are scheduling for November 19 and 20 in New York City. Please put that on your calendar. Thank you again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance. Duane, if I could add on to that, I want to congratulate the Tech Ops team, John Laughter, whose leadership over there in terms of helping to make that turn. We are seeing a renewed set of confidence back in the team. It's been a tough few years on the rebuild. Too early to declare victory. We know the supply chain continues to have a tremendous amount of constraint in it. But I'm confident that we're on a good journey. It's a good path here. I have thoughts, some very -- yes, it has changed. And it's related to schools coming back in the South in particular earlier and earlier into August. As a matter of fact, here I believe schools in Georgia go back the first week of August now. And so, that has materially changed, I think over the years, making the second quarter stronger and making the third quarter a bit weaker. But I think we're -- as we think about how we plan that now, we're incorporating that into our capacity plans moving forward. Well, thanks, Ravi. We're not in a position yet to make any comments or any decisions around that. We still have more debt than we're comfortable with and that continues to be the first call on cash to continue to take risk off the table. Interesting, I was looking at some numbers preparing for this call, if you look at our target for the end of this year and you factor in that we actually have eliminated the Pension H obligation, which we had at the end of 2019. We're actually pretty close to the leverage ratio we were at the end of 2019 entering the pandemic. So, we have made a lot of progress. That said, we'll be talking a bit about that at our Investor Day in November. And -- but the first call will be and will be for some time to pay down the debt. Yes. Well, generally, the Olympics are not good for airline revenues, and this year I think is no exception to that. So, while we see a very favorable backdrop for Europe in its totality, there are some challenges for Paris as generally business travel ceases to and from the local markets as the Olympics approach. So, I wouldn't say that that's going to be a windfall. It's actually going to be a bit of a headwind for us in the numbers we shared with you. And on American Express global acceptance rates, we worked very hard years back with American Express on improving the domestic acceptance rates and right now they're at all-time highs in terms of the number of merchants that you can use American Express at domestically and they are also doing that internationally. So, particularly places that we're strong and we work with them on prioritizing those places that Americans like to go for vacations. Stephen, if I could add on the back end of Dan's comments, two things. In the first quarter, our overall mainline reliability and completion factor was the strongest first quarter in our history. And that's quite a statement given where we've been through and the supply-chain constraints that still exist and I attribute a lot of that to the maintenance team -- the TechOps team, having the product ready every day and responding to the opportunities that we see in front of us. So that's going to continue to be a positive green arrow forward as we move forward these next couple of years, as Dan was saying. Second thing is the MRO, while we've taken, I'd say, a pause given that we've had to focus our energies on our own fleet as compared to our customer's fleets. Going forward in the next couple of years, that's going to start turning back on again. And that growth rate that we've talked about is still there. It's just waiting for us. And I'm very, very excited as to what you talk about a five to 10-year timeline on that. That business is, I think is going to be -- our ability to capture that business is going to be even stronger than we were thinking pre-pandemic given what we've all been through. So, hats off to the TechOps team, a lot more work to go, but we are absolutely on the right path. Hi, Leslie, it's Ed. With respect to weather, we certainly have had a nice run of weather broadly across our system, candidly, across our country. And that certainly has helped with respect to the overall operational performance. But what we like to do is neutralize for weather events and we see the performance of the airline weather-adjusted within our own system and we're outperforming our prior performance even weather-adjusted. So, the improved weather just adds nice icing to the cake, but the fundamental, the core is running at a much, much better clip. And as the communications, safety is job one at all times, every single day. We don't send out special messages around safety. We -- every day is Safety Day around here."
