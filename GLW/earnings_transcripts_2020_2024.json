At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma\u2019am\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, and good morning and welcome to Corning\u2019s quarter four 2020 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company\u2019s financial reports. You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.  For the fourth quarter, the largest difference between our GAAP and core results stem from restructuring charges, which are primarily noncash, as well as noncash mark-to-market losses associated with the company's currency hedging contracts. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation, hedge contracts, and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though these contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q4 by $63 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth, and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than five years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast, and we encourage you to follow along and you can download them from our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported an outstanding finish to the year. Each of our segments grew sales and profits year-over-year, and we continue to progress our strategic initiatives. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.3 billion, up 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. Our operating margin expanded 500 basis points year-over-year to 19.4%. Operating income grew 18% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. EPS of $0.52 was up 21% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We generated $464 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, $948 million for the full year, and we finished the year with $2.7 billion in cash on our balance sheet. It goes without saying, 2020 was an incredibly difficult year. We joined the rest of the world to confront the pandemic, economic uncertainty, and social unrest. Throughout the year, we focused on our customers and executed on strategic priorities while protecting our people. For more perspective on our performance, I'll share three observations. First, we demonstrated our ability to adapt rapidly and remain resilient in the face of uncertainty. Second, our more Corning content strategy clearly contributed to our growth and our performance against our end markets; and finally, throughout this difficult period, we're embracing the opportunity to make a difference wherever we are with what we have to contribute. Now, I'll expand on my first observation. Our decisive actions and strong operational execution have resulted in continued leadership in the capabilities that make Corning distinctive. Like many companies, we focused on bolstering our financial strength, reducing production levels, and operating costs, carefully managing inventory, reducing capital expenditures, and pausing share buybacks. However, it's not about what we cut, but what we kept. While we adjusted production, we didn't reduce capacity keeping us positioned to meet increasing demand when the economy improved. We continue to make strategic investments and advance major innovations with our customers to capture the growth playing out across our market access platforms, and we developed multifaceted programs to protect our talent and preserve our capabilities. Our first half actions generated significant cost savings in the second half of the year, and as the economy started showing signs of green shoots, we effectively adjusted our operations keeping pace as demand started to recover in many of the markets we serve. Our results tell the story. Our sales were down 12% in the first half as most economies were impacted by pandemic-related lockdowns. But in the second half, we improved sales 24% over the first, while growing operating income 122%, returning to year-over-year growth and generating very strong free cash flow. For the year, we generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow and our balance sheet remains very strong. We expect this strong momentum to continue heading into 2021. We will continue to adapt and focus on execution as we have proven that our approach is working. Turning to my second observation. In all the industries we serve, important market trends continue to offer new challenges that Corning is just uniquely qualified to address and new opportunities to integrate more Corning content into our customers' products. In this difficult year, we have proven that this is an especially powerful value creation letter. We aren't relying exclusively on people buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. In the fourth quarter, this strategy paid off as we grew sales year-over-year in every one of our businesses. At the top were Specialty Materials, with sales up 20% year-over-year, and Environmental Technologies up 19% year-over-year, both significantly outperforming their end markets. Last quarter, I described our innovations in Mobile Consumer Electronics, looking at how we're investing to create additional revenue streams and capture content opportunities. Today, I'll focus on our Automotive Market-Access Platform. The auto industry is undergoing major disruptions. Automakers are designing cleaner and safer vehicles, while featuring technology that provides immersive experiences. We're uniquely suited to address these trends. And for us, the opportunity is large in the range of $100 per car in Corning content. We're collaborating with more OEMs, and we're offering more solutions to help move the industry forward. Let's look at two of our biggest successes right now. Starting with our Automotive Glass Solutions business, we\u2019re building strong momentum. Our advantaged solutions are enabling the very rapid shift toward in-vehicle displays that are interactive, that are integrated and shaped. We're collaborating with industry leaders across the auto ecosystem, including Visteon, LGE, BOE, and Via Optronics to accelerate the adoption of our patented 3D ColdForm technology, which enables lower cost, shaped, auto interiors. Our large-scale facility in Hefei, China is now fully operational and servicing our growing demand. And we continue to see strong adoption of our technology by auto OEMs. Our recent proof point is the new Mercedes-Benz Hyperscreen dashboard display, which features a Gorilla Glass cover nearly 5 feet wide. Similarly, in Environmental Technologies, in a year when a global pandemic temporarily shut down OEM production, our proprietary gasoline particulate filter business still grew sales year-over-year. When we introduced GPF, we said our technology increased our content opportunity per car by three to four times. Like most of our innovations, it started with the customer challenge. Europe and China are addressing fine particular pollution with new emissions regulations. We applied our expertise in ceramic science with our advanced manufacturing capabilities and extrusion to rapidly develop filters that efficiently trap ion particulates. And today, we're effectively helping automakers reduce these harmful emissions, meet new regulations, and produce some of the cleanest gasoline vehicles you can buy. Demand for our GPS has grown quickly. And with our market leading product, we continue to win the majority of platforms awarded to date. We're well on our way to building a $0.5 billion business. We're actually ahead of schedule, and the content opportunity continues to grow. We expect our GPS technology to migrate beyond Europe and China as other regions focus on improving air quality. And many new car models will soon be required to get even closer to near zero particulate emissions. In response, we recently introduced our next-generation GPS, featuring enhanced filtration capabilities. They're launching in upcoming models as automakers prepare for the next wave of regulations. Across our markets, we see a similar content story playing out as we respond to key industry challenges with more Corning solutions. Let me share some other accomplishments across our market access platforms. In Life Sciences, pandemic related demand has highlighted our strength in the industry. And we achieved major milestones towards building a significant Valor Glass franchise in 2020. At the start of the year, we entered a long-term supply agreement to provide Valor Glass vials for a portion of the currently marketed Pfizer drug products. Soon after, we were awarded $204 million in funding from the U.S. government to substantially expand domestic manufacturing capacity for Valor vials. Today, we're supplying Valor Glass to several leading COVID vaccine manufacturers. We produce millions of Valor vials and shipped enough for more than 100 million doses, supporting multiple vaccine developers. In our Life Sciences segment, the global health fight is driving strong demand for our consumable products. We're supporting the development of treatments in vaccines, as well as mass testing efforts. We received $15 million from the U.S. government to expand domestic capacity for robotic pipette tips, which are used for COVID diagnostic testing. BioNTech recently recognized our contribution to their successful COVID vaccine development. Turning to Mobile Consumer Electronics. We launched the toughest Gorilla Glass yet, Victus. And it's already featured on six Samsung devices. Corning also invented the world's first transparent color-free glass ceramic, which is featured on the front cover of the latest iPhone. Apple and Corning partnered to develop and scale manufacturing of Ceramic Shield. It offers unparallel durability and toughness. I noted that Specialty Materials sales were up 20% year-over-year in quarter four. They were up 18% for the full year in a smartphone market that declined 7%. In Optical Communications, we returned to growth and we expect this growth to continue as customers increase spending to support growing bandwidth requirements. In 2020, we introduced new and innovative solutions that help speed the deployment of 5G. We launched our outdoor 5G-ready connectivity solutions, featuring compact easy-to-install terminals that can be deployed in any conceivable architecture. Operators can actually save up to $500 per terminal location, dramatically lowering installation cost and speeding up deployment. We're also collaborating with Verizon to enable 5G millimeter wave indoor deployments for their enterprise customers. We're also working with Qualcomm Technologies to deliver indoor networks that are 5G ready, easy-to-install and affordable. And we're collaborating with EnerSys to simplify the delivery of fiber and electrical power to small-cell wireless sites. Turning to Display. Retail demand for TV and IT products remain strong. Demand for large-sized TVs continues to grow. 75-inch sets were up more than 60% for the full year. Large TVs are most efficiently made on Gen 10.5 plants. Corning is well positioned to capture that growth with its Gen 10.5 plants in China, including the two newest Gen 10.5 facilities in Wuhan and Guangzhou, which are now expanding production to meet customer demand. Ramping these sites has been no small feat in the midst of a pandemic. We are very proud of our innovative and dedicated expert engineering teams that rose to a host of unprecedented challenges to start-up tanks in both facilities. Looking ahead, Corning's long-term growth drivers and content opportunities are strong in each of our markets. And we believe some secular trends could accelerate as consumer lifestyles continue to change in the aftermath of the health crisis. And that leads to my third observation. We're living through the kind of moment that tends to bring true carrier to light. At Corning, our values are evident in our actions. We've unleased our capabilities to help combat the virus. And we're proud to be creating life-changing technologies that contribute to keeping people safe and help society address the challenges of the pandemic. We also recognize, in these unprecedented times, that we have the opportunity to share resources and leadership on a range of important issues. We've launched racial and social quality programs, and our Unity Campaign support vital human services and emergency relief in our communities around the world. In conclusion, on all fronts, Corning is executing well. We're delivering outstanding results and making important progress across our strategic priorities. I am confident that we are entering the year with solid momentum and we expect to grow in 2021. Our More Corning strategy will continue to drive outperformance across the diverse industries that we serve. We're not just counting on consumers buying more cars, TVs or smartphones to grow. And I'm excited about how we're bringing our capabilities to bear in optical and life sciences, as operators expand their networks and we continue to support vital drug and vaccine development. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tony, so that he can provide additional insight on our results and expectations.\nTony Tripeny: Thank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone. We feel good about our fourth quarter results. On a year-over-year basis, we grew sales and earnings. We expect to grow again in the first quarter, and we expect to grow for the full year, driven by improving markets and our More Corning strategy. We are building a bigger, stronger company that delivers sustainable results while remaining agile in our ability to respond to changing market factors. Now let me walk you through our fourth quarter performance. In the fourth quarter, we grew sales 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year to $3.3 billion, exceeding expectations. Excluding the consolidation of Hemlock Semiconductor, sales grew 11% year-over-year, with every segment growing sales and net income. Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies delivered particularly strong year-over-year sales growth, up 20% and 19%, respectively, both outperforming their underlying markets. Optical Communications returned to year-over-year growth, and we expect that growth to continue. Our operating margin was 19.4%. That is an improvement of 500 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We grew operating income 18% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. EPS of $0.52 was up 21% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We generated $464 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Cumulative free cash flow for the full year was $948 million. We ended the year with a cash balance of $2.7 billion. We entered 2021 in an excellent financial position. Now let's review the business segments. In Display Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $841 million, up 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. And net income was $217 million, up 11% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Retail demand for TV and IT products remain strong remained strong during the promotional season in Q4. Display\u2019s full year sales were $3.2 billion, and net income was $717 million. Our full year price declines in 2020 were mid-single digits. The glass market and our glass volume were up mid-single digits for the year. The retail market was more robust than the industry expected, resulting in panel supply being tight for the second half of 2020. Panel makers ran at high utilizations and the industry drew down inventory to satisfy demand. These dynamics also resulted in glass supply being tight, and more recently in shortage due to a power outage at a competitor's glass plant. Now let's look at 2021. We expect the TV and IT retail markets to remain strong. We remain confident that large size TVs will continue to grow, and we are well-positioned to capture that growth with Gen 10.5, which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing. We expect the glass market to grow a mid single-digit percentage in 2021. We expect glass supply to remain tight in the upcoming quarters. As a result of these supply/demand dynamics, we are experiencing a very favorable pricing environment. We expect Q1, 2021 glass prices to be flat with Q4, 2020. This is significantly better than the sequential declines we've seen in any other first quarter over the last decade. Glass prices for some customers in some gen sizes may actually see a sequential increase. We believe the following three factors will continue to drive the favorable pricing environment for the upcoming quarters. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be tight; second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels; and third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support acceptable returns on these investments. In Optical Communications, fourth quarter sales were $976 million, up 8% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Our year-over-year growth can be attributed to broad improvements in demand for both carrier and enterprise customers. Fourth quarter core net income of $141 million was up 127% year-over-year, and 23% sequentially. The improvement was driven by the incremental volume, and favorable cost performance. We have returned to growth in Optical Communications, and we expect that growth to continue. Bandwidth demand is increasing and users are demanding higher performance connections. We're seeing positive statements from customers on increasing investments in their optical networks. Our sales and order rates are picking up, and we're ready to capture demand as it materializes. We are confident we will grow sales in Optical Communications for the year. We continue to monitor and evaluate market demand signals to determine the magnitude of growth, and we'll keep \u2013 we'll continue to keep you updated as we go through the year. In Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $445 million, up 19% year-over-year and 17%, sequentially, ahead of expectations as markets continue to improve and GPF adoptions continued in China. Net income was $93 million, up 45% year-over-year and 35% sequentially, driven by strong operational performance globally and successful ramping of additional GPF capacity in China. For the full year, sales were $1.4 billion, and our performance was better than the underlying market. Net income was $197 million. While our full year 2020 sales were certainly impacted by COVID-19, we are recovering faster than the market by increasing our content for both the automotive and diesel end markets. Despite severely challenged markets we saw year over growth in GPF sales. Strong GPF adoption continues in Europe and in China, where the China 6a regulation is being implemented nationwide this month. We are ahead of our original timeframe to build a $500 million GPF business. Specialty Materials had an outstanding fourth quarter and full year. Q4 sales of $545 million were up 20% year-over-year, full year sales were $1.9 billion, up 18% year-over-year, despite a 7% decline in the smartphone market, driven by strong demand for our premium cover materials and our other innovations. Net income was $423 million, up 40% from 2019 on higher sales volume and strong cost performance. The importance of computing and connectivity were amplified during the pandemic. Our new product innovations, including Ceramic Shield and Gorilla Glass Victus, as well as our EUV products in the semiconductor market were important contributors to our strong performance. Now before I get to our Life Sciences results, I'd like to note something of great importance to us. Throughout the pandemic, our Life Sciences market access platform has applied its broad capabilities and full product portfolio to help the world combat the pandemic. From our traditionally research-focused consumables to our bioproduction products to our transport media and, of course, our Valor Glass, we're playing a vital role in the development and supply of test kits and vaccines. Now let's look at our segment results. Life Sciences fourth quarter sales were $274 million, up 7% year-over-year and 23% sequentially, driven by strong demand for COVID related products, including bioproduction products used in clinical trials. Net income was $42 million, up 11% year-over-year and 50% sequentially. In summary, we successfully navigated a very challenging year. We strengthened our balance sheet, established growth in the second half and generated free cash flow of $948 million for the year. As we look ahead, we have strong momentum coming into 2021 and expect year-over-year growth to accelerate in the first quarter. Specifically, we expect core sales of $3.0 billion to $3.2 billion compared to $2.5 billion in the first quarter last year and EPS of $0.40 to $0.44, which is double last year's first quarter EPS at the low end of the range. For the full year, we expect growth in sales and earnings, and we anticipate generating more free cash flow in 2021 than in 2020. And we will share more with you as the year progresses. Let's turn to our commitment to financial stewardship and prudent capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect that to continue going forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders. Our first priority for our use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic M&A. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. In 2021, we expect CapEx similar to 2020, as we have capacity in place to meet higher sales. Now we'll invest more if we require capacity to support additional growth, any additional capital investment would be supported by a customer commitment. We'll keep you updated as we go throughout the year. Given our expected strong free cash flow generation in 2021, we expect to increase our distributions to shareholders. That includes reinstating opportunistic share repurchases sometime this year. In closing, we're very pleased with our strong close to 2020, highlighted by growing sales and profitability. We continue to focus on a rich set of opportunities. Our businesses are fundamental to the long-term growth drivers in the industries they serve, and our More Corning strategy continues to deliver sales outperformance relative to our end markets. And I look forward to sharing our progress as the year goes on. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Tony. Operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Long from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTim Long: Thank you. A two-parter, if I could, on display. First, you talked about the pretty strong pricing environment into Q1. Could you talk a little bit -- it's, obviously, a little bit different supply dynamic, and that's normally a tough quarter for pricing. So how do you think about that as it, kind of, impacts the rest of the year, the cadence of normal pricing throughout the year? And then second, can you talk a little bit about the move of some of the big providers from Korea to China, it\u2019s been on hold a little bit. So curious what your thoughts are, what that would mean to either the supply side of the equation or the pricing side? Thank you.\nTony Tripeny: Sure. I mean, I think it's important to think about what's happened over the last year from a display standpoint. The market overall was more robust than what we had expected. And what the industry expected which meant that panel makers ran tight in the second half of 2020. Not only did those higher utilizations, but the industry also brought down inventory to meet that demand, and that meant that glass was tight throughout the year. And as you -- we remain confident that things will remain tight on -- over the next several quarters, because of where we think demand is and as that demand continues to be met, there's also a need to replenish what's happened from a supply chain standpoint and some of the tightness that's happened from a supply chain standpoint. So that's, obviously led to very favorable pricing in the first quarter. And as we look out over the next several quarters, we think that, that environment continues, that tight environment continues.\nWendell Weeks: Yeah. Just building on Tony\u2019s, because I think you're, obviously, a close watcher of the industry. We were tight. Glass was tight, and glass is going to stay tight for -- as far as we can see right now. Then with a competitor having a power outage and the planned shutdown of the Korean operations, that took everything being delayed because the market was so strong, that tipped everything in the shortage. So, we went from being very tight to go into shortage. And that's what led to the very, very strong quarter one pricing environment. But we're going to stay tight even as we address those. I think the Koreans will still, ultimately, continue their shift to those big Gen 10.5 plants just because it's more economical. But right now, they continue to press us to be able to help them supply their Korean operations, and they're not providing a firm end date for when they'll transfer those over primarily because they continue to see this end market as being very strong. Does that make sense? Does that answer your question?\nTim Long: Yeah. Yeah, great. I'm just curious if in any way it changes the longer term view of most of the production moving to China, if the delay here in the Koreans moving -- does that change the overall outlook of the impact of your China position?\nWendell Weeks: Well, I think because these Gen 10.5 plants produced panels, I don't know, roughly at about a 30% cost advantage, especially when they're integrated with our glass operations. The fastest, a pretty powerful microeconomic force so that you're just seeing the behavior set that when demand is well is more than those ultimate low-cost production assets, then less productive capacity stays full. And so as that continues to grow, I still think the right bet is continuing movement towards those big Gen 10.5 plants.\nTim Long: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to dig a bit further into the opportunity for Valor over the next 18 to 24 months. And I'm just curious how maybe conversations have changed with partners given the strong uptake, I know it's from a small, small base, but of Valor Glass vials related to COVID, and just how maybe have your thoughts changed around the timing of investment and the ability to grow this business? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: So the way we view Valor, Shannon, is this is an opportunity to help make all of us safer. And so, we're going with Virtu first, rather than any one of our previous plans. And so now, we are full on accelerating as fast as we can. We're also looking at other ways that our Valor technology can help fill and finish operations because as the world shifts to try to address this really need for billions of doses. We want to make sure that other life-saving medicines can be produced. And so that bottleneck is going to increasingly shift towards fill and finish. And we are uniquely qualified to do that. Many of the vaccines have very complicated thermal cycles that our technology is once again uniquely positioned to do. So sort of simple answer to your question is it's all hands on deck, trying to increase our production, a Valor to increase the applicability of our technology across this platform. I personally have now switched to leading a key engineering program to help address this upcoming bottleneck. That's a long answer. Really, I could have simply just said, how has it changed our view, we need to make a lot more vials, is the short answer to your question, Shannon.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. So Optical grew in the quarter on a year-on-year basis and you're expressing confidence on the fact that the growth is going to continue. Can you maybe help us think about sort of the rate and pace of recovery in Optical, and how the conversations with your customers have changed through the course of the quarter that's now giving you this confidence on growth? And you seem to be really firing across all cylinders here. I'm curious if you can maybe share some high-level viewpoint on 2021 versus 2020, which segment would you say is going to be the largest contributor of growth and profitability? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Well, let me first start with from an Optical standpoint. I think the last several calls, we really have focused in on our fundamental belief that as bandwidth demand is increasing and users demand higher performance, connections that this was going to be positive from a business standpoint. And we've even talked about, I think, in the last quarter about how our customers were beginning to talk more about that in their conference calls, and there are plenty of examples of that. I think what's really happened over the last three or four months is that our sales and order rates have started to pick up. And it's really that pickup in the sales and order rates, which is what drove our growth on a year-over-year basis and why we're confident that, that growth is going to happen. So I think the question before was, when was it going to happen? And I think the answer is that it's happening now. And so, I think, that's how we think about it there. And then I think from an overall economic standpoint, clearly, as we enter into the year, we had a very strong fourth quarter, and we expect to have a strong first quarter. But there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world and we're not in the greatest position to sort through how that uncertainty is actually going to play out. We think there's two places where we can provide unique insights. When was optical that we just talked about. And the other was to better understand what's happening from a display standpoint, and that's the areas that we focused on during the call.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Great. Thanks. If I could quickly follow-up. On the pricing front, I mean, as you noted, this is very unusual for a first quarter. Typically, you reset price contracts in Q1 on LCD glass. Wendell, obviously, articulated all the reasons why we're seeing this better pricing. And you're also saying that this is -- the market is going to stay relatively tight. But as you ramp your Gen 10.5 capacity, should we expect the pricing cadence to change through the course of the year? Normally, you have a big step down in Q1 and then you have very moderate in through the rest of the year, this year, you're not really seeing a step down. In fact, with some customers, you're seeing a step up. So should we expect that pace of pricing to remain as it has in past years, just very, very moderate, or should we take that as more capacity ramps with Gen 10.5, gee, you're actually going to see more maybe accelerated pricing pressure as you go through the course of the year?\nWendell Weeks: I think you should think of it, Wamsi, as we'd expect that moderation. The environment for moderation continues. I totally get your question though, because the pattern of pricing sort of is a little different than normal. We had the best pricing in quarter one that we've had in a decade in terms of relative move, relative decrease. And so the pattern of question is, like, totally legit, but we do expect it to remain tight how the exact pattern plays out. And let's take it a quarter at a time. And right now, we see quarter one, the way we see it. And we -- our current look in the quarter two is, as Tony said, looks pretty favorable to us in continued moderation.\nWamsi Mohan: Thanks guys. Congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citi. Your line is open.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for the opportunity. A couple of quick questions. One on Specialty, clearly, a very strong performance here in the face of smartphone undergrowing and declining actually. But with a strong recovery ahead, if you can like dial down a little bit deeper into your expectations for specialty, that would be great. And then for Tony, as well, on OpEx, you guys are talking about at recent conferences about, kind of, bit very well-managed on the OpEx. Can you just talk to us about what are some of the changes that you've done internally that despite the growth that you're seeing and the secular demand trend that you're thinking about into 2021? OpEx should be well-maintained here -- or well-contained here, I should say. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Great. Let's start with OpEx, and then I'll touch briefly on specialty. And I would like to make a little more macro comment on how we see the year. Yeah. I think from an OpEx standpoint, I see -- clearly, when we got into the early parts of 2020 and things were changing, we did a number of things to adjust our operating cost. Some of them were set up so that we would be able to as the economy has recovered, be able to respond to that. Some of them were compensation related, for example, furloughs and things like that. And certainly, to the degree that business has returned, of course, those costs will also return. But from an overall standpoint, we've remained very focused from an OpEx standpoint to make sure that we're getting leverage as we grow and that we don't grow our OpEx over a longer period of time as fast as we grow our sales. And that's really our underlying philosophy from an OpEx standpoint. I think what structurally makes it possible for us to do is when you us lay out our three, four, five framework, what that allows us to do as we build on our market access platforms, is that ability to reuse and share those platforms, both in our -- we've seen that both on our technology side, as well now in our customer facing organizations. And so that should allow us to more efficiently address the growth that we see. And over time, we do expect that at operating margin leverage to be a more powerful generated for us than just at the manufacturing gross margin levels. So you're going to see us really addressing that more because that's where we're seeing the synergy really start to drive across our portfolio. Let's touch briefly on specialty for you. We would expect that our outperformance versus the smartphone market to continue. And sort of the -- I'm not calling what happens with the smartphone market. So that, kind of, takes me to a broader point. And I'd be really interested in -- feedback from investors, both sell-side and buy, which is -- we saw the strong momentum. We knew it was coming, but we saw the strong momentum and really strong order book in Q4. And that continues into this quarter. So that clarity enabled us to provide the sales in EPS guidance that we just did for quarter one. Now we listen to our investors and made it simple and clear by providing sales and EPS for the entire company rather than the more complicated and detailed market-by-market guidance that we previously provided. Now as we turn to the total year, simply put, we expect our momentum and our outperformance versus our markets to continue. So then the question really becomes what happens in the macro environment. Now you all have your own experts and opinions on what's going to happen in the macro. At Corning, we approach our ability to predict macroeconomic and geopolitical events and tensions with great humility. Hence, we don't think it's helpful for us at this time to predict these forces, and therefore, what exactly our revenue for the year will be. But what we are confident of is we\u2019re going to outperform these markets. So as you pick your geopolitical or macroeconomic scenario, for our various markets, what you can count on is we're going to do better than that. So that may be more than you wanted to know, Asiya, but that's how we think about it.\nAsiya Merchant: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the Specialty Material. Wendell, when do you think we're actually going to see enough of a penetration into other industries, so for \u2013 specifically for Gorilla that you would have more of a debundling from a smartphone market? And I have a follow-up.\nWendell Weeks: Could you say more. I want to make sure I understand your question.\nMehdi Hosseini: Sure. Sure.\nWendell Weeks: You always have very interesting ones, so let me make sure I understand.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you. We have been anticipating diversification of Gorilla Glass into other markets like auto. And then you highlighted Mercedes Benz. And I just want to see what instigated you to actually illustrate that case. And in that context, how should we think about diversification of Gorilla and Specialty Material end market?\nWendell Weeks: I totally understand. As always, a really good question. So we highlighted that for two reasons. First, our momentum in auto glass systems is increasing. And it's not yet at the point where we would say, okay, in your models, you better start providing for display because it's going to change your macro numbers. But we can totally feel it. And you will feel it more going forward. We're also seeing Gorilla find its way into more and more of our maps. What we're going to do is really talk about that in the form of those market access platforms as the various forms that that technology takes, serves multiple of our customers. Believe it or not, it's even finding its way into opto. So we'll \u2013 let us take that note. And as that becomes more important, we'll make sure we share a little bit more on it, Mehdi.\nMehdi Hosseini: Sure. Thank you. And maybe I just as a follow-up to that question. Thank you for providing detailed opportunities in other industry. You highlighted $100 of content per car. I want to better understand whether some of the key assumptions, how are you thinking about the evolution of electric vehicle and as that segment grow, is your $100 content accounts for that change in auto industry? And does that also account for like, Gorilla penetrating other industry? And again, how should we how should we think about variability in that $100 content?\nWendell Weeks: Yes. So, I think, the short answer to your question is, yes. So, all of the above. So I think what we should do, what I recommend we do is, why don't we -- why don't you follow-up with Ann and let us share just the way we think about the map. And it'll probably be an excellent report for you to do. We'll be helpful and lay that all out, because you had got a great question. And we have the build, and we'd be happy to share it.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. So can I ask one...\nWendell Weeks: I think Tony has something to add. He's looking at me like he has something to add.\nTony Tripeny: No, I mean, Mehdi, I think that would be great. Why don't we -- I think we talk to you later today, and we can talk about next steps on this. And the only thing I wanted to point out as the CFO, is that any glass that's sold to the automotive industry right now shows up in our automotive or into our other segment, not in our Specialty Materials segment, but that was just more of a reporting for...\nMehdi Hosseini: Well, thank you very much.\nTony Tripeny: You\u2019re welcome.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nJoe Cardoso: Hi, guys. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. Just one follow-up question for me on the optical side. Obviously, the return of your growth and guide for full year growth is great to hear, but I just wanted to take a moment and focus on the profitability initiatives that has been done in that business specifically. Can you walk us through what you've been doing on the optical side, particularly as it relates to temporary versus permanent measures, as well as if there's any weighting towards carrier versus the enterprise portions of those businesses? And as we see revenues come back in that business, is there any way you can gauge expectations relative to the profitability now versus, let's say, a year ago, assuming apples-to-apples revenue profile?\nTony Tripeny: I think from an overall standpoint, we're seeing both growth in the carrier and in the enterprise business. Of course, the enterprise piece is a lot of what being grown from cloud computing, hyperscale data centers. Some of the traditional enterprise pieces are more impacted by the economy. You're not seeing that as much. But we're really seeing growth in both parts of those businesses. And from an operational standpoint, I mean, I think what's important to note is, is that even though our revenues were down. We didn't change our ability to supply that, because we always knew it was going to come back. And there's costs that you carry during those kind of periods. And when you fill those factories back up, you see expansions from a margin standpoint. And we saw that in the third and fourth quarter of this year, and we'd expect to see that going forward.\nWendell Weeks: Yes. And also, Joe, you have another dynamic. I think Tony nailed it, which is, as you expect revenues -- as revenues expand, we would expect our margins to expand. There's another factor in that can always impact your quarter-to-quarter type of variability, which is what precisely are the operators or enterprise players buying. When they buy our more complicated, highly engineered solutions, when they buy those, our profitability is higher, right? Than if you're just buying fiber and cable. It depends what's specific size of cable. And so mix starts to play a real role in opto when you think about it from quarter-to-quarter. But if you step back, I think Tony has nailed the fundamentals here, which is as we fill. We would expect the incrementals to be good.\nJoe Cardoso: Thanks guys. I appreciate the insights into that and on a result.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Roberts: Thanks. Nice quarter and glad to be active on the stock again.\nWendell Weeks: John, you're welcome.\nTony Tripeny: It's so good to hear your voice John. Long time no see.\nJohn Roberts: Yeah. You've had another quarter to think about the strategy in semiconductors. You've got the lens business and Specialty Materials, and it's benefiting from EUV and you put Hemlock in other, and it doesn't really benefit from any, I think, special trends going on in the semiconductor market. So and it just looks like an opportunistic good deal at this point. Is there more to within that?\nWendell Weeks: So first, I'm just having flashbacks to almost a decade ago when you were telling me what we needed to do is make sure we ended up with Hemlock because it fit so much better with us and the silicone side fit so much better with Dow. And so we finally got it done, John. It just took us a while. So yeah, we feel good about it. For sure, the economics on that deal are incredibly good and we really like that. But actually, your insight from all those years ago, I think is right and we're going to run some experiments here to try to see, can we make more of a difference to Hemlock? Can we, with our capabilities, make it accelerate or vice versa? We really are interested and can we address some of the significant issues there are with lack of domestic production of solar here in the U.S? So there's a number of, I think -- there's a number of significant opportunities. It's too early to say, will they work out or not. And sometimes, and I'd love to have a conversation with you about any ideas that you have on it as well, given how long you've advocated for this.\nTony Tripeny: Yeah. We will definitely do that, John, and we will get back with you on some of those ideas. And all I would say is that in the short-term, all the financial attractiveness of this deal is absolutely paying out as we expected it to. As you know, we didn't put any money into this transaction and Hemlock generates a lot of cash. And so what debt they had, they've mostly started -- we'll pay back within a year, in fact, pay back a lot of it in the fourth quarter. They generate approximately $150 million of annual cash flow. So we're very excited from a financial standpoint and also from a strategic standpoint.\nJohn Roberts: And maybe just an easier financial question. So you guided for 2021 CapEx, roughly flat with 2020. Do you still expect it to be relatively modest through 2023, which -- that was your target, I think, at the Investor Day?\nTony Tripeny: Yeah. I think what happens through 2023, of course, depends a lot on how much growth that we get and how much growth capital that we have to put in bill capital that we have to put in over the next several years. And the good news is any bill capital. I mean, first of all, it comes with growth. And secondly, it comes with a pretty significant customer commitments.\nJohn Roberts: Great Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Go ahead, Joel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is now open.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good morning. I just had two quick questions. First, on the 25 points of outperformance for Specialty Materials versus mobile device sales last year, can you sort of put that in perspective, where maybe there's some unusualness to the outperformance, what maybe a normal rate of change would be versus markets, et cetera?  And then just as a follow-up, when you talk about the bullishness with Optical, how much are you factoring in the recent auctions on the rural side and the 5G side into that bullishness, or is this before thinking about those things? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: I think on the specialty side, you can always expect us to outperform because of the more Corning strategy, putting more content, higher value content in. What the rate of that is, I think you're quite wise to say, well, that could depend on which particular products are working really well for our end customers and how much of that has our newest technology or is different types of our technology. And that gets a lot harder to predict, because you not only have to call the total market, but then which OEMs sort of win in that market, as well as which of our technologies play. But I think, overall, you could think about it as we will outperform, it's just a little too early in the year to give you some insight as to like how much to outperform, Steven. I'm sorry on that. And then on Opto, you're right to identify it, it is definitely a positive, but it is just one of the sort of number of positive impacts and announcements that you're seeing from our key customers. It's never been \u2013 as Tony said, it's never been that we did it \u2013 we believe strongly that our customers would have to build and invest to meet the very strong demand. What we wanted to do, though, is before we predicted when it would come. We wanted to see it in our sales. We wanted to see it in our order book. We wanted to see the projects actually state. And so that's what we're seeing. And that's why we're saying it.\nSteven Fox: That's helpful. Congrats on the quarter.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks.\nAnn Nicholson: Joel, we'll take one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. And that question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nRod Hall: Yes. Thanks for sneaking me in. I appreciate it. I've just got one question, and that is \u2013 mainly, I guess, aimed at Tony. Tony, we're looking at the cash flow conversion of EBITDA in the fourth quarter, and it's lower than we anticipated. We see the working capital release a little lower than last year. So that's one of the drivers that normally, we see pretty good conversion in Q4. I assume maybe there's COVID related impacts, et cetera. But I wonder if you could dig into the color on that a little bit more for us and help us understand the dynamics of the cash flow conversion, whether it's one-off in nature and kind of some of those things go away as we move into the year here.\nTony Tripeny: Yes. Actually, we were quite pleased with our cash flow conversion in the back half of the year. Compared to NPAT, which is the way a lot of people talk about the cash flow conversion, I mean our cash flow and our NPAT was the same number in the fourth quarter, and it was -- and our cash flow was a little bit better than our NPAT in the third quarter. So, I mean, we were real happy with the cash flow conversion. And in terms of some of the specifics there, Rod, when we talk to you later today, I'd be happy to walk through it with you. But, overall, we were very excited about our cash flow conversion. And frankly, that's a question that a lot of our investors have asked us over the last couple of years, and it's something that we've been focused on. And this is what happens when we're not in a build cycle. We generate a lot of operating cash flow. We generate a lot of free cash flow, and we saw that in the back half of this year. We expect to see more of that in 2021.\nRod Hall: Great. Okay. Thanks, Tony.\nAnn Nicholson: Yes. Thanks, Rod. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Before we close, I just wanted to let you know that we will attend the Goldman Sachs 2021 Virtual Tech & Internet Conference on February 11, the UBS West Coast conference on February 23 and the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on March 1. And a replay of today's call will be available on our site starting later this morning. Operator, that concludes our call, please disconnect all lines.\nOperator: This concludes our call for today. Thank you for attending.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported an outstanding finish to the year. Each of our segments grew sales and profits year-over-year, and we continue to progress our strategic initiatives. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.3 billion, up 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. Our operating margin expanded 500 basis points year-over-year to 19.4%. Operating income grew 18% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. EPS of $0.52 was up 21% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We generated $464 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, $948 million for the full year, and we finished the year with $2.7 billion in cash on our balance sheet. It goes without saying, 2020 was an incredibly difficult year. We joined the rest of the world to confront the pandemic, economic uncertainty, and social unrest. Throughout the year, we focused on our customers and executed on strategic priorities while protecting our people. For more perspective on our performance, I'll share three observations. First, we demonstrated our ability to adapt rapidly and remain resilient in the face of uncertainty. Second, our more Corning content strategy clearly contributed to our growth and our performance against our end markets; and finally, throughout this difficult period, we're embracing the opportunity to make a difference wherever we are with what we have to contribute. Now, I'll expand on my first observation. Our decisive actions and strong operational execution have resulted in continued leadership in the capabilities that make Corning distinctive. Like many companies, we focused on bolstering our financial strength, reducing production levels, and operating costs, carefully managing inventory, reducing capital expenditures, and pausing share buybacks. However, it's not about what we cut, but what we kept. While we adjusted production, we didn't reduce capacity keeping us positioned to meet increasing demand when the economy improved. We continue to make strategic investments and advance major innovations with our customers to capture the growth playing out across our market access platforms, and we developed multifaceted programs to protect our talent and preserve our capabilities. Our first half actions generated significant cost savings in the second half of the year, and as the economy started showing signs of green shoots, we effectively adjusted our operations keeping pace as demand started to recover in many of the markets we serve. Our results tell the story. Our sales were down 12% in the first half as most economies were impacted by pandemic-related lockdowns. But in the second half, we improved sales 24% over the first, while growing operating income 122%, returning to year-over-year growth and generating very strong free cash flow. For the year, we generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow and our balance sheet remains very strong. We expect this strong momentum to continue heading into 2021. We will continue to adapt and focus on execution as we have proven that our approach is working. Turning to my second observation. In all the industries we serve, important market trends continue to offer new challenges that Corning is just uniquely qualified to address and new opportunities to integrate more Corning content into our customers' products. In this difficult year, we have proven that this is an especially powerful value creation letter. We aren't relying exclusively on people buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. In the fourth quarter, this strategy paid off as we grew sales year-over-year in every one of our businesses. At the top were Specialty Materials, with sales up 20% year-over-year, and Environmental Technologies up 19% year-over-year, both significantly outperforming their end markets. Last quarter, I described our innovations in Mobile Consumer Electronics, looking at how we're investing to create additional revenue streams and capture content opportunities. Today, I'll focus on our Automotive Market-Access Platform. The auto industry is undergoing major disruptions. Automakers are designing cleaner and safer vehicles, while featuring technology that provides immersive experiences. We're uniquely suited to address these trends. And for us, the opportunity is large in the range of $100 per car in Corning content. We're collaborating with more OEMs, and we're offering more solutions to help move the industry forward. Let's look at two of our biggest successes right now. Starting with our Automotive Glass Solutions business, we're building strong momentum. Our advantaged solutions are enabling the very rapid shift toward in-vehicle displays that are interactive, that are integrated and shaped. We're collaborating with industry leaders across the auto ecosystem, including Visteon, LGE, BOE, and Via Optronics to accelerate the adoption of our patented 3D ColdForm technology, which enables lower cost, shaped, auto interiors. Our large-scale facility in Hefei, China is now fully operational and servicing our growing demand. And we continue to see strong adoption of our technology by auto OEMs. Our recent proof point is the new Mercedes-Benz Hyperscreen dashboard display, which features a Gorilla Glass cover nearly 5 feet wide. Similarly, in Environmental Technologies, in a year when a global pandemic temporarily shut down OEM production, our proprietary gasoline particulate filter business still grew sales year-over-year. When we introduced GPF, we said our technology increased our content opportunity per car by three to four times. Like most of our innovations, it started with the customer challenge. Europe and China are addressing fine particular pollution with new emissions regulations. We applied our expertise in ceramic science with our advanced manufacturing capabilities and extrusion to rapidly develop filters that efficiently trap ion particulates. And today, we're effectively helping automakers reduce these harmful emissions, meet new regulations, and produce some of the cleanest gasoline vehicles you can buy. Demand for our GPS has grown quickly. And with our market leading product, we continue to win the majority of platforms awarded to date. We're well on our way to building a $0.5 billion business. We're actually ahead of schedule, and the content opportunity continues to grow. We expect our GPS technology to migrate beyond Europe and China as other regions focus on improving air quality. And many new car models will soon be required to get even closer to near zero particulate emissions. In response, we recently introduced our next-generation GPS, featuring enhanced filtration capabilities. They're launching in upcoming models as automakers prepare for the next wave of regulations. Across our markets, we see a similar content story playing out as we respond to key industry challenges with more Corning solutions. Let me share some other accomplishments across our market access platforms. In Life Sciences, pandemic related demand has highlighted our strength in the industry. And we achieved major milestones towards building a significant Valor Glass franchise in 2020. At the start of the year, we entered a long-term supply agreement to provide Valor Glass vials for a portion of the currently marketed Pfizer drug products. Soon after, we were awarded $204 million in funding from the U.S. government to substantially expand domestic manufacturing capacity for Valor vials. Today, we're supplying Valor Glass to several leading COVID vaccine manufacturers. We produce millions of Valor vials and shipped enough for more than 100 million doses, supporting multiple vaccine developers. In our Life Sciences segment, the global health fight is driving strong demand for our consumable products. We're supporting the development of treatments in vaccines, as well as mass testing efforts. We received $15 million from the U.S. government to expand domestic capacity for robotic pipette tips, which are used for COVID diagnostic testing. BioNTech recently recognized our contribution to their successful COVID vaccine development. Turning to Mobile Consumer Electronics. We launched the toughest Gorilla Glass yet, Victus. And it's already featured on six Samsung devices. Corning also invented the world's first transparent color-free glass ceramic, which is featured on the front cover of the latest iPhone. Apple and Corning partnered to develop and scale manufacturing of Ceramic Shield. It offers unparallel durability and toughness. I noted that Specialty Materials sales were up 20% year-over-year in quarter four. They were up 18% for the full year in a smartphone market that declined 7%. In Optical Communications, we returned to growth and we expect this growth to continue as customers increase spending to support growing bandwidth requirements. In 2020, we introduced new and innovative solutions that help speed the deployment of 5G. We launched our outdoor 5G-ready connectivity solutions, featuring compact easy-to-install terminals that can be deployed in any conceivable architecture. Operators can actually save up to $500 per terminal location, dramatically lowering installation cost and speeding up deployment. We're also collaborating with Verizon to enable 5G millimeter wave indoor deployments for their enterprise customers. We're also working with Qualcomm Technologies to deliver indoor networks that are 5G ready, easy-to-install and affordable. And we're collaborating with EnerSys to simplify the delivery of fiber and electrical power to small-cell wireless sites. Turning to Display. Retail demand for TV and IT products remain strong. Demand for large-sized TVs continues to grow. 75-inch sets were up more than 60% for the full year. Large TVs are most efficiently made on Gen 10.5 plants. Corning is well positioned to capture that growth with its Gen 10.5 plants in China, including the two newest Gen 10.5 facilities in Wuhan and Guangzhou, which are now expanding production to meet customer demand. Ramping these sites has been no small feat in the midst of a pandemic. We are very proud of our innovative and dedicated expert engineering teams that rose to a host of unprecedented challenges to start-up tanks in both facilities. Looking ahead, Corning's long-term growth drivers and content opportunities are strong in each of our markets. And we believe some secular trends could accelerate as consumer lifestyles continue to change in the aftermath of the health crisis. And that leads to my third observation. We're living through the kind of moment that tends to bring true carrier to light. At Corning, our values are evident in our actions. We've unleased our capabilities to help combat the virus. And we're proud to be creating life-changing technologies that contribute to keeping people safe and help society address the challenges of the pandemic. We also recognize, in these unprecedented times, that we have the opportunity to share resources and leadership on a range of important issues. We've launched racial and social quality programs, and our Unity Campaign support vital human services and emergency relief in our communities around the world. In conclusion, on all fronts, Corning is executing well. We're delivering outstanding results and making important progress across our strategic priorities. I am confident that we are entering the year with solid momentum and we expect to grow in 2021. Our More Corning strategy will continue to drive outperformance across the diverse industries that we serve. We're not just counting on consumers buying more cars, TVs or smartphones to grow. And I'm excited about how we're bringing our capabilities to bear in optical and life sciences, as operators expand their networks and we continue to support vital drug and vaccine development. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tony, so that he can provide additional insight on our results and expectations. Yeah. Just building on Tony's, because I think you're, obviously, a close watcher of the industry. We were tight. Glass was tight, and glass is going to stay tight for -- as far as we can see right now. Then with a competitor having a power outage and the planned shutdown of the Korean operations, that took everything being delayed because the market was so strong, that tipped everything in the shortage. So, we went from being very tight to go into shortage. And that's what led to the very, very strong quarter one pricing environment. But we're going to stay tight even as we address those. I think the Koreans will still, ultimately, continue their shift to those big Gen 10.5 plants just because it's more economical. But right now, they continue to press us to be able to help them supply their Korean operations, and they're not providing a firm end date for when they'll transfer those over primarily because they continue to see this end market as being very strong. Does that make sense? Does that answer your question? Well, I think because these Gen 10.5 plants produced panels, I don't know, roughly at about a 30% cost advantage, especially when they're integrated with our glass operations. The fastest, a pretty powerful microeconomic force so that you're just seeing the behavior set that when demand is well is more than those ultimate low-cost production assets, then less productive capacity stays full. And so as that continues to grow, I still think the right bet is continuing movement towards those big Gen 10.5 plants. So the way we view Valor, Shannon, is this is an opportunity to help make all of us safer. And so, we're going with Virtu first, rather than any one of our previous plans. And so now, we are full on accelerating as fast as we can. We're also looking at other ways that our Valor technology can help fill and finish operations because as the world shifts to try to address this really need for billions of doses. We want to make sure that other life-saving medicines can be produced. And so that bottleneck is going to increasingly shift towards fill and finish. And we are uniquely qualified to do that. Many of the vaccines have very complicated thermal cycles that our technology is once again uniquely positioned to do. So sort of simple answer to your question is it's all hands on deck, trying to increase our production, a Valor to increase the applicability of our technology across this platform. I personally have now switched to leading a key engineering program to help address this upcoming bottleneck. That's a long answer. Really, I could have simply just said, how has it changed our view, we need to make a lot more vials, is the short answer to your question, Shannon. Well, let me first start with from an Optical standpoint. I think the last several calls, we really have focused in on our fundamental belief that as bandwidth demand is increasing and users demand higher performance, connections that this was going to be positive from a business standpoint. And we've even talked about, I think, in the last quarter about how our customers were beginning to talk more about that in their conference calls, and there are plenty of examples of that. I think what's really happened over the last three or four months is that our sales and order rates have started to pick up. And it's really that pickup in the sales and order rates, which is what drove our growth on a year-over-year basis and why we're confident that, that growth is going to happen. So I think the question before was, when was it going to happen? And I think the answer is that it's happening now. And so, I think, that's how we think about it there. And then I think from an overall economic standpoint, clearly, as we enter into the year, we had a very strong fourth quarter, and we expect to have a strong first quarter. But there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world and we're not in the greatest position to sort through how that uncertainty is actually going to play out. We think there's two places where we can provide unique insights. When was optical that we just talked about. And the other was to better understand what's happening from a display standpoint, and that's the areas that we focused on during the call. I think you should think of it, Wamsi, as we'd expect that moderation. The environment for moderation continues. I totally get your question though, because the pattern of pricing sort of is a little different than normal. We had the best pricing in quarter one that we've had in a decade in terms of relative move, relative decrease. And so the pattern of question is, like, totally legit, but we do expect it to remain tight how the exact pattern plays out. And let's take it a quarter at a time. And right now, we see quarter one, the way we see it. And we -- our current look in the quarter two is, as Tony said, looks pretty favorable to us in continued moderation. Great. Let's start with OpEx, and then I'll touch briefly on specialty. And I would like to make a little more macro comment on how we see the year. Yeah. I think from an OpEx standpoint, I see -- clearly, when we got into the early parts of 2020 and things were changing, we did a number of things to adjust our operating cost. Some of them were set up so that we would be able to as the economy has recovered, be able to respond to that. Some of them were compensation related, for example, furloughs and things like that. And certainly, to the degree that business has returned, of course, those costs will also return. But from an overall standpoint, we've remained very focused from an OpEx standpoint to make sure that we're getting leverage as we grow and that we don't grow our OpEx over a longer period of time as fast as we grow our sales. And that's really our underlying philosophy from an OpEx standpoint. I think what structurally makes it possible for us to do is when you us lay out our three, four, five framework, what that allows us to do as we build on our market access platforms, is that ability to reuse and share those platforms, both in our -- we've seen that both on our technology side, as well now in our customer facing organizations. And so that should allow us to more efficiently address the growth that we see. And over time, we do expect that at operating margin leverage to be a more powerful generated for us than just at the manufacturing gross margin levels. So you're going to see us really addressing that more because that's where we're seeing the synergy really start to drive across our portfolio. Let's touch briefly on specialty for you. We would expect that our outperformance versus the smartphone market to continue. And sort of the -- I'm not calling what happens with the smartphone market. So that, kind of, takes me to a broader point. And I'd be really interested in -- feedback from investors, both sell-side and buy, which is -- we saw the strong momentum. We knew it was coming, but we saw the strong momentum and really strong order book in Q4. And that continues into this quarter. So that clarity enabled us to provide the sales in EPS guidance that we just did for quarter one. Now we listen to our investors and made it simple and clear by providing sales and EPS for the entire company rather than the more complicated and detailed market-by-market guidance that we previously provided. Now as we turn to the total year, simply put, we expect our momentum and our outperformance versus our markets to continue. So then the question really becomes what happens in the macro environment. Now you all have your own experts and opinions on what's going to happen in the macro. At Corning, we approach our ability to predict macroeconomic and geopolitical events and tensions with great humility. Hence, we don't think it's helpful for us at this time to predict these forces, and therefore, what exactly our revenue for the year will be. But what we are confident of is we're going to outperform these markets. So as you pick your geopolitical or macroeconomic scenario, for our various markets, what you can count on is we're going to do better than that. So that may be more than you wanted to know, Asiya, but that's how we think about it. Could you say more. I want to make sure I understand your question. You always have very interesting ones, so let me make sure I understand. I totally understand. As always, a really good question. So we highlighted that for two reasons. First, our momentum in auto glass systems is increasing. And it's not yet at the point where we would say, okay, in your models, you better start providing for display because it's going to change your macro numbers. But we can totally feel it. And you will feel it more going forward. We're also seeing Gorilla find its way into more and more of our maps. What we're going to do is really talk about that in the form of those market access platforms as the various forms that that technology takes, serves multiple of our customers. Believe it or not, it's even finding its way into opto. So we'll \u2013 let us take that note. And as that becomes more important, we'll make sure we share a little bit more on it, Mehdi. Yes. So, I think, the short answer to your question is, yes. So, all of the above. So I think what we should do, what I recommend we do is, why don't we -- why don't you follow-up with Ann and let us share just the way we think about the map. And it'll probably be an excellent report for you to do. We'll be helpful and lay that all out, because you had got a great question. And we have the build, and we'd be happy to share it. I think Tony has something to add. He's looking at me like he has something to add. Yes. And also, Joe, you have another dynamic. I think Tony nailed it, which is, as you expect revenues -- as revenues expand, we would expect our margins to expand. There's another factor in that can always impact your quarter-to-quarter type of variability, which is what precisely are the operators or enterprise players buying. When they buy our more complicated, highly engineered solutions, when they buy those, our profitability is higher, right? Than if you're just buying fiber and cable. It depends what's specific size of cable. And so mix starts to play a real role in opto when you think about it from quarter-to-quarter. But if you step back, I think Tony has nailed the fundamentals here, which is as we fill. We would expect the incrementals to be good. Thanks. John, you're welcome. So first, I'm just having flashbacks to almost a decade ago when you were telling me what we needed to do is make sure we ended up with Hemlock because it fit so much better with us and the silicone side fit so much better with Dow. And so we finally got it done, John. It just took us a while. So yeah, we feel good about it. For sure, the economics on that deal are incredibly good and we really like that. But actually, your insight from all those years ago, I think is right and we're going to run some experiments here to try to see, can we make more of a difference to Hemlock? Can we, with our capabilities, make it accelerate or vice versa? We really are interested and can we address some of the significant issues there are with lack of domestic production of solar here in the U.S? So there's a number of, I think -- there's a number of significant opportunities. It's too early to say, will they work out or not. And sometimes, and I'd love to have a conversation with you about any ideas that you have on it as well, given how long you've advocated for this. I think on the specialty side, you can always expect us to outperform because of the more Corning strategy, putting more content, higher value content in. What the rate of that is, I think you're quite wise to say, well, that could depend on which particular products are working really well for our end customers and how much of that has our newest technology or is different types of our technology. And that gets a lot harder to predict, because you not only have to call the total market, but then which OEMs sort of win in that market, as well as which of our technologies play. But I think, overall, you could think about it as we will outperform, it's just a little too early in the year to give you some insight as to like how much to outperform, Steven. I'm sorry on that. And then on Opto, you're right to identify it, it is definitely a positive, but it is just one of the sort of number of positive impacts and announcements that you're seeing from our key customers. It's never been \u2013 as Tony said, it's never been that we did it \u2013 we believe strongly that our customers would have to build and invest to meet the very strong demand. What we wanted to do, though, is before we predicted when it would come. We wanted to see it in our sales. We wanted to see it in our order book. We wanted to see the projects actually state. And so that's what we're seeing. And that's why we're saying it. Thanks."

            "name": "Tony Tripeny",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone. We feel good about our fourth quarter results. On a year-over-year basis, we grew sales and earnings. We expect to grow again in the first quarter, and we expect to grow for the full year, driven by improving markets and our More Corning strategy. We are building a bigger, stronger company that delivers sustainable results while remaining agile in our ability to respond to changing market factors. Now let me walk you through our fourth quarter performance. In the fourth quarter, we grew sales 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year to $3.3 billion, exceeding expectations. Excluding the consolidation of Hemlock Semiconductor, sales grew 11% year-over-year, with every segment growing sales and net income. Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies delivered particularly strong year-over-year sales growth, up 20% and 19%, respectively, both outperforming their underlying markets. Optical Communications returned to year-over-year growth, and we expect that growth to continue. Our operating margin was 19.4%. That is an improvement of 500 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We grew operating income 18% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. EPS of $0.52 was up 21% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We generated $464 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Cumulative free cash flow for the full year was $948 million. We ended the year with a cash balance of $2.7 billion. We entered 2021 in an excellent financial position. Now let's review the business segments. In Display Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $841 million, up 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. And net income was $217 million, up 11% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Retail demand for TV and IT products remain strong remained strong during the promotional season in Q4. Display's full year sales were $3.2 billion, and net income was $717 million. Our full year price declines in 2020 were mid-single digits. The glass market and our glass volume were up mid-single digits for the year. The retail market was more robust than the industry expected, resulting in panel supply being tight for the second half of 2020. Panel makers ran at high utilizations and the industry drew down inventory to satisfy demand. These dynamics also resulted in glass supply being tight, and more recently in shortage due to a power outage at a competitor's glass plant. Now let's look at 2021. We expect the TV and IT retail markets to remain strong. We remain confident that large size TVs will continue to grow, and we are well-positioned to capture that growth with Gen 10.5, which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing. We expect the glass market to grow a mid single-digit percentage in 2021. We expect glass supply to remain tight in the upcoming quarters. As a result of these supply/demand dynamics, we are experiencing a very favorable pricing environment. We expect Q1, 2021 glass prices to be flat with Q4, 2020. This is significantly better than the sequential declines we've seen in any other first quarter over the last decade. Glass prices for some customers in some gen sizes may actually see a sequential increase. We believe the following three factors will continue to drive the favorable pricing environment for the upcoming quarters. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be tight; second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels; and third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support acceptable returns on these investments. In Optical Communications, fourth quarter sales were $976 million, up 8% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Our year-over-year growth can be attributed to broad improvements in demand for both carrier and enterprise customers. Fourth quarter core net income of $141 million was up 127% year-over-year, and 23% sequentially. The improvement was driven by the incremental volume, and favorable cost performance. We have returned to growth in Optical Communications, and we expect that growth to continue. Bandwidth demand is increasing and users are demanding higher performance connections. We're seeing positive statements from customers on increasing investments in their optical networks. Our sales and order rates are picking up, and we're ready to capture demand as it materializes. We are confident we will grow sales in Optical Communications for the year. We continue to monitor and evaluate market demand signals to determine the magnitude of growth, and we'll keep \u2013 we'll continue to keep you updated as we go through the year. In Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $445 million, up 19% year-over-year and 17%, sequentially, ahead of expectations as markets continue to improve and GPF adoptions continued in China. Net income was $93 million, up 45% year-over-year and 35% sequentially, driven by strong operational performance globally and successful ramping of additional GPF capacity in China. For the full year, sales were $1.4 billion, and our performance was better than the underlying market. Net income was $197 million. While our full year 2020 sales were certainly impacted by COVID-19, we are recovering faster than the market by increasing our content for both the automotive and diesel end markets. Despite severely challenged markets we saw year over growth in GPF sales. Strong GPF adoption continues in Europe and in China, where the China 6a regulation is being implemented nationwide this month. We are ahead of our original timeframe to build a $500 million GPF business. Specialty Materials had an outstanding fourth quarter and full year. Q4 sales of $545 million were up 20% year-over-year, full year sales were $1.9 billion, up 18% year-over-year, despite a 7% decline in the smartphone market, driven by strong demand for our premium cover materials and our other innovations. Net income was $423 million, up 40% from 2019 on higher sales volume and strong cost performance. The importance of computing and connectivity were amplified during the pandemic. Our new product innovations, including Ceramic Shield and Gorilla Glass Victus, as well as our EUV products in the semiconductor market were important contributors to our strong performance. Now before I get to our Life Sciences results, I'd like to note something of great importance to us. Throughout the pandemic, our Life Sciences market access platform has applied its broad capabilities and full product portfolio to help the world combat the pandemic. From our traditionally research-focused consumables to our bioproduction products to our transport media and, of course, our Valor Glass, we're playing a vital role in the development and supply of test kits and vaccines. Now let's look at our segment results. Life Sciences fourth quarter sales were $274 million, up 7% year-over-year and 23% sequentially, driven by strong demand for COVID related products, including bioproduction products used in clinical trials. Net income was $42 million, up 11% year-over-year and 50% sequentially. In summary, we successfully navigated a very challenging year. We strengthened our balance sheet, established growth in the second half and generated free cash flow of $948 million for the year. As we look ahead, we have strong momentum coming into 2021 and expect year-over-year growth to accelerate in the first quarter. Specifically, we expect core sales of $3.0 billion to $3.2 billion compared to $2.5 billion in the first quarter last year and EPS of $0.40 to $0.44, which is double last year's first quarter EPS at the low end of the range. For the full year, we expect growth in sales and earnings, and we anticipate generating more free cash flow in 2021 than in 2020. And we will share more with you as the year progresses. Let's turn to our commitment to financial stewardship and prudent capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect that to continue going forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders. Our first priority for our use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic M&A. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. In 2021, we expect CapEx similar to 2020, as we have capacity in place to meet higher sales. Now we'll invest more if we require capacity to support additional growth, any additional capital investment would be supported by a customer commitment. We'll keep you updated as we go throughout the year. Given our expected strong free cash flow generation in 2021, we expect to increase our distributions to shareholders. That includes reinstating opportunistic share repurchases sometime this year. In closing, we're very pleased with our strong close to 2020, highlighted by growing sales and profitability. We continue to focus on a rich set of opportunities. Our businesses are fundamental to the long-term growth drivers in the industries they serve, and our More Corning strategy continues to deliver sales outperformance relative to our end markets. And I look forward to sharing our progress as the year goes on. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann? Sure. I mean, I think it's important to think about what's happened over the last year from a display standpoint. The market overall was more robust than what we had expected. And what the industry expected which meant that panel makers ran tight in the second half of 2020. Not only did those higher utilizations, but the industry also brought down inventory to meet that demand, and that meant that glass was tight throughout the year. And as you -- we remain confident that things will remain tight on -- over the next several quarters, because of where we think demand is and as that demand continues to be met, there's also a need to replenish what's happened from a supply chain standpoint and some of the tightness that's happened from a supply chain standpoint. So that's, obviously led to very favorable pricing in the first quarter. And as we look out over the next several quarters, we think that, that environment continues, that tight environment continues. No, I mean, Mehdi, I think that would be great. Why don't we -- I think we talk to you later today, and we can talk about next steps on this. And the only thing I wanted to point out as the CFO, is that any glass that's sold to the automotive industry right now shows up in our automotive or into our other segment, not in our Specialty Materials segment, but that was just more of a reporting for... You're welcome. I think from an overall standpoint, we're seeing both growth in the carrier and in the enterprise business. Of course, the enterprise piece is a lot of what being grown from cloud computing, hyperscale data centers. Some of the traditional enterprise pieces are more impacted by the economy. You're not seeing that as much. But we're really seeing growth in both parts of those businesses. And from an operational standpoint, I mean, I think what's important to note is, is that even though our revenues were down. We didn't change our ability to supply that, because we always knew it was going to come back. And there's costs that you carry during those kind of periods. And when you fill those factories back up, you see expansions from a margin standpoint. And we saw that in the third and fourth quarter of this year, and we'd expect to see that going forward. It's so good to hear your voice John. Long time no see. Yeah. We will definitely do that, John, and we will get back with you on some of those ideas. And all I would say is that in the short-term, all the financial attractiveness of this deal is absolutely paying out as we expected it to. As you know, we didn't put any money into this transaction and Hemlock generates a lot of cash. And so what debt they had, they've mostly started -- we'll pay back within a year, in fact, pay back a lot of it in the fourth quarter. They generate approximately $150 million of annual cash flow. So we're very excited from a financial standpoint and also from a strategic standpoint. Yeah. I think what happens through 2023, of course, depends a lot on how much growth that we get and how much growth capital that we have to put in bill capital that we have to put in over the next several years. And the good news is any bill capital. I mean, first of all, it comes with growth. And secondly, it comes with a pretty significant customer commitments. Yes. Actually, we were quite pleased with our cash flow conversion in the back half of the year. Compared to NPAT, which is the way a lot of people talk about the cash flow conversion, I mean our cash flow and our NPAT was the same number in the fourth quarter, and it was -- and our cash flow was a little bit better than our NPAT in the third quarter. So, I mean, we were real happy with the cash flow conversion. And in terms of some of the specifics there, Rod, when we talk to you later today, I'd be happy to walk through it with you. But, overall, we were very excited about our cash flow conversion. And frankly, that's a question that a lot of our investors have asked us over the last couple of years, and it's something that we've been focused on. And this is what happens when we're not in a build cycle. We generate a lot of operating cash flow. We generate a lot of free cash flow, and we saw that in the back half of this year. We expect to see more of that in 2021."

We encourage you to follow along. They are also available on our website for downloading. And now, I will turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann and good morning everyone. Today, we reported third quarter results demonstrating that the company is strong, financially healthy and well-positioned for growth. Sales were $3 billion, up 16% sequentially, EPS grew 72% sequentially to $0.43 as higher sales and strong manufacturing execution resulted in operating margin expanding to 18.3%, up 710 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year. We generated $518 million of free cash flow and finished the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash. Our financial performance has improved significantly since April and we expect a strong fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we remain vigilant and continue to adapt appropriately to multiple disruptive forces playing out around the world from the pandemic to civil unrest to recession and geopolitical struggles. We have been rising to the challenges since Day 1 and our priorities remain clear. First, we must make our values evident in our actions. Our commitment to the health, safety and well-being of our employees underlined every facet of our operations. We are dedicating resources and providing leadership to support our communities around the world. We have launched Unity campaigns as well as racial and social equality programs targeting the multitude of hardships people are confronting right now. And when it comes to the global health fight, we are all in mobilizing our capabilities to combat the virus directly. We must also safeguard our financial health. Our third quarter results show that our decisive actions are providing clear benefits as we leverage cost savings and increase efficiencies across the company. Regardless of the depth or duration of global uncertainty, we are doing everything in our power to keep the company strong and is working. Now to ensure that we emerge even stronger, we are continuing to invest to create additional revenue streams. We are inventing new-to-the-world materials and manufacturing processes as well as co-innovating new solutions in partnership with our customers. The relevance of our portfolio puts Corning at the heart of ongoing innovation with industry leaders and we continue to solve our customers\u2019 toughest technology challenges. You may have seen Apple\u2019s recent promotion of Ceramic Shield for the iPhone 12. They are featuring our new-to-the-world material, which is the world\u2019s first highly transparent, color-free glass ceramic with performance that meets the rigorous demands put on smartphone cover materials. This latest innovation with Apple exemplifies our ongoing strategy of consistent long-term value creation by combining our deep expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with our unparalleled manufacturing and engineering capabilities. Ceramic Shield melts the attributes that we love about glass, great optics and retain strength with the attributes we love about ceramics, most notably, its toughness. Ceramic Shield consists of ceramic crystals within a glass matrix. There are two big inventions here. The first was keeping the best damage-resistant attributes of both glass and ceramics. The second was ensuring high-optical transparency by growing index matched nanocrystals inside the glass matrix that are one-tenth the wavelength of light. As you recall, Apple made two investments in Corning, totaling $450 million as part of their advanced manufacturing fund and their commitment to foster innovation among American manufacturers. We take Apple for our longstanding product development partnership and their investments in new manufacturing technology, centered in our Harrodsburg, Kentucky facility. We could not be prouder to be a key component in the iPhone 12. Now, it\u2019s important to note, the iPhone 12 and many other flagship phones that we are also proud to be part of support 5G. 5G matters to us. The density of fiber necessary to deliver its promise is yet another example. You have seen us illustrate that up to 100x more fiber is required to deploy 5G in the city than 4G. This week, we are announcing a product design to help operators dramatically boost the speed and reduce the cost of their outdoor deployments. And we are embarking on new work to support Verizon\u2019s to extend 5G indoors. The relevance of our portfolio and our deep customer relationships as illustrated by these advancements keep us at the center of the inexorable shift to optical. Stepping back, in all the industries we serve, important market trends offer new challenges that Corning is uniquely qualified to address and new opportunities to integrate more Corning content into products. This is an especially powerful value creation letter in times of economic uncertainty, because we aren\u2019t exclusively relying on people buying more stuff, we are putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. We are clearly seeing the benefits of this ladder in today\u2019s results as innovation adoption drove specialty material sales up 23% year-over-year, despite a declining smartphone market. This type of outperformance is not unique. From 2016 to 2019, we added $500 million in sales or 42% cumulatively, while smartphone sales actually went down and we are extending that growth streak this year. In Environmental Technologies, we grew sales 16% in 2019 much faster than the underlying unit demand as automakers added gas particulate filters to cars and we again saw outperformance this quarter with sequential sales, up 68%. These are additional examples of the more Corning strategy at work and why that content story is so powerful for us. I want to stress one additional point. You often hear us say that our core technologies enabled life changing capabilities. In these times, we are increasing focus on life-saving innovations. Safe widespread vaccine delivery is one of society\u2019s top priorities and glass packaging is critical. Our value innovation will help enable faster filling line speeds and increased patient safety. Right now, we are expanding capacity and supplying glass files for vaccines as part of Operation Warp Speed all while leveraging our leadership in life sciences to help support COVID diagnostic testing and virus research efforts. Additionally, reduce fine particulate pollution the objective of our filtration products appears to be helpful for reducing infection rates. And we are excited about recent university lab test showing that our Guardiant antimicrobial glass particles kill bacteria and viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. We are also well-positioned to contribute as consumers continue to adapt to a world with social distancing. For example, fiber increases the capacity and performance of networks and glass provides the primary window to information and entertainment. We are confident that we can bring further innovations to bear in many vital areas as the world addresses and recovers from its current challenges. Overall, we have very strong quarter on almost every dimension. From an innovation perspective, I just reviewed our significant advancements. Financially, we grew sales at double-digit rates sequentially and expanded margins to grow profitability even faster. Operationally, we performed well and I would like to share a few examples. In the midst of the pandemic, we deployed expert engineering teams to startup our Gen 10.5 melting operations in both Wuhan and Guangzhou. These facilities are positioning us well to capture the fast growing demand for large TVs. In mobile consumer electronics, we successfully scaled up a new-to-the-world manufacturing process and product to meet Apple\u2019s iPhone launch. In automotive, we have flexed our operations to adjust to the fast pace ramp-up at OEMs after they significantly reduced production in quarter two. In optical communications, we successfully adjusted our cost to the current market environment, resulting in significant profitability expansion despite flattish sales on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We also remain vigilant in our actions to safeguard the company\u2019s financial strength. We are proud of our execution, especially given the current global uncertainties. Clearly, our employees around the world are dedicated to living our values and giving their best everyday. Now, I will turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insights on the quarter.\nTony Tripeny: Thank you, Wendell and good morning. We had a very strong third quarter. As Wendell highlighted, we executed effectively and we have bolstered our healthy balance sheet despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Sales growth and cost actions led to strong sequential margin expansion further demonstrating that our operational adjustments are working. We have made significant adjustments to align our cost and operating plan with the lower anticipated sales. In total, Corning continues to demonstrate that it has the resources to deliver on our commitments and extend our leadership as we continue to focus on operational excellence, cash flow generation and prudent capital allocation. Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to call out the changes at Hemlock during Q3 and cover the differences between GAAP and core results. On September 9, Hemlock Semiconductor Group redeemed DuPont\u2019s 40.25% ownership interest in the company, which transforms Corning\u2019s long-time ownership in Hemlock into a majority position. In the second transaction, Hemlock purchased certain manufacturing assets from DuPont and gained control of a critical raw material, thereby becoming a leading low cost producer of ultra-pure polysilicon to the semiconductor industry. Hemlock\u2019s leadership position is backed by attractive, long-term take-or-pay customer contracts with upfront payments. And we are very excited about these transactions that are good for Hemlock, good for Corning and good for our shareholders. We didn\u2019t put any money into the transaction and Hemlock generates a lot of cash. So, it\u2019s debt is mostly paid back in 1 year. Corning improves its financials by adding sales and earnings. In the third quarter, we recognized $31 million of sales from the newly consolidated Hemlock. And Hemlock will add approximately $150 million in annual cash flow. Please see our web disclosure for helpful consolidation details. Now on to GAAP, the largest differences between our third quarter GAAP and core results are a non-cash gain associated with the Hemlock transaction, ongoing restructuring charges, which are primarily non-cash and a mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. Now, with respect to the mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and reported a current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q3 by $103 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provides highest certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We are very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We have received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago. Now, I walk through our third quarter performance. At the outset of the pandemic, we are committed to preserving our financial strength and positioning the company to emerge even stronger. In Q1 and Q2, we told you we were responding to economic uncertainty by making significant operational adjustments. We said we reduced cost and capital spend to align with lower anticipated sales. And while ramping down production and reducing inventory impacts margins, we said that when sales growth resumed, we expect improved profitability. Now, looking at the third quarter, we grew 16% \u2013 sales grew 16% sequentially to $3 billion and our operating margin expanded by 710 basis points sequentially to 18.3%. This resulted in net income of $380 million and EPS of $0.43, up 72% sequentially. We also said we would maintain a strong cash balance and generate positive free cash flow for the year. In the third quarter, free cash flow grew to $580 million. Cumulative free cash flow for the first three quarters was $484 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and we expect to generate additional positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter. As we continue to reduce cost, control inventory and execute well overall. As a result, I am confident that we will succeed on our free cash flow goals. These actions \u2013 the actions we have taken are clearly working. We have delivered great operational improvements, which started to show results in Q2 and really accelerated in Q3. We expect the benefit of these actions to continue in Q4 contributing to another strong quarter. Now, let\u2019s review the business segments. In Display Technology, fourth quarter sales were $827 million, up 10% sequentially and net income was $196 million, up 29% sequentially. Display Glass volume grew approximately 10% sequentially as panel makers increase utilization, resulting in strong incrementals. Sequential price declines were moderate as expected. From an end-market perspective, it appears that the impact from COVID-19 has been a positive. In developed markets, consumers are prioritizing in-home entertainment. Globally, work and steady from home trends are growing. This is increasing demand for TV and IT products. On the other hand, smartphone demand has been down. In total, the retail market as measured in square feet of glass is up mid single-digits year-to-date through August. Of course, the upcoming holiday retail season will be a big factor in how the market actually plays out for the full year. Longer term, we remain confident that TV screen size will continue to grow. TVs at 65 inches or larger grew 40% year-to-date through August and we are well-positioned to capture the majority of that growth with Gen 10.5, which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing. We continue to expect display pricing to decline by mid single-digit percentage in 2020. We believe that three factors drive a favorable glass pricing environment. First, we expect glass supply demand to be down to tight. For Corning, we are ramping our Gen 10.5 tanks to align with panel makers schedules. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments. In Optical Communications, third quarter sales grew 10% sequentially to $909 million as carrier spending and deployments remain stable and enterprise sales grew slightly. Net income grew by $34 million or 42% to $150 million driven by improving cost performance. Looking forward, demand on the network is at an all-time high and we are seeing positive statements on capacity expansion for network operators. Currently, COVID-related factors hamper the ability to invest broadly in networks and operators are focusing efforts on addressing capacity bottlenecks. We believe operators will begin additional investments to reestablish normal network headroom and expand offerings. Large carrier and enterprise capital projects are inevitable, but as I said before, it\u2019s always hard to predict the time. Environmental Technologies sales in the third quarter were $379 million, up 68% sequentially as markets recover and OEMs continue to adopt GPS in Europe and China. We effectively adjusted our operations to pace with the market recovery and delivered net income of $69 million compared to breakeven in the second quarter. The business team did a great job over the last 6 months in reacting to the rapid shutdown and restart of auto production by controlling cost and maintaining flexibility. Automotive sales increased 1% year-over-year as continued strong adoption of GPS helped us exceed vehicle production, which declined 6% year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw continued strong market performance in China, up slightly year-over-year. North America and European OEMs more than doubled production sequentially but declined 5% on a year-over-year basis. Diesel sales improved 49% from the second quarter, but were still down 15% year-over-year. The North American heavy-duty truck market improved, but remains in a cyclical downturn with vehicle production down 46% year-over-year. Third quarter sales of heavy-duty vehicles in China, however, continue to exceed 2020 levels and adoption of advanced content increased in preparation for China VI regulations. No doubt, it has been a challenging year for our automotive market access platform. However, we are recovering faster than the market due to increasing content, primarily GPS and advanced heavy-duty products. Our content-driven strategy continues to drive strong results. Specialty material sales were $570 million in the third quarter, up 23% year-over-year and in sharp contrast to the smartphone market, which declined. Net income grew 59% year-over-year to $146 million. Sales growth was driven by Ceramic Shield, our new-to-the-world glass ceramic on the iPhone 12 as well as premium glass sales, IT and tablet glass sales in support of work from home trends and strength in our advanced optic products. In brief, strong adoption and commercialization of our innovations produced strong year-over-year results for the third quarter for specialty materials and we expect that to be true for full year 2020 as well. In life sciences, North America lab utilization is increasing and the pandemic is driving demand for laboratory diagnostic testing consumables. As a result, we are seeing increased demand for our products. In July, we carried out our long-term plan to ramp a new larger distribution center needed to support our growth and enhance our ability to address our customers\u2019 increased needs around the world. Starting up this summer in the middle of a pandemic proved to be more difficult than we expected, which constrained third quarter sales. Sales declined 8% sequentially. Net income declined 10% in line with the lower volume. We have added resources where required, implemented recovery plans and are confident that operations will support the required output in Q4. As a result, we expect strong sequential life science growth in the fourth quarter. Now, I will turn to our balance sheet and our dedication to financial stewardship. As I mentioned at the outset of the pandemic, we committed to preserving our financial strength and positioning the company to emerge even stronger. I have discussed the operational improvements we have implemented and our strong free cash flow generation. It is also important to note that we continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet with a strong cash position at the end of the quarter at $2.5 billion and we have a debt structure that is conservative by design and relatively unique. Today, our average debt maturity is about 25 years, the longest in the S&P 500. Over the next 15 months, we have only $70 million coming due. Less than half of our total debt is due within the next 20 years. And during this time, there is no single year with debt repayments over $500 million. Our balance sheet is built for times like these. As I have previously mentioned, we expected generally positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter. And for the year we also expect to maintain a strong cash position and to maintain our dividend. We have the financial resources needed for the duration of the economic slowdown. In closing we demonstrated outstanding operational performance. In the quarter with significant sequential improvement in sales, net income, EPS and free cash flow, we are successfully carrying out the operational and financial goals we set up to stay strong during the prices we expect another solid quarter at the end of the year. We remain aware of potential impacts from the pandemic, the global recession, civil unrest and geopolitical tensions. Regardless of how long or what shape the recovery takes, Corning is effectively safe guarding its financial strength, our growth drivers are intact. And we continue advancing important growth initiatives with leaders in industries we serve. We are confident that our execution and market leadership positions us to emerge from the current global uncertainty even stronger. With that, let\u2019s move in to Q&A. Ann?\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Wendell. Okay Catherine, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Your line is open. \nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you everyone. Good morning. And thank you for the opportunity to ask this question. Wendell, Tony given, the consumer spending has been very strong year to date, obviously, we have seen that in some of the results of our company. How do you guys kind of look into the next couple of quarters? Do you feel like visibility is good based on discussions with customers that consumers spending could continue at these levels? as it relates to smartphones, TVs, notebooks, etcetera, that use up all your products? And then simultaneously on the optical side, clearly starting to see some positive trends here I know it\u2019s lumpy. But just as you look at the next couple of quarters, do you feel like you have good visibility at this point into how these quarters unfold and demand strength continues in the next couple of quarters? Thank you. \nWendell Weeks: Asiya, I think that is an excellent question. And I don\u2019t disagree with any of your observations on some of the macro data on both consumer and statements from network operators. That being said, we expect a really solid quarter further we just we are off to really good start this month. But that is really the extent of the guidance that we want to give at this time. And like last quarter, our business segments, as you just highlighted, continue to flash green. The global uncertainties just remind us to be very humble in our ability to precisely predict the future. And exactly how our customers are going to work their way through this uncertainty on the asset side, I totally get where you are coming from, because we have all heard from our customers or from the network operators that they are experiencing very strong demand on their network. I mean, there is some great examples. I mean, they publish this all the time, its great website by the way. The Internet and Television Association reports upstream growth. So, go from your home, up back into the network. It\u2019s up 37%. Also just recently, we have seen the Microsoft Teams set a new single-day record of 4.1 billion minutes, unbelievable, right. And you also hear very strong statements from them that they want to build more capacity to be able to deal with this new baseline of demand that\u2019s on them. Whether it\u2019s AT&T and Verizon or cable TV, companies or the public cloud players, they are all quite public that they are planning increases in their capacity. That being said, predicting the exact quarter when these plans turn into deployment at scale, that\u2019s just challenging. Just so once again, I just think we should be very humble in predicting that exact quarter and wait until we see that surge in shipments out of our factories to claim a rebound in the optical segment.\nAsiya Merchant: Great, thank you. And if I may for Tony, as a follow-up, Tony, given you guys are kind of managing your CapEx and inventory levels with very prudently. Should we expect the CapEx trends that we have been seeing over the last few quarters to sort of continue here? Are we expecting any upsurge in CapEx at least over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.\nTony Tripeny: Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d say as we have talked about before, we have an ongoing amount of capital spending that we expand, that we spend on expanding our product lines and creating new innovations, but where we really spend a lot of money is when we get into the growth cycle and we are not currently in one of those build cycles and we don\u2019t see ourselves in the build cycle over the next year or so. Of course, we want to eventually get to a build cycle, because when we get to a build cycle that means there is a lot of growth coming and we always get that with some commitments from customers and we actually saw the benefit of that in the third quarter with our work with Apple. But as we lookout over the next several quarters, we will be in the build cycle, so we won\u2019t see a lot of change from a CapEx standpoint.\nAsiya Merchant: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on the optical question is maybe this is wrong, but my perception is that there wasn\u2019t a lot of content growth in the revenues based on what your customers are spending on right now. Wendell, can you just sort of talk about the outlook for content growth in optical as you eventually at whatever point it is see an optical spending surge? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Once again, really good observation, Steve. Most of our operators have been dealing with this year is how do they eliminate some of the bottlenecks in their network in these challenging times, but while they are being as you say quite public on that they are planning to expand their networks. So, I think the content play is coming. And I believe that it will be quite strong, quite strong, whether it\u2019s in cloud, because there has been such a huge shift in the cloud during this time or whether it\u2019s in our carriers, our networks are just trained and operators don\u2019t want to be in a spot where they are running close to redline and they need to establish that base. It\u2019s higher. So \u2013 and I feel really good that it\u2019s inevitable, right, but that being said, I call them the quarter, buddy.\nSteven Fox: No, I wasn\u2019t asking you to, but just to be clear in the capacity expansion ramp is what would start sort of your content growth coming back? Is that correct or am I thinking about it wrong? Thank you. \nWendell Weeks: Yes, I think that is correct. That is when you really see it, you are asking actually a super subtle question, which is, we have a sort of more Corning play that is going on here as capacity comes in place more optical. And then we have particular set of innovations that reduce the cost of deployment pretty significantly in the efficacy of it. And those have a higher revenue content for us. So in that subtle question that you are asking, we will begin to see that without an acceleration in capacity growth, but you are not really going to feel we are not all going to feel great about it. Until that those technologies get deployed in new capacity expansions.\nSteven Fox: Great. That is very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you for taking my question. If I can just have a quick clarification first I read up your comment, Wendell about lights flashing green, I just want to make sure I am reading it right that we are applying all segments are here in a positive backdrop where they can improve sequentially from 3Q to 4Q, including life sciences, for which you saying 3Q is the graph. And then in terms of just drilling down a bit on the specialty out performance that you are seeing, how much of this is driven by content increase versus wider adoption of the cover glass, and if we can drill down a bit on the different areas on a smartphone, you are gaining \nWendell Weeks: So could you as a favor to me could you repeat the second part of that question? I am not sure that I understand it. Exactly could you do that again for me?\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes, the question was about Specialty or performance that you are seeing in your specialty materials and how much of the outperformance rate would be underlying smartphone market is content increase versus wider adoption of your cover glass and which are the areas of smartphone you are gaining content if you can just outline that \nWendell Weeks: Okay, so we start with your second question first. So the bulk of that growth that you see is content increase. It\u2019s basically a beating players about the latest innovations that is driving that revenue increase. So that is the primary driver Samik. to your first question, just to be precise, on what I mean by flashing green, I said the same thing, our last quarter. And what I am trying to get at here is not that we are going to have sequential growth or not that this one particular business is going to continue to do a certain thing we are trying to get at is sort of the dissonance that we feel between the demand that our customers are putting on us, and versus sort of the uncertainty we see in around the world. And so what I am trying to do is give you the insight that we see, which is, our businesses are doing well. We have got a good order book, and we are operating well. That being said, we still exist in the world that we exist in and we just got to be humble about giving exact guidance Samik.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes, no sounds fair given the current environment. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRod Hall: Yes, thanks for the question. I wanted to start off with ceramic shield. And just well first of all, congratulations on being named on Apple\u2019s stage I think that was the first. So, congrats on that. I wanted to, Wendell, just to ask you whether that is an exclusive deal and if it is exclusive is there a duration on that. Are there other OEMs? You could sell it to eventually, just kind of how are you thinking about exclusivity versus not on some materials like that? And also, maybe, I doubt you will tell me but I would be interested in the pricing differential with Gorilla. And then I have a second question for Tony, I noticed the inventory days jumped up a little bit in Q3. Tony, could you give us some maybe color on what drove that increase? Is it related to the smartphones cycle or something else? Thanks.\nTony Tripeny: I want to start with, yes, why don\u2019t I start with the inventory one? It\u2019s a pretty easy answer. During the quarter, we did the Hemlock transaction. We had to consolidate their balance sheet, which is increase the inventory for Corning in total, but of course, that just comes from that transaction itself. It\u2019s great transaction. We are really excited about Hemlock. It generates a lot of cash. We really didn\u2019t put any money and it pays back the debt within \u2013 most of it within a year, we have $150 million of ongoing free cash flow generation. So, we will make sure it\u2019s clear and we can talk about it in our call later today that how much of the inventory came from that versus our own growth. If you look at the cash flow statement, we actually lowered our inventory about $187 million during the quarter. So, our inventory actually came down during the quarter, but it\u2019s because of the Hemlock consolidation that you see it little bit different on the balance sheet.\nRod Hall: Okay. Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: And Rod to your question, questions for me. First, your statement, thank you for the congratulations, we are really, really proud of that. Ceramic Shield is a lot of work. I have to tell you that it feels, but not quite right to use Apple\u2019s name out loud. I still don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever done that, like inside the company, we have a codename for Apple, but like we never even say Apple inside the company. So, if you could see me, I sound like turning a little pink and I am having an anxiety attack, if I read their name out loud. So if I stumble a little, be forgiving, so\u2026\nRod Hall: Really soaking it with Apple\u2019s name in the [indiscernible]\nWendell Weeks: Yes, exactly right. So, Ceramic Shield, that\u2019s Apple\u2019s. It\u2019s that simple. That\u2019s Apple\u2019s. They helped us develop it. They invested in U.S. manufacturing for it. That\u2019s theirs. And it should be theirs. And so that\u2019s the way that is. Now, because we take a look at other players, we got a whole stream of innovations for them as well. I think what we would love to see ideal scenario would be that Apple has so raised \u2013 I can\u2019t believe, I just said Apple again has so raised the bar on performance for everybody that all of the players will be coming to us to say, we need to have a way to compete with this incredible performance. And if that happens, that\u2019s just going to all be good for us. We will not do Ceramic Shield for them, but we have got a lot of great ideas and we have got a lot of great products to help them raise their game to the new level. That was just set I\u2019ve got to revert in Cupertino. So, the next one got to how much that you didn\u2019t think I would answer was, what\u2019s the price delta? I would say once again, Rod, you have effectively predicted the future. I am not going to answer that.\nRod Hall: Alright. Thanks a lot. One wasn\u2019t it used on the back of the phone, is it too expensive?\nWendell Weeks: You have exhausted my ability to get myself to answer any question about that particular company, I just \u2013 I am reverting back to my mode and very sooner we are going to go back into using code words, so\u2026\nRod Hall: Alright. Well, thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Just to stay on this specialty for a second, on the content inquiries that you referred to Wendell, can you talk about whether you meant dollar content or unit content or both? And if both like what the relative split is and just sort of a little bit technical side of this, is the process similar to Gorilla where there is post processing done by finishers or something different that changes the margin structure of this product? And I have a follow-up on display.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks for the question. So it started with smartphones, I think the right way to think about it is its content in dollars, right? It\u2019s just reducing the valuable materials. Now, quite often with some of them like, is a great example is more valuable material that we are introducing, but it also reduces finishing cost for our customers. And so as a result, their part cost can be really close to what they had for Gorilla Glasses. So that is sort of a shape of the way that you should think about it. As it\u2019s brand new products that have a higher price point is the primary way to think about it from your modeling perspective. That smartphones, I think you also got this going on in laptops, and the IP piece is also bringing up more content. Once again, the right way to think about this as more value added in our products that rather than increasing a mass of glass or ceramics on the products right now. It is super interesting question that when you think about 5G, where you have seen smartphones evolve to which is this all glass structure pretty much driven by Yes, we make awesome product and like glass is the best thing we have heard other than that. Is that they need the RF transparency. And if you pop open a 5G phone, any of them you will see how much antenna content is in there to be able to handle 5G and the ability to do 4G and to be able to do different players depending on where you are in the world. This same thing, I believe, is going to come to the IT products if they are going to be 5G users we are going to have to see more mass of our product but volume of our product on those devices to make them be truly great 5G devices.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful.\nWendell Weeks: Has that answered your question?\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, it does Wendell. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you.\nWamsi Mohan: And a follow-up, can you talk about the incremental strengthen display? There is some concern in the market that there were some ramp issues in the China glass market that is causing one of your competitors to take some share? Can you comment on that? And maybe just talk about any changes on the pace of like Korea ramp down? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: So I think from an overall standpoint, what is really driving the strength and display is what is happening in the end markets and that\u2019s what always matters from a disclosure standpoint. As we talked about clearly TV demand in the COVID world has been pretty strong. So has IT demand in particularly notebooks and tablets and that\u2019s fundamentally what we are seeing there and you see it in terms of couple of ways one is panel maker utilizations have been high and I think that has slowed down a bit of the exit of from Korea by some of the panel makers there. But in addition to that the value chain is pretty tight right now. So what is really driving this is customer demand from a retail standpoint as we mentioned as measured in glass it is up mid single digits on a year-over-year basis and that feels good. \nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Zdebski with Barclays. Your line is open.\nPeter Zdebski: Hi, this is Peter on for Tim Long. Congratulations on the quarter. One I wanted to ask about GPS. Prior to pandemic, I think we were looking at ahead of target about $350 million of sales in 2020. And given it looks like the auto rebound has been probably a little stronger than expected can you give us an idea of how close you might get to that number for 20? And then maybe your thoughts on timing towards that $500 million target?\nWendell Weeks: I think that fundamentally, what is driving the sales from the GPS standpoint, of course is the adoption in Europe and the adoption in China. And on a year-over-year basis, the European market is down, it went down with a lot in Q3, but we are still down on a year-over-year basis, but China is actually up. So, I mean, I think they feel good about where GPS sales are and we certainly feel good that we are outperforming the market because of the content-driven part of GPS.\nPeter Zdebski: Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Couple of questions. On Valor Glass, understanding the FDA has had a more their fast track policy over the last year on vaccines, but just post any vaccines just progress you think Valor Glass is making within the FDA did not need a drug by drug approval? And then maybe second, if there were any kind of administration change to come in the next year, just how quickly could emission standard changes flow through the environmental segment? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Well, I will take the first one and maybe you can take the second coming on if you would like. So, Meta, I think in Valor, we are refueling with the broader adoption as well as strategies by our customers to make the regulatory burden be less. And the way to think about the FDA, they react to the plans of our customers and that will end up providing a basis for how it will evolve in the treatment of Valor Glass. In general, what I would say is ease of qualification is getting better for us as our customers get more sophisticated in how to do the regulatory moves. You just have to remember this is the first change really in vial packaging in 100 years. So, everybody was a little out of practice, right. So, I think with that\u2019s coming in place and getting better. Our really focus though in Valor right now is to support the COVID-19 vaccine efforts. That\u2019s what we are about. And we have focused most of our energy now on supporting various vaccine candidates. And for them, it\u2019s a new drug. So, the new drug is just qualified in our vial. So there is no real additional regulatory burden. It\u2019s the redo that provides an extra burden, not the originals. That product is superior in every way from the current product. So, that\u2019s where we are really focusing our capacity efforts, that\u2019s where we are focusing our technology efforts is to use all the Corning\u2019s capabilities to make all of us and our children safer and that\u2019s where we are aimed.\nTony Tripeny: And Meta, I think in terms of the environmental regulations, the way we look at it isn\u2019t as \u2013 at least from our business standpoint and when we will start generating sales, it\u2019s not as how quickly the regulations change, it\u2019s when the implementations happened. And on environmental regulations, they always take several years to occur. They have got to change the automotive supply chain and the like. So, while the change in the regulations might be quick in terms of us actually seeing it in sales in North America that would clearly be a couple of years after that.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I want to add a question, if we look back to April when you put in place the new operating structure it was sort of centered around your maps in that, what kind of benefits have you seen from that? How is it working just given we are I don\u2019t know 5 months since it was launched? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: So, we basically \u2013 because our innovations have been successful, we have sort of outgrown our previous structures. And so we put in place this new operating structure with Eric Musser as our President and CEO and named new market access platform leaders, next generation leadership to take each and every one of our major market access platforms. And it\u2019s gone great. And my main evidence for that is look at the results. I mean it is really strong so I have got nothing but good things to say about that and I am overall quite hopeful going forward with this type of outstanding operations performance continues.\nShannon Cross: Okay. And then I don\u2019t know Tony can you talk a bit about any operational improvements you could make to unlock now that it, wholly owned, just or is it or we should just assume it will be standalone. And there is not much leverage that we had? Thank you.\nTony Tripeny: I think there is plenty of operational improvements that we can make there we are basically based on as we thought about why we\u2019re excited about this is based on their current operating performance and those long-term take-or-pay contracts that come with upfront cash payments there the good controls what they have over their cost both in terms of the assets that they bought from long term energy contracts at very favorable rates. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re confident in that ability to generate the $150 million of annual cash flow that being said we will start working on other kind of operational improvements we can make a good example of that is that we procure a lot more stuff as a company than they do I am sure there is opportunities there and those opportunities, from a technology standpoint, from the general manufacturing standpoint, market access stand point chances to look at different markets than they\u2019ve had before. I mean, they will now get the whole power of the Corning machine to really drive that business. So I think on the whole we would expect improvements over time now how quickly they are happening like all we are just at the beginning stages of that and the fact it is going to have $150 million a year free cash flow generation is very exciting.\nShannon Cross: Thank you, Wendell.\nAnn Nicholson: Okay. We will take one last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open. \nMartin Yang: Hi good morning. Thank you for squeezing again. And my question is about Display Glass prices, is there any opportunity for you to see price improvement even more, I understand at the current structure protects your downside but given the tight supply on demand, right now is there any way for you to raise price?\nWendell Weeks: I would say it did like you often heard me say Martin about display is it right way to think about it. To investment standpoint, in my opinion, I have so my operating folks who believe we can make this be back into a growth machine. But I continue to believe we should just count on it is aging gracefully generating tons of cash flow pricing, being moderate alright and that will decide normally in maturing business. That way the price declining and I think that\u2019s the way to think about it. And right now our primary focus here is to make sure we bring up those Generation 10.5 plants that we have put in place and you can remember that was when we did this we did this with largely money support and from various Chinese players, where we kept 100% of the profit stream. And that move when we did it was really a bet on the growth of large size TV and a bet on the Chinese LCD manufacturers that bet is playing out really well. And the key for us is to grow that into its full capability as fast as we can.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Wendell. Great and thanks everybody for joining us today. Before we close, I wanted to let you know that we will be at the Baird Virtual Global Industrial Conference on November 10 and Morgan Stanley Virtual Life after COVID Conference on November 11, Credit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on November 30 and the Barclays Global Technology Media and Telecom Conference on December 10. Finally, the replay of today\u2019s call will be available on our site starting later this morning. Operator, that concludes our call. Please disconnect our lines.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann and good morning everyone. Today, we reported third quarter results demonstrating that the company is strong, financially healthy and well-positioned for growth. Sales were $3 billion, up 16% sequentially, EPS grew 72% sequentially to $0.43 as higher sales and strong manufacturing execution resulted in operating margin expanding to 18.3%, up 710 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year. We generated $518 million of free cash flow and finished the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash. Our financial performance has improved significantly since April and we expect a strong fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we remain vigilant and continue to adapt appropriately to multiple disruptive forces playing out around the world from the pandemic to civil unrest to recession and geopolitical struggles. We have been rising to the challenges since Day 1 and our priorities remain clear. First, we must make our values evident in our actions. Our commitment to the health, safety and well-being of our employees underlined every facet of our operations. We are dedicating resources and providing leadership to support our communities around the world. We have launched Unity campaigns as well as racial and social equality programs targeting the multitude of hardships people are confronting right now. And when it comes to the global health fight, we are all in mobilizing our capabilities to combat the virus directly. We must also safeguard our financial health. Our third quarter results show that our decisive actions are providing clear benefits as we leverage cost savings and increase efficiencies across the company. Regardless of the depth or duration of global uncertainty, we are doing everything in our power to keep the company strong and is working. Now to ensure that we emerge even stronger, we are continuing to invest to create additional revenue streams. We are inventing new-to-the-world materials and manufacturing processes as well as co-innovating new solutions in partnership with our customers. The relevance of our portfolio puts Corning at the heart of ongoing innovation with industry leaders and we continue to solve our customers' toughest technology challenges. You may have seen Apple's recent promotion of Ceramic Shield for the iPhone 12. They are featuring our new-to-the-world material, which is the world's first highly transparent, color-free glass ceramic with performance that meets the rigorous demands put on smartphone cover materials. This latest innovation with Apple exemplifies our ongoing strategy of consistent long-term value creation by combining our deep expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with our unparalleled manufacturing and engineering capabilities. Ceramic Shield melts the attributes that we love about glass, great optics and retain strength with the attributes we love about ceramics, most notably, its toughness. Ceramic Shield consists of ceramic crystals within a glass matrix. There are two big inventions here. The first was keeping the best damage-resistant attributes of both glass and ceramics. The second was ensuring high-optical transparency by growing index matched nanocrystals inside the glass matrix that are one-tenth the wavelength of light. As you recall, Apple made two investments in Corning, totaling $450 million as part of their advanced manufacturing fund and their commitment to foster innovation among American manufacturers. We take Apple for our longstanding product development partnership and their investments in new manufacturing technology, centered in our Harrodsburg, Kentucky facility. We could not be prouder to be a key component in the iPhone 12. Now, it's important to note, the iPhone 12 and many other flagship phones that we are also proud to be part of support 5G. 5G matters to us. The density of fiber necessary to deliver its promise is yet another example. You have seen us illustrate that up to 100x more fiber is required to deploy 5G in the city than 4G. This week, we are announcing a product design to help operators dramatically boost the speed and reduce the cost of their outdoor deployments. And we are embarking on new work to support Verizon's to extend 5G indoors. The relevance of our portfolio and our deep customer relationships as illustrated by these advancements keep us at the center of the inexorable shift to optical. Stepping back, in all the industries we serve, important market trends offer new challenges that Corning is uniquely qualified to address and new opportunities to integrate more Corning content into products. This is an especially powerful value creation letter in times of economic uncertainty, because we aren't exclusively relying on people buying more stuff, we are putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. We are clearly seeing the benefits of this ladder in today's results as innovation adoption drove specialty material sales up 23% year-over-year, despite a declining smartphone market. This type of outperformance is not unique. From 2016 to 2019, we added $500 million in sales or 42% cumulatively, while smartphone sales actually went down and we are extending that growth streak this year. In Environmental Technologies, we grew sales 16% in 2019 much faster than the underlying unit demand as automakers added gas particulate filters to cars and we again saw outperformance this quarter with sequential sales, up 68%. These are additional examples of the more Corning strategy at work and why that content story is so powerful for us. I want to stress one additional point. You often hear us say that our core technologies enabled life changing capabilities. In these times, we are increasing focus on life-saving innovations. Safe widespread vaccine delivery is one of society's top priorities and glass packaging is critical. Our value innovation will help enable faster filling line speeds and increased patient safety. Right now, we are expanding capacity and supplying glass files for vaccines as part of Operation Warp Speed all while leveraging our leadership in life sciences to help support COVID diagnostic testing and virus research efforts. Additionally, reduce fine particulate pollution the objective of our filtration products appears to be helpful for reducing infection rates. And we are excited about recent university lab test showing that our Guardiant antimicrobial glass particles kill bacteria and viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. We are also well-positioned to contribute as consumers continue to adapt to a world with social distancing. For example, fiber increases the capacity and performance of networks and glass provides the primary window to information and entertainment. We are confident that we can bring further innovations to bear in many vital areas as the world addresses and recovers from its current challenges. Overall, we have very strong quarter on almost every dimension. From an innovation perspective, I just reviewed our significant advancements. Financially, we grew sales at double-digit rates sequentially and expanded margins to grow profitability even faster. Operationally, we performed well and I would like to share a few examples. In the midst of the pandemic, we deployed expert engineering teams to startup our Gen 10.5 melting operations in both Wuhan and Guangzhou. These facilities are positioning us well to capture the fast growing demand for large TVs. In mobile consumer electronics, we successfully scaled up a new-to-the-world manufacturing process and product to meet Apple's iPhone launch. In automotive, we have flexed our operations to adjust to the fast pace ramp-up at OEMs after they significantly reduced production in quarter two. In optical communications, we successfully adjusted our cost to the current market environment, resulting in significant profitability expansion despite flattish sales on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We also remain vigilant in our actions to safeguard the company's financial strength. We are proud of our execution, especially given the current global uncertainties. Clearly, our employees around the world are dedicated to living our values and giving their best everyday. Now, I will turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insights on the quarter. Asiya, I think that is an excellent question. And I don't disagree with any of your observations on some of the macro data on both consumer and statements from network operators. That being said, we expect a really solid quarter further we just we are off to really good start this month. But that is really the extent of the guidance that we want to give at this time. And like last quarter, our business segments, as you just highlighted, continue to flash green. The global uncertainties just remind us to be very humble in our ability to precisely predict the future. And exactly how our customers are going to work their way through this uncertainty on the asset side, I totally get where you are coming from, because we have all heard from our customers or from the network operators that they are experiencing very strong demand on their network. I mean, there is some great examples. I mean, they publish this all the time, its great website by the way. The Internet and Television Association reports upstream growth. So, go from your home, up back into the network. It's up 37%. Also just recently, we have seen the Microsoft Teams set a new single-day record of 4.1 billion minutes, unbelievable, right. And you also hear very strong statements from them that they want to build more capacity to be able to deal with this new baseline of demand that's on them. Whether it's AT&T and Verizon or cable TV, companies or the public cloud players, they are all quite public that they are planning increases in their capacity. That being said, predicting the exact quarter when these plans turn into deployment at scale, that's just challenging. Just so once again, I just think we should be very humble in predicting that exact quarter and wait until we see that surge in shipments out of our factories to claim a rebound in the optical segment. Once again, really good observation, Steve. Most of our operators have been dealing with this year is how do they eliminate some of the bottlenecks in their network in these challenging times, but while they are being as you say quite public on that they are planning to expand their networks. So, I think the content play is coming. And I believe that it will be quite strong, quite strong, whether it's in cloud, because there has been such a huge shift in the cloud during this time or whether it's in our carriers, our networks are just trained and operators don't want to be in a spot where they are running close to redline and they need to establish that base. It's higher. So \u2013 and I feel really good that it's inevitable, right, but that being said, I call them the quarter, buddy. Yes, I think that is correct. That is when you really see it, you are asking actually a super subtle question, which is, we have a sort of more Corning play that is going on here as capacity comes in place more optical. And then we have particular set of innovations that reduce the cost of deployment pretty significantly in the efficacy of it. And those have a higher revenue content for us. So in that subtle question that you are asking, we will begin to see that without an acceleration in capacity growth, but you are not really going to feel we are not all going to feel great about it. Until that those technologies get deployed in new capacity expansions. So could you as a favor to me could you repeat the second part of that question? I am not sure that I understand it. Exactly could you do that again for me? Okay, so we start with your second question first. So the bulk of that growth that you see is content increase. It's basically a beating players about the latest innovations that is driving that revenue increase. So that is the primary driver Samik. to your first question, just to be precise, on what I mean by flashing green, I said the same thing, our last quarter. And what I am trying to get at here is not that we are going to have sequential growth or not that this one particular business is going to continue to do a certain thing we are trying to get at is sort of the dissonance that we feel between the demand that our customers are putting on us, and versus sort of the uncertainty we see in around the world. And so what I am trying to do is give you the insight that we see, which is, our businesses are doing well. We have got a good order book, and we are operating well. That being said, we still exist in the world that we exist in and we just got to be humble about giving exact guidance Samik. Okay, thank you. And Rod to your question, questions for me. First, your statement, thank you for the congratulations, we are really, really proud of that. Ceramic Shield is a lot of work. I have to tell you that it feels, but not quite right to use Apple's name out loud. I still don't think I've ever done that, like inside the company, we have a codename for Apple, but like we never even say Apple inside the company. So, if you could see me, I sound like turning a little pink and I am having an anxiety attack, if I read their name out loud. So if I stumble a little, be forgiving, so... Yes, exactly right. So, Ceramic Shield, that's Apple's. It's that simple. That's Apple's. They helped us develop it. They invested in U.S. manufacturing for it. That's theirs. And it should be theirs. And so that's the way that is. Now, because we take a look at other players, we got a whole stream of innovations for them as well. I think what we would love to see ideal scenario would be that Apple has so raised \u2013 I can't believe, I just said Apple again has so raised the bar on performance for everybody that all of the players will be coming to us to say, we need to have a way to compete with this incredible performance. And if that happens, that's just going to all be good for us. We will not do Ceramic Shield for them, but we have got a lot of great ideas and we have got a lot of great products to help them raise their game to the new level. That was just set I've got to revert in Cupertino. So, the next one got to how much that you didn't think I would answer was, what's the price delta? I would say once again, Rod, you have effectively predicted the future. I am not going to answer that. You have exhausted my ability to get myself to answer any question about that particular company, I just \u2013 I am reverting back to my mode and very sooner we are going to go back into using code words, so... Thanks for the question. So it started with smartphones, I think the right way to think about it is its content in dollars, right? It's just reducing the valuable materials. Now, quite often with some of them like, is a great example is more valuable material that we are introducing, but it also reduces finishing cost for our customers. And so as a result, their part cost can be really close to what they had for Gorilla Glasses. So that is sort of a shape of the way that you should think about it. As it's brand new products that have a higher price point is the primary way to think about it from your modeling perspective. That smartphones, I think you also got this going on in laptops, and the IP piece is also bringing up more content. Once again, the right way to think about this as more value added in our products that rather than increasing a mass of glass or ceramics on the products right now. It is super interesting question that when you think about 5G, where you have seen smartphones evolve to which is this all glass structure pretty much driven by Yes, we make awesome product and like glass is the best thing we have heard other than that. Is that they need the RF transparency. And if you pop open a 5G phone, any of them you will see how much antenna content is in there to be able to handle 5G and the ability to do 4G and to be able to do different players depending on where you are in the world. This same thing, I believe, is going to come to the IT products if they are going to be 5G users we are going to have to see more mass of our product but volume of our product on those devices to make them be truly great 5G devices. Has that answered your question? Thank you. So I think from an overall standpoint, what is really driving the strength and display is what is happening in the end markets and that's what always matters from a disclosure standpoint. As we talked about clearly TV demand in the COVID world has been pretty strong. So has IT demand in particularly notebooks and tablets and that's fundamentally what we are seeing there and you see it in terms of couple of ways one is panel maker utilizations have been high and I think that has slowed down a bit of the exit of from Korea by some of the panel makers there. But in addition to that the value chain is pretty tight right now. So what is really driving this is customer demand from a retail standpoint as we mentioned as measured in glass it is up mid single digits on a year-over-year basis and that feels good. I think that fundamentally, what is driving the sales from the GPS standpoint, of course is the adoption in Europe and the adoption in China. And on a year-over-year basis, the European market is down, it went down with a lot in Q3, but we are still down on a year-over-year basis, but China is actually up. So, I mean, I think they feel good about where GPS sales are and we certainly feel good that we are outperforming the market because of the content-driven part of GPS. Well, I will take the first one and maybe you can take the second coming on if you would like. So, Meta, I think in Valor, we are refueling with the broader adoption as well as strategies by our customers to make the regulatory burden be less. And the way to think about the FDA, they react to the plans of our customers and that will end up providing a basis for how it will evolve in the treatment of Valor Glass. In general, what I would say is ease of qualification is getting better for us as our customers get more sophisticated in how to do the regulatory moves. You just have to remember this is the first change really in vial packaging in 100 years. So, everybody was a little out of practice, right. So, I think with that's coming in place and getting better. Our really focus though in Valor right now is to support the COVID-19 vaccine efforts. That's what we are about. And we have focused most of our energy now on supporting various vaccine candidates. And for them, it's a new drug. So, the new drug is just qualified in our vial. So there is no real additional regulatory burden. It's the redo that provides an extra burden, not the originals. That product is superior in every way from the current product. So, that's where we are really focusing our capacity efforts, that's where we are focusing our technology efforts is to use all the Corning's capabilities to make all of us and our children safer and that's where we are aimed. So, we basically \u2013 because our innovations have been successful, we have sort of outgrown our previous structures. And so we put in place this new operating structure with Eric Musser as our President and CEO and named new market access platform leaders, next generation leadership to take each and every one of our major market access platforms. And it's gone great. And my main evidence for that is look at the results. I mean it is really strong so I have got nothing but good things to say about that and I am overall quite hopeful going forward with this type of outstanding operations performance continues. I would say it did like you often heard me say Martin about display is it right way to think about it. To investment standpoint, in my opinion, I have so my operating folks who believe we can make this be back into a growth machine. But I continue to believe we should just count on it is aging gracefully generating tons of cash flow pricing, being moderate alright and that will decide normally in maturing business. That way the price declining and I think that's the way to think about it. And right now our primary focus here is to make sure we bring up those Generation 10.5 plants that we have put in place and you can remember that was when we did this we did this with largely money support and from various Chinese players, where we kept 100% of the profit stream. And that move when we did it was really a bet on the growth of large size TV and a bet on the Chinese LCD manufacturers that bet is playing out really well. And the key for us is to grow that into its full capability as fast as we can."

            "name": "Tony Tripeny",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell and good morning. We had a very strong third quarter. As Wendell highlighted, we executed effectively and we have bolstered our healthy balance sheet despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Sales growth and cost actions led to strong sequential margin expansion further demonstrating that our operational adjustments are working. We have made significant adjustments to align our cost and operating plan with the lower anticipated sales. In total, Corning continues to demonstrate that it has the resources to deliver on our commitments and extend our leadership as we continue to focus on operational excellence, cash flow generation and prudent capital allocation. Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to call out the changes at Hemlock during Q3 and cover the differences between GAAP and core results. On September 9, Hemlock Semiconductor Group redeemed DuPont's 40.25% ownership interest in the company, which transforms Corning's long-time ownership in Hemlock into a majority position. In the second transaction, Hemlock purchased certain manufacturing assets from DuPont and gained control of a critical raw material, thereby becoming a leading low cost producer of ultra-pure polysilicon to the semiconductor industry. Hemlock's leadership position is backed by attractive, long-term take-or-pay customer contracts with upfront payments. And we are very excited about these transactions that are good for Hemlock, good for Corning and good for our shareholders. We didn't put any money into the transaction and Hemlock generates a lot of cash. So, it's debt is mostly paid back in 1 year. Corning improves its financials by adding sales and earnings. In the third quarter, we recognized $31 million of sales from the newly consolidated Hemlock. And Hemlock will add approximately $150 million in annual cash flow. Please see our web disclosure for helpful consolidation details. Now on to GAAP, the largest differences between our third quarter GAAP and core results are a non-cash gain associated with the Hemlock transaction, ongoing restructuring charges, which are primarily non-cash and a mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. Now, with respect to the mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and reported a current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q3 by $103 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provides highest certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We are very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We have received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago. Now, I walk through our third quarter performance. At the outset of the pandemic, we are committed to preserving our financial strength and positioning the company to emerge even stronger. In Q1 and Q2, we told you we were responding to economic uncertainty by making significant operational adjustments. We said we reduced cost and capital spend to align with lower anticipated sales. And while ramping down production and reducing inventory impacts margins, we said that when sales growth resumed, we expect improved profitability. Now, looking at the third quarter, we grew 16% \u2013 sales grew 16% sequentially to $3 billion and our operating margin expanded by 710 basis points sequentially to 18.3%. This resulted in net income of $380 million and EPS of $0.43, up 72% sequentially. We also said we would maintain a strong cash balance and generate positive free cash flow for the year. In the third quarter, free cash flow grew to $580 million. Cumulative free cash flow for the first three quarters was $484 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and we expect to generate additional positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter. As we continue to reduce cost, control inventory and execute well overall. As a result, I am confident that we will succeed on our free cash flow goals. These actions \u2013 the actions we have taken are clearly working. We have delivered great operational improvements, which started to show results in Q2 and really accelerated in Q3. We expect the benefit of these actions to continue in Q4 contributing to another strong quarter. Now, let's review the business segments. In Display Technology, fourth quarter sales were $827 million, up 10% sequentially and net income was $196 million, up 29% sequentially. Display Glass volume grew approximately 10% sequentially as panel makers increase utilization, resulting in strong incrementals. Sequential price declines were moderate as expected. From an end-market perspective, it appears that the impact from COVID-19 has been a positive. In developed markets, consumers are prioritizing in-home entertainment. Globally, work and steady from home trends are growing. This is increasing demand for TV and IT products. On the other hand, smartphone demand has been down. In total, the retail market as measured in square feet of glass is up mid single-digits year-to-date through August. Of course, the upcoming holiday retail season will be a big factor in how the market actually plays out for the full year. Longer term, we remain confident that TV screen size will continue to grow. TVs at 65 inches or larger grew 40% year-to-date through August and we are well-positioned to capture the majority of that growth with Gen 10.5, which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing. We continue to expect display pricing to decline by mid single-digit percentage in 2020. We believe that three factors drive a favorable glass pricing environment. First, we expect glass supply demand to be down to tight. For Corning, we are ramping our Gen 10.5 tanks to align with panel makers schedules. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments. In Optical Communications, third quarter sales grew 10% sequentially to $909 million as carrier spending and deployments remain stable and enterprise sales grew slightly. Net income grew by $34 million or 42% to $150 million driven by improving cost performance. Looking forward, demand on the network is at an all-time high and we are seeing positive statements on capacity expansion for network operators. Currently, COVID-related factors hamper the ability to invest broadly in networks and operators are focusing efforts on addressing capacity bottlenecks. We believe operators will begin additional investments to reestablish normal network headroom and expand offerings. Large carrier and enterprise capital projects are inevitable, but as I said before, it's always hard to predict the time. Environmental Technologies sales in the third quarter were $379 million, up 68% sequentially as markets recover and OEMs continue to adopt GPS in Europe and China. We effectively adjusted our operations to pace with the market recovery and delivered net income of $69 million compared to breakeven in the second quarter. The business team did a great job over the last 6 months in reacting to the rapid shutdown and restart of auto production by controlling cost and maintaining flexibility. Automotive sales increased 1% year-over-year as continued strong adoption of GPS helped us exceed vehicle production, which declined 6% year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw continued strong market performance in China, up slightly year-over-year. North America and European OEMs more than doubled production sequentially but declined 5% on a year-over-year basis. Diesel sales improved 49% from the second quarter, but were still down 15% year-over-year. The North American heavy-duty truck market improved, but remains in a cyclical downturn with vehicle production down 46% year-over-year. Third quarter sales of heavy-duty vehicles in China, however, continue to exceed 2020 levels and adoption of advanced content increased in preparation for China VI regulations. No doubt, it has been a challenging year for our automotive market access platform. However, we are recovering faster than the market due to increasing content, primarily GPS and advanced heavy-duty products. Our content-driven strategy continues to drive strong results. Specialty material sales were $570 million in the third quarter, up 23% year-over-year and in sharp contrast to the smartphone market, which declined. Net income grew 59% year-over-year to $146 million. Sales growth was driven by Ceramic Shield, our new-to-the-world glass ceramic on the iPhone 12 as well as premium glass sales, IT and tablet glass sales in support of work from home trends and strength in our advanced optic products. In brief, strong adoption and commercialization of our innovations produced strong year-over-year results for the third quarter for specialty materials and we expect that to be true for full year 2020 as well. In life sciences, North America lab utilization is increasing and the pandemic is driving demand for laboratory diagnostic testing consumables. As a result, we are seeing increased demand for our products. In July, we carried out our long-term plan to ramp a new larger distribution center needed to support our growth and enhance our ability to address our customers' increased needs around the world. Starting up this summer in the middle of a pandemic proved to be more difficult than we expected, which constrained third quarter sales. Sales declined 8% sequentially. Net income declined 10% in line with the lower volume. We have added resources where required, implemented recovery plans and are confident that operations will support the required output in Q4. As a result, we expect strong sequential life science growth in the fourth quarter. Now, I will turn to our balance sheet and our dedication to financial stewardship. As I mentioned at the outset of the pandemic, we committed to preserving our financial strength and positioning the company to emerge even stronger. I have discussed the operational improvements we have implemented and our strong free cash flow generation. It is also important to note that we continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet with a strong cash position at the end of the quarter at $2.5 billion and we have a debt structure that is conservative by design and relatively unique. Today, our average debt maturity is about 25 years, the longest in the S&P 500. Over the next 15 months, we have only $70 million coming due. Less than half of our total debt is due within the next 20 years. And during this time, there is no single year with debt repayments over $500 million. Our balance sheet is built for times like these. As I have previously mentioned, we expected generally positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter. And for the year we also expect to maintain a strong cash position and to maintain our dividend. We have the financial resources needed for the duration of the economic slowdown. In closing we demonstrated outstanding operational performance. In the quarter with significant sequential improvement in sales, net income, EPS and free cash flow, we are successfully carrying out the operational and financial goals we set up to stay strong during the prices we expect another solid quarter at the end of the year. We remain aware of potential impacts from the pandemic, the global recession, civil unrest and geopolitical tensions. Regardless of how long or what shape the recovery takes, Corning is effectively safe guarding its financial strength, our growth drivers are intact. And we continue advancing important growth initiatives with leaders in industries we serve. We are confident that our execution and market leadership positions us to emerge from the current global uncertainty even stronger. With that, let's move in to Q&A. Ann? Yes. I think it's \u2013 I'd say as we have talked about before, we have an ongoing amount of capital spending that we expand, that we spend on expanding our product lines and creating new innovations, but where we really spend a lot of money is when we get into the growth cycle and we are not currently in one of those build cycles and we don't see ourselves in the build cycle over the next year or so. Of course, we want to eventually get to a build cycle, because when we get to a build cycle that means there is a lot of growth coming and we always get that with some commitments from customers and we actually saw the benefit of that in the third quarter with our work with Apple. But as we lookout over the next several quarters, we will be in the build cycle, so we won't see a lot of change from a CapEx standpoint. I want to start with, yes, why don't I start with the inventory one? It's a pretty easy answer. During the quarter, we did the Hemlock transaction. We had to consolidate their balance sheet, which is increase the inventory for Corning in total, but of course, that just comes from that transaction itself. It's great transaction. We are really excited about Hemlock. It generates a lot of cash. We really didn't put any money and it pays back the debt within \u2013 most of it within a year, we have $150 million of ongoing free cash flow generation. So, we will make sure it's clear and we can talk about it in our call later today that how much of the inventory came from that versus our own growth. If you look at the cash flow statement, we actually lowered our inventory about $187 million during the quarter. So, our inventory actually came down during the quarter, but it's because of the Hemlock consolidation that you see it little bit different on the balance sheet. And Meta, I think in terms of the environmental regulations, the way we look at it isn't as \u2013 at least from our business standpoint and when we will start generating sales, it's not as how quickly the regulations change, it's when the implementations happened. And on environmental regulations, they always take several years to occur. They have got to change the automotive supply chain and the like. So, while the change in the regulations might be quick in terms of us actually seeing it in sales in North America that would clearly be a couple of years after that. I think there is plenty of operational improvements that we can make there we are basically based on as we thought about why we're excited about this is based on their current operating performance and those long-term take-or-pay contracts that come with upfront cash payments there the good controls what they have over their cost both in terms of the assets that they bought from long term energy contracts at very favorable rates. And that's why we're confident in that ability to generate the $150 million of annual cash flow that being said we will start working on other kind of operational improvements we can make a good example of that is that we procure a lot more stuff as a company than they do I am sure there is opportunities there and those opportunities, from a technology standpoint, from the general manufacturing standpoint, market access stand point chances to look at different markets than they've had before. I mean, they will now get the whole power of the Corning machine to really drive that business. So I think on the whole we would expect improvements over time now how quickly they are happening like all we are just at the beginning stages of that and the fact it is going to have $150 million a year free cash flow generation is very exciting."

We encourage you to follow along and they're also available on our website for downloading. Now, I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported second quarter 2020 results. Sales were $2.6 billion. Net income was $218 million. EPS was $0.25 and free cash flow was $285 million. All increased sequentially. I have two primary observations on the quarter. First, while we're effectively adjusting to this period of uncertainty with decisive action and operational execution, we're generating positive cash flow and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Second, even in these uncertain times our strategy to deliver for our customers and outperform our markets is working. We're continuing to lead in the capabilities that make Corning distinctive. In fact, we advanced multiple growth initiatives during the quarter. Let\u2019s consider the first observation in more detail. In the second quarter, we completed adjustments to our operating plan and continue to execute across the board by delivering operational improvements that will generate significant cost savings through 2021. We delivered sequential growth in sales, EPS and free cash flow. We also completed the vast majority of our anticipated restructuring, including the reprioritization of R&D programs. We believe we're continuing to position Corning for strong long term and improve profitability. Turning to my second observation, our long-term strategy is sound and our growth drivers are intact. As I said before, we're not just counting on everybody buying more stuff, we're putting more Corning into the products that people already buy. This provides a mechanism for us to outperform our end markets even in challenging environments. The relevance of our focused and cohesive portfolio remains strong and is actually increasing some of the secular trends benefiting us could accelerate as consumer lifestyles continue to adapt in a world of social distancing and as healthcare companies advance solutions to end the pandemic. There is a need for expanded network capacity and ubiquitous display as people spend more time online. Safe widespread delivery of vaccines are among society\u2019s top priorities and reduce fine particular pollution appears to be helpful for reducing infection rates. All these needs fall directly within Corning's mission of improving lives through innovation and we are well positioned to contribute. The progress we've made and the leadership position we leverage across our markets in the second quarter speaks for itself. Let's take a closer look. In Life Sciences, we're mobilizing our capabilities to combat the virus wherever we can. Glass packaging is critical to the COVID-19 vaccine effort and it is currently in sure supply. Our Valor Glass innovation helps enables faster filling line speeds and increased patient safety. Valor Glass was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense to accelerate delivery of COVID-19 vaccines and Corning was awarded $204 million in funding to expand Valor manufacturing capacity. Three leading COVID-19 vaccine produces have entered supply agreements for Valor Glass and we\u2019re also working with several other potential customers to capture additional opportunities. Additionally, we announced a long-term supply agreement with Pfizer to provide Valor Glass for currently marketed drugs in their portfolio. Our Life Sciences segment entered several long-term agreements with major customers for COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing and antibody detection kits in quarter two. We're seeing strong demand for these products currently and we expect to accelerate shipments further in the second half. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, our specialty materials segment delivered 13% year-over-year sales growth while the smartphone market declined year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong demand for premium products. And we announced two exciting milestones. Gorilla Glass has now been used on more than 8 billion devices worldwide. And we maintained our industry leadership with the launch of Gorilla Glass Victus. This is the toughest Gorilla Glass yet and features significantly better drop and scratch performance than any other Gorilla Glass or competitive glass from other manufacturers. Samsung will be the first customer to adopt Gorilla Glass Victus in the near future. In Automotive, our Environmental Technologies segment outperformed in a weak market, strong adoption of our Gasoline Particulate Filters continued driving their sales growth to more than 20% year-over-year. Turning to Optical Communications, Corning grew sales 12% sequentially driven by carrier network projects. We announced a collaboration with EnerSys to speed 5G deployment by simplifying the delivery of fiber and electrical power to small-cell wireless sites. We also announced that we're working with Qualcomm Technologies to deliver indoor networks that are 5G ready, easy to install and affordable. The Corning systems are expected to be among the first designed to deliver 5G and our capability over a millimeter wave spectrum in the indoor segment. This includes enterprises such as offices, university campuses, hospitals, hotels, retail outlets, and more. Our collaboration will enable a small footprint and low power consumption platform for true high bandwidth 5G for in-building networks. Customer deployment will begin in the fall. In Display, Corning generated consistent sequential net income as customer demand remains steady, and large screen TV sales continue to drive demand supporting the opening of our Gen10.5 facilities. Across our markets, you can see that we're successfully advancing our long-term growth initiatives. Additionally, near term market conditions have improved. Auto factories are resuming operations in North America and Europe. And auto sales in China have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Telecommunications service providers and data center operators have resumed sending their technicians into the field. And they're rethinking their network needs to address greater demand for their services. Life Science labs are slowly reopening. We also expect television demand to remain resilient, as in-home entertainment is more important than ever and the demand for computing devices will be boosted by work and learn from home. So, we're seeing some encouraging developments across our industries. On the other hand, disruptive forces from the pandemic to civil unrest to a worldwide recession and geopolitical struggles all remain in play and they create uncertainty. We are united as a company to remain vigilant and adapt appropriately. We're rising to the challenge. I'll now turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more detail on our quarter and our near-term outlook.\nTony Tripeny: Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We came into this economic downturn with a balance sheet built for times like these, and we took actions during the quarter to ensure we have the financial resources needed for the duration. We generated $285 million in free cash flow, exited the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and are on track to generate positive free cash flow for the year. Our financial position is strong. We are becoming more efficient and we have the capacity in place to meet expected growth with minimal investment. We expect improved profitability and return on invested capital as we grow sales. As the quarter progressed, demand and visibility improved. We maintained our leadership across all of our market access platforms. As a result, we expected gross sales and profits in the third quarter. As we said on our first quarter call, we've made aggressive adjustments to align our cost and operating plan with lower anticipated sales. These actions were essentially completed in the second quarter and fall into four broad categories; reducing production levels across most of our businesses, adjusting operating expenses with the majority of the savings to be realized in the second half, modifying inventory plans and reducing capital expenditures. As a result, we expect $200 million in annualized cash savings. We reduced inventory by a $120 million in the second quarter, and we reduced our CapEx by half versus Q1 to $288 million. We expect Q3 and Q4 CapEx to be consistent with the second quarter. We had strong operational performance with sequential improvement in sales, net income, EPS and free cash flow. Second quarter sales were $2.6 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Net income was $218 million, up 23% quarter-over-quarter, and EPS was $0.25, up 25% sequentially, and free cash flow was $285 million. Now, before I get into further details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results stem from restructuring charges of $254 million, which was primarily non-cash and included the reassessment and reprioritization of R&D programs. Other differences between our GAAP and core results come from a non-cash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translations, hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded a current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. To be clear, with mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. So, we're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since the reception more than five years ago. Now let's review the business segments. In Display Technologies, second quarter sales were $753 million and net income was a $152 million, both consistent with the first quarter. The Display Glass volume grew by a low single digit percentage sequentially as our Gen 10.5 customers bought more glass, sequential price declines were moderate and as expected. As Wendell said, we expect that Television demand will remain resilient as in-home entertainment is more important than ever and that demand for IT products will be boosted by work and study from home trends. In the second quarter, worldwide TV sell-through units in Q2 increased slightly year-over-year better than Q1 and better than the industry anticipated. Additionally, demand for Notebook PC's was strong in the second quarter. Preliminary retail sell-through data for June and July indicate that demand recovery in China has held and that demand in North America and Europe remains robust, while emerging regions remain weak. While uncertainty exists around retail demand in the back half of the year, we remain confident that TV screen size will continue to grow in 2020 and beyond. TV\u2019s 65 inch or larger group are almost 40% year-over-year in the first half and we're well positioned to capture the majority of that growth with Gen 10.5 which is the most efficient Gen size for a large TV manufacturer. We continue to expect Display pricing to decline by mid-single digit percentage in 2020. We believe that three factors drive a favorable glass pricing environment. First; we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced through demand. For Corning, we are aligning our capacity with demand. We're also pacing Gen 10.5 capital projects to align with panel makers schedules. Second; our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third; display glass manufacturing requires periodic investment in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments. In Optical Communications, second quarter sales grew 12% sequentially to $887 million as major carriers increased spending on cable deployments and access network projects. Net income grew by $52 million to $81 million on the higher volume and actions taken to allowing cost and capacity. The year-over-year decline in sales was consistent with the passive optical market decline. We maintain our view that the long-term trend in Optical is strongly positive. Bandwidth demand has accelerated during the pandemic consuming network headroom capacity. Evidence of that demand includes AT&T\u2019s report that Wi-Fi calling increased 100%, Verizon's report that VPN connections were up 72% over pre-COVID levels and Zoom surpassing 300 million users from 10 million in December. We expect carriers to expand capacity to meet growing bandwidth in the future but the current environment makes timing uncertain. While network operators remain committed to the original capital plans for 2020, deployments are constrained by pandemic related labor and site access constraints. We expect these factors to continue in the third quarter. Environmental Technologies faced a challenging market. During the quarter, OEMs temporarily halted production in both the automotive and diesel markets. To mitigate the impact, we swiftly adjusted our operations to pace with customer demand and reduce costs. Environmental Technologies second quarter sales were $226 million and profitability was impacted by lower sales and production volumes. Our auto sales were down 31% year-over-year beating the global auto production decline of 41 -- 45% year-over-year through a continued adoption of Gasoline Particulate Filters. The good news is that by the end of the quarter, auto sales in China returned to pre-lockdown levels, while North America and Europe OEMs began ramping production. In these realms, we anticipated cyclical downturn in North America heavy duty truck market was made worse by shut downs, with vehicle production dropping 73% year-over-year. Overall, we remain confident in our content and innovation driven strategy in environmental and expect to return to grow as markets improve through the second half and into next year. Specialty Materials sales were $417 million in the second quarter up 13% year-over-year and in sharp contrast to the smartphone market which declined year-over-year. Net income was $90 million up 34% year-over-year. Sales growth was driven by three factors. First; premium glass demand increased in support of second half customer launches. Second; work and study from home trends drove growth in our products for tablets and laptops. And third; the demand for advanced chips drugs sales for our semiconductor equipment products. Looking ahead, we expect our performance relative to the 2020 mobile consumer electronics market to come from further adoption of our innovations. In Life Sciences, second quarter sales declined 7% year-over-year to $243 million. Net income was $31 million, down $9 million versus last year on the lower sales volume. The business was impacted by the prolong closure of non-essential laboratories such as university research labs particularly in the North American market. The impact has been somewhat offset by increased demand for consumables using COVID-19 testing applications. Life Science lab re-openings picked up in late May and lab utilization has been steadily increasing since then. Going forward, we are confident in the opportunities ahead for Life Sciences and Valor, especially as we prepare for upcoming vaccine demand. Equity earnings were positively impacted in the second quarter as our Hemlock JV settled a contract with the seller customer. Going forward, Hemlock will largely sell products in the semiconductor industry. Hemlock\u2019s leadership position is backed by attractive long term take or pay customer contracts with upfront payments. This creates stable revenue and profits and strong cash flow generation. Let\u2019s move to the balance sheet and our commitment to strong financial stewardship. We generated $285 million of free cash flow, a significant increase from the first quarter. We have $2.2 billion of cash and we have a debt structure that is conservative by design and relatively unique. Our balance sheet is built for times like these. Today, our average debt maturity is about 25 years, the longest in the S&P 500. Over the next 18 months, we have under $70 million coming due. Less than half of our total debt is due within the next 20 years and during this time there is no single year with debt repayments over $500 million. Investors often evaluate credit and financial health based on total debt-to-EBITDA. For the S&P 500, the average company has a weighted average debt maturity of roughly 10 years, and more than 80% of debt is due within 20 years. Consequently, when investors calculate the debt-to-EBITDA, they are implicitly focusing mostly on debt due in the next 20 years. Corning's 20-year debt-to-EBITDA is 1.2 times consistent with an A credit rating and illustrative of the conservatism of our balance sheet. We expect to maintain a strong cash position and to maintain our dividend. As I've previously mentioned, we expect to generate positive free cash flow for the year. And we have paused share buybacks and do not expect to add material debt in 2020. So in total, we have a very strong balance sheet and we have the financial resources needed for the duration of the economic downturn. To wrap-up, we had strong operational performance in the second quarter with sequential improvements in sales, net income, EPS and free cash flow. As the quarter progress, demand and visibility improved. This improvement has continued throughout July. As a result, we expect to grow sales and profits in the third quarter. However, we remain aware of the potential impact from the pandemic, the global recession, civil unrest and geopolitical tensions. So, how much growth will depend on end market demand and economic activity during August and September. We will keep you updated as we move through the quarter. Stepping back, our underlying growth drivers are intact and we're successfully navigating across this crisis. As we grow sales, we expect improved profitability. Furthermore, we have the capacity in place to be able to meet the sales growth with minimal investment, which we expect to result in capital efficiency gains including ROIC improvement. Altogether, this reaffirms our confidence that Corning is positioned to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks, Tony. During the second quarter, we made great strides in positioning Corning to emerge stronger from the global health crisis and resume growth. Sales, net income, EPS and free cash flow, all increased sequentially. Corning advanced multiple initiatives throughout the second quarter, including the launch of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus and continued innovation with 5G industry leaders. On the COVID-19 front, we continue to seek ways to leverage our deep technology, manufacturing, and engineering capabilities to combat the pandemic directly. We were delighted that Valor Glass was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense to accelerate delivery of COVID-19 vaccines. Overall, our decisive action and operational execution resulted in positive free cash flow and continued leadership in the capabilities that make Corning distinctive. We're delivering for our customers, we're outperforming on markets and we're preserving our financial strength. I'll conclude with an additional important development. For nearly 170 years, our company has been dedicated to creating innovations that have a positive impact on the world, while conducting business in a way that has positive impact on our people and our communities. Now, we have an opportunity to make additional contributions. We're setting up an office to further build racial and social unity within the walls of Corning, and in our communities. Lewis Steverson, our Chief Legal and Administrative Officer will lead this office. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Wendell. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes, thank you. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. If I can just start off with Display. You talked about kind of demand being resilient on the TV side, but as we\u2019re looking at some of the data points from panel makers regarding to a substantial improvement in banner shipments quarter-on-quarter or going into 3Q something in the magnitude of 20%. So, wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing in terms of or hearing in terms of demand from your panel customers? And where does inventory stand? Because I think last quarter, you were a bit concerned about the inventory level going in.\nWendell Weeks: Yeah, I think from Samik, from an overall standpoint the TV demand has clearly been resilient. The data points that we saw in the second quarter was the fact that the TV units were up on a year-over-year basis and that was certainly better than Q1. I mean, it was also better than well, most people were expecting as we went into the quarter. In addition to that, if you look at what happened in the preliminary data in June and July, I mean, that data was also very strong. In China, we didn't see a change in that data, though, that demand remains robust. And then North American and Europe, it was strong during the whole quarter and that continued. So yes, we think TV demand is resilient. We also think that supply chain is perfectly healthy. I mean, we ended the year in a healthy supply chain situation, of course, nobody knew exactly what was going to happen in the second quarter. But given what did happen in the second quarter and the way things are going now, we don't see any supply chain issues there.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And if I can just follow-up on the cash flow here, so you had a strong free cash flow quarter through the working capital improvements that you're driving. Just help me think about how sustainable those are as you start to kind of go through the recovery in terms of revenue, how much of that improvement is kind of something you have to get back as you go in working capital? Just trying to think about kind of how does this impact your free cash flow conversion in the long run?\nTony Tripeny: Well, certainly a lot of that was by reducing inventory -- reduced inventory over $100 million during the quarter. And if you recall, over the last 18 months or so as we thought our sales were going to be more stronger than they actually turned out to be we actually built up a fair amount of inventory, so, we think there's the opportunity to continue to reduce inventory. And then just from an overall operational standpoint, one of our real focus areas of the company is on the inventory management and how to get better at that. So, I think that at least that is sustainable for at least a couple more quarters, no doubt, when we grow again, we'll have to consume working capital. The other thing that was a big improvement during the quarter, of course, was what happened on capital spending. And as you know in the first quarter, a lot of that was the expansion capital wrapping up on some of our biggest projects, such as Gen 10.5 and although we still have some of that that's going on, we've reduced it significantly in Q2. And we expect Q3 and Q4 to be at those same levels.\nWendell Weeks: I think stepping back and looking at free cash flow conversion, fundamentally, when we're not in a build cycle, our free cash flow conversion is excellent. And that's where we are right now. Right, so it's less really about the specific programs and specific things we're doing. It's more just since it takes us a couple three years to build one of our major low-cost factories, but there's a cycle where we invest for the future. And it is that investment to drive down our free cash flow conversion. We're in a period right now, where we've gotten ahead of that. So, we're in a spot where we're just in a reinvestment stage. And we were like that, we're going to have really high free cash flow conversion, you can expect that to continue.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is now open.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good morning. Wendell, I was wondering if you could maybe step back and give us a bigger picture view on the new Optical cycle. You talked about network headroom, basically going away and sounds like site access is still an issue but not as big of an issue. So, if you wanted to think about maybe the next four to six quarters versus how you performed in the year or two before the downturn in Optical how do we think about that under the sort of new world we're living in? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Steve, I think that's an excellent question and sort of balance of the known versus the unknown and then try to come to the conclusion. On the known side, both our cloud providers as well as our network service providers, all are experiencing very strong growth, as you heard from Tony and you've heard from me during this call. That strong growth and they see an opportunity for more revenue production going forward. And they see that fiber based networks have -- are just lower cost. And we're starting to see some commentary especially from the network providers about how they can combine and merge all the various services onto one high capacity fiber network, and therefore, open up lots of avenues towards revenue creation, all off on capital investment. So, all of that is stacking up to sort of powerful forces to put Optical Communications back in a cycle of growth. On the unknown side, real people have to install these networks. Real people have to show up to put in place these massive cloud-based data centers. And even when people are resuming putting technicians in the field, it is at a much less rate than what it would be -- what would be needed to support historical build cycles. So, we still have the pandemic here. And so that makes actual prediction just quarter-to-quarter what will happen to be difficult? But I think as you said Steve, because that's what's behind the question, the fundamentals look really strong. Our market position looks really strong. We should be entering a growth cycle. Now, we just got to see how the world deals with the pandemic.\nSteven Fox: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nAsiya Merchant: Great, thank you for taking my question and congratulations on a good quarter. A couple of questions; one is on Optical, there was commentary that the optical segment performed sort of in line with the passive optical market decline and Wendell just talked about all the labor constraints etcetera that's going on. How should we think about Corning always maintained their leadership across their end markets? When do we expect or when should we expect Corning to again resume growth that outpaces the broader market? And then I have another follow-up on capacity and margins. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: This year if we're doing our job, that's the way we think about it. We should be outpacing the market and we will get on with that post haste.\nAsiya Merchant: Okay, and then just on margins, if I think about obviously, you guys are making some progress here sequentially in the third quarter, that's the commentary and typically 3Q is up 5% or so on the top line and as the top line flows through the margins, etcetera. There's some investor confusion around how idling capacity should help margins. If somebody can walk us through the dynamics there typically idling capacity would lead to perhaps a hit on margins? And how should we think about the margin improvements in the back half? Thank you.\nTony Tripeny: Yes, Asiya, you're correct. I think when we idle capacity that does hurt the margins, especially if you're having less production than you're actually selling because you also take down inventory, which is, of course, what we did in Q2, in Q3. On the other side, though we did a lot of cost reduction efforts, and that ends up helping margins. And so, we ended up in Q2 with margins very similar to what we had in Q1 on a gross margin level and then on an operating margin level, of course, we did better than that. So, as we look forward, the key here is to increase sales and as we create more sales through our factories and more sales for OpEx structure, we'll see expansion in margins.\nAsiya Merchant: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, there. Thanks a lot. I guess I wanted to ask about just the fundamentals in the Display business. I'm thinking more strategically, there's a lot of moving parts there, of course, you guys are pacing some of your investment in Gen 10.5. You've got pending exits of some of the LCD panel making facilities in Korea. Certainly, we hear about CVC rumored to be for sale. I mean, can you just talk about what you're seeing over there, and how that kind of plays into your dynamics strategically as you look forward? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks for the question. Once you've heard from us in the past really remains -- those fundamental drivers remain in place, which is, we have been preparing for a number of years for the ascendancy of the Chinese panel making infrastructure. And because of the particular way that economy works, that we believe, what was the strongest region in terms of production in Korea at a cost disadvantage. Once they made the decision not to go to Gen 10.5 that sort of was the die was cast. So, that's why we have been on our investment cycle in China with three quarters of the support coming from our customers or the Chinese government in one form or another. So, those trends look right, they continue to move in our direction. It all just happened a little bit faster than we were planning. Because Korea ended-up, Samsung specifically ended-up making decisions a little faster than what was their original plan. So, we don't really have all of our Gen 10.5 facilities up to support all that demand yet. And that's what we're working through. CC, of course, is a strong customer of ours. We would expect our market position to continue to grow as the trends towards China continue and the trends towards our long-term strategic partners continue.\nGeorge Notter: Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Does that answer your question, George?\nGeorge Notter: Very well, yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I was just curious, given the vaccine and obviously you've gotten some funding from the government but just in general sort of this push to move manufacturing back to the U.S. and clearly a significant amount of government dollars that are out there right now, if this has changed really your thought process on timeline for Valor to provide meaningful contribution to the business? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: The simple answer Shannon is yes.\nShannon Cross: Any idea of the magnitude of the pull-in of the timeline?\nWendell Weeks: We have an excellent idea. Yeah, we have an excellent idea, we\u2019re not disclosing it yet. Here's the challenge really why we're not giving specific guidance here on that is, we are putting a significant amount of our effort behind the specific human health need that we have to protect our people and the people around the globe with the vaccine. So, that's where we're aiming our efforts. So, sort of any prediction on the specific sales as they evolve would have to involve like what is going to be the success and timing of the vaccine. So, what you can see the way to think about it is, we're now accelerating the building of our high-volume manufacturing facility. And we're in the midst of pouring concrete on the floor to inside that shell. We're in the midst of quickly ramping our equipment and we are doubling the output of our big flaps New York facility. So, we're growing very fast. But so our customer is going very fast. And it's really hard to pick winners and losers. So, I spilled up, here's why I think about it financially. I still don't think if you're primarily focused on the near term, you should worry much about Valor driving right numbers, right. If you're worried about the long term, this is an excellent sign for us. All the stuff that we bet on, which is we needed U.S. based manufacturing, that we needed a new pharmaceutical package, that we needed to have more full line capacity, that we could do that through our packaging, that we needed to make patient safer. All those bets looked like they're coming true. But that's really about the long term. It will be a big driver. Meanwhile, we just want to make you safe, and we want to do our part. Does that make sense, Shannon?\nShannon Cross: It does, it does. Can you talk a bit about any competitive moves that you've seen from some of the others out in the industry because it seems like you guys are in a really good position and I'm wondering if you've seen anything pop up recently? And then thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Well, in this industry remember we\u2019re an attacker. So historically, we haven't had much of a position in pharmaceutical packaging. And it was only when we saw significant issues with the packaging of today that we developed the Valor Innovation and decided we needed to do this to make patients safer. And we needed to bring our capabilities to that fight. So, we're really the attacker, we're just getting started. But I think you're right. I think we're off to a robust start to give our competitors a heck of a wake-up call.\nShannon Cross: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTim Long: Hi, thanks for the opportunity. Congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask about the Specialty Materials outperformance. Can you talk us about how significant the impact from work from home and the strong semiconductor equipment demand was relative to smartphone premium products? And then maybe how sustainable you see that as we go into 2H?\nTony Tripeny: I think from an overall standpoint, each of those items were roughly about a third of the reason for the outperformance. I mean clearly what happened the glass that we sell both the tablets and as far as we sell the notebook computers that have Gorilla Glass on them was very important to us. And we think it's a good example of the innovations that we have that cause us to perform better than the underlying market. And the semiconductor performance was also good. I mean, the demand for advanced chipsets really have made a difference there. And then from a glass standpoint, as we said, we -- as people get ready, as our customers get ready to introduce new products in the back half of the year, they of course, pull all those products early and we saw nice demand there too.\nTim Long: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe just a question for me on the Optical segment picking up but just whether you could give us a sense of the breadth of that pickup, is it amongst kind of one or two major customers? Are you seeing it kind of across the board and any commentary on hyperscale customers in terms of their kind of optical demand?\nTony Tripeny: I think from an overall standpoint, in the specialty side and the carrier market, I mean, it's certainly more than one or two customers, but it was very much driven in the carrier market and when you see our detailed numbers, you'll see that those were the numbers that were up on a sequential basis. In the enterprise market, it was a little bit more mixed, I think from a data center standpoint. That's where a lot of the labor constraint really showed up, I mean, in some data centers, less so than others. But I think that's one of the reasons that those sales were down on a quarter-over-quarter basis. But then also a lot of our enterprise customers are small and medium businesses, and also corporate spending. And we saw, those areas were clearly impacted by what's happening in the outside world. But there was a broad set, especially in the carrier business.\nMeta Marshall: Got it. And then maybe just on the restructuring charge and you noted that it was due to reprioritization of some R&D projects. Are there any major projects we should consider discontinued or just any commentary there? Thanks.\nTony Tripeny: Yes, I mean, it was very specifically a stealth project that we hadn't really talked a lot about externally, that had originally been initiated by a customer request. And if you recall on our 3, 4, 5 strategies, there's the 20% that\u2019s outside of 3, 4, 5 capabilities where we put our energy and efforts into. I mean, it's one of those projects in that 20% category. And of course, in this environment, it made sense for us to go back and look at that 20%. And so that's what we did. And, we ended up restructuring impairing some of those assets.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nRod Hall: Yeah, hi, thank you for the question. I wanted to start with the lack of guidance or the lower guidance for September and just see if I'm interpreting this correctly. It seems like your Display commentary is positive. And then, Optical have been uncertain so that leaves us with Specialty as the source of increased uncertainty in September. So, I wanted to check and see if that's accurate, or that's the right way to interpret this and then if that is right, what's driving that? Is it product timing or is it demand uncertainty; you may be double click on why the reduced guidance in September? And also maybe tell us whether you're going to continue to provide a lower level of guidance like this or is this just a one-off? And then I have a follow up.\nWendell Weeks: So, let's start with your premise, okay. We're not providing lower guidance for September. Nor are we providing lower guidance for Specialty or anything like this. While this is, I think you're over thinking it. Here's the situation. Really, all lights are flashing green in our specific industries and in our performance of our units. Our financial executives, our operational executives, our strategic executives, where all four are getting more specific guidance this quarter, okay. I'm the problem. And it's not anything that we're seeing happening specifically in our industries. It's just as I look at the world, and I see the pandemic doing what it's doing. I see a very broad global recession. I see civil unrest, really across the globe. And I see an awful lot of global tensions in a geopolitical sense, and is that macro area that makes me say, I think there's just too much uncertainty just to count on what we're seeing with our own two eyes. But if we just looked at our data, I think we'd be comfortable giving specific guidance. And we would view that guidance as positive. And I'm just more worried about the uncertainty. Does that make sense to you, Rod? I know it must disappoint.\nRod Hall: Yes.\nWendell Weeks: Does it make sense to you?\nRod Hall: No, no, no Wendell, that's very helpful color. I just -- that's very helpful. So, that answers my question. I appreciate that. And then the second thing, I wanted to drill into the working capital again Tony. One of the standouts for us was the date payable that came down quite a bit in June and wondering, is that a sustainable level? Or do you expect that to bounce back to kind of more historical average levels or and maybe, can you tell us what drove that?\nTony Tripeny: Yeah. And I think from an overall standpoint, I mean, Wendell is right, I mean, we're in a period of time where our free cash flow conversion is going to be strong because we\u2019re not doing the investment capital that we've done the last several years and so either on any given line item on the cash flow statement, there's a variety of things that happened on a month in and month out standpoint. But we're committed and we're going to deliver free cash flow for the year. And, that's what our focus is. And we\u2019re thrilled with our performance in the second quarter. I think it really helps investors understand our ability to generate that free cash flow.\nRod Hall: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Wendell, you noted strong free cash flow margins coming off a build cycle. I think, Tony, you just referenced that too. I was wondering how long typically these post build cycles are especially given the fact that Display has been usually a large source of that historical perspective on that would be helpful. And given COVID now, do you think that, that is extended for a longer period of time? And I have a follow up.\nWendell Weeks: That's a very excellent question. In a way, what you're asking is, when will we be in our next build cycle, which usually is for revenue that's a couple of years now. I think it's really hard to answer that question Wamsi. Drove me up in the middle of the night and asked me, I'd say, I think we're going to be in a period of really staying within more of the reinvestment, repurpose pieces of our wheel, right. And pieces of our wheel for a time period that is your normal models you should be able to count on. At the same time, what we hope for is that things like successful health with the vaccine that, this the movement towards more optical networks and all those things put us in a long-term spot, those mega trends are a conversion of more value in order to be back in our build cycle. But I think we'll have plenty of warning, Wamsi. Sorry, I don't have a more specific answer for you.\nWamsi Mohan: No, thank you. Thanks for the color Wendell. And Tony, if I could, the funding that the government's providing the $204 million that you alluded to, to expand Valor manufacturing capacity. How should we think of that flowing through sort of your statements? Is that a -- does it get reflected in CapEx right away? Is it all in CapEx? Can you give us any color on that? Thank you.\nTony Tripeny: Yeah, I think the way to think about it Wamsi is, as we spend this money, this gets reversed. And so we just get it added out into our statements I mean, most of it is for capacity and most of it is in CapEx, but there's also some operating expenses and they'll get reimbursed there too.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, we've got time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And that question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question, two follow-ups. Tony, given all the changes going within the company and increased focus and in reducing the cost, should I expect your operating margins were to expand from here on even if revenues were to go flat just for the scenario analysis? And I have a follow up.\nTony Tripeny: I mean, clearly what we've done in the second quarter is reduce our operating costs. And that will be reflected as we get into Q3 and Q4. From our overall standpoint, as we've talked about before, our real focus area is to get back to growing our sales and growing our profitability. And when our sales grow, we expect to see improved profitability too.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. And then Wendell, I just want to better understand the dynamics impacting the TV industry. Can you remind me what the mix of 65-inch TV is as a percentage of the overall TV demand or shipment?\nTony Tripeny: Mehdi, at the top of my head, I'm drawing a blank on that, that's clearly where a lot of the growth is going, to give example, almost 40% on a year-over-year basis. But when we have our follow up call, we'll get to the answer of that.\nMehdi Hosseini: All right. Thank you.\nTony Tripeny: Thanks.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks Mehdi, and thanks everybody for joining us today. Before we close out, just want to let you know that we will attend the Jefferies Semiconductor IP Hardware and Communication Infrastructure Summit on September 2nd, and Citi 2020 Global Technology Conference on September 9th, and both will be virtual conferences. So once again, thank you and Joel, please disconnect all lines.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported second quarter 2020 results. Sales were $2.6 billion. Net income was $218 million. EPS was $0.25 and free cash flow was $285 million. All increased sequentially. I have two primary observations on the quarter. First, while we're effectively adjusting to this period of uncertainty with decisive action and operational execution, we're generating positive cash flow and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Second, even in these uncertain times our strategy to deliver for our customers and outperform our markets is working. We're continuing to lead in the capabilities that make Corning distinctive. In fact, we advanced multiple growth initiatives during the quarter. Let's consider the first observation in more detail. In the second quarter, we completed adjustments to our operating plan and continue to execute across the board by delivering operational improvements that will generate significant cost savings through 2021. We delivered sequential growth in sales, EPS and free cash flow. We also completed the vast majority of our anticipated restructuring, including the reprioritization of R&D programs. We believe we're continuing to position Corning for strong long term and improve profitability. Turning to my second observation, our long-term strategy is sound and our growth drivers are intact. As I said before, we're not just counting on everybody buying more stuff, we're putting more Corning into the products that people already buy. This provides a mechanism for us to outperform our end markets even in challenging environments. The relevance of our focused and cohesive portfolio remains strong and is actually increasing some of the secular trends benefiting us could accelerate as consumer lifestyles continue to adapt in a world of social distancing and as healthcare companies advance solutions to end the pandemic. There is a need for expanded network capacity and ubiquitous display as people spend more time online. Safe widespread delivery of vaccines are among society's top priorities and reduce fine particular pollution appears to be helpful for reducing infection rates. All these needs fall directly within Corning's mission of improving lives through innovation and we are well positioned to contribute. The progress we've made and the leadership position we leverage across our markets in the second quarter speaks for itself. Let's take a closer look. In Life Sciences, we're mobilizing our capabilities to combat the virus wherever we can. Glass packaging is critical to the COVID-19 vaccine effort and it is currently in sure supply. Our Valor Glass innovation helps enables faster filling line speeds and increased patient safety. Valor Glass was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense to accelerate delivery of COVID-19 vaccines and Corning was awarded $204 million in funding to expand Valor manufacturing capacity. Three leading COVID-19 vaccine produces have entered supply agreements for Valor Glass and we're also working with several other potential customers to capture additional opportunities. Additionally, we announced a long-term supply agreement with Pfizer to provide Valor Glass for currently marketed drugs in their portfolio. Our Life Sciences segment entered several long-term agreements with major customers for COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing and antibody detection kits in quarter two. We're seeing strong demand for these products currently and we expect to accelerate shipments further in the second half. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, our specialty materials segment delivered 13% year-over-year sales growth while the smartphone market declined year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong demand for premium products. And we announced two exciting milestones. Gorilla Glass has now been used on more than 8 billion devices worldwide. And we maintained our industry leadership with the launch of Gorilla Glass Victus. This is the toughest Gorilla Glass yet and features significantly better drop and scratch performance than any other Gorilla Glass or competitive glass from other manufacturers. Samsung will be the first customer to adopt Gorilla Glass Victus in the near future. In Automotive, our Environmental Technologies segment outperformed in a weak market, strong adoption of our Gasoline Particulate Filters continued driving their sales growth to more than 20% year-over-year. Turning to Optical Communications, Corning grew sales 12% sequentially driven by carrier network projects. We announced a collaboration with EnerSys to speed 5G deployment by simplifying the delivery of fiber and electrical power to small-cell wireless sites. We also announced that we're working with Qualcomm Technologies to deliver indoor networks that are 5G ready, easy to install and affordable. The Corning systems are expected to be among the first designed to deliver 5G and our capability over a millimeter wave spectrum in the indoor segment. This includes enterprises such as offices, university campuses, hospitals, hotels, retail outlets, and more. Our collaboration will enable a small footprint and low power consumption platform for true high bandwidth 5G for in-building networks. Customer deployment will begin in the fall. In Display, Corning generated consistent sequential net income as customer demand remains steady, and large screen TV sales continue to drive demand supporting the opening of our Gen10.5 facilities. Across our markets, you can see that we're successfully advancing our long-term growth initiatives. Additionally, near term market conditions have improved. Auto factories are resuming operations in North America and Europe. And auto sales in China have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Telecommunications service providers and data center operators have resumed sending their technicians into the field. And they're rethinking their network needs to address greater demand for their services. Life Science labs are slowly reopening. We also expect television demand to remain resilient, as in-home entertainment is more important than ever and the demand for computing devices will be boosted by work and learn from home. So, we're seeing some encouraging developments across our industries. On the other hand, disruptive forces from the pandemic to civil unrest to a worldwide recession and geopolitical struggles all remain in play and they create uncertainty. We are united as a company to remain vigilant and adapt appropriately. We're rising to the challenge. I'll now turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more detail on our quarter and our near-term outlook. Thanks, Tony. During the second quarter, we made great strides in positioning Corning to emerge stronger from the global health crisis and resume growth. Sales, net income, EPS and free cash flow, all increased sequentially. Corning advanced multiple initiatives throughout the second quarter, including the launch of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus and continued innovation with 5G industry leaders. On the COVID-19 front, we continue to seek ways to leverage our deep technology, manufacturing, and engineering capabilities to combat the pandemic directly. We were delighted that Valor Glass was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense to accelerate delivery of COVID-19 vaccines. Overall, our decisive action and operational execution resulted in positive free cash flow and continued leadership in the capabilities that make Corning distinctive. We're delivering for our customers, we're outperforming on markets and we're preserving our financial strength. I'll conclude with an additional important development. For nearly 170 years, our company has been dedicated to creating innovations that have a positive impact on the world, while conducting business in a way that has positive impact on our people and our communities. Now, we have an opportunity to make additional contributions. We're setting up an office to further build racial and social unity within the walls of Corning, and in our communities. Lewis Steverson, our Chief Legal and Administrative Officer will lead this office. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann? Yeah, I think from Samik, from an overall standpoint the TV demand has clearly been resilient. The data points that we saw in the second quarter was the fact that the TV units were up on a year-over-year basis and that was certainly better than Q1. I mean, it was also better than well, most people were expecting as we went into the quarter. In addition to that, if you look at what happened in the preliminary data in June and July, I mean, that data was also very strong. In China, we didn't see a change in that data, though, that demand remains robust. And then North American and Europe, it was strong during the whole quarter and that continued. So yes, we think TV demand is resilient. We also think that supply chain is perfectly healthy. I mean, we ended the year in a healthy supply chain situation, of course, nobody knew exactly what was going to happen in the second quarter. But given what did happen in the second quarter and the way things are going now, we don't see any supply chain issues there. I think stepping back and looking at free cash flow conversion, fundamentally, when we're not in a build cycle, our free cash flow conversion is excellent. And that's where we are right now. Right, so it's less really about the specific programs and specific things we're doing. It's more just since it takes us a couple three years to build one of our major low-cost factories, but there's a cycle where we invest for the future. And it is that investment to drive down our free cash flow conversion. We're in a period right now, where we've gotten ahead of that. So, we're in a spot where we're just in a reinvestment stage. And we were like that, we're going to have really high free cash flow conversion, you can expect that to continue. Steve, I think that's an excellent question and sort of balance of the known versus the unknown and then try to come to the conclusion. On the known side, both our cloud providers as well as our network service providers, all are experiencing very strong growth, as you heard from Tony and you've heard from me during this call. That strong growth and they see an opportunity for more revenue production going forward. And they see that fiber based networks have -- are just lower cost. And we're starting to see some commentary especially from the network providers about how they can combine and merge all the various services onto one high capacity fiber network, and therefore, open up lots of avenues towards revenue creation, all off on capital investment. So, all of that is stacking up to sort of powerful forces to put Optical Communications back in a cycle of growth. On the unknown side, real people have to install these networks. Real people have to show up to put in place these massive cloud-based data centers. And even when people are resuming putting technicians in the field, it is at a much less rate than what it would be -- what would be needed to support historical build cycles. So, we still have the pandemic here. And so that makes actual prediction just quarter-to-quarter what will happen to be difficult? But I think as you said Steve, because that's what's behind the question, the fundamentals look really strong. Our market position looks really strong. We should be entering a growth cycle. Now, we just got to see how the world deals with the pandemic. This year if we're doing our job, that's the way we think about it. We should be outpacing the market and we will get on with that post haste. Thanks for the question. Once you've heard from us in the past really remains -- those fundamental drivers remain in place, which is, we have been preparing for a number of years for the ascendancy of the Chinese panel making infrastructure. And because of the particular way that economy works, that we believe, what was the strongest region in terms of production in Korea at a cost disadvantage. Once they made the decision not to go to Gen 10.5 that sort of was the die was cast. So, that's why we have been on our investment cycle in China with three quarters of the support coming from our customers or the Chinese government in one form or another. So, those trends look right, they continue to move in our direction. It all just happened a little bit faster than we were planning. Because Korea ended-up, Samsung specifically ended-up making decisions a little faster than what was their original plan. So, we don't really have all of our Gen 10.5 facilities up to support all that demand yet. And that's what we're working through. CC, of course, is a strong customer of ours. We would expect our market position to continue to grow as the trends towards China continue and the trends towards our long-term strategic partners continue. Does that answer your question, George? The simple answer Shannon is yes. We have an excellent idea. Yeah, we have an excellent idea, we're not disclosing it yet. Here's the challenge really why we're not giving specific guidance here on that is, we are putting a significant amount of our effort behind the specific human health need that we have to protect our people and the people around the globe with the vaccine. So, that's where we're aiming our efforts. So, sort of any prediction on the specific sales as they evolve would have to involve like what is going to be the success and timing of the vaccine. So, what you can see the way to think about it is, we're now accelerating the building of our high-volume manufacturing facility. And we're in the midst of pouring concrete on the floor to inside that shell. We're in the midst of quickly ramping our equipment and we are doubling the output of our big flaps New York facility. So, we're growing very fast. But so our customer is going very fast. And it's really hard to pick winners and losers. So, I spilled up, here's why I think about it financially. I still don't think if you're primarily focused on the near term, you should worry much about Valor driving right numbers, right. If you're worried about the long term, this is an excellent sign for us. All the stuff that we bet on, which is we needed U.S. based manufacturing, that we needed a new pharmaceutical package, that we needed to have more full line capacity, that we could do that through our packaging, that we needed to make patient safer. All those bets looked like they're coming true. But that's really about the long term. It will be a big driver. Meanwhile, we just want to make you safe, and we want to do our part. Does that make sense, Shannon? Well, in this industry remember we're an attacker. So historically, we haven't had much of a position in pharmaceutical packaging. And it was only when we saw significant issues with the packaging of today that we developed the Valor Innovation and decided we needed to do this to make patients safer. And we needed to bring our capabilities to that fight. So, we're really the attacker, we're just getting started. But I think you're right. I think we're off to a robust start to give our competitors a heck of a wake-up call. So, let's start with your premise, okay. We're not providing lower guidance for September. Nor are we providing lower guidance for Specialty or anything like this. While this is, I think you're over thinking it. Here's the situation. Really, all lights are flashing green in our specific industries and in our performance of our units. Our financial executives, our operational executives, our strategic executives, where all four are getting more specific guidance this quarter, okay. I'm the problem. And it's not anything that we're seeing happening specifically in our industries. It's just as I look at the world, and I see the pandemic doing what it's doing. I see a very broad global recession. I see civil unrest, really across the globe. And I see an awful lot of global tensions in a geopolitical sense, and is that macro area that makes me say, I think there's just too much uncertainty just to count on what we're seeing with our own two eyes. But if we just looked at our data, I think we'd be comfortable giving specific guidance. And we would view that guidance as positive. And I'm just more worried about the uncertainty. Does that make sense to you, Rod? I know it must disappoint. Does it make sense to you? That's a very excellent question. In a way, what you're asking is, when will we be in our next build cycle, which usually is for revenue that's a couple of years now. I think it's really hard to answer that question Wamsi. Drove me up in the middle of the night and asked me, I'd say, I think we're going to be in a period of really staying within more of the reinvestment, repurpose pieces of our wheel, right. And pieces of our wheel for a time period that is your normal models you should be able to count on. At the same time, what we hope for is that things like successful health with the vaccine that, this the movement towards more optical networks and all those things put us in a long-term spot, those mega trends are a conversion of more value in order to be back in our build cycle. But I think we'll have plenty of warning, Wamsi. Sorry, I don't have a more specific answer for you."

            "name": "Tony Tripeny",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We came into this economic downturn with a balance sheet built for times like these, and we took actions during the quarter to ensure we have the financial resources needed for the duration. We generated $285 million in free cash flow, exited the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and are on track to generate positive free cash flow for the year. Our financial position is strong. We are becoming more efficient and we have the capacity in place to meet expected growth with minimal investment. We expect improved profitability and return on invested capital as we grow sales. As the quarter progressed, demand and visibility improved. We maintained our leadership across all of our market access platforms. As a result, we expected gross sales and profits in the third quarter. As we said on our first quarter call, we've made aggressive adjustments to align our cost and operating plan with lower anticipated sales. These actions were essentially completed in the second quarter and fall into four broad categories; reducing production levels across most of our businesses, adjusting operating expenses with the majority of the savings to be realized in the second half, modifying inventory plans and reducing capital expenditures. As a result, we expect $200 million in annualized cash savings. We reduced inventory by a $120 million in the second quarter, and we reduced our CapEx by half versus Q1 to $288 million. We expect Q3 and Q4 CapEx to be consistent with the second quarter. We had strong operational performance with sequential improvement in sales, net income, EPS and free cash flow. Second quarter sales were $2.6 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Net income was $218 million, up 23% quarter-over-quarter, and EPS was $0.25, up 25% sequentially, and free cash flow was $285 million. Now, before I get into further details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results stem from restructuring charges of $254 million, which was primarily non-cash and included the reassessment and reprioritization of R&D programs. Other differences between our GAAP and core results come from a non-cash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translations, hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded a current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. To be clear, with mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. So, we're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since the reception more than five years ago. Now let's review the business segments. In Display Technologies, second quarter sales were $753 million and net income was a $152 million, both consistent with the first quarter. The Display Glass volume grew by a low single digit percentage sequentially as our Gen 10.5 customers bought more glass, sequential price declines were moderate and as expected. As Wendell said, we expect that Television demand will remain resilient as in-home entertainment is more important than ever and that demand for IT products will be boosted by work and study from home trends. In the second quarter, worldwide TV sell-through units in Q2 increased slightly year-over-year better than Q1 and better than the industry anticipated. Additionally, demand for Notebook PC's was strong in the second quarter. Preliminary retail sell-through data for June and July indicate that demand recovery in China has held and that demand in North America and Europe remains robust, while emerging regions remain weak. While uncertainty exists around retail demand in the back half of the year, we remain confident that TV screen size will continue to grow in 2020 and beyond. TV's 65 inch or larger group are almost 40% year-over-year in the first half and we're well positioned to capture the majority of that growth with Gen 10.5 which is the most efficient Gen size for a large TV manufacturer. We continue to expect Display pricing to decline by mid-single digit percentage in 2020. We believe that three factors drive a favorable glass pricing environment. First; we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced through demand. For Corning, we are aligning our capacity with demand. We're also pacing Gen 10.5 capital projects to align with panel makers schedules. Second; our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third; display glass manufacturing requires periodic investment in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments. In Optical Communications, second quarter sales grew 12% sequentially to $887 million as major carriers increased spending on cable deployments and access network projects. Net income grew by $52 million to $81 million on the higher volume and actions taken to allowing cost and capacity. The year-over-year decline in sales was consistent with the passive optical market decline. We maintain our view that the long-term trend in Optical is strongly positive. Bandwidth demand has accelerated during the pandemic consuming network headroom capacity. Evidence of that demand includes AT&T's report that Wi-Fi calling increased 100%, Verizon's report that VPN connections were up 72% over pre-COVID levels and Zoom surpassing 300 million users from 10 million in December. We expect carriers to expand capacity to meet growing bandwidth in the future but the current environment makes timing uncertain. While network operators remain committed to the original capital plans for 2020, deployments are constrained by pandemic related labor and site access constraints. We expect these factors to continue in the third quarter. Environmental Technologies faced a challenging market. During the quarter, OEMs temporarily halted production in both the automotive and diesel markets. To mitigate the impact, we swiftly adjusted our operations to pace with customer demand and reduce costs. Environmental Technologies second quarter sales were $226 million and profitability was impacted by lower sales and production volumes. Our auto sales were down 31% year-over-year beating the global auto production decline of 41 -- 45% year-over-year through a continued adoption of Gasoline Particulate Filters. The good news is that by the end of the quarter, auto sales in China returned to pre-lockdown levels, while North America and Europe OEMs began ramping production. In these realms, we anticipated cyclical downturn in North America heavy duty truck market was made worse by shut downs, with vehicle production dropping 73% year-over-year. Overall, we remain confident in our content and innovation driven strategy in environmental and expect to return to grow as markets improve through the second half and into next year. Specialty Materials sales were $417 million in the second quarter up 13% year-over-year and in sharp contrast to the smartphone market which declined year-over-year. Net income was $90 million up 34% year-over-year. Sales growth was driven by three factors. First; premium glass demand increased in support of second half customer launches. Second; work and study from home trends drove growth in our products for tablets and laptops. And third; the demand for advanced chips drugs sales for our semiconductor equipment products. Looking ahead, we expect our performance relative to the 2020 mobile consumer electronics market to come from further adoption of our innovations. In Life Sciences, second quarter sales declined 7% year-over-year to $243 million. Net income was $31 million, down $9 million versus last year on the lower sales volume. The business was impacted by the prolong closure of non-essential laboratories such as university research labs particularly in the North American market. The impact has been somewhat offset by increased demand for consumables using COVID-19 testing applications. Life Science lab re-openings picked up in late May and lab utilization has been steadily increasing since then. Going forward, we are confident in the opportunities ahead for Life Sciences and Valor, especially as we prepare for upcoming vaccine demand. Equity earnings were positively impacted in the second quarter as our Hemlock JV settled a contract with the seller customer. Going forward, Hemlock will largely sell products in the semiconductor industry. Hemlock's leadership position is backed by attractive long term take or pay customer contracts with upfront payments. This creates stable revenue and profits and strong cash flow generation. Let's move to the balance sheet and our commitment to strong financial stewardship. We generated $285 million of free cash flow, a significant increase from the first quarter. We have $2.2 billion of cash and we have a debt structure that is conservative by design and relatively unique. Our balance sheet is built for times like these. Today, our average debt maturity is about 25 years, the longest in the S&P 500. Over the next 18 months, we have under $70 million coming due. Less than half of our total debt is due within the next 20 years and during this time there is no single year with debt repayments over $500 million. Investors often evaluate credit and financial health based on total debt-to-EBITDA. For the S&P 500, the average company has a weighted average debt maturity of roughly 10 years, and more than 80% of debt is due within 20 years. Consequently, when investors calculate the debt-to-EBITDA, they are implicitly focusing mostly on debt due in the next 20 years. Corning's 20-year debt-to-EBITDA is 1.2 times consistent with an A credit rating and illustrative of the conservatism of our balance sheet. We expect to maintain a strong cash position and to maintain our dividend. As I've previously mentioned, we expect to generate positive free cash flow for the year. And we have paused share buybacks and do not expect to add material debt in 2020. So in total, we have a very strong balance sheet and we have the financial resources needed for the duration of the economic downturn. To wrap-up, we had strong operational performance in the second quarter with sequential improvements in sales, net income, EPS and free cash flow. As the quarter progress, demand and visibility improved. This improvement has continued throughout July. As a result, we expect to grow sales and profits in the third quarter. However, we remain aware of the potential impact from the pandemic, the global recession, civil unrest and geopolitical tensions. So, how much growth will depend on end market demand and economic activity during August and September. We will keep you updated as we move through the quarter. Stepping back, our underlying growth drivers are intact and we're successfully navigating across this crisis. As we grow sales, we expect improved profitability. Furthermore, we have the capacity in place to be able to meet the sales growth with minimal investment, which we expect to result in capital efficiency gains including ROIC improvement. Altogether, this reaffirms our confidence that Corning is positioned to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Wendell. Well, certainly a lot of that was by reducing inventory -- reduced inventory over $100 million during the quarter. And if you recall, over the last 18 months or so as we thought our sales were going to be more stronger than they actually turned out to be we actually built up a fair amount of inventory, so, we think there's the opportunity to continue to reduce inventory. And then just from an overall operational standpoint, one of our real focus areas of the company is on the inventory management and how to get better at that. So, I think that at least that is sustainable for at least a couple more quarters, no doubt, when we grow again, we'll have to consume working capital. The other thing that was a big improvement during the quarter, of course, was what happened on capital spending. And as you know in the first quarter, a lot of that was the expansion capital wrapping up on some of our biggest projects, such as Gen 10.5 and although we still have some of that that's going on, we've reduced it significantly in Q2. And we expect Q3 and Q4 to be at those same levels. Yes, Asiya, you're correct. I think when we idle capacity that does hurt the margins, especially if you're having less production than you're actually selling because you also take down inventory, which is, of course, what we did in Q2, in Q3. On the other side, though we did a lot of cost reduction efforts, and that ends up helping margins. And so, we ended up in Q2 with margins very similar to what we had in Q1 on a gross margin level and then on an operating margin level, of course, we did better than that. So, as we look forward, the key here is to increase sales and as we create more sales through our factories and more sales for OpEx structure, we'll see expansion in margins. I think from an overall standpoint, each of those items were roughly about a third of the reason for the outperformance. I mean clearly what happened the glass that we sell both the tablets and as far as we sell the notebook computers that have Gorilla Glass on them was very important to us. And we think it's a good example of the innovations that we have that cause us to perform better than the underlying market. And the semiconductor performance was also good. I mean, the demand for advanced chipsets really have made a difference there. And then from a glass standpoint, as we said, we -- as people get ready, as our customers get ready to introduce new products in the back half of the year, they of course, pull all those products early and we saw nice demand there too. I think from an overall standpoint, in the specialty side and the carrier market, I mean, it's certainly more than one or two customers, but it was very much driven in the carrier market and when you see our detailed numbers, you'll see that those were the numbers that were up on a sequential basis. In the enterprise market, it was a little bit more mixed, I think from a data center standpoint. That's where a lot of the labor constraint really showed up, I mean, in some data centers, less so than others. But I think that's one of the reasons that those sales were down on a quarter-over-quarter basis. But then also a lot of our enterprise customers are small and medium businesses, and also corporate spending. And we saw, those areas were clearly impacted by what's happening in the outside world. But there was a broad set, especially in the carrier business. Yes, I mean, it was very specifically a stealth project that we hadn't really talked a lot about externally, that had originally been initiated by a customer request. And if you recall on our 3, 4, 5 strategies, there's the 20% that's outside of 3, 4, 5 capabilities where we put our energy and efforts into. I mean, it's one of those projects in that 20% category. And of course, in this environment, it made sense for us to go back and look at that 20%. And so that's what we did. And, we ended up restructuring impairing some of those assets. Yeah. And I think from an overall standpoint, I mean, Wendell is right, I mean, we're in a period of time where our free cash flow conversion is going to be strong because we're not doing the investment capital that we've done the last several years and so either on any given line item on the cash flow statement, there's a variety of things that happened on a month in and month out standpoint. But we're committed and we're going to deliver free cash flow for the year. And, that's what our focus is. And we're thrilled with our performance in the second quarter. I think it really helps investors understand our ability to generate that free cash flow. Yeah, I think the way to think about it Wamsi is, as we spend this money, this gets reversed. And so we just get it added out into our statements I mean, most of it is for capacity and most of it is in CapEx, but there's also some operating expenses and they'll get reimbursed there too. I mean, clearly what we've done in the second quarter is reduce our operating costs. And that will be reflected as we get into Q3 and Q4. From our overall standpoint, as we've talked about before, our real focus area is to get back to growing our sales and growing our profitability. And when our sales grow, we expect to see improved profitability too. Mehdi, at the top of my head, I'm drawing a blank on that, that's clearly where a lot of the growth is going, to give example, almost 40% on a year-over-year basis. But when we have our follow up call, we'll get to the answer of that. Thanks."

It is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, Tania, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. I would like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures; unless we specifically indicate our comments are related to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now, I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported first quarter 2020 results. Sales were $2.5 billion, net income was $177 million, and EPS was $0.20. We accomplished much of what we set out to do in the quarter, despite the evolving health crisis and its impact on the global economy. That said, the situation is creating uncertainty in our sales. As a result, we are adjusting our operating plan to reduce cost and capital spending. We are committed to preserving the financial strength of the company. We have essentially no debt coming due over the next two years, and we expect to maintain a strong cash balance and generate positive free cash flow for the year. We also plan to maintain our dividend. Because of the heightened uncertainty, we will not be providing our normal guidance at this time. We are all confronting profound challenges as a result of COVID-19. Our thoughts are with those directly affected by the pandemic and the many people fighting it on the front lines. Our company has been facing this human health crisis head on since day one. The first cases of the disease to draw attention from medical officials and the media occurred in Wuhan, where Corning is opening a display plant. Responding to these early cases in Wuhan and Greater China put us to the test, and we rose to the challenge. Our core teams in our factories gave their all. They kept our people safe and delivered on customer commitments. Our experience at the start of the outbreak informed the blueprint deployed in all our facilities as the virus spread across the globe. All Corning sites maintain comprehensive preparedness plans and are operating under our best practices playbook. From China to South Korea, Italy, India, the U.S., the challenges are unique in each location, but our actions have been compassionate, systematic, and based on facts and experience. So what does this response tell you about Corning? Even in periods of uncertainty, we are certain that we'll protect and support our employees and our communities, we'll deliver for our customers, and we'll preserve our financial strength to sustain excellent stewardship on behalf of all of our stakeholders. Beginning with SARS, Corning has designed procedures to keep our employees safe during pandemics. From the start of the outbreak, we've been ahead of the curve, safeguarding our people and workplaces according to the very highest standards, and we support our communities. We're launching Unity Campaigns in partnership with local business owners, medical professionals, food banks, and other human services organizations in all of the communities where we operate. Together, we're supplying basic needs, aiding vulnerable populations, and easing burdens caused by the crisis. From upstate New York to India, Corning is supporting hunger relief and helping secure essential food supplies for people undergoing lockdowns and other disruptions. We donated 150,000 surgical masks to regional hospitals in New York, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Virginia. We stepped forward with pharmaceutical glass packaging to meet surge capacity, and we've accelerated the commercialization of Valor to assist in developing vaccines and other treatments. In Italy, we coordinated the donation of laboratory supplies to mitigate the impact on medical supply networks. And in China, we supported production of antiviral sprays with our advanced flow reactors. We also donated Corning Guardiant antimicrobial particles for an antiviral paint, which was specially produced and deployed for frontline hospital use in the Wuhan area. We are now working with regulatory agencies to seek approval for other applications in other geographies. Corning is in this critical human health fight. We're doing our best to make a difference wherever we are with what we have to contribute. The same resolve applies to our customer commitments. We've maintained our operational excellence throughout the crisis, and we continue to meet or exceed customer expectations in this difficult operating environment. To share a recent example, customers in China needed to produce antimicrobial sprays to combat the spread of the virus. They urgently needed use of our advanced flow reactor product. We knew our technology and the global supply chain system could make a difference. So our teams executed within days on a project that normally would take weeks to design, make, ship, and deploy production scale systems. We're rising to the call in similar ways around the world. We're also committed to preserving the financial strength of the company. To that end, we are adjusting our operating plans to reduce cost and capital spending, all while meeting our customer commitments. We have essentially no debt due over the next two years. We ended the first quarter with $2 billion of cash. We expect to maintain a strong cash balance and generate positive free cash flow for the year. We plan to maintain our current dividend. I want to take a moment to talk about our strong balance sheet. In addition to $2 billion of cash, we have a debt structure that is conservative by design and relatively unique. It is built for times like these. We deliberately issued debt with 30-year, 50-year, and even 60-year maturities so that there is very little debt due in any given year and the total maturity is spread out over a very long time. Today, our average debt maturity is about 25 years, the longest in the S&P 500. Over the next two years, we have under $70 million of debt coming due. Less than half of our total debt is due within the next 20 years, and during this time, there is no single year with debt repayments over $500 million. Investors often evaluate credit and financial health based on total debt to EBITDA. For the S&P 500, the average company has a weighted average debt maturity of roughly 10 years, and more than 80% of debt is due within 20 years. Consequently, when investors calculate debt to EBITDA, they are implicitly focusing mostly on debt due in the next 20 years. Corning's 20-year debt to EBITDA is 1.1, consistent with an A credit rating and illustrative of the conservatism of our balance sheet. In sum, we have a very strong balance sheet, and we have the financial resources needed for the duration of the economic slowdown. We don't know how deep it will be or how long it will last, but we are financially strong coming into it, and we're going to come out of it even stronger and ready to return to growth. Let's turn to our long-term growth drivers, which remain intact. In fact, some of the secular trends could accelerate as consumer lifestyles continue to adapt to the drastic circumstances being experienced across the globe. A world of physical distancing and remote work requires expanded network capacity and sophisticated communication solutions. Reduced fine particulate pollution appears to be helpful for reducing infection rates. Drug discovery and safe widespread delivery of vaccines are among societies' top priorities. All these needs fall directly within our mission of improving lives through innovation, and Corning is ideally positioned to contribute. Many of the lifestyle changes we're adjusting to today will not be temporary, and our products and technologies across our market access platforms are more important than ever. Of course, the thing [ph] continues to come in, and we're busy on all fronts, assessing and collecting information on what exactly the new normal will be. Looking at optical communications, bandwidth demand is surging. Let's start with usage reports published over the last two months. At one major carrier, Wi-Fi calling has increased almost 90%. Collaboration tool usage is up almost 90% at another. And one cable TV company reported that voice over IP and video conferencing traffic increased 228% since March 1. A major social media company said live streams were up 50% and group video calls were up 70%. A popular cloud video conference service reported that they spiked from 10 million users in December to 300 million in April. For a long time now, our personal technology has been intrinsic to our day-to-day experience. We take it wherever we go. With social distancing, that technology has become where we go to work, learn, and connect. All of these points to the need for continuously scaling network capacity and making investments in technologies like 5G, fiber-to-the-home, and cloud computing. And our physical distancing and remote living is being mediated through displays on TVs, laptops, and mobile consumer electronics. Corning's industry-leading glasses are essential for displays and touch interfaces. Turning to our automotive market, our clean air technologies have captured or neutralized billions of tons of pollutants over the past four decades, and helped billions of people breathe easier. Today's health crisis is heightening the importance of this Corning technology. A study by the Harvard School of Public Health connects fine particulate air pollution with higher death rates from COVID-19 in the U.S. The researchers stated that their study results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. Many countries around the world have regulations to address fine particulate emissions from mobile sources, and Corning's technology is an essential part of the solution. Corning's diesel particulate filters have been used for many years to remove particles from diesel exhaust. More recently, Corning introduced gasoline particulate filters, GPFs, to cut down on particulates from gasoline exhausts, while enabling the most efficient use of fuel and horsepower. As the Harvard study reinforces, a body of research ties dirty air to illness, including the most severe COVID-19 outcomes, and makes our solutions more relevant than ever. There are also multiple ways we've mobilized our innovation capabilities to combat the pandemic more directly. Consider our Valor Glass. There is a worldwide shortage of pharmaceutical glass packaging, and vaccine fill, finish capacity is limited. We need successful COVID vaccines, and we need next-generation pharmaceutical packaging and processes to produce and protect them. We believe Corning Valor Glass is the answer. In addition to offering a safer package, we believe that the faster filling line speeds, enabled by our Valor technology, are particularly critical for a pandemic response when every hour counts and every extra dose delivered makes a difference. Valor Glass vials are being used for COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials right now. We're also supporting several other leading companies developing treatments for the disease. Our support includes Valor, other Corning life science products, and technical support to accelerate solutions and ensure availability across the globe. We're supplying our traditional lab products for both RNA and antibody testing to combat the spread of the coronavirus, and we're exploring applying our technology in other ways. For example, using our advanced flow reactors to scale production of small molecule antivirals to treat the virus, GPF substrates for fixed systems that remove fine particles from outdoor air to reduce disease transmission, and Guardiant to create smart surfaces that kill coronavirus before it infects people. Overall, we're confident we can make significant contributions as the world addresses and recovers from these challenges. And as we've recently announced, we're taking the next organizational steps to tap the full power of our potential. We're centering operations around our market access platforms, positioning Corning to become even more relevant in our markets. We're working to capture more customer insights, further leverage our distribution channels, and open up new opportunities for innovation with industry leaders, who already trust us deeply and appreciate our unique set of capabilities. The new organization comes with a new generation of leaders, moving us steadily forward as we pursue our next 169 years of life-changing innovation. We've also established a new leadership position that will drive operational excellence and appointed Eric Musser, President and Chief Operating Officer. Eric's a Corning veteran with a strong track record for leadership and execution. He will enhance process consistency and ensure we hit our targets across the company. Before turning it over to Tony, I'll close with a final thought. Corning is no stranger to difficult times. Across three centuries, we've tackled some of our customers' toughest problems by creating some of the most consequential material inventions in history. We've navigated two world wars, natural disasters, and economic catastrophes. Our job, as always, is to rise to the challenge of today and lead. We're keeping our company strong. We're innovating on some of the most pressing problems of the moment. And we're built to last, regardless of the duration of the current crisis. Our people are dedicated. Our resolve is total. Our capabilities are more relevant than ever. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony for more details.\nTony Tripeny: Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As Wendell said, our results for the first quarter were solid, given the significant changes in market conditions in most of the industries we serve. Because we are in a period of uncertainty, our sales are hard to predict. Therefore, we are withdrawing our full-year 2020 guidance. My remarks today will give you a sense of what we're seeing in each of our businesses and a summary of the actions we're taking to address the situation. Now, before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results is associated with non-cash charges related to capacity realignment and cash severance payments. Other differences between our GAAP and core results come from a non-cash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this resulted in a $50 million GAAP earnings gain in the quarter. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flows, our ability to invest for growth, and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than five years ago. Now, shifting to results, first quarter sales were $2.5 billion, net income was $177 million, and EPS was $0.20. In display technologies, first quarter sales were $751 million and net income was $152 million. Display glass market first quarter volume grew by a low-single digit percentage sequentially, and Corning's volume was down a low-single digit percentage, both as expected. Sequential price declines were moderate, also as expected. Stay-at-home policies in multiple economies, starting in China, impacted end market demand for televisions in Q1. As a result, preliminary Q1 worldwide TV sell-through units are reported to be down low-single digits year-over-year. Now, for Q2, early data indicate TV sell-through units could decline more than in Q1. Weak TV demand will likely be partially offset by pockets of strength for some IT products. Now, based on our experience in prior economic events, we expect TV demand to recover to its longer-term growth trajectory as the economy recovers. In addition, we expect increasing screen size to drive continued growth in glass demand. How the full year plays out for glass demand and retail will depend on the duration of stay-at-home policies and the health of global economies throughout the year. Now, China is the first major economy to experience the shutdown and reopen cycle, and we'll be watching its TV retail demand recovery closely in the upcoming months. Although demand declined year-over-year in the first quarter, it is encouraging to note that China TV sell-through in March increased by over 50% versus February. We are adjusting our production levels to a lower level of demand. As you may have seen reported in the news recently, Samsung Display is accelerating their exit plans for LCD panel manufacturing. While this is happening faster than we originally expected, the fundamental shift from Korea to China is not a surprise to us. We have been working closely with Samsung as we move through this transition, and we are well prepared. As panel makers shift from Korea, our three Chinese Gen 10.5 plants position us well. Ultimately, end market demand drives glass demand. And with retail area growth primarily driven by large TVs, which are most efficiently manufactured on Gen 10.5 fabs, we will capture the majority of that growth. We expect temporary impact on our volume relative to the market, driven by specific timing of Samsung Display's exit, versus the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plants. Our Korea operation is a low-cost manufacturing organization that we will use to serve our global customer base. Finally, we continue to expect display pricing to decline by a mid-single digit percentage in 2020. We believe that three factors continue to drive the favorable glass-pricing environment we've been experiencing. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced to demand. For Corning, we are aligning our capacity with demand. We are also pacing our Gen 10.5 capital projects to align with panel makers' schedules. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support the acceptable returns on those investments. In optical communications, first quarter sales were $791 million. As Wendell said, long-term growth drivers are intact. We are seeing positive statement from telecom operators regarding network constraints, increased demand for bandwidth, and continued investment in 5G and data centers. But we are also seeing negative impact, as carriers and enterprise customers face site access, health and safety concerns, supply chain interruptions, and cash constraints. The business continues to adjust its cost structure and align capacity to match near-term sales. Environmental technologies first quarter sales were $320 million, and net income was $35 million. Sales were down 12% year-over-year, and below our expectations of up mid-single digits, as car and truck manufacturers implemented shutdowns in key markets. Profitability was impacted by the lower volume. We believe the economic impact on the auto industry will be significant, especially over the next two quarters to three quarters. Auto assembly plants are beginning to resume operations, with China starting to run, Europe beginning to open back up, and North America expected to reopen soon. How the recovery will play out for our business will ultimately depend on global car sales. In diesel, we anticipated a cyclical decline in North America heavy-duty truck market from its peak in 2018 and 2019. We now anticipate that decline will be even faster and steeper. Global demand was down 25% in Q1. Now, despite the impact we are experiencing, we expect our full-year sales to be less significantly impacted than the overall market, and we remain confident in our content-driven growth strategies. OEMs continue to adopt gasoline particulate filters in Europe and China, and emerging market heavy-duty regulations are driving adoption of more advanced products. As markets recover and improve, we expect to resume our growth trajectory. Specialty materials sales were $352 million, up 14% year-over-year versus our expectations of a mid-single digit increase. Net income of $51 million was also up year-over-year. We exceeded expectations due to strong sales of premium glasses, other Gorilla Glass innovations, and advanced optics products. We expect the global economic slowdown to reduce smartphone sales. In the first quarter, units were down 19%, as store closures and stay-at-home restrictions, particularly in China, impacted phone sales. Social distancing policies are now underway in many countries, so we expect these lower end market demand levels to continue in the second quarter. As countries begin to emerge from lockdowns, we expect to see increasing end market demand. Looking ahead, we expect our outperformance relative to the 2020 mobile consumer electronic market to come from further advancements and adoption of our premium glasses and our other innovations. In Life Sciences, first quarter sales were up 6% year-over-year to $258 million. Net income was $38 million. Life Sciences is being impacted by the prolonged closure of non-essential laboratories. However, this is somewhat offset by increased demand for consumables used in COVID-19 testing applications. As Wendell said, we are confident in the opportunities ahead for Life Sciences and Valor, especially as we prepare for upcoming vaccine demand. So, that is what we are seeing in each of our businesses. Clearly, the world and our outlooks have changed significantly. Anticipating lower sales, we are aggressively adjusting our operating plan and taking actions that will maintain our financial strength and result in positive free cash flow for the full year. We initiated actions in Q1 and we will continue in Q2. These actions fall into several broad categories: reducing production levels across all of our businesses, adjusting operating expenses with the majority of the savings realized in the second half, modifying inventory plans, and reducing capital expenditures. Our actions impacted gross margins in Q1, and we expect additional impact in Q2. Gross margin in the first quarter was 33.4% and below our expectations, driven by lower-than-expected volume in Environmental and the impact of lowering production across several businesses. Most of our businesses have high fixed costs. In fact, more than half of our manufacturing costs are fixed, and a significant portion of that is non-cash depreciation. This results in very high operating leverage. However, in times when volumes are dropping, our fixed costs do not change and the impact on our margins is significant. The impact is more dramatic when we are lowering inventory. In Q2, we will be further ramping down production and bringing down inventory. Therefore, we expect the Q2 gross margin percentage to be lower than Q1. So, our factory utilizations are low today. On the other hand, the capital is in place when sales growth returns. When this happens, gross margins will expand. Let's move to the balance sheet and our commitment to strong financial stewardship. We have under $70 million in debt due over the next two years and no year with more than $500 million due over the next 20 years. Our 20-year debt to EBIT ratio is 1.1 times, and that's outstanding. We expect to maintain a strong cash position and to maintain our dividend. As I previously mentioned, we expect to generate positive free cash flow for the year. We have paused share buybacks and do not expect to add material debt in 2020. To wrap up, we expect that continued economic uncertainty and related end-market weakness will affect most of our businesses. The current situation poses many unknowns for people, for families, for companies and for governments. What we know at Corning is that our underlying market drivers are intact and that we fully expect to return - to resume growth. And when the expected growth resumes, most of the capital is already in place. We're operating on the strong financial foundation we built under the strategy and capital allocation framework. And we're adjusting our operating plan and taking actions to position ourselves to come out of this slowdown even stronger. We certainly look forward to the end of this health crisis and the related hardships being experienced by so many people around the world. Until then, our priorities focus on Corning's stakeholders, as we maintain disciplined stewardship that will steer us back to growing sales and profitability. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, Tony. Okay, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Rod.\nRod Hall: Yes, hi guys. Thanks for the question. And let me just say, our thoughts are with you guys. It's difficult to run a business in an environment like this. So, let me start off, I guess, with one for Wendell, and then I'll jump on to one for Tony or Wendell, whoever wants to answer it. Wendell, there is an increased amount of discussion of onshoring. And I know there's been some movement toward potentially producing displays in the US. I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on where that debate is right now and how Corning's costs look in an onshoring environment? Would you need additional capital? I guess you might look to the governor for that etc. Just whatever color you can give in terms of your thinking there. And then, my second question relates to inventory and what you guys think is going on with both display and smartphone component inventory. Are people - we've heard that there is some inventory build out in the channel. Maybe if people worry that production would be affected on through the year by this and so on. So just curious what's going on with inventory levels out there? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Okay. Well, first, Rod, thank you for your thoughts. With regards to onshoring, sort of - I think the priority set with policymakers is going to start with life science products. What they're trying to address is that a huge number of the active pharmaceutical ingredients that we use to preserve human health are manufactured overseas, often starting in China and India; so one of their top priorities is that as we seek to confront this particular health crisis that we build that infrastructure in the US. That is what you heard me talk about in my opening and it's where Valor begins to play a very large role, more to come on that topic. Next, in order would be the other critical parts of infrastructure. Of course, you have defense, which often - which already has significant onshoring implications to it, as does aerospace. But telecom is now increasingly becoming an issue. We already are built because of our value set to support all of our different customers regionally. I think display and consumer electronics will tend to fall relatively low on our societies around the world's priority list for critical infrastructure that governments want to control in their country or in to a particular trading block. So that's my current point of view on it. Of course, it's political. So, that is always subject to change as opposed to necessarily logic. Does that make sense, Rod?\nRod Hall: Yes, that's great, Wendell. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: On the inventory question, whenever you have situations where different elements of the supply chain can be shut down at different times, it makes calculation of value chain inventory quite challenging. So, what we do instead is, we're looking directly to the end market, Rod. And then, we're trying to use that to guide our internal operational thoughts around what we expect revenue will be in total for the year. And then, so to just work out the math that's in between. I'll be interested when you publish on your own thoughts around smartphone demand. You've been relatively accurate in the past.\nRod Hall: Great. Okay, thanks. And do you think, Wendell, there's anything to this idea that maybe people have built up more inventory in the channel, just thinking that they can't count on supply necessarily? Or do you think that's probably not such a big issue?\nWendell Weeks: Well, for sure, they're doing the behavior that you\u2019re noticing. You see it in our numbers, Rod. You see the very strong revenue growth in our Gorilla business, right? And throughout this time period, we've been having very strong requests from our customers. But what you would have heard from us is that we'd say we wouldn't take a look directly at our revenues as being the most accurate view of what's going to happen in the end market. So I think without doubt that's happening. How big a deal it is totally depends on what happens as people emerge from shelter-in-place. For that, what we're looking to is what's happening in China. Because they are now earliest to sort of return. There's other countries like that throughout Asia where we're going to look at what's happening in those markets and use that to inform what it is we think will happen as other regions open up. So, without doubt, you're noticing something that is a true thing. How much of a problem is really the key thing to solve is what happens to demand?\nRod Hall: Great. Okay, thank you, Wendell.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. I just wanted to touch the display business a little bit. You mentioned the move from Korea to China and some potential disruptions as that happens in the 10.5 G plants' ramp. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the magnitude and the time frame for that period of this - maybe second related to that, once we're kind of much more China based in this part of the market, what do you think kind of the pricing or margin implications of this move will be and market share longer term as the supply chain moves more into the China business? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: I'll take the start of it and then Tony can add. So, with the shift from the Korean peninsula to China, as you heard from Tony, this was something we were anticipating. It's just happening faster than what we originally anticipated. So, what the interaction with our revenues will be is how fast the Korean peninsula turns down versus how rapidly the Gen 10.5 plants come up and in what order. Our current point of view is that it will play itself out so that we'll feel the pain this year as Korea will tune down a little faster given COVID-19 than our Gen 10.5 plants will come up. But then, we'll have a strong gain next year. In total, what will drive this thing is what happens to television demand, of course, right? But given that that plays out how we would expect, I think that will be the pattern of how it will play out in our numbers; a little bit of pain this year and a strong gain next year.\nTony Tripeny: And the only thing I would add to that is that essentially, you saw some of that happen in Q1 where the market sequentially grew a little bit and we were down a little bit, and that's really the explanation there. Not a surprise, it's as we guided. But it's a good example of what Wendell is - it's a good example of seeing what - playing out what Wendell just described.\nWendell Weeks: Did that address your question, Tim? Or did you have an additional one?\nTim Long: Yes, that's it. And just maybe if you can just - kind of the overall ASP dynamic will be once we're more China-based than Korea-based?\nTony Tripeny: I think from an ASP standpoint, we are very confident in our strategy that we have talked about in the past in terms of our price declines being moderate. This is already a global pricing market, and we've - for the three reasons that I mentioned and that really are - we still feel confident. And we don't think there's really a change relative to this shift.\nWendell Weeks: And if you're asking a more subtle question about generational mix pricing, I think that's a very astute question. And we like Gen 10.5, but I wouldn't let it overwhelm my analysis at this point. What I would really focus on is, what's going to happen with television demand in this economic and health cycle. If we get that right, then I think the business is going to continue to age gracefully and we'll continue to like it from a profitability and cash generation standpoint.\nTim Long: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Wendell, when you did the SCP transaction back in 2013, there was a long-term supply agreement that was struck between Corning and Samsung. What is the impact of the long-term supply agreement that you have with Samsung as Samsung winds down its LCD operations? And Tony, maybe any update on Samsung's intent on handling the convertible stock? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Why don't you start, and then I'll do the next on the convert? Or do you want me to do both?\nTony Tripeny: Go ahead.\nWendell Weeks: So, we have no new information on the convert. In my previous discussions with people who run Samsung, right from the very beginning, what they believed in was they have a deep understanding of our technology road map and they believe that in that road map and they want to be a long-term holder. We have had nothing that would change that. It didn't drive their investment, and it originally was display technology. It was the totality of the technology portfolio. And what they thought even was coming next for displays. Now, to the purchase, first on the long-term supply agreement, of course, it changes the - who do we sell our glass to, if they shut down their LCD plants in - or LCD panel making plants in Korea. And you'll see some of that in our financials. I think we had a write-off of about $100 million something.\nTim Long: Yes, that's right. If you look at our reconciliation from GAAP to core, there was about $105 million and that was - asset that was set up when we first did the transaction that was being amortized over the length of the contract. And so, that was written off in the quarter.\nWendell Weeks: If we take a look at the deal overall, sort of depending on how you would address what the original purchase price was and some of the original balance sheet moves, basically our acquisition of SCP, the entity now known as Corning Precision Materials, has already paid itself back two times or three times. So we feel really good about that transaction. I think where we're now - I think the key thing to focus on what Samsung is doing, because we've seen some reports that people don't totally understand what Samsung's plans are in the display area, so perhaps I can take a moment and discuss those. Basically, what they're exiting is just the manufacturing of LCD panels. They remain very dedicated to LCD TV. The problem they faced was simple, and it was accentuated by COVID-19 and the challenges that provides to the economy, which is, they have a lack of competitive cost position versus the Chinese Gen 10.5 plants, built with Chinese subsidized capital. So basically, it became - it's cheaper for them to source those panels rather than make them in Korea. It's not much more complicated than that. Instead, what they're going to turn their Korean resources towards is next-generation television and display technologies. You saw some of those recently be introduced at last Consumer Electronics, a Zero Bezel LCD TV that actually uses three pieces of glass; a quantum OLED TV, which combines quantum dot and OLED technology, which is a two-piece glass technology; micro LED technology, once again with some of our advanced glass technologies will be used; and continued emphasis on the polyimide OLED built on our glass substrates. So, our deep relationship with Samsung on display technology continues, in some ways accelerates. And we just have to follow their panel sourcing as it works its way around the globe. Was that helpful, sir?\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, it is, Wendell. And just to follow up on Tony's comment on the $105 million in the quarter, you view that as a one-time or is there going to be additional impact in the subsequent quarters on that particular element? Thank you.\nTony Tripeny: No, that's just one time.\nWamsi Mohan: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I have two questions. First of all, Wendell, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times antimicrobial coatings that are now being used. It sounds like more so, given some of the health crisis issues. Can you just give us a little more of a tutorial on the opportunities for that to be used as a surface coating in hospitals and other places? I think you've talked about that in the past. And then you mentioned sprays as well, and I'm not quite sure I understood that part. And then, I have a quick follow-up.\nWendell Weeks: Okay. What we call our Guardiant technology, which I think is what you're talking about, Steve, is we developed a number of years ago because we saw folks going into hospitals and basically getting sicker than what they came in with because of infections arising from viruses, bacterias, and spores. So what Guardiant is, is our answer to that. It is a copper-based solution where we capture a particular ionic state of copper in glass ceramic that we then turn into very small particles that can be used in paints, coatings, potentially fabrics, right, and plastics. So, what we are seeking to do with that is do two things at once. One, provide good antimicrobial and antiviral surfaces, but also because of the particular way in which this ionic form of copper kills, prevent the development of any form of superbugs. Now, as you would imagine, the introduction of such a technology needs to go through a number of regulatory barriers. We are approved for use under the EPA as an antifungal right now, but we're going to have to work our way through various regulatory agencies to be able to effectively make the claim that we can kill these coronaviruses. We are quite confident we can. Now, for countries who felt that very pressing health need like China in the Wuhan area, they leapt on the opportunity for us to be able to provide this to help in those new hospitals that they built. And we're just going to work our way through all the various regulatory agencies accordingly. Also in China, they had a sudden need for sprays, antiviral sprays. Now, things that they use in these sprays, they want to be - they tend to be a chemical production. We have a particularly modular, small, super safe way to produce those type products called advanced flow reactors that we manufacture in China. And so, that was the example that we talked about there. In general, as we look at what are the pressing needs for us all as a society to get a handle on this and potentially future pandemics, vaccinations are important, therefore pharmaceutical packaging. We believe smart surfaces make a lot of sense, and we're continuing to use our core technology to solve that problem. And then as well, there'll be all sorts of treatments and/or protective spray. When that happens, that could use some of our production capabilities that we have built for life sciences and also for small molecule chemistry, sir.\nSteven Fox: That's really helpful. And then, just as a quick follow-up, Tony, you guys are withdrawing guidance, which obviously makes sense here. But you sounded confident about generating positive free cash flows for the year. Can you just sort of give us some sense for how we get to positive free cash flows given Q1 cash flows were negative? Thanks.\nTony Tripeny: Sure. I mean, we're really focused on four areas of improvement; both in terms of from a cost standpoint and a lowering capital spending standpoint. And you know, that includes our cost at our manufacturing operations, but it also includes our operating expenses. And then, in addition to that, we're re-looking at our working capital, in particular, our inventory plans, and we're planning to also reduce that. So, when you add those four things together, that gives me pretty good confidence that we will be able to generate positive free cash flow for the year.\nSteven Fox: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please, go ahead.\nAsiya Merchant: Great, thank you. And thank you for the opportunity. Just a quick question, the near-term spending by carriers and enterprises is obviously cloudy. But as we come out of the pandemic, do you see any structural changes in demand for 5G spend from the carriers relative to where it was pre the pandemic; where a lot of carriers seemed to be burdened with debts and certain capital allocation plans, etcetera? So, as we come out of that, are there any structural changes in demand that you're seeing for 5G spend from the carriers? And then, I just have another quick follow-up on free cash flow for Tony. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: So Asiya, the way I would - A) it's early, okay. And you're seeing a number of things come up in the data, but it's too early to make any sort of conclusive statements. That being said, in general, what we're seeing - and then I'll get specific on 5G - in general, what we're seeing is, the way telecommunications companies work is because it's capital good, they build ahead of perceived demand. Depending on the company, they use different algorithms for how they figure it out but in general, they try to be about 18 months ahead of where they think demand will be. And that's the reason that the telecom network has held up pretty well as we face this surge in traffic, is - they basically went through that excess that they carry to prepare for the next 18 months. So, in general, what we're hearing from our customers is, assuming the human health crisis comes under management, that they believe they will continue to invest pretty strongly in infrastructure so that they can make sure that they re-establish that safety net. The real question is; what's baseline? Are we on a new baseline? If we're on a new baseline, then everybody's plans aren't aggressive enough. So, then it's more than just the catch-up of the period you went through, it's too early to tell that. On 5G, that will just be part of the overall mosaic of network solutions that gets played. If someone's primarily technological thrust was 5G, witness the major carriers that you can name, they will press on the accelerator for that. Now, I think one of the most interesting things that I've seen in terms of innovation because we were working super closely with them during this time, is their ability to do even things like fiber-to-the-home installations without going inside people's homes; it's been a tremendous amount of innovation around being able to do that, and I've been quite impressed with their installation teams and what they've done. So, I'm looking at this overall as reinforcing to us all how important telecommunications infrastructure is, but I don't know and I don't think it will trump various financial constraints that some carriers feel. But without doubt, it's made people believe that they need to have infrastructure.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you. And then, Tony, on the cash flow, I think you mentioned obviously positive free cash flow. And if I heard you correct, no new or no material debt raise to support your dividends. I just wanted to clarify that, given your dividend and sort of positive free cash flow generation expectations for the year that we wouldn't be raising any debt to support these dividends for the remainder of the year. Thank you.\nTony Tripeny: Yes, that's correct. I'm always interested in opportunities to take advantage of different markets that we participate in, like in China. And as you - when you see the cash flow statement, you'll see we raised a little bit of debt in China, which is great because it's a natural hedge for all of our businesses in China. And if I could raise more money in Japan, I would at least take a look at that. But we don't really - that - we don't - we are not counting on that on a going-forward basis in the projections that I gave.\nAsiya Merchant: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. On Optical, you noted the installation challenges with the telco customers. But just, what have you seen from kind of your cloud or hyperscale customers as far as order continuity and was there any upside there? And then, maybe second question, just - I would expect most of your facilities are being the central businesses, but just given the adaptations to production, are there any areas of the business where you're concerned about production continuity or supply constraints? That's it. Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Hi, Meta. So, on cloud, they're in a little bit different situation, in some ways similar, in some ways different than the telecom carriers. And different ones are playing different ways. Like telecom carriers, they try to be able to hold enough capacity to handle peak demands. So - and there has been an enormous surge of cloud usage here, and that is being absorbed up. At the same time, those are enclosed facilities, and some of the cloud carriers have decided to basically go on lockdown and not allow new materials to come in or installation crews to come in. So, that has provided some downward momentum, just like it's done in some of the carriers giving installation pieces. I think in general, we would anticipate as - around the globe, and we're seeing it - as those rules relax, as the human health crisis feels like it's under more management, then we'll see some of that return to normal order patterns. I think in telecom, the area where it is most difficult to figure out how it will play out will be the impact on small and medium businesses and their particular LAN networks and what demand they need for that. I think all that's ahead of us. But for base cloud and telecom, they're seeing the reinforcement of their business model, and everyone that I talked to, at least, continues to believe that we need for long-term investment. So far, we've been able to maintain our business community - our business continuity at an outstanding level and have managed to do that and delight our customers. It will continue to be something that we - that garners a lot of our attention because as they do things like restart automotive plants, we're experiencing worlds where - situations that there's not a lot of experience in. I mean, restarting economies and whole plants and knowing what the safe return to work, this is going to continue to challenge supply chains. So, so far so good, but historical performance does not necessarily guarantee future performance here.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please, go ahead.\nJoseph Cardoso: Thank you for the question, guys. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik Chatterjee. Just one question for me. As for your operating plans, you highlighted reducing capital expenditures. Could you remind me of your maintenance CapEx level and whether you guys think this type of macro backdrop calls for Corning to operate close to those levels?\nTony Tripeny: Well, from a maintenance CapEx standpoint, somewhere in the $800 million to $1 billion range, I think as we look at our capital for the rest of the year, in Q1, we were finishing up a number of projects and that's why the capital was at the level it was. It will be a little bit less - somewhat less in Q2, and then in the back half of the year, will be less than that. So, we're seeing the trajectory from a capital spending standpoint to go down as we go through the year. And it is one of the four things that we're focused on in terms of making sure that we have positive operating cash flow this year.\nJoseph Cardoso: And if I could, just one follow-up. Relative to Samsung exiting the LCD manufacturing business, or panel business, do you guys have any indication relative to the cadence of the de-ramp by Samsung as we go through the year?\nWendell Weeks: Yes, we do. But it wouldn't be appropriate for me to share that.\nJoseph Cardoso: Okay, no problem. Can't blame you [ph]. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question\u2026\nAnn Nicholson: I think there is time for one. Yes, go ahead. I think this is the last one.\nOperator: Okay, great. Thank you. And the last question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please, go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. Wendell, I wanted to ask about the organizational changes you made. Maybe you could talk a bit more about what drove that, any changes that are being made in decision-making or customer relationships. Just provide a little bit more color on those shifts. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Shannon. Three things drove it. First, our portfolio work has been successful, serving our customer base with products and inventions from many of our different divisions. And it has been successful enough now that rather than just count on sort of the soft systems we've used to do something like auto, where we did our environmental products, now we're seeing adoption of our different glass products and potentially some of our advanced sensor products and some of our advanced display products. We have used that primarily in our soft systems to be - those customers know us well and to be able to bring together our capabilities; it's been successful enough now but instead we're going to start to put in hard systems in May, market access platform leaders [ph], which we fund, to be able to run that customer interface and our strategies to serve those platforms going forward. The second thing we sought to do was improve our operational excellence across an increasingly complicated global set of operations, and that's why we have named Eric as our COO. The third and final reason is, we have very talented next generation of leaders that we're able to push in more senior spots and get more experience, show their great leadership skills as they will be the ones that will carry us into the next 169 years.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you very much.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Shannon. Thank you, Wendell, and thank you all for joining us today. Before we close, I just wanted to let you know that we're going to attend the JP Morgan Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference on May 13, and Bank of America Global Technologies Conference on June 2. Both will be virtual conferences. Once again, thank you all for joining us. Operator, that concludes our call. Please, disconnect our lines.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported first quarter 2020 results. Sales were $2.5 billion, net income was $177 million, and EPS was $0.20. We accomplished much of what we set out to do in the quarter, despite the evolving health crisis and its impact on the global economy. That said, the situation is creating uncertainty in our sales. As a result, we are adjusting our operating plan to reduce cost and capital spending. We are committed to preserving the financial strength of the company. We have essentially no debt coming due over the next two years, and we expect to maintain a strong cash balance and generate positive free cash flow for the year. We also plan to maintain our dividend. Because of the heightened uncertainty, we will not be providing our normal guidance at this time. We are all confronting profound challenges as a result of COVID-19. Our thoughts are with those directly affected by the pandemic and the many people fighting it on the front lines. Our company has been facing this human health crisis head on since day one. The first cases of the disease to draw attention from medical officials and the media occurred in Wuhan, where Corning is opening a display plant. Responding to these early cases in Wuhan and Greater China put us to the test, and we rose to the challenge. Our core teams in our factories gave their all. They kept our people safe and delivered on customer commitments. Our experience at the start of the outbreak informed the blueprint deployed in all our facilities as the virus spread across the globe. All Corning sites maintain comprehensive preparedness plans and are operating under our best practices playbook. From China to South Korea, Italy, India, the U.S., the challenges are unique in each location, but our actions have been compassionate, systematic, and based on facts and experience. So what does this response tell you about Corning? Even in periods of uncertainty, we are certain that we'll protect and support our employees and our communities, we'll deliver for our customers, and we'll preserve our financial strength to sustain excellent stewardship on behalf of all of our stakeholders. Beginning with SARS, Corning has designed procedures to keep our employees safe during pandemics. From the start of the outbreak, we've been ahead of the curve, safeguarding our people and workplaces according to the very highest standards, and we support our communities. We're launching Unity Campaigns in partnership with local business owners, medical professionals, food banks, and other human services organizations in all of the communities where we operate. Together, we're supplying basic needs, aiding vulnerable populations, and easing burdens caused by the crisis. From upstate New York to India, Corning is supporting hunger relief and helping secure essential food supplies for people undergoing lockdowns and other disruptions. We donated 150,000 surgical masks to regional hospitals in New York, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Virginia. We stepped forward with pharmaceutical glass packaging to meet surge capacity, and we've accelerated the commercialization of Valor to assist in developing vaccines and other treatments. In Italy, we coordinated the donation of laboratory supplies to mitigate the impact on medical supply networks. And in China, we supported production of antiviral sprays with our advanced flow reactors. We also donated Corning Guardiant antimicrobial particles for an antiviral paint, which was specially produced and deployed for frontline hospital use in the Wuhan area. We are now working with regulatory agencies to seek approval for other applications in other geographies. Corning is in this critical human health fight. We're doing our best to make a difference wherever we are with what we have to contribute. The same resolve applies to our customer commitments. We've maintained our operational excellence throughout the crisis, and we continue to meet or exceed customer expectations in this difficult operating environment. To share a recent example, customers in China needed to produce antimicrobial sprays to combat the spread of the virus. They urgently needed use of our advanced flow reactor product. We knew our technology and the global supply chain system could make a difference. So our teams executed within days on a project that normally would take weeks to design, make, ship, and deploy production scale systems. We're rising to the call in similar ways around the world. We're also committed to preserving the financial strength of the company. To that end, we are adjusting our operating plans to reduce cost and capital spending, all while meeting our customer commitments. We have essentially no debt due over the next two years. We ended the first quarter with $2 billion of cash. We expect to maintain a strong cash balance and generate positive free cash flow for the year. We plan to maintain our current dividend. I want to take a moment to talk about our strong balance sheet. In addition to $2 billion of cash, we have a debt structure that is conservative by design and relatively unique. It is built for times like these. We deliberately issued debt with 30-year, 50-year, and even 60-year maturities so that there is very little debt due in any given year and the total maturity is spread out over a very long time. Today, our average debt maturity is about 25 years, the longest in the S&P 500. Over the next two years, we have under $70 million of debt coming due. Less than half of our total debt is due within the next 20 years, and during this time, there is no single year with debt repayments over $500 million. Investors often evaluate credit and financial health based on total debt to EBITDA. For the S&P 500, the average company has a weighted average debt maturity of roughly 10 years, and more than 80% of debt is due within 20 years. Consequently, when investors calculate debt to EBITDA, they are implicitly focusing mostly on debt due in the next 20 years. Corning's 20-year debt to EBITDA is 1.1, consistent with an A credit rating and illustrative of the conservatism of our balance sheet. In sum, we have a very strong balance sheet, and we have the financial resources needed for the duration of the economic slowdown. We don't know how deep it will be or how long it will last, but we are financially strong coming into it, and we're going to come out of it even stronger and ready to return to growth. Let's turn to our long-term growth drivers, which remain intact. In fact, some of the secular trends could accelerate as consumer lifestyles continue to adapt to the drastic circumstances being experienced across the globe. A world of physical distancing and remote work requires expanded network capacity and sophisticated communication solutions. Reduced fine particulate pollution appears to be helpful for reducing infection rates. Drug discovery and safe widespread delivery of vaccines are among societies' top priorities. All these needs fall directly within our mission of improving lives through innovation, and Corning is ideally positioned to contribute. Many of the lifestyle changes we're adjusting to today will not be temporary, and our products and technologies across our market access platforms are more important than ever. Of course, the thing [ph] continues to come in, and we're busy on all fronts, assessing and collecting information on what exactly the new normal will be. Looking at optical communications, bandwidth demand is surging. Let's start with usage reports published over the last two months. At one major carrier, Wi-Fi calling has increased almost 90%. Collaboration tool usage is up almost 90% at another. And one cable TV company reported that voice over IP and video conferencing traffic increased 228% since March 1. A major social media company said live streams were up 50% and group video calls were up 70%. A popular cloud video conference service reported that they spiked from 10 million users in December to 300 million in April. For a long time now, our personal technology has been intrinsic to our day-to-day experience. We take it wherever we go. With social distancing, that technology has become where we go to work, learn, and connect. All of these points to the need for continuously scaling network capacity and making investments in technologies like 5G, fiber-to-the-home, and cloud computing. And our physical distancing and remote living is being mediated through displays on TVs, laptops, and mobile consumer electronics. Corning's industry-leading glasses are essential for displays and touch interfaces. Turning to our automotive market, our clean air technologies have captured or neutralized billions of tons of pollutants over the past four decades, and helped billions of people breathe easier. Today's health crisis is heightening the importance of this Corning technology. A study by the Harvard School of Public Health connects fine particulate air pollution with higher death rates from COVID-19 in the U.S. The researchers stated that their study results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. Many countries around the world have regulations to address fine particulate emissions from mobile sources, and Corning's technology is an essential part of the solution. Corning's diesel particulate filters have been used for many years to remove particles from diesel exhaust. More recently, Corning introduced gasoline particulate filters, GPFs, to cut down on particulates from gasoline exhausts, while enabling the most efficient use of fuel and horsepower. As the Harvard study reinforces, a body of research ties dirty air to illness, including the most severe COVID-19 outcomes, and makes our solutions more relevant than ever. There are also multiple ways we've mobilized our innovation capabilities to combat the pandemic more directly. Consider our Valor Glass. There is a worldwide shortage of pharmaceutical glass packaging, and vaccine fill, finish capacity is limited. We need successful COVID vaccines, and we need next-generation pharmaceutical packaging and processes to produce and protect them. We believe Corning Valor Glass is the answer. In addition to offering a safer package, we believe that the faster filling line speeds, enabled by our Valor technology, are particularly critical for a pandemic response when every hour counts and every extra dose delivered makes a difference. Valor Glass vials are being used for COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials right now. We're also supporting several other leading companies developing treatments for the disease. Our support includes Valor, other Corning life science products, and technical support to accelerate solutions and ensure availability across the globe. We're supplying our traditional lab products for both RNA and antibody testing to combat the spread of the coronavirus, and we're exploring applying our technology in other ways. For example, using our advanced flow reactors to scale production of small molecule antivirals to treat the virus, GPF substrates for fixed systems that remove fine particles from outdoor air to reduce disease transmission, and Guardiant to create smart surfaces that kill coronavirus before it infects people. Overall, we're confident we can make significant contributions as the world addresses and recovers from these challenges. And as we've recently announced, we're taking the next organizational steps to tap the full power of our potential. We're centering operations around our market access platforms, positioning Corning to become even more relevant in our markets. We're working to capture more customer insights, further leverage our distribution channels, and open up new opportunities for innovation with industry leaders, who already trust us deeply and appreciate our unique set of capabilities. The new organization comes with a new generation of leaders, moving us steadily forward as we pursue our next 169 years of life-changing innovation. We've also established a new leadership position that will drive operational excellence and appointed Eric Musser, President and Chief Operating Officer. Eric's a Corning veteran with a strong track record for leadership and execution. He will enhance process consistency and ensure we hit our targets across the company. Before turning it over to Tony, I'll close with a final thought. Corning is no stranger to difficult times. Across three centuries, we've tackled some of our customers' toughest problems by creating some of the most consequential material inventions in history. We've navigated two world wars, natural disasters, and economic catastrophes. Our job, as always, is to rise to the challenge of today and lead. We're keeping our company strong. We're innovating on some of the most pressing problems of the moment. And we're built to last, regardless of the duration of the current crisis. Our people are dedicated. Our resolve is total. Our capabilities are more relevant than ever. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony for more details. Okay. Well, first, Rod, thank you for your thoughts. With regards to onshoring, sort of - I think the priority set with policymakers is going to start with life science products. What they're trying to address is that a huge number of the active pharmaceutical ingredients that we use to preserve human health are manufactured overseas, often starting in China and India; so one of their top priorities is that as we seek to confront this particular health crisis that we build that infrastructure in the US. That is what you heard me talk about in my opening and it's where Valor begins to play a very large role, more to come on that topic. Next, in order would be the other critical parts of infrastructure. Of course, you have defense, which often - which already has significant onshoring implications to it, as does aerospace. But telecom is now increasingly becoming an issue. We already are built because of our value set to support all of our different customers regionally. I think display and consumer electronics will tend to fall relatively low on our societies around the world's priority list for critical infrastructure that governments want to control in their country or in to a particular trading block. So that's my current point of view on it. Of course, it's political. So, that is always subject to change as opposed to necessarily logic. Does that make sense, Rod? On the inventory question, whenever you have situations where different elements of the supply chain can be shut down at different times, it makes calculation of value chain inventory quite challenging. So, what we do instead is, we're looking directly to the end market, Rod. And then, we're trying to use that to guide our internal operational thoughts around what we expect revenue will be in total for the year. And then, so to just work out the math that's in between. I'll be interested when you publish on your own thoughts around smartphone demand. You've been relatively accurate in the past. Well, for sure, they're doing the behavior that you're noticing. You see it in our numbers, Rod. You see the very strong revenue growth in our Gorilla business, right? And throughout this time period, we've been having very strong requests from our customers. But what you would have heard from us is that we'd say we wouldn't take a look directly at our revenues as being the most accurate view of what's going to happen in the end market. So I think without doubt that's happening. How big a deal it is totally depends on what happens as people emerge from shelter-in-place. For that, what we're looking to is what's happening in China. Because they are now earliest to sort of return. There's other countries like that throughout Asia where we're going to look at what's happening in those markets and use that to inform what it is we think will happen as other regions open up. So, without doubt, you're noticing something that is a true thing. How much of a problem is really the key thing to solve is what happens to demand? I'll take the start of it and then Tony can add. So, with the shift from the Korean peninsula to China, as you heard from Tony, this was something we were anticipating. It's just happening faster than what we originally anticipated. So, what the interaction with our revenues will be is how fast the Korean peninsula turns down versus how rapidly the Gen 10.5 plants come up and in what order. Our current point of view is that it will play itself out so that we'll feel the pain this year as Korea will tune down a little faster given COVID-19 than our Gen 10.5 plants will come up. But then, we'll have a strong gain next year. In total, what will drive this thing is what happens to television demand, of course, right? But given that that plays out how we would expect, I think that will be the pattern of how it will play out in our numbers; a little bit of pain this year and a strong gain next year. Did that address your question, Tim? Or did you have an additional one? And if you're asking a more subtle question about generational mix pricing, I think that's a very astute question. And we like Gen 10.5, but I wouldn't let it overwhelm my analysis at this point. What I would really focus on is, what's going to happen with television demand in this economic and health cycle. If we get that right, then I think the business is going to continue to age gracefully and we'll continue to like it from a profitability and cash generation standpoint. Why don't you start, and then I'll do the next on the convert? Or do you want me to do both? So, we have no new information on the convert. In my previous discussions with people who run Samsung, right from the very beginning, what they believed in was they have a deep understanding of our technology road map and they believe that in that road map and they want to be a long-term holder. We have had nothing that would change that. It didn't drive their investment, and it originally was display technology. It was the totality of the technology portfolio. And what they thought even was coming next for displays. Now, to the purchase, first on the long-term supply agreement, of course, it changes the - who do we sell our glass to, if they shut down their LCD plants in - or LCD panel making plants in Korea. And you'll see some of that in our financials. I think we had a write-off of about $100 million something. If we take a look at the deal overall, sort of depending on how you would address what the original purchase price was and some of the original balance sheet moves, basically our acquisition of SCP, the entity now known as Corning Precision Materials, has already paid itself back two times or three times. So we feel really good about that transaction. I think where we're now - I think the key thing to focus on what Samsung is doing, because we've seen some reports that people don't totally understand what Samsung's plans are in the display area, so perhaps I can take a moment and discuss those. Basically, what they're exiting is just the manufacturing of LCD panels. They remain very dedicated to LCD TV. The problem they faced was simple, and it was accentuated by COVID-19 and the challenges that provides to the economy, which is, they have a lack of competitive cost position versus the Chinese Gen 10.5 plants, built with Chinese subsidized capital. So basically, it became - it's cheaper for them to source those panels rather than make them in Korea. It's not much more complicated than that. Instead, what they're going to turn their Korean resources towards is next-generation television and display technologies. You saw some of those recently be introduced at last Consumer Electronics, a Zero Bezel LCD TV that actually uses three pieces of glass; a quantum OLED TV, which combines quantum dot and OLED technology, which is a two-piece glass technology; micro LED technology, once again with some of our advanced glass technologies will be used; and continued emphasis on the polyimide OLED built on our glass substrates. So, our deep relationship with Samsung on display technology continues, in some ways accelerates. And we just have to follow their panel sourcing as it works its way around the globe. Was that helpful, sir? Okay. What we call our Guardiant technology, which I think is what you're talking about, Steve, is we developed a number of years ago because we saw folks going into hospitals and basically getting sicker than what they came in with because of infections arising from viruses, bacterias, and spores. So what Guardiant is, is our answer to that. It is a copper-based solution where we capture a particular ionic state of copper in glass ceramic that we then turn into very small particles that can be used in paints, coatings, potentially fabrics, right, and plastics. So, what we are seeking to do with that is do two things at once. One, provide good antimicrobial and antiviral surfaces, but also because of the particular way in which this ionic form of copper kills, prevent the development of any form of superbugs. Now, as you would imagine, the introduction of such a technology needs to go through a number of regulatory barriers. We are approved for use under the EPA as an antifungal right now, but we're going to have to work our way through various regulatory agencies to be able to effectively make the claim that we can kill these coronaviruses. We are quite confident we can. Now, for countries who felt that very pressing health need like China in the Wuhan area, they leapt on the opportunity for us to be able to provide this to help in those new hospitals that they built. And we're just going to work our way through all the various regulatory agencies accordingly. Also in China, they had a sudden need for sprays, antiviral sprays. Now, things that they use in these sprays, they want to be - they tend to be a chemical production. We have a particularly modular, small, super safe way to produce those type products called advanced flow reactors that we manufacture in China. And so, that was the example that we talked about there. In general, as we look at what are the pressing needs for us all as a society to get a handle on this and potentially future pandemics, vaccinations are important, therefore pharmaceutical packaging. We believe smart surfaces make a lot of sense, and we're continuing to use our core technology to solve that problem. And then as well, there'll be all sorts of treatments and/or protective spray. When that happens, that could use some of our production capabilities that we have built for life sciences and also for small molecule chemistry, sir. So Asiya, the way I would - A) it's early, okay. And you're seeing a number of things come up in the data, but it's too early to make any sort of conclusive statements. That being said, in general, what we're seeing - and then I'll get specific on 5G - in general, what we're seeing is, the way telecommunications companies work is because it's capital good, they build ahead of perceived demand. Depending on the company, they use different algorithms for how they figure it out but in general, they try to be about 18 months ahead of where they think demand will be. And that's the reason that the telecom network has held up pretty well as we face this surge in traffic, is - they basically went through that excess that they carry to prepare for the next 18 months. So, in general, what we're hearing from our customers is, assuming the human health crisis comes under management, that they believe they will continue to invest pretty strongly in infrastructure so that they can make sure that they re-establish that safety net. The real question is; what's baseline? Are we on a new baseline? If we're on a new baseline, then everybody's plans aren't aggressive enough. So, then it's more than just the catch-up of the period you went through, it's too early to tell that. On 5G, that will just be part of the overall mosaic of network solutions that gets played. If someone's primarily technological thrust was 5G, witness the major carriers that you can name, they will press on the accelerator for that. Now, I think one of the most interesting things that I've seen in terms of innovation because we were working super closely with them during this time, is their ability to do even things like fiber-to-the-home installations without going inside people's homes; it's been a tremendous amount of innovation around being able to do that, and I've been quite impressed with their installation teams and what they've done. So, I'm looking at this overall as reinforcing to us all how important telecommunications infrastructure is, but I don't know and I don't think it will trump various financial constraints that some carriers feel. But without doubt, it's made people believe that they need to have infrastructure. Hi, Meta. So, on cloud, they're in a little bit different situation, in some ways similar, in some ways different than the telecom carriers. And different ones are playing different ways. Like telecom carriers, they try to be able to hold enough capacity to handle peak demands. So - and there has been an enormous surge of cloud usage here, and that is being absorbed up. At the same time, those are enclosed facilities, and some of the cloud carriers have decided to basically go on lockdown and not allow new materials to come in or installation crews to come in. So, that has provided some downward momentum, just like it's done in some of the carriers giving installation pieces. I think in general, we would anticipate as - around the globe, and we're seeing it - as those rules relax, as the human health crisis feels like it's under more management, then we'll see some of that return to normal order patterns. I think in telecom, the area where it is most difficult to figure out how it will play out will be the impact on small and medium businesses and their particular LAN networks and what demand they need for that. I think all that's ahead of us. But for base cloud and telecom, they're seeing the reinforcement of their business model, and everyone that I talked to, at least, continues to believe that we need for long-term investment. So far, we've been able to maintain our business community - our business continuity at an outstanding level and have managed to do that and delight our customers. It will continue to be something that we - that garners a lot of our attention because as they do things like restart automotive plants, we're experiencing worlds where - situations that there's not a lot of experience in. I mean, restarting economies and whole plants and knowing what the safe return to work, this is going to continue to challenge supply chains. So, so far so good, but historical performance does not necessarily guarantee future performance here. Yes, we do. But it wouldn't be appropriate for me to share that. Thank you, Shannon. Three things drove it. First, our portfolio work has been successful, serving our customer base with products and inventions from many of our different divisions. And it has been successful enough now that rather than just count on sort of the soft systems we've used to do something like auto, where we did our environmental products, now we're seeing adoption of our different glass products and potentially some of our advanced sensor products and some of our advanced display products. We have used that primarily in our soft systems to be - those customers know us well and to be able to bring together our capabilities; it's been successful enough now but instead we're going to start to put in hard systems in May, market access platform leaders [ph], which we fund, to be able to run that customer interface and our strategies to serve those platforms going forward. The second thing we sought to do was improve our operational excellence across an increasingly complicated global set of operations, and that's why we have named Eric as our COO. The third and final reason is, we have very talented next generation of leaders that we're able to push in more senior spots and get more experience, show their great leadership skills as they will be the ones that will carry us into the next 169 years."

            "name": "Tony Tripeny",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As Wendell said, our results for the first quarter were solid, given the significant changes in market conditions in most of the industries we serve. Because we are in a period of uncertainty, our sales are hard to predict. Therefore, we are withdrawing our full-year 2020 guidance. My remarks today will give you a sense of what we're seeing in each of our businesses and a summary of the actions we're taking to address the situation. Now, before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results is associated with non-cash charges related to capacity realignment and cash severance payments. Other differences between our GAAP and core results come from a non-cash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this resulted in a $50 million GAAP earnings gain in the quarter. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flows, our ability to invest for growth, and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than five years ago. Now, shifting to results, first quarter sales were $2.5 billion, net income was $177 million, and EPS was $0.20. In display technologies, first quarter sales were $751 million and net income was $152 million. Display glass market first quarter volume grew by a low-single digit percentage sequentially, and Corning's volume was down a low-single digit percentage, both as expected. Sequential price declines were moderate, also as expected. Stay-at-home policies in multiple economies, starting in China, impacted end market demand for televisions in Q1. As a result, preliminary Q1 worldwide TV sell-through units are reported to be down low-single digits year-over-year. Now, for Q2, early data indicate TV sell-through units could decline more than in Q1. Weak TV demand will likely be partially offset by pockets of strength for some IT products. Now, based on our experience in prior economic events, we expect TV demand to recover to its longer-term growth trajectory as the economy recovers. In addition, we expect increasing screen size to drive continued growth in glass demand. How the full year plays out for glass demand and retail will depend on the duration of stay-at-home policies and the health of global economies throughout the year. Now, China is the first major economy to experience the shutdown and reopen cycle, and we'll be watching its TV retail demand recovery closely in the upcoming months. Although demand declined year-over-year in the first quarter, it is encouraging to note that China TV sell-through in March increased by over 50% versus February. We are adjusting our production levels to a lower level of demand. As you may have seen reported in the news recently, Samsung Display is accelerating their exit plans for LCD panel manufacturing. While this is happening faster than we originally expected, the fundamental shift from Korea to China is not a surprise to us. We have been working closely with Samsung as we move through this transition, and we are well prepared. As panel makers shift from Korea, our three Chinese Gen 10.5 plants position us well. Ultimately, end market demand drives glass demand. And with retail area growth primarily driven by large TVs, which are most efficiently manufactured on Gen 10.5 fabs, we will capture the majority of that growth. We expect temporary impact on our volume relative to the market, driven by specific timing of Samsung Display's exit, versus the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plants. Our Korea operation is a low-cost manufacturing organization that we will use to serve our global customer base. Finally, we continue to expect display pricing to decline by a mid-single digit percentage in 2020. We believe that three factors continue to drive the favorable glass-pricing environment we've been experiencing. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced to demand. For Corning, we are aligning our capacity with demand. We are also pacing our Gen 10.5 capital projects to align with panel makers' schedules. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support the acceptable returns on those investments. In optical communications, first quarter sales were $791 million. As Wendell said, long-term growth drivers are intact. We are seeing positive statement from telecom operators regarding network constraints, increased demand for bandwidth, and continued investment in 5G and data centers. But we are also seeing negative impact, as carriers and enterprise customers face site access, health and safety concerns, supply chain interruptions, and cash constraints. The business continues to adjust its cost structure and align capacity to match near-term sales. Environmental technologies first quarter sales were $320 million, and net income was $35 million. Sales were down 12% year-over-year, and below our expectations of up mid-single digits, as car and truck manufacturers implemented shutdowns in key markets. Profitability was impacted by the lower volume. We believe the economic impact on the auto industry will be significant, especially over the next two quarters to three quarters. Auto assembly plants are beginning to resume operations, with China starting to run, Europe beginning to open back up, and North America expected to reopen soon. How the recovery will play out for our business will ultimately depend on global car sales. In diesel, we anticipated a cyclical decline in North America heavy-duty truck market from its peak in 2018 and 2019. We now anticipate that decline will be even faster and steeper. Global demand was down 25% in Q1. Now, despite the impact we are experiencing, we expect our full-year sales to be less significantly impacted than the overall market, and we remain confident in our content-driven growth strategies. OEMs continue to adopt gasoline particulate filters in Europe and China, and emerging market heavy-duty regulations are driving adoption of more advanced products. As markets recover and improve, we expect to resume our growth trajectory. Specialty materials sales were $352 million, up 14% year-over-year versus our expectations of a mid-single digit increase. Net income of $51 million was also up year-over-year. We exceeded expectations due to strong sales of premium glasses, other Gorilla Glass innovations, and advanced optics products. We expect the global economic slowdown to reduce smartphone sales. In the first quarter, units were down 19%, as store closures and stay-at-home restrictions, particularly in China, impacted phone sales. Social distancing policies are now underway in many countries, so we expect these lower end market demand levels to continue in the second quarter. As countries begin to emerge from lockdowns, we expect to see increasing end market demand. Looking ahead, we expect our outperformance relative to the 2020 mobile consumer electronic market to come from further advancements and adoption of our premium glasses and our other innovations. In Life Sciences, first quarter sales were up 6% year-over-year to $258 million. Net income was $38 million. Life Sciences is being impacted by the prolonged closure of non-essential laboratories. However, this is somewhat offset by increased demand for consumables used in COVID-19 testing applications. As Wendell said, we are confident in the opportunities ahead for Life Sciences and Valor, especially as we prepare for upcoming vaccine demand. So, that is what we are seeing in each of our businesses. Clearly, the world and our outlooks have changed significantly. Anticipating lower sales, we are aggressively adjusting our operating plan and taking actions that will maintain our financial strength and result in positive free cash flow for the full year. We initiated actions in Q1 and we will continue in Q2. These actions fall into several broad categories: reducing production levels across all of our businesses, adjusting operating expenses with the majority of the savings realized in the second half, modifying inventory plans, and reducing capital expenditures. Our actions impacted gross margins in Q1, and we expect additional impact in Q2. Gross margin in the first quarter was 33.4% and below our expectations, driven by lower-than-expected volume in Environmental and the impact of lowering production across several businesses. Most of our businesses have high fixed costs. In fact, more than half of our manufacturing costs are fixed, and a significant portion of that is non-cash depreciation. This results in very high operating leverage. However, in times when volumes are dropping, our fixed costs do not change and the impact on our margins is significant. The impact is more dramatic when we are lowering inventory. In Q2, we will be further ramping down production and bringing down inventory. Therefore, we expect the Q2 gross margin percentage to be lower than Q1. So, our factory utilizations are low today. On the other hand, the capital is in place when sales growth returns. When this happens, gross margins will expand. Let's move to the balance sheet and our commitment to strong financial stewardship. We have under $70 million in debt due over the next two years and no year with more than $500 million due over the next 20 years. Our 20-year debt to EBIT ratio is 1.1 times, and that's outstanding. We expect to maintain a strong cash position and to maintain our dividend. As I previously mentioned, we expect to generate positive free cash flow for the year. We have paused share buybacks and do not expect to add material debt in 2020. To wrap up, we expect that continued economic uncertainty and related end-market weakness will affect most of our businesses. The current situation poses many unknowns for people, for families, for companies and for governments. What we know at Corning is that our underlying market drivers are intact and that we fully expect to return - to resume growth. And when the expected growth resumes, most of the capital is already in place. We're operating on the strong financial foundation we built under the strategy and capital allocation framework. And we're adjusting our operating plan and taking actions to position ourselves to come out of this slowdown even stronger. We certainly look forward to the end of this health crisis and the related hardships being experienced by so many people around the world. Until then, our priorities focus on Corning's stakeholders, as we maintain disciplined stewardship that will steer us back to growing sales and profitability. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann? And the only thing I would add to that is that essentially, you saw some of that happen in Q1 where the market sequentially grew a little bit and we were down a little bit, and that's really the explanation there. Not a surprise, it's as we guided. But it's a good example of what Wendell is - it's a good example of seeing what - playing out what Wendell just described. I think from an ASP standpoint, we are very confident in our strategy that we have talked about in the past in terms of our price declines being moderate. This is already a global pricing market, and we've - for the three reasons that I mentioned and that really are - we still feel confident. And we don't think there's really a change relative to this shift. Go ahead. No, that's just one time. Sure. I mean, we're really focused on four areas of improvement; both in terms of from a cost standpoint and a lowering capital spending standpoint. And you know, that includes our cost at our manufacturing operations, but it also includes our operating expenses. And then, in addition to that, we're re-looking at our working capital, in particular, our inventory plans, and we're planning to also reduce that. So, when you add those four things together, that gives me pretty good confidence that we will be able to generate positive free cash flow for the year. Yes, that's correct. I'm always interested in opportunities to take advantage of different markets that we participate in, like in China. And as you - when you see the cash flow statement, you'll see we raised a little bit of debt in China, which is great because it's a natural hedge for all of our businesses in China. And if I could raise more money in Japan, I would at least take a look at that. But we don't really - that - we don't - we are not counting on that on a going-forward basis in the projections that I gave. Well, from a maintenance CapEx standpoint, somewhere in the $800 million to $1 billion range, I think as we look at our capital for the rest of the year, in Q1, we were finishing up a number of projects and that's why the capital was at the level it was. It will be a little bit less - somewhat less in Q2, and then in the back half of the year, will be less than that. So, we're seeing the trajectory from a capital spending standpoint to go down as we go through the year. And it is one of the four things that we're focused on in terms of making sure that we have positive operating cash flow this year."

[Operator Instructions] It is my pleasure to introduce you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning\u2019s quarter four 2021 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer; and Ed Schlesinger, currently serving as Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company\u2019s financial reports. You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments related to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the fourth quarter, the largest differences between our GAAP and core results stem from non-cash mark-to-market gains associated with the company\u2019s currency hedging contracts and non-cash impairment charges. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this increased GAAP earnings in Q4 by $86 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using constant currency rates aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We are very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We have received more than $1.8 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They are also available on our website for downloading. And now, I will turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann and good morning everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. We delivered another strong quarter of year-over-year growth. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. We generated EPS of $0.54 and free cash flow of $425 million. For the full year, sales were $14.1 billion, up 23% year-over-year. We generated EPS of $2.07, up 49% year-over-year and we nearly doubled free cash flow. In addition, we achieved double-digit ROIC. We expanded our operating margin by 230 basis points. We increased our dividend by 9% and we reduced our outstanding shares by 5% through the resumption of share repurchases. By leveraging our fundamental capabilities and our more Corning strategy, we are capturing a compelling set of short and long-term opportunities across our portfolio. We are performing well in a challenging environment and we have momentum entering the year. Now all of that said, our gross margin is simply not where it should be. As we said last quarter, throughout the pandemic, we have prioritized protecting our people and delivering for our customers in a complex inflationary environment and it has come at a cost. Over the last several months, we have negotiated with customers to increase prices in our long-term contracts to more appropriately share the increased cost we are experiencing. We are focused on expanding our gross margin and expect improvement in 2022 as our sales growth and our price actions take hold throughout the year. Last quarter, we also discussed our expectations for our display business. I am pleased to report we had another strong quarter of display revenues and profits in quarter four. Display glass pricing is expected to be flat sequentially in the first quarter. The supply demand balance for display glass is tight. In 2022, we expect overall glass supply to remain tight to balanced and the pricing environment to remain favorable. This morning, you will hear more on these and other priorities for 2022, our focus on how we intend to maintain our growth and positive momentum that Tony and Ed will discuss our results as well as our plan to enhance our profitability and overall financial strength. So let\u2019s dive in. We have been delivering consistent growth. Sales have been up for six quarters in a row. Since 2019, we have grown sales by 21% and EPS by 18%, with more balanced and consistent contributions across our businesses. Everything begins with our cohesive portfolio. We are the world leader in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics along with our four proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms. We focus our strategy on capturing synergies among these capabilities and applying them to create disruptive innovations. Across multiple industries, we work closely with many of the most influential and successful companies to bring our world leading capabilities to bear on their toughest challenges. In the process, we help move the world forward. As we partner with our customers to advance their visions, our probability of success increases as we combine our capabilities, reapply our talent and repurpose existing assets. This provides a powerful value creation lever by unlocking new ways to integrate more of our content into our customers\u2019 ecosystems. We aren\u2019t exclusively relying on people buying more stuff. We are driving more Corning content into the products they are already buying. Our progress in 2021 illustrates the effectiveness of our approach and it gives us confidence that we are building on a strong foundation for additional growth in 2022. In Optical Communications, we\u2019ve returned to growth, with sales up 22% in 2021 and we expect strong growth to continue. Operators are expanding network capacity, capability and access. The pace of data center construction is accelerating as more applications move to the cloud and data creation continues to soar and fiber-rich wireless deployments are underway. Meanwhile, governments around the world are initiating plans to extend the reach of broadband to more people in more places as network access is increasingly viewed as a human right. For example, the recently passed U.S. Infrastructure bill allocates $65 billion in new spending for broadband infrastructure, including $42 billion for new network builds. Our customers are stating their preferences for fiber to build these networks. As the only large scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, Corning plays a vital role in driving the continued expansion of connectivity. We are working even more closely with industry players at the regional and national levels, including expanding our long-time collaboration with AT&T. Stepping back, we are at the beginning of a large multiyear wave of growth for passive optical networks. Project momentum is strong across our customer base. And as U.S. infrastructure plans roll out, it could add as much as $1 billion a year to the market for 4 years, starting as early as 2023. We believe private carrier and public infrastructure investments will push the market into double-digit growth over the next few years. In Life Sciences, we are delivering growth on multiple fronts, with sales up 24% in 2021. We are seeing ongoing demand in support of a global pandemic response. Our inventions are also helping the industry advance the transition to cell and gene-based therapies. And we are making progress on our multibillion dollar content opportunity in our pharmaceutical packaging business. After introducing Valor Glass vials in 2017, we recently introduced Velocity vials. These vials are helping industry leading drug makers increase efficiency and throughput to drive faster manufacturing of vaccines to help meet global demand. Velocity joins Valor and our glass tubing business as we build a comprehensive end-to-end pharmaceutical packaging portfolio. In fact, our portfolio has enabled the delivery of nearly 5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines so far. And earlier this week, West Pharmaceutical Services, a global leader in injectable drug administration, announced a long-term supply agreement and technology investment in Corning to enhance injectable drug packaging systems. In automotive, 2021 sales in our Environmental Technologies segment increased 16% to reach an all-time high $1.6 billion despite weakness in the automotive market related to chip shortages. We are pursuing a $100 per car content opportunity driven by trends that are reshaping the auto industry and re-imagining the car. We delivered multiple proof points in 2021. Daimler launched the Hyperscreen dashboard display in the Mercedes-Benz EQS. The display features a Gorilla Glass cover nearly 5 feet wide. Building on this momentum, we entered a new automotive product category with our curved mirror solutions. This innovation is enabling the augmented reality head-up display in Hyundai\u2019s electric crossover, the IONIQ 5. And Jeep announced a product that brings our tough technical glass into their iconic vehicles. The new Jeep performance parts windshield featuring Gorilla Glass is now a factory installed option on the Wrangler and Gladiator. Additionally, tighter emissions regulations continue to provide a strong content opportunity for our environmental solutions. Our newest generation of gasoline particulate filters helped vehicles including hybrids, achieve even lower levels of fine particulate tailpipe emissions. The contributions of our GPF business provide a strong illustration of our more Corning strategy in action. Since 2017, Environmental Technologies sales have increased more than 40%, while global car sales have decreased by 20%. Let\u2019s turn to Mobile Consumer Electronics, where 2021 sales increased 7% and we surpassed the $2 billion in sales for the first time. Since 2016 specialty materials has added nearly $900 million on a base of $1.1 billion in a smartphone market that has been flat to down. As we help our customers deliver new value to their users, more of our content is deployed in each device sold. That is another great illustration of more Corning in action. Our industry leading innovations continued to garner widespread accolades. In fact, SaaS company named Corning the most innovative company in the consumer electronics category for 2021 touting Ceramic Shield, the world\u2019s first transparent and color-free glass ceramic as close \u201cvirtually indestructible\u201d and recognizing Gorilla Glass Victus as the toughest Gorilla Glass yet. We continue to see strong demand for both of these premium products. In 2021, more than 125 devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets and laptops, launched featuring Gorilla Glass. And we expanded our capabilities into a new category by introducing Gorilla Glass with DX and DX+ to optimize mobile phone cameras. These composite products create an attractive opportunity to increase our revenue per device. Finally, in 2021, Apple awarded Corning an additional $45 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. To-date, Corning has received $495 million in total from Apple\u2019s fund. We are investing in multiple new inventions and innovations for mobile consumer electronics and we are excited about the potential in 2022 and beyond. Turning to Display, our leadership in large glass puts us in a position of strength. 2021 sales grew 17% to $3.7 billion. Our volume exceeded glass market growth as we ramp Gen 10.5 facilities that supply glass for large-sized TVs, which are expected to grow at a high-teens compound annual growth rate over the next several years. In 2022, we expect overall glass supply to remain tight to balanced and the pricing environment to remain favorable. We continue to believe the retail market will grow, led by higher TV unit sales and growth in average screen size. Across our markets, long-term growth drivers are strong and our role is clear. We lead in capabilities that are vital to progress. Our approach provides exciting opportunities for Corning inventions to make a positive impact on the world. And it underscores our commitment to moving the world forward in everything that we do. Now, let me give you some examples outside of the operational context. In 2021, we hosted COVID-19 vaccination clinics at Corning sites around the world. In Reynosa, Mexico, for example, we helped administer more than 100,000 doses of vaccines and boosters to employees and community members. And we provided more than 200,000 diagnostic tests for employees around the world. We kicked off a 5-year $5.5 million partnership with the nation\u2019s largest historically black university, North Carolina A&T. Our work will prepare students for STEM careers. We engaged our Board of Directors to provide guidance and resources to our office of racial equality and social unity, utilizing our members\u2019 diverse experience, gender, age and ethnicity to advance this new initiative. We achieved gender pay equity globally for all salaried employees and we expanded the reach of our DE&I office with regional business counsels. And finally, we committed to greenhouse gas goals that align with the Paris agreement and we signed solar contracts at Hemlock that will help the world address its renewable energy goals. I feel very good about our efforts to bolster equality inside and outside the company and our progress on our sustainability initiatives. Overall, we continue to build a stronger, more resilient company. We are in the early innings of exciting industry transformations and key trends are converging around our capabilities. You can see it in our results. You can see it in our outlook for 2022 and advancement of new businesses towards significant commercial sales over the next few years. Of course, to keep advancing during Corning\u2019s next 170 years, we must focus on growing and developing our leaders. We have a new generation who are stepping up to guide this company to a very exciting phase of its history and into the future. And I am working closely with each of them. To that end, I want to recognize Tony as he prepares to hand over the reins to Ed in just a few weeks. The strong position we are in today certainly reflects the many contributions he has made throughout more than three decades of excellent service to Corning. Tony, we thank you and wish you the very best in retirement. At the same time, I am excited to welcome Ed into the CFO role, which he starts on February 18. Ed has long played a key role in the growth and financial strength of our company. Tony and I have worked closely with him during that time and I look forward to the important contributions he will make in this new position. So, let me turn the call over to Tony and Ed, who will share more details on our results, our priorities and our outlook for 2022.\nTony Tripeny: Thank you, Wendell and good morning everyone. Our growth initiatives are succeeding and we delivered another quarter of excellent year-over-year growth that capped off a truly exceptional year. For the full year, sales increased 23% and EPS was up 49%. All of our segments grew with 4 out of 5 increasing sales by a double-digit percentage. It was a strong year even compared to pre-pandemic levels. Since 2019, we have grown sales by 21% and EPS by 18%. We nearly doubled free cash flow to $1.8 billion, which is a conversion rate of 97% for the year. We achieved double-digit ROIC and we utilized our strong cash generation to reward shareholders. We increased our dividend 9% and we reduced our outstanding shares by 5% to the resumption of share repurchases. On so many dimensions, we are feeling great. That said, as you heard from Wendell, our gross margin percentage is not where it should be. In the fourth quarter, gross margin was 36.5%, down 180 basis points sequentially. As expected, below normal auto production and seasonally lower sales in specialty materials reduced profitability. In addition, we restarted idle polysilicon capacity to support Hemlock\u2019s new long-term solar contracts thus incurring temporary startup cost. We expect to expand gross margin percent throughout the year. We negotiated pricing increases in long-term customer contracts to more appropriately share the higher cost that we are experiencing. These increases take effect and accelerate throughout the year. As always, we expect to deliver on a robust cost reduction program. The combined benefits of these efforts should offset the cumulative inflation we experienced over the last year and what we anticipate for 2022. Our gross and operating margins will also benefit from growing volume. Our operating leverage is such that additional volume drives good incremental profitability and becomes even more apparent as we offset inflation. We expect volume increases throughout the year. As our volumes increase and our pricing actions take effect, our gross margin percent will grow. As a reminder, the first quarter is usually our lowest volume quarter of the year. We expect Specialty Materials to improve on its normal cycle, with Q1 typically being the lowest quarter of the year. Environmental Technologies sales will improve with the resolution of the chip shortage, which we expect to happen later in the year. And Optical Communications will grow as we fill the capacity that we\u2019re adding to meet growing demand. For the year, we expect price increases cost reductions and volume growth. Putting this all together, we expect Q1 to be the lowest gross margin percent quarter of the year and for gross margin to grow from there. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at performance in each of our businesses during the fourth quarter and the full year. Let\u2019s begin with Optical Communications. Fourth quarter sales were up 7% sequentially, exceeding $1.2 billion. Net income increased to 12%. For the full year, sales grew 22% to $4.3 billion, and net income was up 51%. We grew significantly faster than the passive optical market. National and regional carriers increased capital spending on 5G and broadband projects. Additionally, enterprise sales were up as customers increase spending on data center builds. Full year net income grew 51% driven by the incremental volume despite cost headwinds related to materials and logistics. We\u2019re entering 2022 with a sales run rate 25% higher than where we started in 2021, and we have a strong order book. We continue to see significant public and private investments in fiber infrastructure as operators work to expand capacity, capability and access, and we expect a large multiyear wave of growth. In fact, we believe private carrier and public infrastructure investments will push the market into double-digit growth. We\u2019re adding capacity to capture the growing demand, and we feel really good about our position as the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions. Turning to Display, in the fourth quarter, sales were $942 million, up 12% year-over-year and net income was $252 million, up 16% year-over-year. For the full year, sales were $3.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Net income reached $960 million, up 34% year-over-year. The pricing environment was favorable throughout the year, and our excellent operational performance allowed us to continue to lead the market. In the third quarter, we provided detail about our perspective on the Display industry based on three main factors: Retail demand, panel makers production and glass makers\u2019 ability to supply panel makers. Our fourth quarter performance and first quarter outlook reaffirm our expectations. We continue to expect that glass at retail will grow in 2022 by high single digits, driven by TV unit and screen size growth. We expect display glass pricing to be flat sequentially in the first quarter and supply-demand balance for display glass to be tight. We expect glass supply-demand to remain tight to balanced in 2022 and the pricing environment to remain favorable. Overall, we are very pleased with Display\u2019s performance in 2021, and we feel good about our outlook for 2022. We\u2019re operating from a position of strength, and we intend to build on our momentum as we move forward. In Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $353 million, down 9% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Fourth quarter net income was $54 million, down 10% sequentially and 42% year-over-year on lower sales volume. These declines were driven by auto production constraints created by the semiconductor chip shortage that began in the second quarter of last year. As expected, this negatively impacted profitability for the segment and the company. Now even with this temporary setback caused by the chip shortage, for the full year, we were able to deliver double-digit sales growth, enabled by our content-driven growth strategy. Full year sales were nearly $1.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in heavy-duty diesel and greater adoption of gas particulate filters. For the full year, net income was $269 million, up 37% year-over-year. As we look ahead, we\u2019re confident that our content-driven approach will continue to drive outperformance. And when the automotive market rebounds with the resolution of the chip shortage, we expect significant growth from current levels. Turning to Specialty Materials, sales were $518 million, down 7% sequentially on normal seasonality. Sales were down 5% year-over-year versus a strong Q4 in 2020 following the launch of Ceramic Shield. Fourth quarter net income was $92 million, down sequentially and year-over-year, driven by the lower sales volume. Full year sales were up 7% and exceeded $2 billion, driven by continued strong sales of premium cover materials. Demand also remains strong for advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturing as the broader end market continues to experience robust growth. Despite sales being up, full year net income was down as we invested strongly in new innovations that will be commercialized in the coming year. We have grown sales every year since 2016 through our more Corning approach despite smartphone unit sales maturing. Over that 5-year period, we\u2019ve added nearly $900 million in sales on a base of $1.1 billion. Looking ahead, in 2022, we expect sales to grow faster than our underlying markets driven by continuing adoption of our innovations and growth in advanced optics specifically in products for EUV lithography. And as I mentioned here, we expect sales to increase from the seasonal low levels we expect in the first quarter. And finally, turning to Life Sciences, we had a great year with total sales topping $1.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Fourth quarter sales were $317 million, up 16% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by ongoing demand to support the global pandemic response, continued recovery in academic and pharmaceutical research labs and strong demand for bioproduction vessels and diagnostic-related consumables. Full year net income was $194 million, up 40%. Fourth quarter net income was $49 million, up 17% year-over-year. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect our strong growth to continue, driven by COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, strong research funding, lab utilization returning to pre-pandemic levels and growth in the bioproduction segment. I also want to spend a minute on our other segment. As a reminder, the majority of sales in our other segment are in Hemlock Semiconductor Group. During the year, Hemlock saw new demand for solar-grade polysilicon. With the increased activity and interest in U.S.-based solar manufacturing, customers have turned to Hemlock, a leader in polysilicon manufacturing. So in addition to selling polysilicon for use in semiconductors, Hemlock was able to sell solar polysilicon from inventory. Going forward, solar remains a strong revenue opportunity for Hemlock. In the fourth quarter, we signed long-term take-or-pay supply contracts with customer deposits that start to shift in 2022. As a result, we restarted idle capacity with minimal capital investment to meet this demand. As I mentioned earlier, gross margins were impacted in the fourth quarter as we incurred temporary cost to restart solar polysilicon capacity. This will improve throughout the year as solar production increases. Additionally, our auto glass and pharmaceutical packaging emerging businesses are also in the other segment. And both businesses significantly grew sales during the year as well. Stepping back, we made strong progress across all of our businesses in 2021. We entered new product categories, announced collaboration with key industry leaders and contributed to significant industry advancements. We\u2019re building a strong foundation for future growth. This combined with our consistent focus on innovation and deep commitment to RD&E is what continues to fuel and sustain Corning\u2019s leadership position across its markets. Looking ahead, we expect Corning sales and EPS to grow year-over-year in the first quarter. We expect sales to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion and EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.53. Sales are down sequentially due to typical seasonal volume declines. For the full year, we expect sales of approximately $15 billion and profit to grow faster than sales. Before I turn things over to Ed, I\u2019d like to take a moment to express my gratitude. First, to all Corning employees whose dedication and commitment to this great company is such an inspiration. Second, to those of you on the call and all our shareholders, for being, with being on this journey with us, we\u2019re working hard every day to maintain your trust and reward your confidence in us. And finally, I\u2019d like to thank Wendell, Ed and my fellow members of Corning\u2019s senior leadership team. I\u2019m proud to have played a role in building the strong foundation Corning has today. It\u2019s truly been a wonderful journey. As Ed takes the reins in just a few weeks, I\u2019m fully confident in his ability to build on this foundation and continue creating value for all our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ed.\nEd Schlesinger: Thanks, Tony, and hello, everyone. I\u2019m looking forward to connecting with you in the days and months ahead so we can expand on the thoughts I share today and address any questions you may have. Before I start, I\u2019d like to say that it\u2019s been an honor working alongside Tony all these years. Under his tenure, we met or exceeded all the goals of our 4-year strategy and capital allocation framework. And today, we\u2019re performing well against the subsequent goals we outlined in our strategy and growth framework in 2019. Our execution has created a stronger, more resilient Corning and that provided vital \u2013 proved vital as the pandemic unfolded. Our solid footing enabled us to preserve our financial strength throughout 2020, and it kept us well positioned for growth in 2021. Throughout it all, Tony\u2019s focus on financial stewardship has been central to our results, and I plan to sustain that disciplined approach. So let me walk through my priorities as CFO as I work to ensure that Corning continues to be an excellent steward of capital. We expect another strong year of cash generation in 2022, and our financial priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to invest of cash to support organic growth, extend our leadership and reward shareholders. First, we will continue to invest for growth, primarily through RD&E and CapEx. RD&E is fundamental to our long-term success and our allocation will be consistent with previous years. In 2022, we expect to keep CapEx consistent with 2021. Our investments include adding capacity to meet growing demand, introduce new innovations and improve productivity. Shareholder returns also remain a key priority. In 2022, we expect to increase our dividend per share by approximately $0.10. And we expect to continue opportunistic share repurchases building on the 5% of outstanding shares we repurchased in 2021. In the near-term, improving gross margin is my top priority. We expect improvement throughout 2022 as sales grow and our pricing actions take hold. Overall, I\u2019ll close today saying that I\u2019m optimistic about our growth trajectory for 2022 and excited to step into the CFO role. We\u2019re building on a strong foundation. Our capabilities are relevant to major trends playing out across the industries we serve. Our more Corning approach is working. And we\u2019re executing effectively through some very volatile end markets, expanding relationships and commitments with our customers and extending our leadership position. Based on the growth drivers and financial priorities you\u2019ve heard this morning, I feel good about delivering on our expectation to grow sales to $15 billion in 2022 with EPS growing even faster. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A. Ann?\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Ed. Okay. Shannon, we are ready for the first question. And I ask that folks please try to keep it to one question, so we can get through as many as we can.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. When you look at your comments on long-term contracts where you\u2019re negotiating pricing, can you give us some sense of what percent of your revenue is tied into these contracts? And how should investors think about the bridge to $15 billion in revenues? How much of that increase would you say is pricing versus content versus market growth? Thank you. And Tony, thanks for all you\u2019ve done for Corning. It\u2019s been a pleasure working with you.\nTony Tripeny: Thank you, Wamsi. I appreciate it.\nWendell Weeks: So let\u2019s deal with the pricing question first. So first, let\u2019s pull out Display for a moment. We provide glass pricing guidance each and every quarter in Display. And you know that we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable. And you just received both what happened in quarter four, which was flat sequential pricing in Display and our guide for flat sequential pricing in quarter one as well. As you look at \u2013 let\u2019s take now take all of our other segments, Opto, Life Sciences, auto and MCE. If we take them as a whole, we expect price to be up in total dollars year-over-year. Now each of the businesses is different. There is different types of contracts. And then within each of those, you have different customers and different positions. So it\u2019s hard to reach a general statement. But I think as you think about it analytically, basically, we expect prices, as a whole, in those segments to go up. Turning to the $15 billion, I think always for us, that you should be thinking about it primarily as being driven by our growth. The way \u2013 the sort of construct that you heard from Tony is that if you\u2019ve looked back at this past year, our \u2013 we had cost inflation much higher than a normal year of increasing input costs. And when we\u2019re looking at the pricing is that we expect to share that more appropriately with our customers. And the price, together with our more robust cost reduction will put us in a position to offset the inflation we\u2019ve already experienced as well as what we anticipate for 2022. That allows the volume growth to drop to the gross margin line with our normal sort of robustness and without any sort of friction costs driven by excess inflation. So that\u2019s the way we tend to think about the $15 billion. That\u2019s the way we think about price, cost and then how it turns into gross margin percentage gains as volume grows and the price actions take effect.\nWamsi Mohan: Thanks, Wendell.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long: Thank you. I wanted to ask on the optical comms business, obviously, pretty strong in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit, have you already started to see the benefits from the renewed agreement with AT&T? And looking out at this business, it sounds like you think you can see double-digit growth in the next several years. So could you talk a little bit about how you see the margin progression over time? Do you think net margins can get back to levels they were a few years ago given higher growth and pricing actions as well? Thank you.\nTony Tripeny: Yes. I think the short answer to that is, for sure, we think that margins will expand in this business for all the reasons that Wendell just explained I mean. First, we are taking pricing actions here that\u2019s where a lot of our long-term supply agreements are and those will roll out through the year. And then secondly, when you combine it with the volume increase that we expect, so yes, we expect our margins to increase. And in terms of AT&T, obviously, they are a very important customer for us, and we continue to see the benefits from that relationship.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nMartin Yang: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Can we maybe talk about the cadence for price increase and their associated margin expansion for the majority of this year? And is there any one quarter where we should expect most of the pricing impact to be fully accounted for?\nTony Tripeny: Yes. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 Martin, I mean it\u2019s clearly going to roll out at different times at different pace by customers. We would expect to see some of it start kicking-in in Q1 and then accelerate from there. What we would expect to have happen is Q1 being our lowest quarter from a gross margin standpoint. And then when you add the sales volume increase that we expect, as we described how those dynamics work, we would expect gross margin to expand from there throughout the year.\nWendell Weeks: The way we tend to think about it cycle-wise, is that first quarter will be the lowest amount of incremental price, then it builds as the year goes on, as more and more of the contracts and increased pricing go into effect and as it applies to more volume just following our normal sort of seasonal cycle in our businesses.\nMartin Yang: I guess I was trying to get at is, is there any potential for the price increase with customers, the effect of that to maybe lingering into 2023 also?\nWendell Weeks: It\u2019s an excellent question. Like many things, when we wrestle with the issue of inflation, and we try to figure out how to deal with that problem, we learn things and we develop new tools. I would say that our customers have been very fair with us and they have been very favorable discussions. There is a good mutual understanding that we rely on each other. We are real partners. We tend not to be transactional with our customers. And our customers are transactional with us. So, the good news is those long-term nature of those relationships mean that each and every time we evolve that relationship, it tends to last. So, I think it all really depends on what happens with inflation going forward. The key thematic is that we will own our part with the type of rigorous cost reduction we normally do. But for these excess costs, this excess inflation, they have agreed to share that in a more appropriate fashion with us.\nMartin Yang: Got it. That\u2019s perfectly fair. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good morning. Tony, congrats on your retirement, and thanks for all your help over the years. Really appreciate it.\nTony Tripeny: Thanks Steve.\nSteven Fox: In terms of my \u2013 thanks. In terms of my question, I guess I was wondering if you guys could dig into specialty materials a little bit more. It sounded like there were some new drivers that\u2019s going to help sales growth this year. Just trying to understand maybe the new versus the more typical growth of the recent years and then maybe its impact on gross margins for the coming year? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks, Steve. Thanks, especially for the comments on Tony. I think when you think about specialty, you are just seeing the inverse of what you see this year in terms of margin. We are investing in new programs that are stealth in nature. As the spending has gone up, the investment has gone up as we begin to start to ramp some of those production assets, but they are not totally stable yet, and we are continuing to invest in the product technology. And what we expect is as we work our way through this year, those products will get introduced, they will start generating revenue, we will get more efficient in making them, and therefore, they will turn into profit \u2013 year-over-year profit gains as we work our way through 2022.\nSteven Fox: So, more of a second half type thing you just said, Wendell?\nWendell Weeks: Yes. I think more on the second half which is, as you know, tends to be relatively typical in mobile consumer electronics.\nSteven Fox: Yes. Got it. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Great. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Roberts: Thanks. Best wishes as well, Tony, and welcome, Edward. Since we have so much CFO firepower here on this call, Corning met the earlier financial goals that were laid out, but they didn\u2019t include an ROIC target. And if you look at Slide 38, again, ROIC is only 10%. Do you think we will have a focus on that going forward? You have pivoted to focus on gross margin. I don\u2019t know if you are going to pivot maybe to focus on ROIC as well and maybe wrap the capital spending outlook in with that as well?\nTony Tripeny: Sure. I mean, I think that if you look back over the last several years, it\u2019s actually been a pretty significant improvement in ROIC. And it was clearly one of our focuses, both on the original strategy and capital allocation framework. But if you go back to what we talked about in 2019, it was a very specific commitment to get to at least above 10% level, which I am really proud of the fact that we accomplished that in 2021, especially when you think about the challenges from a pandemic standpoint. But for sure, continuing to expand ROIC, which is kind of the ultimate measure of profitability is a real focus area for us. And so that also remains a high priority from a financial management standpoint.\nEd Schlesinger: Yes. I would add, John, that we expect to grow, as we have shared with you and expand our margins, and we gave you our capital guidance. So, we certainly are focused on ROIC and expect it to continue to be important for us as we go forward.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citi. Your line is open.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for the opportunity. And Tony, once again, thank you for all your help.\nTony Tripeny: Thanks.\nAsiya Merchant: I had a quick question on margin. I mean you got some pushback this quarter. I think Tony mentioned there were some start-up costs that impacted margins this quarter, which as Wendell pointed out, were underwhelming relative to expectations. My understanding was of those cost negotiations and inflationary pressures being passed on to customers were being negotiated in 4Q as well. So, where did you get the most pushback on that? And why do you feel so confident that these inflationary pressures should abate in \u201822 with the negotiated contract? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: So, it wasn\u2019t so much \u2013 it\u2019s really just a timing question. It wasn\u2019t so much of what goes into effect exactly in Q4, who pushed against us and who did it. Really, it\u2019s just \u2013 these are all long-term contract based. And the reason we have these long-term contracts is that our core value creation comes from us making product and having a high transformation value driven by our factories. And the key thing we need to do to drive that ROIC up and to give good streams of earnings to our investors is to make sure we de-risk that capital investment. So, the good news with that is that the way inflation works is that tends to put some dampening of the effective inflation on us because of our fixed cost structure being relatively high. But the downside is that those long-term contracts, you have to actually sit down and renegotiate them. So, what gives us confidence is we have renegotiated them and reached a formal agreement with our customers on this is what their pricing will be. So, it takes time to do that, to reach agreement, what is the appropriate sharing. But the good news is, once you reach agreement, you have agreement and then now we just execute. And that\u2019s where we are. Now we are not close with everybody. There is more to do, and that\u2019s another reason that some of it builds through the year.\nEd Schlesinger: Yes. Sorry, Asiya with regard to the start-up costs that you mentioned, that was primarily in Hemlock, and that\u2019s actually a pretty exciting thing for us. As you know, when we did the transaction around Hemlock, in September of 2020, it was primarily based on the semiconductor market, and we looked at solar as an option. That solar appears to be materializing, and we have signed long-term contracts, and that\u2019s where the start-up costs came from.\nAnn Nicholson: Great. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats to Tony and Ed. I was going to just ask on display here. Tony, you sounded optimistic about the retail TV environment in 2022. At least in 4Q from the data we saw \u2013 I mean we haven\u2019t seen any positive data points, at least the industry seemed a bit more bearish or sort of seeing a soft environment in terms of TV in 4Q. So, what\u2019s really driving in terms of data points and maybe what you are looking at driving that optimism about TV unit outlook in 2022? And separately, just on the screen size as well. I mean some of the recent data shows screen size increases aren\u2019t going up as much as it used to. Is there an inflation-driven change in consumer behavior where consumers are maybe pulling back a bit in terms of moving to higher screen sizes? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Well, thanks for the question on display. We think it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s an important area because what we have heard from investors is that a key factor weighing on our stock price is a concern that the current cycle of downward price in profits in the LCD panel industry would cause a significant glass price and profit squeeze for Corning. Now what we said in quarter three is that we believe glass supply-demand balance will be tight. And therefore, the glass pricing environment will remain favorable and therefore, we did not expect a significant reduction in our profit stream. We now have a quarter four data. Glass price was flat sequentially. Further, we guided that for quarter one, the glass price will be flat sequentially. Once again, glass supply demand remains tight. So, now we have a more confirmatory evidence to support our belief that the pricing environment will be favorable in 2022. That, I think is the core evidence that we are looking at. Now, when you shift to thinking about the market, retail, full glass out in retail overall is like in the range of what we anticipated, right. And size, we actually expect to do quite well in the coming year. One of the things that happened sort of during the pandemic is that a lot of smaller screens were sold, and that tends to be the place where the units we expected to drop off more and they have, which sort of has the effect of also accelerating, if anything, the diagonal growth on average. That\u2019s the way we tend to think about size and retail. Would you guys have anything to add on that?\nTony Tripeny: No, I think that\u2019s exactly right. I mean our expectations for the year really haven\u2019t changed. They are pretty well in line from a unit standpoint with what third-party people in the industry are looking at. And the screen size, we are very confident in. I mean, 1.5 inch has been pretty consistent for a very long period of time. And when you look at the growth above 65 inches TVs over the last year, it just confirms that 1.5 inch. We feel very confident about that.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGeorge Notter: Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about the optical business. Obviously, I think the bet there is just how fast you guys can expand manufacturing capacity. I saw you grew that business, obviously, about 6.5% sequentially. So, you are making progress. But at the same time, we hear about how your lead times are nearly 2 years for high-count fiber cables. So, maybe you could talk about the gating items to expanding capacity there. Is it resin? Is it buildings and the draw towers? Just kind of walk us through what you see. And then last thing, congrats to Tony.\nTony Tripeny: Thanks, George.\nWendell Weeks: Like as you point out, I won\u2019t comment on our specific backlog by product line, but as you point out, if we could make more, we could sell more. And that\u2019s why we announced the capacity expansions that we did last year. And we expect those to ramp as the year goes on. With each of those capacity expansions, we need to have in place long-term commitments from our customers. And we have those and that is ramping. So, the real bottleneck isn\u2019t resin, isn\u2019t raw materials, isn\u2019t labor. It is just us being able to get into place capacity that is more appropriately balanced to the demand that we are experiencing.\nAnn Nicholson: Alright. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRod Hall: Yes. Thanks for fitting me in. Congrats, Tony, great working with you. Best of luck\u2026\nTony Tripeny: Thanks, Rod.\nRod Hall: So, I had two questions, one on Hemlock. The Hemlock commentary on solar, I thought was pretty positive. Do you have any ideas for growth there in \u201822 on \u201821, mid-single digits? Any kind of indication you could give us for that?\nEd Schlesinger: Rod, we are not specifically giving guidance, but what I would say is we have signed a number of long-term multiyear agreements. We received cash upfront, their take-or-pay agreements. So, we are highly confident that we will be able to fill the capacity that we have coming online. So, you will see that expand through the year in 2022.\nWendell Weeks: One of interesting dynamics that Ann could maybe sit down with you on afterwards Rod, is from a modeling standpoint. When we did the Hemlock transaction, as you heard from Jeff, we really stood on the semiconductor business, but we picked up all of those solar capabilities that really is an option with that, with inventory that we also had is solar grade. And so just through this year, we sold down a hunk of that inventory, which generated cash nicely. And then now you are really seeing new solar grade poly sign being made by us with the start-up that you are talking about. So, when you work through the modeling, let\u2019s have \u2013 and sit down to provide a little bit of help on just sort of how that worked.\nRod Hall: Okay. Great. Thanks, Wendell. And then the buyback is kind of back to the same level it was in December of 2019. Should we be thinking like we are back into kind of a normalized buyback regime now?\nTony Tripeny: Well, for sure, Rod, our approach from a buyback standpoint is first, we generate very strong operating cash flow. And our first priority is to invest that in our business and our growth and sustained leadership. And then obviously, once we have done that, we want to return the cash to shareholders. As Ed mentioned, we have increased the dividend in 2021, and we expect to increase the dividend in 2022. And then we will be opportunistic on buybacks. And we saw Q4 as a really great opportunity to buy back shares where the stock price was, and we will continue to pursue buybacks on an opportunistic basis.\nRod Hall: Great. Okay. Thanks a lot Tony. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Shannon, let\u2019s take one more question, please.\nOperator: Our last question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe just a question on environmental, I just wanted to get a sense of clearly, supply chain is an issue with autos right now, but we hear a lot of like cars that are basically ready to go and just need a chip. And so just trying to get a sense of when you would expect to see environmental tick back up? Is it when the supply chain shortage kind of alleviates itself on the auto market, or you would need kind of a quarter or two quarters after that to work through kind of inventory that they may have? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: We don\u2019t see a significant inventory sort of overhang for our product. One of the reason is that our demand supply was tight for that product to begin with as we work our way through the year and our content strategy has put a good amount of strain on our ability to supply. So, in general, if you had a point of view on when chips started to come back for auto and as auto production scaled, we would expect to roughly follow that timing.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Great. Thank you. Alright. Thank you all for joining us today. Before we close, I wanted to let everyone know that we will attend the SIG Analyst Annual Tech Conference on March 4th and Morgan Stanley Global Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on March 8th. We will also host management visits to investor offices in select cities. Finally, a web replay of today\u2019s call will be available on our site starting later this morning. So, thank you all for joining us. Shannon, that concludes our call. Please disconnect all lines.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Tony, and hello, everyone. I'm looking forward to connecting with you in the days and months ahead so we can expand on the thoughts I share today and address any questions you may have. Before I start, I'd like to say that it's been an honor working alongside Tony all these years. Under his tenure, we met or exceeded all the goals of our 4-year strategy and capital allocation framework. And today, we're performing well against the subsequent goals we outlined in our strategy and growth framework in 2019. Our execution has created a stronger, more resilient Corning and that provided vital \u2013 proved vital as the pandemic unfolded. Our solid footing enabled us to preserve our financial strength throughout 2020, and it kept us well positioned for growth in 2021. Throughout it all, Tony's focus on financial stewardship has been central to our results, and I plan to sustain that disciplined approach. So let me walk through my priorities as CFO as I work to ensure that Corning continues to be an excellent steward of capital. We expect another strong year of cash generation in 2022, and our financial priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to invest of cash to support organic growth, extend our leadership and reward shareholders. First, we will continue to invest for growth, primarily through RD&E and CapEx. RD&E is fundamental to our long-term success and our allocation will be consistent with previous years. In 2022, we expect to keep CapEx consistent with 2021. Our investments include adding capacity to meet growing demand, introduce new innovations and improve productivity. Shareholder returns also remain a key priority. In 2022, we expect to increase our dividend per share by approximately $0.10. And we expect to continue opportunistic share repurchases building on the 5% of outstanding shares we repurchased in 2021. In the near-term, improving gross margin is my top priority. We expect improvement throughout 2022 as sales grow and our pricing actions take hold. Overall, I'll close today saying that I'm optimistic about our growth trajectory for 2022 and excited to step into the CFO role. We're building on a strong foundation. Our capabilities are relevant to major trends playing out across the industries we serve. Our more Corning approach is working. And we're executing effectively through some very volatile end markets, expanding relationships and commitments with our customers and extending our leadership position. Based on the growth drivers and financial priorities you've heard this morning, I feel good about delivering on our expectation to grow sales to $15 billion in 2022 with EPS growing even faster. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A. Ann? Yes. I would add, John, that we expect to grow, as we have shared with you and expand our margins, and we gave you our capital guidance. So, we certainly are focused on ROIC and expect it to continue to be important for us as we go forward. Yes. Sorry, Asiya with regard to the start-up costs that you mentioned, that was primarily in Hemlock, and that's actually a pretty exciting thing for us. As you know, when we did the transaction around Hemlock, in September of 2020, it was primarily based on the semiconductor market, and we looked at solar as an option. That solar appears to be materializing, and we have signed long-term contracts, and that's where the start-up costs came from. Rod, we are not specifically giving guidance, but what I would say is we have signed a number of long-term multiyear agreements. We received cash upfront, their take-or-pay agreements. So, we are highly confident that we will be able to fill the capacity that we have coming online. So, you will see that expand through the year in 2022."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann and good morning everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. We delivered another strong quarter of year-over-year growth. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. We generated EPS of $0.54 and free cash flow of $425 million. For the full year, sales were $14.1 billion, up 23% year-over-year. We generated EPS of $2.07, up 49% year-over-year and we nearly doubled free cash flow. In addition, we achieved double-digit ROIC. We expanded our operating margin by 230 basis points. We increased our dividend by 9% and we reduced our outstanding shares by 5% through the resumption of share repurchases. By leveraging our fundamental capabilities and our more Corning strategy, we are capturing a compelling set of short and long-term opportunities across our portfolio. We are performing well in a challenging environment and we have momentum entering the year. Now all of that said, our gross margin is simply not where it should be. As we said last quarter, throughout the pandemic, we have prioritized protecting our people and delivering for our customers in a complex inflationary environment and it has come at a cost. Over the last several months, we have negotiated with customers to increase prices in our long-term contracts to more appropriately share the increased cost we are experiencing. We are focused on expanding our gross margin and expect improvement in 2022 as our sales growth and our price actions take hold throughout the year. Last quarter, we also discussed our expectations for our display business. I am pleased to report we had another strong quarter of display revenues and profits in quarter four. Display glass pricing is expected to be flat sequentially in the first quarter. The supply demand balance for display glass is tight. In 2022, we expect overall glass supply to remain tight to balanced and the pricing environment to remain favorable. This morning, you will hear more on these and other priorities for 2022, our focus on how we intend to maintain our growth and positive momentum that Tony and Ed will discuss our results as well as our plan to enhance our profitability and overall financial strength. So let's dive in. We have been delivering consistent growth. Sales have been up for six quarters in a row. Since 2019, we have grown sales by 21% and EPS by 18%, with more balanced and consistent contributions across our businesses. Everything begins with our cohesive portfolio. We are the world leader in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics along with our four proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms. We focus our strategy on capturing synergies among these capabilities and applying them to create disruptive innovations. Across multiple industries, we work closely with many of the most influential and successful companies to bring our world leading capabilities to bear on their toughest challenges. In the process, we help move the world forward. As we partner with our customers to advance their visions, our probability of success increases as we combine our capabilities, reapply our talent and repurpose existing assets. This provides a powerful value creation lever by unlocking new ways to integrate more of our content into our customers' ecosystems. We aren't exclusively relying on people buying more stuff. We are driving more Corning content into the products they are already buying. Our progress in 2021 illustrates the effectiveness of our approach and it gives us confidence that we are building on a strong foundation for additional growth in 2022. In Optical Communications, we've returned to growth, with sales up 22% in 2021 and we expect strong growth to continue. Operators are expanding network capacity, capability and access. The pace of data center construction is accelerating as more applications move to the cloud and data creation continues to soar and fiber-rich wireless deployments are underway. Meanwhile, governments around the world are initiating plans to extend the reach of broadband to more people in more places as network access is increasingly viewed as a human right. For example, the recently passed U.S. Infrastructure bill allocates $65 billion in new spending for broadband infrastructure, including $42 billion for new network builds. Our customers are stating their preferences for fiber to build these networks. As the only large scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, Corning plays a vital role in driving the continued expansion of connectivity. We are working even more closely with industry players at the regional and national levels, including expanding our long-time collaboration with AT&T. Stepping back, we are at the beginning of a large multiyear wave of growth for passive optical networks. Project momentum is strong across our customer base. And as U.S. infrastructure plans roll out, it could add as much as $1 billion a year to the market for 4 years, starting as early as 2023. We believe private carrier and public infrastructure investments will push the market into double-digit growth over the next few years. In Life Sciences, we are delivering growth on multiple fronts, with sales up 24% in 2021. We are seeing ongoing demand in support of a global pandemic response. Our inventions are also helping the industry advance the transition to cell and gene-based therapies. And we are making progress on our multibillion dollar content opportunity in our pharmaceutical packaging business. After introducing Valor Glass vials in 2017, we recently introduced Velocity vials. These vials are helping industry leading drug makers increase efficiency and throughput to drive faster manufacturing of vaccines to help meet global demand. Velocity joins Valor and our glass tubing business as we build a comprehensive end-to-end pharmaceutical packaging portfolio. In fact, our portfolio has enabled the delivery of nearly 5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines so far. And earlier this week, West Pharmaceutical Services, a global leader in injectable drug administration, announced a long-term supply agreement and technology investment in Corning to enhance injectable drug packaging systems. In automotive, 2021 sales in our Environmental Technologies segment increased 16% to reach an all-time high $1.6 billion despite weakness in the automotive market related to chip shortages. We are pursuing a $100 per car content opportunity driven by trends that are reshaping the auto industry and re-imagining the car. We delivered multiple proof points in 2021. Daimler launched the Hyperscreen dashboard display in the Mercedes-Benz EQS. The display features a Gorilla Glass cover nearly 5 feet wide. Building on this momentum, we entered a new automotive product category with our curved mirror solutions. This innovation is enabling the augmented reality head-up display in Hyundai's electric crossover, the IONIQ 5. And Jeep announced a product that brings our tough technical glass into their iconic vehicles. The new Jeep performance parts windshield featuring Gorilla Glass is now a factory installed option on the Wrangler and Gladiator. Additionally, tighter emissions regulations continue to provide a strong content opportunity for our environmental solutions. Our newest generation of gasoline particulate filters helped vehicles including hybrids, achieve even lower levels of fine particulate tailpipe emissions. The contributions of our GPF business provide a strong illustration of our more Corning strategy in action. Since 2017, Environmental Technologies sales have increased more than 40%, while global car sales have decreased by 20%. Let's turn to Mobile Consumer Electronics, where 2021 sales increased 7% and we surpassed the $2 billion in sales for the first time. Since 2016 specialty materials has added nearly $900 million on a base of $1.1 billion in a smartphone market that has been flat to down. As we help our customers deliver new value to their users, more of our content is deployed in each device sold. That is another great illustration of more Corning in action. Our industry leading innovations continued to garner widespread accolades. In fact, SaaS company named Corning the most innovative company in the consumer electronics category for 2021 touting Ceramic Shield, the world's first transparent and color-free glass ceramic as close \u201cvirtually indestructible\u201d and recognizing Gorilla Glass Victus as the toughest Gorilla Glass yet. We continue to see strong demand for both of these premium products. In 2021, more than 125 devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets and laptops, launched featuring Gorilla Glass. And we expanded our capabilities into a new category by introducing Gorilla Glass with DX and DX+ to optimize mobile phone cameras. These composite products create an attractive opportunity to increase our revenue per device. Finally, in 2021, Apple awarded Corning an additional $45 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. To-date, Corning has received $495 million in total from Apple's fund. We are investing in multiple new inventions and innovations for mobile consumer electronics and we are excited about the potential in 2022 and beyond. Turning to Display, our leadership in large glass puts us in a position of strength. 2021 sales grew 17% to $3.7 billion. Our volume exceeded glass market growth as we ramp Gen 10.5 facilities that supply glass for large-sized TVs, which are expected to grow at a high-teens compound annual growth rate over the next several years. In 2022, we expect overall glass supply to remain tight to balanced and the pricing environment to remain favorable. We continue to believe the retail market will grow, led by higher TV unit sales and growth in average screen size. Across our markets, long-term growth drivers are strong and our role is clear. We lead in capabilities that are vital to progress. Our approach provides exciting opportunities for Corning inventions to make a positive impact on the world. And it underscores our commitment to moving the world forward in everything that we do. Now, let me give you some examples outside of the operational context. In 2021, we hosted COVID-19 vaccination clinics at Corning sites around the world. In Reynosa, Mexico, for example, we helped administer more than 100,000 doses of vaccines and boosters to employees and community members. And we provided more than 200,000 diagnostic tests for employees around the world. We kicked off a 5-year $5.5 million partnership with the nation's largest historically black university, North Carolina A&T. Our work will prepare students for STEM careers. We engaged our Board of Directors to provide guidance and resources to our office of racial equality and social unity, utilizing our members' diverse experience, gender, age and ethnicity to advance this new initiative. We achieved gender pay equity globally for all salaried employees and we expanded the reach of our DE&I office with regional business counsels. And finally, we committed to greenhouse gas goals that align with the Paris agreement and we signed solar contracts at Hemlock that will help the world address its renewable energy goals. I feel very good about our efforts to bolster equality inside and outside the company and our progress on our sustainability initiatives. Overall, we continue to build a stronger, more resilient company. We are in the early innings of exciting industry transformations and key trends are converging around our capabilities. You can see it in our results. You can see it in our outlook for 2022 and advancement of new businesses towards significant commercial sales over the next few years. Of course, to keep advancing during Corning's next 170 years, we must focus on growing and developing our leaders. We have a new generation who are stepping up to guide this company to a very exciting phase of its history and into the future. And I am working closely with each of them. To that end, I want to recognize Tony as he prepares to hand over the reins to Ed in just a few weeks. The strong position we are in today certainly reflects the many contributions he has made throughout more than three decades of excellent service to Corning. Tony, we thank you and wish you the very best in retirement. At the same time, I am excited to welcome Ed into the CFO role, which he starts on February 18. Ed has long played a key role in the growth and financial strength of our company. Tony and I have worked closely with him during that time and I look forward to the important contributions he will make in this new position. So, let me turn the call over to Tony and Ed, who will share more details on our results, our priorities and our outlook for 2022. So let's deal with the pricing question first. So first, let's pull out Display for a moment. We provide glass pricing guidance each and every quarter in Display. And you know that we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable. And you just received both what happened in quarter four, which was flat sequential pricing in Display and our guide for flat sequential pricing in quarter one as well. As you look at \u2013 let's take now take all of our other segments, Opto, Life Sciences, auto and MCE. If we take them as a whole, we expect price to be up in total dollars year-over-year. Now each of the businesses is different. There is different types of contracts. And then within each of those, you have different customers and different positions. So it's hard to reach a general statement. But I think as you think about it analytically, basically, we expect prices, as a whole, in those segments to go up. Turning to the $15 billion, I think always for us, that you should be thinking about it primarily as being driven by our growth. The way \u2013 the sort of construct that you heard from Tony is that if you've looked back at this past year, our \u2013 we had cost inflation much higher than a normal year of increasing input costs. And when we're looking at the pricing is that we expect to share that more appropriately with our customers. And the price, together with our more robust cost reduction will put us in a position to offset the inflation we've already experienced as well as what we anticipate for 2022. That allows the volume growth to drop to the gross margin line with our normal sort of robustness and without any sort of friction costs driven by excess inflation. So that's the way we tend to think about the $15 billion. That's the way we think about price, cost and then how it turns into gross margin percentage gains as volume grows and the price actions take effect. The way we tend to think about it cycle-wise, is that first quarter will be the lowest amount of incremental price, then it builds as the year goes on, as more and more of the contracts and increased pricing go into effect and as it applies to more volume just following our normal sort of seasonal cycle in our businesses. It's an excellent question. Like many things, when we wrestle with the issue of inflation, and we try to figure out how to deal with that problem, we learn things and we develop new tools. I would say that our customers have been very fair with us and they have been very favorable discussions. There is a good mutual understanding that we rely on each other. We are real partners. We tend not to be transactional with our customers. And our customers are transactional with us. So, the good news is those long-term nature of those relationships mean that each and every time we evolve that relationship, it tends to last. So, I think it all really depends on what happens with inflation going forward. The key thematic is that we will own our part with the type of rigorous cost reduction we normally do. But for these excess costs, this excess inflation, they have agreed to share that in a more appropriate fashion with us. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, especially for the comments on Tony. I think when you think about specialty, you are just seeing the inverse of what you see this year in terms of margin. We are investing in new programs that are stealth in nature. As the spending has gone up, the investment has gone up as we begin to start to ramp some of those production assets, but they are not totally stable yet, and we are continuing to invest in the product technology. And what we expect is as we work our way through this year, those products will get introduced, they will start generating revenue, we will get more efficient in making them, and therefore, they will turn into profit \u2013 year-over-year profit gains as we work our way through 2022. Yes. I think more on the second half which is, as you know, tends to be relatively typical in mobile consumer electronics. So, it wasn't so much \u2013 it's really just a timing question. It wasn't so much of what goes into effect exactly in Q4, who pushed against us and who did it. Really, it's just \u2013 these are all long-term contract based. And the reason we have these long-term contracts is that our core value creation comes from us making product and having a high transformation value driven by our factories. And the key thing we need to do to drive that ROIC up and to give good streams of earnings to our investors is to make sure we de-risk that capital investment. So, the good news with that is that the way inflation works is that tends to put some dampening of the effective inflation on us because of our fixed cost structure being relatively high. But the downside is that those long-term contracts, you have to actually sit down and renegotiate them. So, what gives us confidence is we have renegotiated them and reached a formal agreement with our customers on this is what their pricing will be. So, it takes time to do that, to reach agreement, what is the appropriate sharing. But the good news is, once you reach agreement, you have agreement and then now we just execute. And that's where we are. Now we are not close with everybody. There is more to do, and that's another reason that some of it builds through the year. Well, thanks for the question on display. We think it's really \u2013 it's an important area because what we have heard from investors is that a key factor weighing on our stock price is a concern that the current cycle of downward price in profits in the LCD panel industry would cause a significant glass price and profit squeeze for Corning. Now what we said in quarter three is that we believe glass supply-demand balance will be tight. And therefore, the glass pricing environment will remain favorable and therefore, we did not expect a significant reduction in our profit stream. We now have a quarter four data. Glass price was flat sequentially. Further, we guided that for quarter one, the glass price will be flat sequentially. Once again, glass supply demand remains tight. So, now we have a more confirmatory evidence to support our belief that the pricing environment will be favorable in 2022. That, I think is the core evidence that we are looking at. Now, when you shift to thinking about the market, retail, full glass out in retail overall is like in the range of what we anticipated, right. And size, we actually expect to do quite well in the coming year. One of the things that happened sort of during the pandemic is that a lot of smaller screens were sold, and that tends to be the place where the units we expected to drop off more and they have, which sort of has the effect of also accelerating, if anything, the diagonal growth on average. That's the way we tend to think about size and retail. Would you guys have anything to add on that? Like as you point out, I won't comment on our specific backlog by product line, but as you point out, if we could make more, we could sell more. And that's why we announced the capacity expansions that we did last year. And we expect those to ramp as the year goes on. With each of those capacity expansions, we need to have in place long-term commitments from our customers. And we have those and that is ramping. So, the real bottleneck isn't resin, isn't raw materials, isn't labor. It is just us being able to get into place capacity that is more appropriately balanced to the demand that we are experiencing. One of interesting dynamics that Ann could maybe sit down with you on afterwards Rod, is from a modeling standpoint. When we did the Hemlock transaction, as you heard from Jeff, we really stood on the semiconductor business, but we picked up all of those solar capabilities that really is an option with that, with inventory that we also had is solar grade. And so just through this year, we sold down a hunk of that inventory, which generated cash nicely. And then now you are really seeing new solar grade poly sign being made by us with the start-up that you are talking about. So, when you work through the modeling, let's have \u2013 and sit down to provide a little bit of help on just sort of how that worked. We don't see a significant inventory sort of overhang for our product. One of the reason is that our demand supply was tight for that product to begin with as we work our way through the year and our content strategy has put a good amount of strain on our ability to supply. So, in general, if you had a point of view on when chips started to come back for auto and as auto production scaled, we would expect to roughly follow that timing."

            "content": "Thank you, Wendell and good morning everyone. Our growth initiatives are succeeding and we delivered another quarter of excellent year-over-year growth that capped off a truly exceptional year. For the full year, sales increased 23% and EPS was up 49%. All of our segments grew with 4 out of 5 increasing sales by a double-digit percentage. It was a strong year even compared to pre-pandemic levels. Since 2019, we have grown sales by 21% and EPS by 18%. We nearly doubled free cash flow to $1.8 billion, which is a conversion rate of 97% for the year. We achieved double-digit ROIC and we utilized our strong cash generation to reward shareholders. We increased our dividend 9% and we reduced our outstanding shares by 5% to the resumption of share repurchases. On so many dimensions, we are feeling great. That said, as you heard from Wendell, our gross margin percentage is not where it should be. In the fourth quarter, gross margin was 36.5%, down 180 basis points sequentially. As expected, below normal auto production and seasonally lower sales in specialty materials reduced profitability. In addition, we restarted idle polysilicon capacity to support Hemlock's new long-term solar contracts thus incurring temporary startup cost. We expect to expand gross margin percent throughout the year. We negotiated pricing increases in long-term customer contracts to more appropriately share the higher cost that we are experiencing. These increases take effect and accelerate throughout the year. As always, we expect to deliver on a robust cost reduction program. The combined benefits of these efforts should offset the cumulative inflation we experienced over the last year and what we anticipate for 2022. Our gross and operating margins will also benefit from growing volume. Our operating leverage is such that additional volume drives good incremental profitability and becomes even more apparent as we offset inflation. We expect volume increases throughout the year. As our volumes increase and our pricing actions take effect, our gross margin percent will grow. As a reminder, the first quarter is usually our lowest volume quarter of the year. We expect Specialty Materials to improve on its normal cycle, with Q1 typically being the lowest quarter of the year. Environmental Technologies sales will improve with the resolution of the chip shortage, which we expect to happen later in the year. And Optical Communications will grow as we fill the capacity that we're adding to meet growing demand. For the year, we expect price increases cost reductions and volume growth. Putting this all together, we expect Q1 to be the lowest gross margin percent quarter of the year and for gross margin to grow from there. Now let's take a closer look at performance in each of our businesses during the fourth quarter and the full year. Let's begin with Optical Communications. Fourth quarter sales were up 7% sequentially, exceeding $1.2 billion. Net income increased to 12%. For the full year, sales grew 22% to $4.3 billion, and net income was up 51%. We grew significantly faster than the passive optical market. National and regional carriers increased capital spending on 5G and broadband projects. Additionally, enterprise sales were up as customers increase spending on data center builds. Full year net income grew 51% driven by the incremental volume despite cost headwinds related to materials and logistics. We're entering 2022 with a sales run rate 25% higher than where we started in 2021, and we have a strong order book. We continue to see significant public and private investments in fiber infrastructure as operators work to expand capacity, capability and access, and we expect a large multiyear wave of growth. In fact, we believe private carrier and public infrastructure investments will push the market into double-digit growth. We're adding capacity to capture the growing demand, and we feel really good about our position as the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions. Turning to Display, in the fourth quarter, sales were $942 million, up 12% year-over-year and net income was $252 million, up 16% year-over-year. For the full year, sales were $3.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Net income reached $960 million, up 34% year-over-year. The pricing environment was favorable throughout the year, and our excellent operational performance allowed us to continue to lead the market. In the third quarter, we provided detail about our perspective on the Display industry based on three main factors: Retail demand, panel makers production and glass makers' ability to supply panel makers. Our fourth quarter performance and first quarter outlook reaffirm our expectations. We continue to expect that glass at retail will grow in 2022 by high single digits, driven by TV unit and screen size growth. We expect display glass pricing to be flat sequentially in the first quarter and supply-demand balance for display glass to be tight. We expect glass supply-demand to remain tight to balanced in 2022 and the pricing environment to remain favorable. Overall, we are very pleased with Display's performance in 2021, and we feel good about our outlook for 2022. We're operating from a position of strength, and we intend to build on our momentum as we move forward. In Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $353 million, down 9% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Fourth quarter net income was $54 million, down 10% sequentially and 42% year-over-year on lower sales volume. These declines were driven by auto production constraints created by the semiconductor chip shortage that began in the second quarter of last year. As expected, this negatively impacted profitability for the segment and the company. Now even with this temporary setback caused by the chip shortage, for the full year, we were able to deliver double-digit sales growth, enabled by our content-driven growth strategy. Full year sales were nearly $1.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in heavy-duty diesel and greater adoption of gas particulate filters. For the full year, net income was $269 million, up 37% year-over-year. As we look ahead, we're confident that our content-driven approach will continue to drive outperformance. And when the automotive market rebounds with the resolution of the chip shortage, we expect significant growth from current levels. Turning to Specialty Materials, sales were $518 million, down 7% sequentially on normal seasonality. Sales were down 5% year-over-year versus a strong Q4 in 2020 following the launch of Ceramic Shield. Fourth quarter net income was $92 million, down sequentially and year-over-year, driven by the lower sales volume. Full year sales were up 7% and exceeded $2 billion, driven by continued strong sales of premium cover materials. Demand also remains strong for advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturing as the broader end market continues to experience robust growth. Despite sales being up, full year net income was down as we invested strongly in new innovations that will be commercialized in the coming year. We have grown sales every year since 2016 through our more Corning approach despite smartphone unit sales maturing. Over that 5-year period, we've added nearly $900 million in sales on a base of $1.1 billion. Looking ahead, in 2022, we expect sales to grow faster than our underlying markets driven by continuing adoption of our innovations and growth in advanced optics specifically in products for EUV lithography. And as I mentioned here, we expect sales to increase from the seasonal low levels we expect in the first quarter. And finally, turning to Life Sciences, we had a great year with total sales topping $1.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Fourth quarter sales were $317 million, up 16% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by ongoing demand to support the global pandemic response, continued recovery in academic and pharmaceutical research labs and strong demand for bioproduction vessels and diagnostic-related consumables. Full year net income was $194 million, up 40%. Fourth quarter net income was $49 million, up 17% year-over-year. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect our strong growth to continue, driven by COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, strong research funding, lab utilization returning to pre-pandemic levels and growth in the bioproduction segment. I also want to spend a minute on our other segment. As a reminder, the majority of sales in our other segment are in Hemlock Semiconductor Group. During the year, Hemlock saw new demand for solar-grade polysilicon. With the increased activity and interest in U.S.-based solar manufacturing, customers have turned to Hemlock, a leader in polysilicon manufacturing. So in addition to selling polysilicon for use in semiconductors, Hemlock was able to sell solar polysilicon from inventory. Going forward, solar remains a strong revenue opportunity for Hemlock. In the fourth quarter, we signed long-term take-or-pay supply contracts with customer deposits that start to shift in 2022. As a result, we restarted idle capacity with minimal capital investment to meet this demand. As I mentioned earlier, gross margins were impacted in the fourth quarter as we incurred temporary cost to restart solar polysilicon capacity. This will improve throughout the year as solar production increases. Additionally, our auto glass and pharmaceutical packaging emerging businesses are also in the other segment. And both businesses significantly grew sales during the year as well. Stepping back, we made strong progress across all of our businesses in 2021. We entered new product categories, announced collaboration with key industry leaders and contributed to significant industry advancements. We're building a strong foundation for future growth. This combined with our consistent focus on innovation and deep commitment to RD&E is what continues to fuel and sustain Corning's leadership position across its markets. Looking ahead, we expect Corning sales and EPS to grow year-over-year in the first quarter. We expect sales to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion and EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.53. Sales are down sequentially due to typical seasonal volume declines. For the full year, we expect sales of approximately $15 billion and profit to grow faster than sales. Before I turn things over to Ed, I'd like to take a moment to express my gratitude. First, to all Corning employees whose dedication and commitment to this great company is such an inspiration. Second, to those of you on the call and all our shareholders, for being, with being on this journey with us, we're working hard every day to maintain your trust and reward your confidence in us. And finally, I'd like to thank Wendell, Ed and my fellow members of Corning's senior leadership team. I'm proud to have played a role in building the strong foundation Corning has today. It's truly been a wonderful journey. As Ed takes the reins in just a few weeks, I'm fully confident in his ability to build on this foundation and continue creating value for all our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Ed. Thank you, Wamsi. I appreciate it. Yes. I think the short answer to that is, for sure, we think that margins will expand in this business for all the reasons that Wendell just explained I mean. First, we are taking pricing actions here that's where a lot of our long-term supply agreements are and those will roll out through the year. And then secondly, when you combine it with the volume increase that we expect, so yes, we expect our margins to increase. And in terms of AT&T, obviously, they are a very important customer for us, and we continue to see the benefits from that relationship. Yes. I mean, it's \u2013 Martin, I mean it's clearly going to roll out at different times at different pace by customers. We would expect to see some of it start kicking-in in Q1 and then accelerate from there. What we would expect to have happen is Q1 being our lowest quarter from a gross margin standpoint. And then when you add the sales volume increase that we expect, as we described how those dynamics work, we would expect gross margin to expand from there throughout the year. Thanks Steve. Sure. I mean, I think that if you look back over the last several years, it's actually been a pretty significant improvement in ROIC. And it was clearly one of our focuses, both on the original strategy and capital allocation framework. But if you go back to what we talked about in 2019, it was a very specific commitment to get to at least above 10% level, which I am really proud of the fact that we accomplished that in 2021, especially when you think about the challenges from a pandemic standpoint. But for sure, continuing to expand ROIC, which is kind of the ultimate measure of profitability is a real focus area for us. And so that also remains a high priority from a financial management standpoint. Thanks. No, I think that's exactly right. I mean our expectations for the year really haven't changed. They are pretty well in line from a unit standpoint with what third-party people in the industry are looking at. And the screen size, we are very confident in. I mean, 1.5 inch has been pretty consistent for a very long period of time. And when you look at the growth above 65 inches TVs over the last year, it just confirms that 1.5 inch. We feel very confident about that. Thanks, George. Thanks, Rod. Well, for sure, Rod, our approach from a buyback standpoint is first, we generate very strong operating cash flow. And our first priority is to invest that in our business and our growth and sustained leadership. And then obviously, once we have done that, we want to return the cash to shareholders. As Ed mentioned, we have increased the dividend in 2021, and we expect to increase the dividend in 2022. And then we will be opportunistic on buybacks. And we saw Q4 as a really great opportunity to buy back shares where the stock price was, and we will continue to pursue buybacks on an opportunistic basis."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Corning Incorporated, Quarter 3, 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instruction]. It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning's quarter 3 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the Company's financial reports. You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data.  Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the Third Quarter, the largest differences between our GAAP and core results stem from non-cash mark-to-market losses associated with the Company's currency hedging contracts, and non-cash impairment charges. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts in foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market. And recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though these contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. This decreased GAAP earnings in Q3 by $16 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.  Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth, and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We have received more than $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the interactive analyst center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now, I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported strong third quarter results that continue a year of outstanding sales growth, margin expansion, and significant cash generation. Sales grew 21% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, a new all-time high. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points sequentially, and 70 basis points year-over-year to 38.3%. EPS grew 30% year-over-year to $0.56, and free cash flow of $0.5 billion brought cumulative free cash generation for the first 9 months of 2021 to $1.3 billion. Our outstanding results in this period of global disruption are due to excellent execution at all levels of the Company, and they're driven by a compelling set of long-term growth opportunities that would account sharing through our innovations and broad market access, as we strengthen our commercial relationships and scale operations to meet demand.  Like everyone, we're dealing with numerous factors caused by the pandemic and the resulting inflation. In this quarter, the largest macro impact was constraints in the automotive industry, stemming from chip and component shortages. Auto production in the third quarter is estimated to be down nearly 20% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. As a result, we stepped down in light duty sales. Across our businesses, we prioritize delivering for our customers in a complex inflationary environment. and we have delivered despite incurring extra costs. Now we're taking additional actions, including pricing to address these costs and maintain our ability to invest and support our customers. And you'll hear of more from Tony on this in just a few minutes.  Against this backdrop, we feel really good about our performance. In the quarter, announcements with industry leaders illustrated the power of our portfolio, demonstrating not only our relevance across multiple markets, but also our role as a key innovation partner. Our start position stems from a complimentary set of 3 core technologies, 4 proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms, and 5 market access platforms. We're leaders in each. We generate growth opportunities by delivering combinations and new applications of these capabilities to help our customers drive their industries forward. And in doing so, we drive more Corning content into the products people are already buying.  Let me share some highlights from the quarter. In optical communications, the industries in the early innings of large deployments in support of 5G, broadband, and the cloud. Momentum is building, and we see it confirmed by multiple sources. First is network need. Demand on network is significantly higher than pre -pandemic levels. Broadband usage for September was up 32% versus pre -pandemic levels, and up 9% versus September 2020 when remote work and school were largely in play. Global 5G subscriptions have grown to almost 0.5 billion this year. More applications are moving to the Cloud, and global data creation is expected to grow at 23% compound annual growth rate from 2020 to 2055. Versus 2020, Cloud revenue industry-wide is up nearly 50%.  The second confirmation of strong industry momentum can be seen in the announcements from leading companies. On AT&T's earnings call last week, their CEO said they're on a march to deploy fiber at scale. They're working toward passing 5 million homes per year. In the quarter, we announced a strategic investment to support their growth plans. Speaking about our expanded collaboration, AT&T said the expansion of fiber infrastructure is central to the growth of broadband reach for consumers as well as business customers. [inaudible 00:08:50] recently shared that they plan to reach 10 million more homes with fiber by the end of 2025 with their CEO saying, ''Our future is fiber''. Cloud deployments are also expanding. Microsoft CEO said that over the past year, they added new data center clusters in 15 countries across 5 continents in support of their cloud business. The third confirmation is power substantial increase in sales and continued order book momentum. This is perhaps the most important indicator of growth over the next few quarters. We evolve. We are ramping capacity and we are energized. Across the business, we're driving strong year-over-year [inaudible 00:09:51] growth, and we're outperforming the optical market as we continue to commercialize innovations that extend our competitive advantage, and as we provide more solutions to more customers at both the regional and national levels. During the quarter, we introduced the newest additions to our Evolv portfolio, which includes solutions designed to support role deployments. We also introduced our ever-on millimeter wave indoor small cell systems, which deliver 5G -ready coverage in high-density environments, including office buildings, factories, hotels, hospitals, and classrooms. Let's turn to mobile consumer electronics. Here, we're helping transform the smartphone experience.  As we help our customers deliver new value to their users, we drive more of our content into each device sold. This played out well during the quarter with the launch of Samsung's Galaxy V Fold 3 and Galaxy V Flip 3. Both devices feature Gorilla Glass Victus. Now, they also utilize our new Gorilla Glass with DX on the lenses of the rear cameras. This is ore Corning in action. We've expanded our capabilities into a new category, device cameras. Even though the lens is a fraction of the surface area we addressed with our cover material, the value we had is high. And we're capturing a very attractive opportunity to increase our revenue per device. Samsung is also featuring Gorilla Glass with DX on the new Galaxy Watch4.  Turning to automotive. OEMs in designing cleaner, safer vehicles, and distinguishing themselves with technologies that enhance the driving experience. Corning is uniquely suited to address these trends. And we're pursuing a $100 per car content opportunity, across emissions and AutoGlass solutions. In the quarter, Jeep announced a product that brings our top technical glass into their iconic vehicles. Their new Jeep Performance Parts windshield featuring Gorilla Glass is now a factory-installed option on the 2021 Wrangler and Gladiator. We're making the windshields lightweight, durable, and up to 3 times more impact-resistant than regular windshields.  Additionally, tighter emissions regulations continue to provide a strong content opportunity for our environmental solutions. OEMs need higher filtration performance, and we've responded with a new generation of gasoline particular filters. The importance of our GPF business drives home my ongoing point; it's not about more cars, it's about more Corning in those cars. Since 2017, our auto sales are up more than 40% while global car sales are down 20%. Turning to display. We're in a position of strength for 2 reasons, for significantly more profitable than our competitors. Second, the market for large-size TVs is projected to grow at a double-digit compound annual growth rate through 2024.  And we're leader in Gen 10.5, which is the most economical approach for larger sets. Stepping back, we've all seen the declines in panel pricing and we're beginning to see panel maker utilization adjustments. Now, lower demand provides us an opportunity to minimize expedited freight and to rebuild tanks that have operated beyond end-of-life. Taking these actions will allow us to keep our supply balance to demand. We expect the overall glass supply to remain tight, and the glass pricing environment to remain attractive. Tony will give you more details on our industry position and our outlook.  Finally, in life sciences, word delivering growth on multiple fronts. We're seeing ongoing demand in support of the global pandemic response. And our inventions are helping advanced the transition to sell and gene-based therapies. Additionally, we're making progress on our multi-billion-dollar content opportunity in pharmaceutical packaging. We're expanding our comprehensive portfolio, advancing key partnerships, and building our customer base. Corning continues to support the pandemic response, and its portfolio of advanced vials and pharmaceutical glass tubing has enabled the delivery of more than 3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines.  Our high-volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina is now operational, which will help us scale with demand. In total, we believe our efforts to address the pandemic are enabling permanent industry shifts. That means a future pharmaceutical packaging landscape defined by enhanced patient safety, lower cost, minimal regulatory hurdles, and increased capacity for life-saving drugs. Other efforts that have gained increased attention during pandemic are finding broader long-term applications. We introduced Corning Guardiant. A paint additive that uses a glass matrix to trap copper ions.  A powerful and long used antimicrobial material. Paint with Guardiant has been proven to kill 99.9% of bacteria and viruses, including the one that causes COVID-19. This month, PPG announced that their Copper Armor paint powered by Guardiant received EPA registration and will be available in major U.S. retail and home improvement stores. PPG noted that it's the first virus-killing paint in the U.S. And our collaboration builds on an EPA statement asserting that public health would benefit from surfaces with built-in antimicrobial capabilities.  Stepping back, I am proud of the many ways our people unleashed the power of our portfolio in the quarter, and when our performance says about Corning's strong position today. Key trends are converging around our capabilities, as we become more and more vital to industry transformations driving the world forward. This provides a compelling set of long-term growth opportunities. and we're executing well to bring those opportunities to life and make a difference wherever we can. So, I want to thank our dedicated employees for their contributions. Now, I'll close by briefly looking back at 2019 when we outlined our priorities for growth and shareholder returns for the next several years.  We provided attractive targets, as we laid out our plans to building even bigger, stronger Company that delivers sustainable results. Today, the growth drivers we laid out remain intact and we're delivering on our goals. We are a bigger, stronger Company than we were in 2019, and we are continuing to grow. Tony will get into more specifics. But I feel really good about our position and the progress that we've made. I look forward to updating you when we close out a strong year. And as we grow again in 2022. Now, I will turn the call over to Tony so that he can give you some more insight on the quarter.\nTony Tripeny: Thank you, Wendell, and good morning everyone. Strong execution resulted in another outstanding quarter. We are on track to reach $14 billion in sales and over $2 in EPS, making significant progress extending our market leadership while scaling operations to meet demand, and we expect to grow again in 2022. During the third quarter, sales increased 21% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, led by the strength in optical communications and the strong performance in our other businesses. EPS grew 30% year-over-year to $0.56. Sales and earnings reflect lower production levels in the automotive industry due to the semiconductor chip shortage. The impact of Corning's results was approximately $40 million in sales and $0.02 of EPS.  Gross margin percent expanded 50 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year to 38.3%, despite a net impact of 150 basis points from supply chain challenges and inflationary headwinds. Free cash flow grew to $497 million, with cash generation of $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of the year. These achievements are particularly noteworthy because we are operating in the face of unprecedented logistical challenges and component shortages. Delivering for customers in this complex environment requires both decisive action and agility. Our ability to sense disruption and act quickly has been key to running our plants well and meeting our customer\u2019s needs. And we're leveraging our diversified global supply chain to continue to meet customer demand.  In fact, I'd be remiss if I didn't recognize the efforts of our global supply management and operations teams that have allowed us to maintain a steady supply of raw materials, while finding creative shipping strategies. Their actions have enabled us to effectively deliver for our customers, and they're providing actionable insight into the current dynamic environment. At the same time, we continue to incur additional costs as we work to meet strong customer demand. And while we've been taking actions to mitigate them, certain costs continue to elevate in the third quarter. For example, we were able to offset a significant portion of elevated freight cost, but resin prices increased again.  Therefore, our margin is temporarily muted. Given this ongoing inflationary environment, we have price increases underway across all of our businesses. We saw some benefit from these actions in the third quarter, and their impact should accelerate in the fourth quarter and into 2022. Now, we don't expect the environment to improve in the short-term, but our digital supply chain capabilities enabled real-time visibility into emerging situations, allowing us to proactively address issues. We remain focused on meeting demand, expanding our margins, and protecting our ability to invest for customers. Now let's take a closer look at the performance in each of our businesses during the third quarter.  In display technology, sales were $956 million up 2% sequentially, and 16% year-over-year. Corning's glass volume grew slightly, and glass prices increased moderately sequentially as expected. Glass supply continues to be tight, and we continue to do everything we can to meet customer demand. We expect fourth quarter glass prices to be consistent with the third quarter. Now, I know there is a lot of discussion about the display industry. Briefly, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable, as glass supply remains tight to balance throughout 2022. Now, as we've discussed previously, we based our perspective on what will happen in the display market on three main factors: retail demand, panel makers' production, and glassmakers' ability to supply the panel makers.  With those factors in line, I'll start with what I said about retail demand on our last earnings call in July. Since LCD televisions emerged as a mainstream technology in 2004, LCD TV units have only been down 3 times and never 2 years in a row. Since 2014, TV sell-through units are typically range -bound between 225 and 235 million, which average screen size grows about 1.5 inches a year. In 2020, global television units increased 4% above the trend line to about 242 million. Screen size growth was about 1.2 inches, about 20% below trend. A lot of smaller TVS sold probably to accommodate more people living, working, and studying from home.  Entering this year, we expected and continue to expect the market to reverse the trend, implying a decrease in TV units, especially smaller televisions, and for normal screen size growth of 1.5 inches to return. We now have 9 months of retail data under our belts, and it is confirmatory. Television units declined by about 10% year-over-year, while average screen size growth is in line with the 1.5 inches per year trend. Unit volume for TV 65 inches or larger increased by a mid-teen percentage, and smaller TVs were down by a mid-teen percentage. So, 3 quarters through the year, our expectation for TV units being down year-over-year, and screen size growing approximately an inch - and -a-half are playing out. Looking ahead to 2022.  We think TV units and screen size will continue to follow historical trends; a nd retail glass demand will be up. That means television units will be within the typical range of 225 to 235 million units, and average screen size will grow about an inch - and -a-half. Now, remember, television units which are declining this year have never declined two years in a row, and next year is a World Cup year, and TV units have never declined in a World Cup year. Finally, the biggest driver of retail glass growth in most years is the increase in screen size. We would expect the average screen size to once again grow 1.5 inches next year.  In summary, we expect glass demand at retail to be up by a high single-digit percentage in 2022, as measured in square feet. Now let's move from retail to panel makers. After a period of high production in 2020 and 2021 to meet strong demand, we are now seeing panel makers temporarily reducing their utilization given the lower 2021 retail demand that we told you about all year. And that is happening just as we would expect. Now, finally, let's move to the glass industry, which struggled to meet demand in 2020 and 2021, as glass has remained tight. Like other glassmakers, we've depleted our inventories, expedited shipping, and operated tanks beyond their targeted end the life.  We will use this period of temporarily lower panel maker utilizations to shutdown end-of-life tanks and rebuild them with our latest technology. We will also take the opportunity to work our way out of expedited shipping. These actions keep our supply balance to demand, and will improve our operating costs going forward. But rest assured, we will still have capacity to supply all of our customers anticipated glass demand. When panel [inaudible 00:30:48] production ramps to meet the expected high single-digit retail demand growth in 2022, we'll be fully prepared with our revitalized fleet of tanks. Overall, we believe glass supply will be tight the balance, throughout 2022.  And since glass pricing is primarily driven by glass supply demand balance, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable in Q4, and also throughout 2022. Moving to optical communications, we saw strong growth across the business with sales exceeding $1.1 billion up 24% year-over-year, and 5% sequentially. Net income was $139 million up 21% year-over-year. Net income declined 6% sequentially, as increased raw material and shipping costs significantly impacted profitability. During the quarter, carriers spent more on 5G and broadband projects.  This, along with the continued strong pace of enterprise cloud data center builds, drove our strong performance. Demand on networks is at an all-time high, setting the stage for significant investments in fiber infrastructure, as operators expand network capacity, capabilities, and access. During the quarter, we announced the collaboration with AT&T. Our capacity expansion will allow AT&T to expand investments in fiber infrastructure, expand U.S. broadband networks, and accelerate 5G deployment. We are well-positioned to capture significant ongoing growth, as network and data center investment increases. Our solutions improve the speed and capital efficiency deployments.  Additionally, Corning is the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. In environmental technologies, our third quarter sales were $385 million, up 2% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. As everyone knows, chip shortages are having a big impact on the auto industry. At the start of 2021, global vehicle production was expected to be about 88 million. By July, the industry was projecting below 85 million. And given continued chip and component constraints, forecast now anticipate out-of-production around 75 million for the year.  This pullback in production began to impact us in the middle of the quarter, and we expected to continue for the fourth quarter. We estimate an impact on EPS in the third quarter of about $0.02, and we expect additional impact in the fourth quarter. The good news is that when component shortages resolved, auto-production will recover because end-market demand remained strong, and we will be prepared to meet the growing demand. Specialty materials delivered sales of $556 million up 15% sequentially, and in line with the strong third quarter in 2020 when we introduced ceramic shield. we've grown specialty sales every year from 2016 to today despite smartphone unit sales being roughly flat.  Over that 5-year period, we've almost doubled our sales on a base of more than $1 billion. Clearly, we are successfully executing our objective of driving more content into each device sold. And strong demand continues for our premium cover materials. During the quarter, our glass innovations were featured in 30 new devices, including smartphones, wearables, and laptops. Demand also remains strong for our advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturer -- manufacturing as the broader end market continues to experience robust growth. In the quarter, investments in innovations that are moving towards commercialization resulted in lower net income than in 2020.  As we've noted before, newer innovations can face high cost as we develop and scale our manufacturing process. We anticipate that profitability will improve, as we come up the learning curve and improve utilization. Looking into the fourth quarter, we're seeing typical volume declines in Gorilla Glass, following the build supporting flagship customer product launches. Life Sciences third quarter sales were $305 million up 37% year-over-year, driven by ongoing demand to support the global pandemic response, continued recovery in the academic and pharmaceutical research labs, and strong demand for bio-production vessels and diagnostic-related consumables.  Our Life Sciences segment is outpacing the overall industry as evidenced by our sales CAGR of 9% over the last 3 years. Stepping back, we have made strong progress across all of our businesses. We entered new product categories, announced collaborations with key industry leaders, and contributed to significant industry advancements. We're building a strong foundation for future growth. This combined with our consistent focus on innovation and deep commitment to RD&E, is what continues to fuel and sustain Corning's leadership position across its markets. As we look ahead to Q4, we expect core sales to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion and Core EPS in the range of 0.50 to 0.55.  Profitability is expected to decline sequentially due to the further reduction on automotive-related sales, as I mentioned, and lower Gorilla Glass sales, following strong customer launches. That said, we expect to close out 2021 with both top and bottom-line growth, and another year of strong cash flow, and we expect our momentum to continue in 2022 with sales and EPS growth along with strong cash generation. Now I'd like to expand on windows closing point. Back in 2019, we outlined our goals for growth and shareholder returns. We said we would leverage our focused and cohesive portfolio to extend our leadership and capture significant growth opportunities.  And we said that key trends would continue to converge around our capabilities. What we said back in 2019 still rings true today. Despite the pandemic and the resulting global disruptions. Our key growth drivers are all intact, some are even accelerating. and we're on track or even ahead of the goals we laid out in 2019 in all our market access platforms. Since 2019, sales have grown at a 10% CAGR ahead of the 6% to 8% target. Now, we have been growing EPS at a rate consistent with sales, which puts us ahead of our target, which puts us behind our target because inflationary pressures are clearly impacting profitability.  But we do expect that our cost and pricing actions will deliver significant improvement over time. As we said, we would do, we're also growing our return on invested capital. Today, our total Company ROIC is in the double-digits. Our most recent capacity expansions, or as we like to call them build investments, are fully ramped, have enabled the $2.5 billion of sales we've added since 2019, and are delivering more than 20% ROIC. Our aggregate free cash flow generation for 2020 and 2021 is expected to be more than $2.5 billion. Finally, we remain steadfast in our commitment to investing in growth and extending our leadership, while returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and a 10% annual increase in our dividend. As you might remember, we decided early in the pandemic to ensure the stability and flexibility of our financial position by building up our cash reserve.  In April, we resumed share buybacks with the Samsung transaction, where we repurchased 4% of our fully diluted shares. Consistent with our strategy to opportunistically buy back shares, we plan to do more repurchases in Q4. In summary, we've built a strong foundation over the last several years. Our capabilities are relevant to major growth trends across our markets. Our more Corning strategy is working. And we're executing through some very volatile end-markets, extending relationships and commitments with our customers, extending our leadership position, and generating outstanding sales, profits, and free cash flow. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Tony. Michelle, we're already for our first question.\nOperator: As a reminder, [ Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt Niknam : Hey, I thank you for taking the questions. Just 2 if I could. First on the price increases, you mentioned the increases across all units. I'm just wondering if you can give us maybe a little bit more color in terms of how we should anticipate that the flow-through. I know you initiated some of these in 3Q, but I'm wondering how to think about the cadence and the flow through there order of magnitude. And then just wondering if this is really intended to effectively pass through the entirety of some of the cost pressure you're facing or whether it's just a portion of that.  And then just secondarily, as we think about capital allocation, Tony, maybe to your last point around doing a little bit more on buybacks in 4Q. I'm just wondering if you could refresh us in terms of how you're thinking about leverage, where you would like to be? And ultimately how you see Corning getting closer to that 2x leverage target you've laid out in the past. Thanks.\nTony Tripeny : First on in terms of the price increases, I mean, clearly our priorities over the last year or so with the pandemic is to protect our people and protect our customers. And we have been doing a great job on that, on those priorities. And we saw it in Q3, which is an incredibly challenging environment, but require decisive action and agility, and we had to act quickly, and we've done that. And I'm personally very proud of what -- all the work we've done as a Company and is what you'd expect at Corning. But what tends to happen in this environment is that you see some places where we made improvements on from a cost and freight standpoint and others that have gone up, and all of this comes at a cost. Our goal here is to increase prices across all of our businesses.  We've had about 150 basis points impact for the last several quarters. I'd expect that to continue in the next quarter and then for it to get better over time. But the actual timing and prediction of that, it's just hard to know because there's so many moving pieces. So tried to do Matt, on pricing here is you have a range of what could happen with inflationary pressures, and then we have a range of what could happen with our pricing in each of our different businesses and even in each of our different products. And what we tried to do is capture those within the guidance that we just gave for quarter four. And as we continue to gain experience on both, we would expect to get better and better at being able to narrow those ranges, and improve our ability to give you a good idea on how this will impact your models.\nWendell Weeks : Then in terms of from a balance sheet standpoint, clearly, we have a very strong set of goals from a balance sheet standpoint in an amount of leverage we're comfortable with, and in particular, very long maturities from a leverage standpoint. We do have the longest maturity in the S&P 500. And that overall approach has not really changed, but we're right -- we're still being impacted by what's happening from a global economic standpoint, so we're going to continue to work through where things go. And the good news is that we're generating tremendous amount of free cash flow. And with that free cash flow, that gives us the ability to invest in the business, but also to return cash to shareholders.\nAnn Nicholson : Thanks, Tony. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee : Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask [Indiscernible] of today's communication and what you're seeing from a demand perspective there. We've heard about all of the different -- the overall sentiment there on demand coming from a lot of the broadband connectivity around the government subsidized plans is the delay on the government's side driving any slowdown there. And just moving over to capacity there, if you go -- outline the expansion capacity, as well recently, please help understand, if you can, the magnitude of that expansion and its potential impact on margin as you build that capacity up as well. Thank you.\nTony Tripeny : I want to make sure that I understand your question. So, you are asking how do we feel about the growth in the business, and as that growth occurs, how do we feel about our margin expansion as that capacity ramps? Do I understand your question correctly Samik?\nSamik Chatterjee : Yes, I'm doing the addition to that as we dive in the government infrastructure plan, driving any slowdown in terms of [Indiscernible].\nTony Tripeny : Great. So first, as I laid out in my comments, we feel that the growth here in the business is very strong. You saw and I think in the quarter, we've had $1.1 billion of revenue. Our order book was in excess of that, stronger than that rate. So that gives you an idea of the demand that we're seeing right now, and that is before there's any passage. It's in the bipartisan infrastructure bill on what it is the government wants to do with broad debt. So that new layer on top of the demand that we're seeing that is largely say, already serving commercial and customer opportunities. So that's how we feel about demand.  All those long-term trends that we see, they look like they're all continuing in both Cloud and carrier networks. Now, margin. So, in margin expansion, this is a segment where we've given the really strong demand. We have had a lot of expedited shipping. We've had a lot of challenges around freight and we've had accelerating raw material costs. So, we haven't been putting quite the increase in our margins that you would normally expect as we fill out, right? That's one of the reasons that we're going to be addressing price with our customers, who we have done all these long-term build investments with. And hopefully what that's going to do is get the type of margin growth that you really expect with our rising revenue growth, Samik. Does that make sense to you, sir?\nSamik Chatterjee : Yes. Thank you. Thank you for taking my question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open.\nShannon Cross : Thank you very much. Wendell, at the risk of continuing on this topic. I'm just curious. Can we dig more into the inflationary environment? I'm trying to understand when you guys have a really great perspective, I think, of how transitory versus permanent shift you're seeing out there, and what should we watch given the impacts to your margins, what specifically should we watch closely to see if things are starting to improve?\nWendell Weeks : Great. It\u2019s a great question, Shannon. I would say if you had asked us when this all began, say in late quarter 2, in quarter 3, like in that time period. We would have said, you know, this is probably transitory and our top priorities are protecting our people and protect our customers, and spend what it takes to make that happen. And we want to keep our customers running like [inaudible 00:50:32], and this too shall pass. And our normal great job that we do, reducing costs will trigger in and we got this.  Actually, it is mainly through conversations with our supply chain head as well as our investors that have led us to look at this and say this may last longer than we had thought. And that this looks like we could continue to have challenged supply chains for the foreseeable future. And what we needed to do was add to our priorities that we also needed to protect our investors and our ability to invest for the future, which in turn allows us to once again protect our people and protect our customers.  And so, as we've looked at it that way, that is what has led us to start to externalize that cost pressure and we began in quarter 3. We've got a lot further to go. So, I think the thing to look at is pretty simply, how do we do get our profitability of working in the way you would expect when we have revenue growth? Because we're expecting to grow no more less as we grow because we actually make things for a living or you would expect our margins to improve. I think that's the key thing that we're looking at as to see that as well as we have detailed plans like by-customer product by-region and all that is getting rolled out. It\u2019s already in motion.\nShannon Cross : Okay. And then I'm curious, what your initial conversations with some of the customers in areas where you're raising prices now? Is the feeling out there that everything's going up in price, so they're absorbing it, or how much push back you're getting from price increases? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks : Well, it's a little early to tell to generalize on that. That depends on the customer. We've had some who have said, [Indiscernible], I was expecting this. We have others who say, thank you very much for sharing, but we rather you fixed this on your own. But we'll work our way through it. I think the key to all is to understand about how we are with our customers, is this a very long-term partnership. And we invest for the long term, and we ask for strong commitments from them and they ask for strong commitments from us. But we face that future, all of us are looking at the future when we make these investments in innovation.  And our plans, that is a little uncertain. And so, the way we always try to work through things with our customers is, okay, this is where we're at. This is reality. How do we work through it together in a way that allows you, our customer to continue to succeed and allows us to continue to support that success. And that's the tone and attitude that we bring to it and that our customers engage in that same dialogue. we'll all play out, and I'm so certain that as we work our way through it, we'll reach a fair resolution of what happened. We operate in an inflationary environment at least for a period of time, which neither our customers nor us have had a lot of experience with.\nShannon Cross : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open.\nSteven Fox : Hi, good morning. I was wondering if maybe you could put some numbers around all that commentary. So, if I look at Optical, for example, your revenues were up 5% quarter-over-quarter, but your margins were 12-3 versus 13-8 in the prior quarter. So how much exactly was the pressure from all those extra costs and adding new capacity, hindering margins when volumes are going up? And then same question on pricing for display. You're saying it's consistent with prior quarter. I assume that's like flat 0% change in pricing, but last quarter you were able to pass through some costs. Does that mean you're not passing through cost this quarter? Thanks so much.\nTony Tripeny : Great. So first in [Indiscernible], that margin drag that you've rightly identified, Steve, that's the inflationary pressures that we have yet to offset with our customers. So, I think you're right on and what we'd like to do is see that drag moderate. And as you know, our Optical businesses big with a lot of customers. So, it's a lot of commercial work to get everything in place. Already began and already gotten rolling in this last quarter, and we will gain and accelerate in quarter 4. So that's what we'll be about in [Indiscernible] and you're looking at the right numbers and that's the numbers you should expect to improve. In display, we expect the price to be consistent with our raised pricing in quarter 3.\nWendell Weeks : And in quarter 2\nTony Tripeny : And in quarter 2. So, we're following a couple of price raises, and we anticipate our price to be consistent in quarter 4.\nSteven Fox : So that just -- that implies that you're still passing through some of these inflation costs in that price; is that correct?\nTony Tripeny : That is correct.\nSteven Fox : Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Roberts : Thanks, and congratulations on all the new product wins. You're now on OEM windshield options for a number of Jeep models versus primarily replacement before. Will the wind shield option be packaged with other options so if you want the better stereo and the better seats, you're going to get the Gorilla Glass windshield with that or is it going to be a la carte? And you're on the replacement windshield in the Ford F-150, which is an even bigger model, do you think that's going to go OEM anytime soon?\nTony Tripeny : I think that's a great question. I need to follow up to see how is Jeep going to do that. I just need to follow up, because right now it's just if like you want a vehicle. You tend to get them highly bundled. But I don't know what the difference is between how they're seeking to optimize their very few chips, and how much is really a long-term approach. Let me follow up on this -- on that and we'll get back to you, John. On windshields, I think, you'll continue to watch this pace.  We've got a number of significant innovations going on to solve the glazing problems that EVs represent and that autonomy represents. It's too early, I think, John, for us to -- for me to say definitively to you that we have this, start building in another large revenue generator for us. But in [Indiscernible] to resolve it, we [Indiscernible] be able to say that within the coming 12 months because they're so -- we're doing so much work in that space. And we're seeing an uptake in a number of places of our laminated product and some other innovations that we have going on. So, the very right to identify just a little early for us to call the ball, John.\nJohn Roberts : And then, could we get an update on Hemlock? It's ironic that we have such strong semiconductor demand and you've got this -- the contractual structures in place really that Hemlock's not participating.\nTony Tripeny : So, we're really happy that we are the owners of Hemlock, John. And I think you're one of the few people that we have this fall that really always understood Hemlock in depth and you always wanted us to be the owner of Hemlock. And finally, after all these years, we are. And we're happy to get it. As you know, semiconductor demand is strong. I think the other added revenue source that we're now seeing in Hemlock is in solar, which as you know, we idled a hunk of our capacity in solar as the U.S. supply chain ended up downstream of us, becoming eroded with the intense competitive environment with China.  We are now seeing really strong demand in solar, and we are doing what you would expect us to do, which is if a customer wants us to commit capacity to them in solar, we're putting in place those same type, very strong contractual arrangements to be able to make sure as we turn up some of that capacity that they buy it. And you're going -- you'll see that in our revenues. And so, we feel very good about it, John. We should have listened to you even earlier.\nJohn Roberts : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. I was wondering when you talk about retail demand and last up, high single-digits in 2022, do you expect Corning to grow in line or higher or lower than that? And then I have some follow-ups, please.\nTony Tripeny : Yeah, Wamsi. As you know, well, a lot of that growth is occurring is in the Gen 10 or is in the large size screen TVs. And that's where us went having 3 out of the 4 Gen 10.5 factories, makes a big difference. So, we would expect that to continue to positively impact our results in 2022, just like it has the last couple of years. We tend to think about -- I'm sorry, you had an additional question, sir?\nWamsi Mohan : No. Please, Wendell goes ahead and I will follow up.\nWendell Weeks : Okay. The way we tend to -- I think you're on one of the real key points. So as Tony said, there are 2 key factors to keep in mind for display, and they really drive display at the demand of the retail level, which we believe will be up single-digits next year, and then glass supply demand balance, which we believe are going to be tight to balance in quarter 4 and throughout 2022. And as a result, we believe the glass environment for pricing is going to continue to be favorable. When we say tight to balance, what we mean is that we're coming out of this time period, I mean, if we're out of it yet, where glass has just been a very tight and we have been extending tanks beyond their planned life.  We've had very high expediting costs and we have delayed technology upgrades really for the last year plus. And so, what our plan is, is to take any opportunity presented by lower panel maker utilization to take targeted tanks down for upgrades while improving service levels with lower expediting costs. Now, the timing for these is slowly within Corning's control. First goal is we plan to meet our customers' demand. We're going to continue to protect our customers and meet the demand that they think they need. But we're also going to get our fleet ready to lower cost and increased quality for years to come. And as a result, that's what we mean by tight to balance. Our customers get what they need, while we get the -- our upgrades done whenever we can. So that's our approach here, and that's how we feel about display. And while we are providing some insight into next year, as well when we normally just would have told you what's going to happen next quarter.\nWamsi Mohan : That's helpful, Wendell. And if I could just follow-up a clarification question. I think Tony mentioned that in Q4 you'd expect some seasonal softness in specialty given some product launch timing in Q3. But I think you specifically you said Gorilla Glass and I was wondering if that was meant to be as specific as Gorilla Glass versus ceramic shield or was that meant to be a comment about a specialty in Gorilla Glass in general?\nWendell Weeks : So, what a very big question. Tony, what did you mean? I would've thought it meant in total, but you tell me.\nTony Tripeny : I absolutely meant in total.\nWendell Weeks : Okay. Wamsi, I need you to -- I need you to help me ask some really interesting question. I took it as total. That's a good question.\nAnn Nicholson : Thanks, Wamsi. We still get time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long : Thank you. Maybe just a two - parter on display here. Wendell, you just mentioned again the -- some of the moves you are doing with end-of-lighting, some tanks, and some new ones. Could you talk about maybe Tony Tripeny as well? What is the kind of cash flow impacts, other near-term gross margin impacts that it sounds like ultimately could be a better profitability dynamic? Can you just walk us through the cadence of what those changes mean to the model? And then second, can you talk a little bit, maybe more high level about PC and display impacts? Obviously with pandemic, those probably came a little bit bigger. Part of the mix, what is the outlook there and how do you see that -- how do you see that impacting the overall volume dynamic as you look forward? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks : I think to the first part of the question, I'll start and let Tony come in. I think from a modeling standpoint, as we do these upgrades. Of course, we're doing it to increase quality and lower costs. But the one way to think about it through your next year would be how you feel revenue plays out. It will pretty much just play out like that. I don't think you'll see any added cost drag or things like that. I just think you're going to mainly see it with the revenue change. That's what I would say. What do you think, Tony?\nTony Tripeny : I think that's right. I mean, there are some things like the expedited freight costs, for example, that won't go away. So, as we think about the 150 basis points, as we go through next year, that will certainly help us to some degree against that. You will see those results in the financials. And then from a cash flow standpoint, I mean, all of this is a part of our ongoing cash flow capital spending. It's not part of a build cycle or anything like that. So, I don't think it will really stand out from a cash flow standpoint.\nWendell Weeks : That's a great question on PCs and notebooks. As you quite rightly pointed out, our PC makers had a really strong demand during the pandemic. What we're seeing right now, we're hearing from them is that demand is still quite robust, but it's shifting towards commercial rather than consumer demand. And that as a result, those that are really strong in commercial still find things quite tight. And that's how they're seeing that play out. And we'd be happy to sit down with you, Tim, if you want to share how we view total IT demand come in to play and how that plays out in glass, and we'd be happy to do that.\nTim Long : Just wondering if you think that's an additional headwind relative to TV as being strong next year?\nTony Tripeny : Not much. Because like I said, you're seeing consumer back-off, right? And then we're seeing few which uses a certain type of display which is too deep to go into here. And we're seeing commercial, I mean, big companies with that return to work and those upgrade cycles turn in turn ups. So, I don't view it as a big headwind one way or the other, but like I said, let's talk through the details with you and that way, you can know where our heads at and how that differs from where you see things.\nTim Long : Okay. Great. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson : Great. Thanks, Tim. And I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Before we close, wanted to let you know that we're going to be at the Baird Virtual Global Industrial Conference on November 10th, the Credit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on December 1st, and the Barclays Virtual Global Technology, Media, and Telecommunications Conference on December 7th. Finally, a replay of today's call will be available on our site starting later this morning. Thanks for joining us. Michelle, you can disconnect all lines.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported strong third quarter results that continue a year of outstanding sales growth, margin expansion, and significant cash generation. Sales grew 21% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, a new all-time high. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points sequentially, and 70 basis points year-over-year to 38.3%. EPS grew 30% year-over-year to $0.56, and free cash flow of $0.5 billion brought cumulative free cash generation for the first 9 months of 2021 to $1.3 billion. Our outstanding results in this period of global disruption are due to excellent execution at all levels of the Company, and they're driven by a compelling set of long-term growth opportunities that would account sharing through our innovations and broad market access, as we strengthen our commercial relationships and scale operations to meet demand.  Like everyone, we're dealing with numerous factors caused by the pandemic and the resulting inflation. In this quarter, the largest macro impact was constraints in the automotive industry, stemming from chip and component shortages. Auto production in the third quarter is estimated to be down nearly 20% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. As a result, we stepped down in light duty sales. Across our businesses, we prioritize delivering for our customers in a complex inflationary environment. and we have delivered despite incurring extra costs. Now we're taking additional actions, including pricing to address these costs and maintain our ability to invest and support our customers. And you'll hear of more from Tony on this in just a few minutes.  Against this backdrop, we feel really good about our performance. In the quarter, announcements with industry leaders illustrated the power of our portfolio, demonstrating not only our relevance across multiple markets, but also our role as a key innovation partner. Our start position stems from a complimentary set of 3 core technologies, 4 proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms, and 5 market access platforms. We're leaders in each. We generate growth opportunities by delivering combinations and new applications of these capabilities to help our customers drive their industries forward. And in doing so, we drive more Corning content into the products people are already buying.  Let me share some highlights from the quarter. In optical communications, the industries in the early innings of large deployments in support of 5G, broadband, and the cloud. Momentum is building, and we see it confirmed by multiple sources. First is network need. Demand on network is significantly higher than pre -pandemic levels. Broadband usage for September was up 32% versus pre -pandemic levels, and up 9% versus September 2020 when remote work and school were largely in play. Global 5G subscriptions have grown to almost 0.5 billion this year. More applications are moving to the Cloud, and global data creation is expected to grow at 23% compound annual growth rate from 2020 to 2055. Versus 2020, Cloud revenue industry-wide is up nearly 50%.  The second confirmation of strong industry momentum can be seen in the announcements from leading companies. On AT&T's earnings call last week, their CEO said they're on a march to deploy fiber at scale. They're working toward passing 5 million homes per year. In the quarter, we announced a strategic investment to support their growth plans. Speaking about our expanded collaboration, AT&T said the expansion of fiber infrastructure is central to the growth of broadband reach for consumers as well as business customers. [inaudible 00:08:50] recently shared that they plan to reach 10 million more homes with fiber by the end of 2025 with their CEO saying, ''Our future is fiber''. Cloud deployments are also expanding. Microsoft CEO said that over the past year, they added new data center clusters in 15 countries across 5 continents in support of their cloud business. The third confirmation is power substantial increase in sales and continued order book momentum. This is perhaps the most important indicator of growth over the next few quarters. We evolve. We are ramping capacity and we are energized. Across the business, we're driving strong year-over-year [inaudible 00:09:51] growth, and we're outperforming the optical market as we continue to commercialize innovations that extend our competitive advantage, and as we provide more solutions to more customers at both the regional and national levels. During the quarter, we introduced the newest additions to our Evolv portfolio, which includes solutions designed to support role deployments. We also introduced our ever-on millimeter wave indoor small cell systems, which deliver 5G -ready coverage in high-density environments, including office buildings, factories, hotels, hospitals, and classrooms. Let's turn to mobile consumer electronics. Here, we're helping transform the smartphone experience.  As we help our customers deliver new value to their users, we drive more of our content into each device sold. This played out well during the quarter with the launch of Samsung's Galaxy V Fold 3 and Galaxy V Flip 3. Both devices feature Gorilla Glass Victus. Now, they also utilize our new Gorilla Glass with DX on the lenses of the rear cameras. This is ore Corning in action. We've expanded our capabilities into a new category, device cameras. Even though the lens is a fraction of the surface area we addressed with our cover material, the value we had is high. And we're capturing a very attractive opportunity to increase our revenue per device. Samsung is also featuring Gorilla Glass with DX on the new Galaxy Watch4.  Turning to automotive. OEMs in designing cleaner, safer vehicles, and distinguishing themselves with technologies that enhance the driving experience. Corning is uniquely suited to address these trends. And we're pursuing a $100 per car content opportunity, across emissions and AutoGlass solutions. In the quarter, Jeep announced a product that brings our top technical glass into their iconic vehicles. Their new Jeep Performance Parts windshield featuring Gorilla Glass is now a factory-installed option on the 2021 Wrangler and Gladiator. We're making the windshields lightweight, durable, and up to 3 times more impact-resistant than regular windshields.  Additionally, tighter emissions regulations continue to provide a strong content opportunity for our environmental solutions. OEMs need higher filtration performance, and we've responded with a new generation of gasoline particular filters. The importance of our GPF business drives home my ongoing point; it's not about more cars, it's about more Corning in those cars. Since 2017, our auto sales are up more than 40% while global car sales are down 20%. Turning to display. We're in a position of strength for 2 reasons, for significantly more profitable than our competitors. Second, the market for large-size TVs is projected to grow at a double-digit compound annual growth rate through 2024.  And we're leader in Gen 10.5, which is the most economical approach for larger sets. Stepping back, we've all seen the declines in panel pricing and we're beginning to see panel maker utilization adjustments. Now, lower demand provides us an opportunity to minimize expedited freight and to rebuild tanks that have operated beyond end-of-life. Taking these actions will allow us to keep our supply balance to demand. We expect the overall glass supply to remain tight, and the glass pricing environment to remain attractive. Tony will give you more details on our industry position and our outlook.  Finally, in life sciences, word delivering growth on multiple fronts. We're seeing ongoing demand in support of the global pandemic response. And our inventions are helping advanced the transition to sell and gene-based therapies. Additionally, we're making progress on our multi-billion-dollar content opportunity in pharmaceutical packaging. We're expanding our comprehensive portfolio, advancing key partnerships, and building our customer base. Corning continues to support the pandemic response, and its portfolio of advanced vials and pharmaceutical glass tubing has enabled the delivery of more than 3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines.  Our high-volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina is now operational, which will help us scale with demand. In total, we believe our efforts to address the pandemic are enabling permanent industry shifts. That means a future pharmaceutical packaging landscape defined by enhanced patient safety, lower cost, minimal regulatory hurdles, and increased capacity for life-saving drugs. Other efforts that have gained increased attention during pandemic are finding broader long-term applications. We introduced Corning Guardiant. A paint additive that uses a glass matrix to trap copper ions.  A powerful and long used antimicrobial material. Paint with Guardiant has been proven to kill 99.9% of bacteria and viruses, including the one that causes COVID-19. This month, PPG announced that their Copper Armor paint powered by Guardiant received EPA registration and will be available in major U.S. retail and home improvement stores. PPG noted that it's the first virus-killing paint in the U.S. And our collaboration builds on an EPA statement asserting that public health would benefit from surfaces with built-in antimicrobial capabilities.  Stepping back, I am proud of the many ways our people unleashed the power of our portfolio in the quarter, and when our performance says about Corning's strong position today. Key trends are converging around our capabilities, as we become more and more vital to industry transformations driving the world forward. This provides a compelling set of long-term growth opportunities. and we're executing well to bring those opportunities to life and make a difference wherever we can. So, I want to thank our dedicated employees for their contributions. Now, I'll close by briefly looking back at 2019 when we outlined our priorities for growth and shareholder returns for the next several years.  We provided attractive targets, as we laid out our plans to building even bigger, stronger Company that delivers sustainable results. Today, the growth drivers we laid out remain intact and we're delivering on our goals. We are a bigger, stronger Company than we were in 2019, and we are continuing to grow. Tony will get into more specifics. But I feel really good about our position and the progress that we've made. I look forward to updating you when we close out a strong year. And as we grow again in 2022. Now, I will turn the call over to Tony so that he can give you some more insight on the quarter. Then in terms of from a balance sheet standpoint, clearly, we have a very strong set of goals from a balance sheet standpoint in an amount of leverage we're comfortable with, and in particular, very long maturities from a leverage standpoint. We do have the longest maturity in the S&P 500. And that overall approach has not really changed, but we're right -- we're still being impacted by what's happening from a global economic standpoint, so we're going to continue to work through where things go. And the good news is that we're generating tremendous amount of free cash flow. And with that free cash flow, that gives us the ability to invest in the business, but also to return cash to shareholders. Great. It's a great question, Shannon. I would say if you had asked us when this all began, say in late quarter 2, in quarter 3, like in that time period. We would have said, you know, this is probably transitory and our top priorities are protecting our people and protect our customers, and spend what it takes to make that happen. And we want to keep our customers running like [inaudible 00:50:32], and this too shall pass. And our normal great job that we do, reducing costs will trigger in and we got this.  Actually, it is mainly through conversations with our supply chain head as well as our investors that have led us to look at this and say this may last longer than we had thought. And that this looks like we could continue to have challenged supply chains for the foreseeable future. And what we needed to do was add to our priorities that we also needed to protect our investors and our ability to invest for the future, which in turn allows us to once again protect our people and protect our customers.  And so, as we've looked at it that way, that is what has led us to start to externalize that cost pressure and we began in quarter 3. We've got a lot further to go. So, I think the thing to look at is pretty simply, how do we do get our profitability of working in the way you would expect when we have revenue growth? Because we're expecting to grow no more less as we grow because we actually make things for a living or you would expect our margins to improve. I think that's the key thing that we're looking at as to see that as well as we have detailed plans like by-customer product by-region and all that is getting rolled out. It's already in motion. Well, it's a little early to tell to generalize on that. That depends on the customer. We've had some who have said, [Indiscernible], I was expecting this. We have others who say, thank you very much for sharing, but we rather you fixed this on your own. But we'll work our way through it. I think the key to all is to understand about how we are with our customers, is this a very long-term partnership. And we invest for the long term, and we ask for strong commitments from them and they ask for strong commitments from us. But we face that future, all of us are looking at the future when we make these investments in innovation.  And our plans, that is a little uncertain. And so, the way we always try to work through things with our customers is, okay, this is where we're at. This is reality. How do we work through it together in a way that allows you, our customer to continue to succeed and allows us to continue to support that success. And that's the tone and attitude that we bring to it and that our customers engage in that same dialogue. we'll all play out, and I'm so certain that as we work our way through it, we'll reach a fair resolution of what happened. We operate in an inflationary environment at least for a period of time, which neither our customers nor us have had a lot of experience with. And in quarter 2 Okay. The way we tend to -- I think you're on one of the real key points. So as Tony said, there are 2 key factors to keep in mind for display, and they really drive display at the demand of the retail level, which we believe will be up single-digits next year, and then glass supply demand balance, which we believe are going to be tight to balance in quarter 4 and throughout 2022. And as a result, we believe the glass environment for pricing is going to continue to be favorable. When we say tight to balance, what we mean is that we're coming out of this time period, I mean, if we're out of it yet, where glass has just been a very tight and we have been extending tanks beyond their planned life.  We've had very high expediting costs and we have delayed technology upgrades really for the last year plus. And so, what our plan is, is to take any opportunity presented by lower panel maker utilization to take targeted tanks down for upgrades while improving service levels with lower expediting costs. Now, the timing for these is slowly within Corning's control. First goal is we plan to meet our customers' demand. We're going to continue to protect our customers and meet the demand that they think they need. But we're also going to get our fleet ready to lower cost and increased quality for years to come. And as a result, that's what we mean by tight to balance. Our customers get what they need, while we get the -- our upgrades done whenever we can. So that's our approach here, and that's how we feel about display. And while we are providing some insight into next year, as well when we normally just would have told you what's going to happen next quarter. So, what a very big question. Tony, what did you mean? I would've thought it meant in total, but you tell me. Okay. Wamsi, I need you to -- I need you to help me ask some really interesting question. I took it as total. That's a good question. I think to the first part of the question, I'll start and let Tony come in. I think from a modeling standpoint, as we do these upgrades. Of course, we're doing it to increase quality and lower costs. But the one way to think about it through your next year would be how you feel revenue plays out. It will pretty much just play out like that. I don't think you'll see any added cost drag or things like that. I just think you're going to mainly see it with the revenue change. That's what I would say. What do you think, Tony? That's a great question on PCs and notebooks. As you quite rightly pointed out, our PC makers had a really strong demand during the pandemic. What we're seeing right now, we're hearing from them is that demand is still quite robust, but it's shifting towards commercial rather than consumer demand. And that as a result, those that are really strong in commercial still find things quite tight. And that's how they're seeing that play out. And we'd be happy to sit down with you, Tim, if you want to share how we view total IT demand come in to play and how that plays out in glass, and we'd be happy to do that."

            "name": "Tony Tripeny",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell, and good morning everyone. Strong execution resulted in another outstanding quarter. We are on track to reach $14 billion in sales and over $2 in EPS, making significant progress extending our market leadership while scaling operations to meet demand, and we expect to grow again in 2022. During the third quarter, sales increased 21% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, led by the strength in optical communications and the strong performance in our other businesses. EPS grew 30% year-over-year to $0.56. Sales and earnings reflect lower production levels in the automotive industry due to the semiconductor chip shortage. The impact of Corning's results was approximately $40 million in sales and $0.02 of EPS.  Gross margin percent expanded 50 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year to 38.3%, despite a net impact of 150 basis points from supply chain challenges and inflationary headwinds. Free cash flow grew to $497 million, with cash generation of $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of the year. These achievements are particularly noteworthy because we are operating in the face of unprecedented logistical challenges and component shortages. Delivering for customers in this complex environment requires both decisive action and agility. Our ability to sense disruption and act quickly has been key to running our plants well and meeting our customer's needs. And we're leveraging our diversified global supply chain to continue to meet customer demand.  In fact, I'd be remiss if I didn't recognize the efforts of our global supply management and operations teams that have allowed us to maintain a steady supply of raw materials, while finding creative shipping strategies. Their actions have enabled us to effectively deliver for our customers, and they're providing actionable insight into the current dynamic environment. At the same time, we continue to incur additional costs as we work to meet strong customer demand. And while we've been taking actions to mitigate them, certain costs continue to elevate in the third quarter. For example, we were able to offset a significant portion of elevated freight cost, but resin prices increased again.  Therefore, our margin is temporarily muted. Given this ongoing inflationary environment, we have price increases underway across all of our businesses. We saw some benefit from these actions in the third quarter, and their impact should accelerate in the fourth quarter and into 2022. Now, we don't expect the environment to improve in the short-term, but our digital supply chain capabilities enabled real-time visibility into emerging situations, allowing us to proactively address issues. We remain focused on meeting demand, expanding our margins, and protecting our ability to invest for customers. Now let's take a closer look at the performance in each of our businesses during the third quarter.  In display technology, sales were $956 million up 2% sequentially, and 16% year-over-year. Corning's glass volume grew slightly, and glass prices increased moderately sequentially as expected. Glass supply continues to be tight, and we continue to do everything we can to meet customer demand. We expect fourth quarter glass prices to be consistent with the third quarter. Now, I know there is a lot of discussion about the display industry. Briefly, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable, as glass supply remains tight to balance throughout 2022. Now, as we've discussed previously, we based our perspective on what will happen in the display market on three main factors: retail demand, panel makers' production, and glassmakers' ability to supply the panel makers.  With those factors in line, I'll start with what I said about retail demand on our last earnings call in July. Since LCD televisions emerged as a mainstream technology in 2004, LCD TV units have only been down 3 times and never 2 years in a row. Since 2014, TV sell-through units are typically range -bound between 225 and 235 million, which average screen size grows about 1.5 inches a year. In 2020, global television units increased 4% above the trend line to about 242 million. Screen size growth was about 1.2 inches, about 20% below trend. A lot of smaller TVS sold probably to accommodate more people living, working, and studying from home.  Entering this year, we expected and continue to expect the market to reverse the trend, implying a decrease in TV units, especially smaller televisions, and for normal screen size growth of 1.5 inches to return. We now have 9 months of retail data under our belts, and it is confirmatory. Television units declined by about 10% year-over-year, while average screen size growth is in line with the 1.5 inches per year trend. Unit volume for TV 65 inches or larger increased by a mid-teen percentage, and smaller TVs were down by a mid-teen percentage. So, 3 quarters through the year, our expectation for TV units being down year-over-year, and screen size growing approximately an inch - and -a-half are playing out. Looking ahead to 2022.  We think TV units and screen size will continue to follow historical trends; a nd retail glass demand will be up. That means television units will be within the typical range of 225 to 235 million units, and average screen size will grow about an inch - and -a-half. Now, remember, television units which are declining this year have never declined two years in a row, and next year is a World Cup year, and TV units have never declined in a World Cup year. Finally, the biggest driver of retail glass growth in most years is the increase in screen size. We would expect the average screen size to once again grow 1.5 inches next year.  In summary, we expect glass demand at retail to be up by a high single-digit percentage in 2022, as measured in square feet. Now let's move from retail to panel makers. After a period of high production in 2020 and 2021 to meet strong demand, we are now seeing panel makers temporarily reducing their utilization given the lower 2021 retail demand that we told you about all year. And that is happening just as we would expect. Now, finally, let's move to the glass industry, which struggled to meet demand in 2020 and 2021, as glass has remained tight. Like other glassmakers, we've depleted our inventories, expedited shipping, and operated tanks beyond their targeted end the life.  We will use this period of temporarily lower panel maker utilizations to shutdown end-of-life tanks and rebuild them with our latest technology. We will also take the opportunity to work our way out of expedited shipping. These actions keep our supply balance to demand, and will improve our operating costs going forward. But rest assured, we will still have capacity to supply all of our customers anticipated glass demand. When panel [inaudible 00:30:48] production ramps to meet the expected high single-digit retail demand growth in 2022, we'll be fully prepared with our revitalized fleet of tanks. Overall, we believe glass supply will be tight the balance, throughout 2022.  And since glass pricing is primarily driven by glass supply demand balance, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable in Q4, and also throughout 2022. Moving to optical communications, we saw strong growth across the business with sales exceeding $1.1 billion up 24% year-over-year, and 5% sequentially. Net income was $139 million up 21% year-over-year. Net income declined 6% sequentially, as increased raw material and shipping costs significantly impacted profitability. During the quarter, carriers spent more on 5G and broadband projects.  This, along with the continued strong pace of enterprise cloud data center builds, drove our strong performance. Demand on networks is at an all-time high, setting the stage for significant investments in fiber infrastructure, as operators expand network capacity, capabilities, and access. During the quarter, we announced the collaboration with AT&T. Our capacity expansion will allow AT&T to expand investments in fiber infrastructure, expand U.S. broadband networks, and accelerate 5G deployment. We are well-positioned to capture significant ongoing growth, as network and data center investment increases. Our solutions improve the speed and capital efficiency deployments.  Additionally, Corning is the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. In environmental technologies, our third quarter sales were $385 million, up 2% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. As everyone knows, chip shortages are having a big impact on the auto industry. At the start of 2021, global vehicle production was expected to be about 88 million. By July, the industry was projecting below 85 million. And given continued chip and component constraints, forecast now anticipate out-of-production around 75 million for the year.  This pullback in production began to impact us in the middle of the quarter, and we expected to continue for the fourth quarter. We estimate an impact on EPS in the third quarter of about $0.02, and we expect additional impact in the fourth quarter. The good news is that when component shortages resolved, auto-production will recover because end-market demand remained strong, and we will be prepared to meet the growing demand. Specialty materials delivered sales of $556 million up 15% sequentially, and in line with the strong third quarter in 2020 when we introduced ceramic shield. we've grown specialty sales every year from 2016 to today despite smartphone unit sales being roughly flat.  Over that 5-year period, we've almost doubled our sales on a base of more than $1 billion. Clearly, we are successfully executing our objective of driving more content into each device sold. And strong demand continues for our premium cover materials. During the quarter, our glass innovations were featured in 30 new devices, including smartphones, wearables, and laptops. Demand also remains strong for our advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturer -- manufacturing as the broader end market continues to experience robust growth. In the quarter, investments in innovations that are moving towards commercialization resulted in lower net income than in 2020.  As we've noted before, newer innovations can face high cost as we develop and scale our manufacturing process. We anticipate that profitability will improve, as we come up the learning curve and improve utilization. Looking into the fourth quarter, we're seeing typical volume declines in Gorilla Glass, following the build supporting flagship customer product launches. Life Sciences third quarter sales were $305 million up 37% year-over-year, driven by ongoing demand to support the global pandemic response, continued recovery in the academic and pharmaceutical research labs, and strong demand for bio-production vessels and diagnostic-related consumables.  Our Life Sciences segment is outpacing the overall industry as evidenced by our sales CAGR of 9% over the last 3 years. Stepping back, we have made strong progress across all of our businesses. We entered new product categories, announced collaborations with key industry leaders, and contributed to significant industry advancements. We're building a strong foundation for future growth. This combined with our consistent focus on innovation and deep commitment to RD&E, is what continues to fuel and sustain Corning's leadership position across its markets. As we look ahead to Q4, we expect core sales to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion and Core EPS in the range of 0.50 to 0.55.  Profitability is expected to decline sequentially due to the further reduction on automotive-related sales, as I mentioned, and lower Gorilla Glass sales, following strong customer launches. That said, we expect to close out 2021 with both top and bottom-line growth, and another year of strong cash flow, and we expect our momentum to continue in 2022 with sales and EPS growth along with strong cash generation. Now I'd like to expand on windows closing point. Back in 2019, we outlined our goals for growth and shareholder returns. We said we would leverage our focused and cohesive portfolio to extend our leadership and capture significant growth opportunities.  And we said that key trends would continue to converge around our capabilities. What we said back in 2019 still rings true today. Despite the pandemic and the resulting global disruptions. Our key growth drivers are all intact, some are even accelerating. and we're on track or even ahead of the goals we laid out in 2019 in all our market access platforms. Since 2019, sales have grown at a 10% CAGR ahead of the 6% to 8% target. Now, we have been growing EPS at a rate consistent with sales, which puts us ahead of our target, which puts us behind our target because inflationary pressures are clearly impacting profitability.  But we do expect that our cost and pricing actions will deliver significant improvement over time. As we said, we would do, we're also growing our return on invested capital. Today, our total Company ROIC is in the double-digits. Our most recent capacity expansions, or as we like to call them build investments, are fully ramped, have enabled the $2.5 billion of sales we've added since 2019, and are delivering more than 20% ROIC. Our aggregate free cash flow generation for 2020 and 2021 is expected to be more than $2.5 billion. Finally, we remain steadfast in our commitment to investing in growth and extending our leadership, while returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and a 10% annual increase in our dividend. As you might remember, we decided early in the pandemic to ensure the stability and flexibility of our financial position by building up our cash reserve.  In April, we resumed share buybacks with the Samsung transaction, where we repurchased 4% of our fully diluted shares. Consistent with our strategy to opportunistically buy back shares, we plan to do more repurchases in Q4. In summary, we've built a strong foundation over the last several years. Our capabilities are relevant to major growth trends across our markets. Our more Corning strategy is working. And we're executing through some very volatile end-markets, extending relationships and commitments with our customers, extending our leadership position, and generating outstanding sales, profits, and free cash flow. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann. First on in terms of the price increases, I mean, clearly our priorities over the last year or so with the pandemic is to protect our people and protect our customers. And we have been doing a great job on that, on those priorities. And we saw it in Q3, which is an incredibly challenging environment, but require decisive action and agility, and we had to act quickly, and we've done that. And I'm personally very proud of what -- all the work we've done as a Company and is what you'd expect at Corning. But what tends to happen in this environment is that you see some places where we made improvements on from a cost and freight standpoint and others that have gone up, and all of this comes at a cost. Our goal here is to increase prices across all of our businesses.  We've had about 150 basis points impact for the last several quarters. I'd expect that to continue in the next quarter and then for it to get better over time. But the actual timing and prediction of that, it's just hard to know because there's so many moving pieces. So tried to do Matt, on pricing here is you have a range of what could happen with inflationary pressures, and then we have a range of what could happen with our pricing in each of our different businesses and even in each of our different products. And what we tried to do is capture those within the guidance that we just gave for quarter four. And as we continue to gain experience on both, we would expect to get better and better at being able to narrow those ranges, and improve our ability to give you a good idea on how this will impact your models. I want to make sure that I understand your question. So, you are asking how do we feel about the growth in the business, and as that growth occurs, how do we feel about our margin expansion as that capacity ramps? Do I understand your question correctly Samik? Great. So first, as I laid out in my comments, we feel that the growth here in the business is very strong. You saw and I think in the quarter, we've had $1.1 billion of revenue. Our order book was in excess of that, stronger than that rate. So that gives you an idea of the demand that we're seeing right now, and that is before there's any passage. It's in the bipartisan infrastructure bill on what it is the government wants to do with broad debt. So that new layer on top of the demand that we're seeing that is largely say, already serving commercial and customer opportunities. So that's how we feel about demand.  All those long-term trends that we see, they look like they're all continuing in both Cloud and carrier networks. Now, margin. So, in margin expansion, this is a segment where we've given the really strong demand. We have had a lot of expedited shipping. We've had a lot of challenges around freight and we've had accelerating raw material costs. So, we haven't been putting quite the increase in our margins that you would normally expect as we fill out, right? That's one of the reasons that we're going to be addressing price with our customers, who we have done all these long-term build investments with. And hopefully what that's going to do is get the type of margin growth that you really expect with our rising revenue growth, Samik. Does that make sense to you, sir? Great. So first in [Indiscernible], that margin drag that you've rightly identified, Steve, that's the inflationary pressures that we have yet to offset with our customers. So, I think you're right on and what we'd like to do is see that drag moderate. And as you know, our Optical businesses big with a lot of customers. So, it's a lot of commercial work to get everything in place. Already began and already gotten rolling in this last quarter, and we will gain and accelerate in quarter 4. So that's what we'll be about in [Indiscernible] and you're looking at the right numbers and that's the numbers you should expect to improve. In display, we expect the price to be consistent with our raised pricing in quarter 3. And in quarter 2. So, we're following a couple of price raises, and we anticipate our price to be consistent in quarter 4. That is correct. I think that's a great question. I need to follow up to see how is Jeep going to do that. I just need to follow up, because right now it's just if like you want a vehicle. You tend to get them highly bundled. But I don't know what the difference is between how they're seeking to optimize their very few chips, and how much is really a long-term approach. Let me follow up on this -- on that and we'll get back to you, John. On windshields, I think, you'll continue to watch this pace.  We've got a number of significant innovations going on to solve the glazing problems that EVs represent and that autonomy represents. It's too early, I think, John, for us to -- for me to say definitively to you that we have this, start building in another large revenue generator for us. But in [Indiscernible] to resolve it, we [Indiscernible] be able to say that within the coming 12 months because they're so -- we're doing so much work in that space. And we're seeing an uptake in a number of places of our laminated product and some other innovations that we have going on. So, the very right to identify just a little early for us to call the ball, John. So, we're really happy that we are the owners of Hemlock, John. And I think you're one of the few people that we have this fall that really always understood Hemlock in depth and you always wanted us to be the owner of Hemlock. And finally, after all these years, we are. And we're happy to get it. As you know, semiconductor demand is strong. I think the other added revenue source that we're now seeing in Hemlock is in solar, which as you know, we idled a hunk of our capacity in solar as the U.S. supply chain ended up downstream of us, becoming eroded with the intense competitive environment with China.  We are now seeing really strong demand in solar, and we are doing what you would expect us to do, which is if a customer wants us to commit capacity to them in solar, we're putting in place those same type, very strong contractual arrangements to be able to make sure as we turn up some of that capacity that they buy it. And you're going -- you'll see that in our revenues. And so, we feel very good about it, John. We should have listened to you even earlier. Yeah, Wamsi. As you know, well, a lot of that growth is occurring is in the Gen 10 or is in the large size screen TVs. And that's where us went having 3 out of the 4 Gen 10.5 factories, makes a big difference. So, we would expect that to continue to positively impact our results in 2022, just like it has the last couple of years. We tend to think about -- I'm sorry, you had an additional question, sir? I absolutely meant in total. I think that's right. I mean, there are some things like the expedited freight costs, for example, that won't go away. So, as we think about the 150 basis points, as we go through next year, that will certainly help us to some degree against that. You will see those results in the financials. And then from a cash flow standpoint, I mean, all of this is a part of our ongoing cash flow capital spending. It's not part of a build cycle or anything like that. So, I don't think it will really stand out from a cash flow standpoint. Not much. Because like I said, you're seeing consumer back-off, right? And then we're seeing few which uses a certain type of display which is too deep to go into here. And we're seeing commercial, I mean, big companies with that return to work and those upgrade cycles turn in turn ups. So, I don't view it as a big headwind one way or the other, but like I said, let's talk through the details with you and that way, you can know where our heads at and how that differs from where you see things."

[Operator Instructions] It is my pleasure to introduce you to Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, Katherine and good morning. Welcome to Corning\u2019s Quarter 2, 2021 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. In the second quarter, GAAP net income was $449 million. However, GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.42 due to the GAAP accounting treatment required for the transaction entered into with Samsung Display. Let me take you through why this was the case. As a reminder on April 5, 2021, Corning entered into a share repurchase agreement with Samsung Display. As part of the agreement, Samsung converted preferred stock into common stock and Corning immediately repurchased 35 million shares of that common stock from Samsung. The common shares were then traded on the open exchange, so GAAP requires a special accounting treatment of the repurchase as an extinguishment of the original preferred shares. The accounting treatment for and extinguishment of preferred shares is to record the difference between the repurchase price and the original book value in retained earnings. This adjustment to retained earnings is also removed from net income available to common shareholders when calculating GAAP earnings per share. [Excluding this], U.S. GAAP EPS would have been $0.52. Differences between our GAAP and core results can also stem from non-cash mark-to-market gains or losses associated with hedging contracts. They were de minimis this quarter. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP values can be found in the investor relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the interactive analyst segment. Supporting slides are being shown live on a webcast; we encourage you to follow along. And they're also available on our website for downloading.  And now, I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you and good morning everyone. Today we reported outstanding second quarter results, and we're on track for a strong year. Versus second quarter 2020, sales grew 35% to $3.5 billion. EPS grew 112% to $0.53 on the higher sales and expanding margins. Free cash flow grew 65% to $471 million with first half cash generation of $843 million. No question, we're in great shape. And we see a clear growth story playing out across our businesses. Each of our five segments grew sales by a double-digit percentage year-over-year ranging from 16% for specialty materials to 80% for environmental technologies. Now, of course, 2020 was an easy compare, so I think it's worth noting that even versus second quarter of 2019 we grew total company sales and EPS 17% and 18% respectively. Since the second quarter of 2019, we've added more than half a billion dollars in quarterly sales. About $200 million is from Hemlock and more than $300 million is organic growth, with about 70% of that coming from success of our more Corning content strategy and outperforming the competition. The other 30% of organic growth is from rising with the market. In each of our market access platforms, we're addressing significant and transformational trends. We seek to drive content and expand our total addressable market by combining capabilities from our focused portfolio and prioritizing opportunities for more Corning. Our long-term strategy is built on a complimentary set of three core technologies for our proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms. We're leaders in age and the synergies among them allow us to create distinctive benefits for our customer, improve the return on our investments in R&D, and reduce capital intensity. We create breakthrough products and processes by leveraging the synergies among our core capabilities. Capitalizing on insights we gain through close collaboration with our customers and taking advantage of our existing plants and pilot facilities for early stage production. For example, over the past few years, we have created new to the world products, including ceramic shield, tougher Gorilla Glasses, auto-grade glass, Valor drug packaging, Gen 10.5 display glass, and innovative passive optical solutions that are dramatically increasing the ease and cost efficiency of network deployments. But we're not just creators. We're also builders. We do the manufacturing ourselves, using processes that we invent, and proprietary equipment that we design and build. When growth opportunities arise and demand exceeds our existing capacity, we build state-of-the-art plants to manufacture products at scale. And we locate these plants in close proximity to our customers. A strategy that is likely to continue to pay-off in a post pandemic world. We de-risk these investments by requiring meaningful commitments from customers, often including funding before beginning construction. We last detailed our build investments with you in 2019 when we described our focus, create, build, extend value creation cycle. We pointed out how our build projects were directly responding to customer needs and commitments. We knew that carriers like AT&T and Verizon would need more fiber to densify their networks for 5G. We knew that BOE would need glass for its Gen 10.5 panels, that car companies would need gasoline particulate filters to meet new regulations, that biotech companies would need high density cell culture to support gene therapy, and that smartphone OEMs would need increasingly durable scratch resistant cover glass as they designed thinner phones and bigger cameras. We told you these build projects would increase our capacity to meet committed demand and that as we delivered on that demand, they would increase our revenue and generate excellent returns. We are delivering. Today, the build projects we undertook from 2016 to 2019 are collectively delivering return on invested capital above 20%. They've helped us increase our sales run rate from $10 billion in 2015 and 2016 to our current run rate of $14 billion and they've helped us improve total company ROIC by 3 percentage points. Importantly, each time we build, we increase our scale, and we enhance the opportunity to extend our leadership, and create new innovations. And because we're constantly improving our productivity and capabilities, we can often manufacture these innovations and drive revenue growth without building new facilities. And we actually spend most of our time in this extend part of the cycle it\u2019s where we are today. In this [space], we keep creating and extending until we're so successful that demand exceeds our capacity. As we reapply our insights and repurpose our assets, our best-in-the-world capabilities just keep getting better. Every time we pursue an adjacent opportunity, we explore new combinations of capabilities. We push the boundaries in areas where we already lead, and we cross train our people indeed in important ways. In other words, we've created a positive feedback loop that expands our knowledge, increases the relevance of our capabilities, and enhances our value to customers. And this directly fuels our content strategy. We aren\u2019t exclusively relying on people buying more stuff we're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying, with that in mind. Let's look at some of the initiatives we're advancing across our market access platforms. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we continue to help transform the way people interact with and use their devices. We capture growth by increasing the value we offer on each of those devices. In the quarter, consistent with our strategy to obtain customer commitments and supportive build initiatives, Apple awarded Corning an additional $45 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to help expand our manufacturing capacity in the United States and to support our R&D. To date, we've received $495 million in total from Apple's fund. We've also launched another chapter in our More Corning strategy with an important application of our capabilities to enhance the optics of smartphone cameras, which is a new category for us. The social media experience is centered around photos. Device designers are adding cameras and increasing lens size. They're also integrating more advanced capabilities, such as telephoto, wide angle lenses, and infrared sensors.  These features naturally increase the prominence of the lens surface area, which in turn increases the likelihood of scratches and damage. And to Corning, just last week, we announced Gorilla Glass with DX and DX+ for mobile phone cameras. Our DX increases image quality and camera durability by providing a composite glass material that combines low reflection with scratch resistance approaching sapphire. Samsung is the first adopter.  Turning to Automotive, OEMs are designing creative and safer vehicles with technology that enhances the driving experience. We're uniquely suited to address these trends. We're pursuing a $100 per car content opportunity across emissions, precision glass products, and auto-glass solutions. And we recently entered a new product category in automotive, Curved Mirror Solutions. Our solutions are enabling the augmented reality head up display in Hyundai\u2019s new electric crossover, the IONIQ 5. The system essentially turns the windshield into a display screen, letting drivers keep their eyes on the road, while assessing navigation and speed information directly in their line of sight. Additionally, a new generation of gasoline particulate filters is helping us on our way to surpassing $500 million in annual GPF sales well ahead of our original timeframe. Turning to Life Sciences, we're delivering growth on multiple fronts. We're seeing ongoing demand in support of the global pandemic response. Our inventions are helping advance the transition to cell and gene therapies. And we're making significant strides toward building a Valor Glass franchise addressing a multi-billion dollar content opportunity in the pharmaceutical packaging market. In the second quarter, we further increased valid production capacity and secured additional customer wins. We worked with Thermo Fisher and OPTIMA pharma to demonstrate solutions that increase bio filling speed by nearly 70% thereby alleviating a critical bottleneck in the medical supply chain. Our collaboration features a combination of Corning\u2019s Valor vials and OPTIMA\u2019s ultra high-speed fill/finish solutions. Thermo Fisher called the results, \u2018a game changer in their ability to serve patients.\u2019 Turning to display, we\u2019ve experienced the most favorable pricing environment in more than a decade. And we announced a second moderate increase to our display glass substrate prices. Stepping back, we\u2019re the lowest cost producer of display glass, which makes us significantly more profitable than our competitors, our superior products [innovation capabilities] and deep customer relationships enable us to enhance our leadership position. Meanwhile, the emergence of Gen 10.5 has given us a unique opportunity. Other market for large sized keys is expected and projected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2024. And Gen 10.5 half glass provides the most economical approach for larger sets. We recently hosted the official opening ceremony for our Gen 10.5 facility in the city of Wuhan. This site is co-located with a large BOE plant, allowing Corning to deliver Gen 10.5 glass substrates more efficiently to our customer for its production of large size display panels. Gen 10.5 provides strong economics for our shareholders, while creating options to use earlier generation fusion tanks for new applications such as automotive and cover glass. To illustrate, remember that we launched our Gorilla Glass business back in 2007 by repurposing some of our existing fusion assets. Over time, repurposing has resulted in us avoiding more than a billion dollars in capital spending. Finally, let's look at optical communications. We're energized by the momentum that is building in this business. We see that momentum confirmed by multiple sources. First is network need. Demand on the network has only been increasing. Broadband usage for June was up 33% versus pre-pandemic levels and up 10% versus June 2020, which was a peak quarantine period. Global 5G subscriptions have grown to almost 300 million and they're on track to double that by the end of 2021 according to industry projections. The second confirmation is customer commitments. And many of our customers are actually being quite public about their plans. We believe we're in the early innings of a large capital deployment cycle across 5G, fiber-to-the-home, and hyperscale data centers. On AT&T earnings call last week, their CEO said that by year-end they expect to have expanded their fiber footprint by 3 million locations, including both business and consumer customers. Deutsche Telekom\u2019s Managing Director recently shared that by 2024 they're planning to have about 10 million homes passed and 97% 5G coverage. He said, \u2018the expansion of high performance networks is our top priority, whether with 5G and mobile communications, or fiber optic broadband expansion. To achieve this, we are massively increasing the investments in our network.\u2019 And Microsoft CEO recently shared his perspective on expanding data center capacity to meet cloud demand. He said, \u2018Digital adoption curves aren't slowing down. In fact, they're accelerating, and it's just the beginning.\u2019 Of course, the third confirmation is our order book, which is perhaps the most important indicator of growth over the next few quarters. Here, we're seeing year-over-year growth in double-digit percentages in both carrier and enterprise networks. During the quarter, we extended our technology and market leadership in Optical Communications by introducing little solutions that speed network deployment. We launched [Corning SMF-28 Contour fiber], which offers an industry first combination of superior bendability, compatibility with other fibers, and low signal loss. We also launched EDGE Rapid Connect solutions that increase fiber density and reduce customer installation time by up to 70%.  Across our markets, you can see that our value creation model is driving growth and that key trends are converging around our capabilities. We're helping our customers move toward a world with nearly infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth, with large lifelike displays where cars are cleaner, autonomous, and connected, where medicines are individualized, effective, and safe, and where you can do more from your mobile device protected by cover materials that are more and more capable. Now, I'll wrap up my remarks today with one final point. I've always said that how we do things is as important as what we accomplish. So, I'd like to take a moment to emphasize that we're committed to making a difference wherever we can. We're building on more than a century of honest, respectful, and fair behavior. And such behavior must continuously characterize all our actions, including progress toward improving our environmental, social, and governance programs. To share insight into our approach, we recently issued our annual report on diversity, equity, and inclusion. And we published our first sustainability report. On all dimensions, Corning is operating exceptionally well focused on providing value for all of our stakeholders. I want to thank our incredibly dedicated employees around the world for their continued hard work. And I look forward to updating you on our progress as we build on our momentum in the second half of the year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insight on the quarter.\nTony Tripeny: Thank you, Wendell, and good morning everyone. As Wendell said, we are on track for a strong year. Second quarter results were outstanding. We added almost $1 billion in sales year-over-year, a half a billion in sales over pre-pandemic levels, and we generated significant operating and free cash flow. We also improve margins both sequentially and year-over-year, which contributed to our strong EPS. Across the board, our progress has been very positive. In particular, pre-pandemic comparisons highlight our strength. We are confident this momentum will continue. In our markets, Corning\u2019s unique capabilities put us at the center of a substantial growth trend, while our content strategy drives outperformance and we have a highly effective value creation model in place to deliver profitable growth and create shareholder value. Now, let me walk you through the key metrics and drivers of our second quarter performance. Sales increased 35% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, a strong run rate. Net income was $459 million, up 111% and EPS was $0.53, up 112% year-over-year. We saw continued strength across our business segments. Optical Communications delivered its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, and we expect to see that trend continue.  Display Technologies was up sequentially and year-over-year and continues to experience the most favorable pricing environment in more than a decade. Life Sciences and environmental outperformed their markets and grew significantly versus last year's pandemic lows. Our margins expanded. Sequentially gross margin improved 200 basis points to 37.8% and operating margin improved 120 basis points to 18.3%. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin expanded 450 basis points and operating margin expanded 710 basis points. During the quarter, we continue to face supply chain disruptions and inflationary headwinds. Planning and increased output allowed us to reduce costly air freight, but the sequential improvement was offset by increases in shipping rates and the cost of certain raw materials such as resin, a key component in our optical and Life Sciences businesses. In total, we felt about the same 150 basis points drag on margins, as in Q1. Now, while we don't expect significant improvement on the supply chain cost in the short-term, we do expect them to normalize over time. And we're taking mitigating actions, including raising prices in selected product lines. Now, as is usual in the second quarter, operating expenses in dollars increased sequentially. The increase was greater than in prior years because of larger variable compensation accruals consistent with our rising outlook. Free cash flow was $471 million, up $186 million year-over-year. Cumulative free cash flow for the first half of 2021 was $843 million. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the second half of the year and to suppress our 2020 total by a wide margin. Now, let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our businesses. In Display Technology, second quarter sales were $939 million, up 9% sequentially, and 25% versus 2020. Net income was $248 million, up 16% sequentially and 63% year-over-year. And Q2 sequential prices increased moderately, as we implemented a price increase during the quarter. For the third quarter, we are moderately increasing glass prices once again. We believe the pricing environment will remain favorable going forward. Three factors will continue to drive this. First, we expect glass supply to remain short to tight in the upcoming quarters. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Now, we receive a lot of questions on how pandemic has impacted the display industry. For example, will there be fewer TVs sold in 2021 or in 2022, and what's the impact on the glass market? So, let me take a moment to explain our view. I\u2019ll focus on televisions since they represent about 70% of the glass market. Since LCD TVs emerged as mainstream technology in 2004, LCD television units have only been down three times and never two years in a row, and annual glass demand has never declined. Since 2014, television sell-through units are typically range bound between 225 million and 235 million, while average screen size grows about an inch and a half a year. In 2020, global TV units increase 4% above the trend line to about 242 million. Screen size growth was about 1.2 inches, about 20% below trend. A lot of smaller TVs sold probably to accommodate more people living, working, and studying from home. In total, glass demand was up mid-single-digits. Now, entering the year, we expected and continue to expect the market to revert the trend, implying a decrease in TV units, especially smaller TVs, and for normal growth of 1.5 inches in screen size to return. We now have retail data through the first half of 2021 and it is largely confirmatory. TV units declined by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year while average trade size growth returned to the 1.5 inches per year trend. Unit volume for TVs, 65-inches and larger increased over 20%, and smaller televisions were down by a high-single-digit percentage. Now, consistent with math and history, the glass market grew. So, halfway through the year, our expectations for TV units being down year-over-year and seeing screen size growing approximately 1.5 inches are playing out. Looking ahead to 2022, we think TV units and screen size will continue to follow historical trends. That means TV units will be within the typical range and average screen size will grow about 1.5 inches. Now, we have yet to see how the current holiday retail season plays out. So, we don't have enough information to definitively comment too much on next year. But it is worth noting that TV units, which are declining this year, have never declined two years in a row. And next year is a World Cup year and TV units have never declined in a World Cup year. And finally, the biggest driver of retail glass growth in most years is the increase in screen size.  We would expect the average screen size to once again grow 1.5 inches next year. Now where we find our views based on this year's holiday retail season, which is still in front of us, and we will keep you updated. Let's move to Optical Communications, which continues its growth in \u2013 with sales surpassing a billion dollars, up 21% year-over-year, and 15% sequentially. Sales increased by a double-digit percentage in both carrier and enterprise networks sequentially and year-over-year. Net income was $148 million of 83% year-over-year and 33% sequentially. Higher volume and better operational performance drove the improvement. The environment is extremely favorable. Demand on networks is at an all-time high. In response, operators are expanding network capacity, capabilities, and access. The pace of data centers builds is accelerating, and capital spending by our customers is increasing. Governments around the world are announcing and initiating plans to extend the reach of broadband. All this points to the start of a strong, sustained investment phase across the industry. We are the market leaders and we're well-positioned to capture significant growth as network investment increases. Our solutions improve the speed and capital efficiency of [Technical Difficulty]; additionally Corning is the only large scale Indian manufacturer of Optical Solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. Our broad customer base and unquestioned technology leadership put us squarely at the center of customer investments for fiber-to-the-home, rural broadband, 5G, and hyperscale data centers. In Environmental Technologies, second quarter results were $407 million, up 81% year-over-year, but down 8% sequentially. Net income improved year-over-year to $81 million and also grew sequentially, partly due to improved freight and logistics costs versus Q1. Car related sales increase 68% year-over-year as vehicle production [Technical Difficulty] and GPF adoption continued in Europe and China. Auto markets continue to be constrained by chip shortages, which impacted our automotive sales sequentially in the second quarter. We are monitoring in-market demand and supply chain activity as we go through the second half of the year. We remain on track to build a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business ahead of our original timeframe. We continue to innovate to solve our customer's most challenging problems, and have recently begun to ship next generation GPS to help OEMs achieve even lower levels of emissions. In diesel, sales grew 101% year-over-year driven by continued customer adoption of advanced after treatment in China, and continued strength in the North American heavy duty truck market. Specialty Materials delivered another outstanding quarter. Following first quarter year-over-year at [28%], the second quarter was up 16% year-over-year, with sales of $483 million. Demand remains strong for our premium cover glass materials in IT products. During the quarter, our premium glasses and surfaces supported multiple new phone and IT launches including 16 smartphones along with 6 laptops and tablets, featuring Gorilla Glass. Demand also remained strong for advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturing, which are essential for deep ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography. Now investments and innovations that are moving towards commercialization resulted in lower net income then in 2020. As we've noted before, newer innovations can face high cost as we develop and scale our manufacturing processes. We anticipate that profitability will improve as we come up the learning curve and improve utilization. Life Sciences second quarter sales were $312 million, up 28% year-over-year, and 4% sequentially driven by ongoing recovery in academic and pharmaceutical research labs and continued strong demand for bio production vessels and diagnostic related consumables.  Net income was $52 million, up 68% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven by the higher sales and solid operating performance. So, our business has performed very well and our markets are strong. That said, let me take a moment to reiterate our commitment to financial stewardship and capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect that to continue going forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership, and reward shareholders. Our first priority for use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through our RD&E investments, capital spending, and strategic acquisitions. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. This year, we increased our quarterly dividend by 9% and resumed share buybacks by repurchasing and retiring 4% of our outstanding common shares from Samsung Display. In closing, we had an excellent quarter. Our performance relative to both 2020 and 2019 adds to our confidence that we are on track for an outstanding year. For the third quarter, we expect core sales in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. And we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.54 to $0.59. Our value creation model is working. We are pursuing opportunities that utilize capabilities from our focused and cohesive portfolio to drive growth. By repurposing and reapplying capabilities, we're increasing our probability of success, lowering our cost of innovation, and becoming more capital efficient. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year goes on. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Tony. And Katherine, we're ready for our first question. And I ask that and \u2013 you analysts please limit to one question so we can get to everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long: Thank you. I\u2019d just ask, kind of, a two-parter on optical comms. Sounds like a lot of positives in the industry there. Could you just talk a little bit about how you see kind of the cadence of, of growth for that vertical as you see these positives emerge in both the service provider and hyperscale markets? And Tony, if you could just follow-up and talk a little bit about operating margin leverage in that business, it looked like it was solid in the quarter? How much more room is there on the margin front for optical comms? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: So first on the cadence for growth, at this time, we're going to place where, what is that if we could make more, we could sell more. And that's where our attention is. So, our cadence is going to relate more to that than normal seasonality that you'd see in optical communications. And so, we expect that cadence to continue to be strong and aimed primarily at our productivity.\nTony Tripeny: And Tim, I think you're right. I mean, we certainly do have operating leverage that will come from this business as it continues to grow. We do have some headwinds that we're facing. I\u2019d mention the inflationary headwinds with rising costs and we're, you know, working to mitigate those. So, you know, in terms of the actual pace of how that leverage happens is, you know, we need to play out over the next couple of quarters, but there's definitely operating leverage there.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Thanks for all the details on the display side of the business that\u2019s affecting TV Unit growth and screen size growth here in this year and potentially next. Now, you had very strong pricing performance as well in 2021, so, how sustainable do you view the current pricing environment? Do you see a normalized outlook on display in 2022, also translating to a reversal to low-to-mid single-digit price declines or can pricing remain better given the supply demand dynamics in glass? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks for the question Wamsi. I think it's a little early for us to be able to give you some guidance on how we feel about pricing next year. Without a doubt, our very long-term strategy that we have been pursuing here continues to bear fruit. And we're seeing pricing stabilization continue to improve throughout the time period of that effort. And there's many things that are going on technically, and with our strategic moves that lower the pricing intensity of the environment. So, we would expect all those factors to continue to be in place. But one quarter out, right now, it's probably about as far as we'd like to guide at this time on pricing. I'm sorry, Wamsi.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAsiya Merchant: Great, thank you. Some of the investors have, you know, sided caution as it relates to end device demand. I know Tony talked a lot about TVs, but maybe if you can talk about notebooks and smartphones and how you think about your components as they go into those two end-markets? And if there's any risk of excess inventory in the channel, maybe due to supply constraints, which are in the end resulting in demand push out? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks Asiya. So, let's start with the first part. So, in general, remember, our outperformance in the market is driven by our More Corning strategy like, now there's a number of great examples, but one, of course is smartphone demand where over the last number of years, smartphone demand has been pretty constant, right. It really hasn't grown. The law revenues have grown in excess of 40%. And so that content started really plays out, across really all the different device categories. So, there's always a degree of mitigation of the impact of what's going on with consumer behavior at any given point of time. So, that's first to put in context. Going forward, what we've tried to do is place that range of outcomes of consumer behavior into our guides, and into the way in which we're thinking about and planning our business in the near-term. We invest though in the long-term, right. So, we're really behind those technology trends in the More Corning strategy and then \u2013 so for us, you know, being able to call it one quarter for the other doesn't really impact our core investment strategies. But we get a ton of information because we serve those markets so broadly. We try to integrate that into the points of view that we give to you. So, I guess short version is, it\u2019s in there. Our point of view is that all that is in there, and we'll update the point of view as we learn more.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. And then on the auto glass opportunity, I know at one point, I think you guys had talked about being able to provide more color on that, you know, to a point where it reaches a certain run rate where you can then call out auto glass, is that something still in the works for 2021 or just given all the bottlenecks in automotive production should we expect that to come later, in 2022? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Great question. So things are going great for us right now in auto glass. And we should get around to figuring out the right way to update you guys on that progress. So, everything is going fine with the innovations, everything's going fine with the industry. We just have to get our act together to decide how do we best help our investors understand our trajectory in that business. So, thank you for the reminder. That's on our to-do list.\nAsiya Merchant: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Nice quarter. When do you think gross margins will be back to pre-pandemic levels?\nTony Tripeny: So, you know, right now, you know, we're clearly facing a lot of supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure. And what we saw in the first quarter was, of course, a lot of that, you know, relative to freight and logistics, we had plans to mitigate that, we actually did those mitigations, but then there were other things that occurred, you know particularly around increased resin cost.  So as, you know, we think about the guide, in particular of the guide for the third quarter, you know, we thought it was prudent to assume that that 150 basis points drag that's, you know, coming from those inflationary and supply chain logistics costs would continue. And you know, again, do the same thing.  We got lots of things to mitigate those and including, in some cases, raising prices on certain product lines. But at least we think for at least for the next couple of quarters, we'll continue to see that drag. We do believe it will mitigate over time, but exactly how long it takes to mitigate that, you know, we just need you to \u2013 we just need to let it play out.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good morning. Just one more on margins. The investment spending on specialty materials that he called out, can you give us a sense for how big that was in terms of a drag on the operating margins and how it subsides? And then just a clarification on what you just said, Tony, so going forward on the inflation pressure is 150 basis points, quarter-over-quarter those aren\u2019t changing. So, it's the same amount in dollars that you saw in Q2, is that how we should think about it?\nTony Tripeny: Yeah, that's how we should think about it. I mean, as I said, we do have some plans to mitigate some of that. We've actually implemented those plans. We just thought, as we were, you know, thinking about the guidance, you know, what happened to us in Q2, you know, it could happen to us again in Q3, where we have new areas, where we have inflationary pressure.  So, that's how we're thinking about it. It's not that we're not taking actions, but we just think from a guidance standpoint, that's about right. And then in terms of the impact on the projects and the Specialty Materials, I mean they did have an impact on our gross margin and on our operating margin, and you specifically saw that impact when you look at the specialty materials results.\nWendell Weeks: And when you think about scaling that, Steve, you have a pretty good model, I think of what the incremental should play out, and the bulk of that [delta] is our investment in this delta innovation. So, I think if you think about it that way, you've got the right sort of [boxed car]. And as to how quickly it goes away, as fast as we can make it, right. We're just coming of the production cycle here and it's progressing, but like, often with innovations, you know, it's what you don't know that surprises you as opposed to what you know. So, we should be humble in predicting the exact end of the drag.\nSteven Fox: Understood. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thanks for taking my question. Tony, I want to go back to your comment about the TV and glass market, and thanks for the detail. What I want to ask you is, what are your key assumption for the panels that are in the channel? And I'm asking that because I'm under the impression that this year we have had to refill the channel, given the strong demand in the second half. And I'm just curious we'd like to know how that channel refill will impact next year?\nTony Tripeny: Yeah, you know, Mehdi the way we always think about this is, what really matters over time is what happens in the end consumer demand and you know, where the channels, you know, go in any given quarter will, of course, you know make a difference in any quarterly number, but what we're really focused on is the longer-term trend there. And as I, you know, pointed out is that, you know, we expected coming into the year for TV units to be down, and for screen size to grow the inch and a half and at least halfway through the year, that's what we're seeing.  As we look at the next year, we'd expect to be back on the trend line that we had previously been on. And, you know, just a reminder that, you know, TV units haven't been down two years in a row, haven't been down in a World Cup year. And what really drives the growth is the screen size growth. And we expect that to be up an inch and a half. So, what we need to do is actually get through the big selling season, and then we'll have more insights once we do that.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRod Hall: Yeah. Hi, thanks for fitting me in. I just wanted to come back to the input inflation question. I guess, Tony, you call that the resin, I'm curious whether you guys are seeing other commodity inputs in play? And whether \u2013 how temporarily you think this is, do you think it's short-term or do you think that that is an ongoing theme that we'll still be talking about next year, just kind of wondering how inflation is likely to impact a model over the next, let's say 12 months? Thanks.\nTony Tripeny: So, we are seeing in other raw material areas, but, you know the biggest one that we saw in the second quarter was really in the resins? You know, it's just, [indiscernible] and shipping freight, you know, areas like that. We do think in the shipping and freight areas, you know, we saw some improvement in the second quarter, and we'd expect that to continue. You know, so, you know, I think that's exactly how this is going to play out over the next several quarters.  It is certainly hard to predict. We think it's prudent to think it is going to be there and we fought it in, you know, our guidance was based on the assumption that that was, you know, continue into the third quarter. We do believe this will normalize our mitigating actions will, you know, have an impact. So, I'm not worried about it in the longer-term, but certainly in the nearer-term, I'm more concerned about it.\nWendell Weeks: So Rod, I think it's an excellent question. And we don't know the exact answer right now. And I think anybody who says they do know the exact answer is probably being prideful. Okay. So, that's why [we're sued]. That's why we're approaching it the way that we are, which is to say, because we look to our guide, we're going to account for those things that we don't know yet that could arise from an inflationary standpoint.  And also on our mitigation actions, you see us begin to take pricing action, to [more equitably] share some of the supply chain pressures and shipping pressures that we feel. I think will \u2013 all of us will learn more here in the coming quarters.  And then as we do, we'll be able to give you, I think, a much better point of view on what happens with those cost structures, but as well, what our plans are to make sure that we're doing the right things around pricing, around cost mitigation to make sure those don't unfairly burden our shareholders.\nRod Hall: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I had one more on TV and kind of display segment. Tony, thanks for the color about the, kind of what you're seeing in retail data. I know you talked previously about China retail probably recovering and self-correcting to some extent. Just wanted to get kind of what you're seeing in the retail data relative to that market? And then display margins is 26.4 that you reported as the highest it's been for a while. So, as we think, kind of about the next couple of quarters, given that you're getting price increases is that the primary driver of improvement that we should be thinking about in the display margins? Thank you.\nTony Tripeny: So, I think from a display margin standpoint, I mean, clearly what has happened is, we've been doing a lot of build investments and as we've talked about before and as Wendell talked about, you know, when those build investments come online, you know, we have outstanding operating performance. And that's what you're really seeing in display. For sure, the pricing is also helping, but it is really what's happening from an operating performance standpoint. In terms of the China markets actually been kind of exactly where it was before. We haven't really seen much of a change there. And, you know, we're obviously monitoring it closely to see if something changes.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.\nMartin Yang: Thank you for taking the question. Good morning, everyone. The Gorilla Glass for camera, smartphone camera cover seems to be a pretty big opportunity and the market seems to be able to adopt the solution fairly quickly. Can you maybe give us more context around the supply chain, whether or not your solution can fit well into existing manufacturing process? And how are the customer feedback so far on the new product?\nWendell Weeks: Thanks Martin. We\u2019re quite excited about this opportunity as well. So, thanks for calling it out. The way the supply chain works is, we will literally provide that part, a cover part. So, both the underlying structure, the glass structures, as well as the material we use to drive the composite to be able to improve the optics and durability of those cameras. So, we've built the supply chain to be able to have that roll into, really the same plants that ultimately glass parts go to, to build phones. So, we feel pretty good that we have the capability that we\u2019ve built the capability to serve the market. And so now it will be, how quickly will the technology be adopted? Because it is new, it is a new feature for phones. It does improve camera performance pretty darn significantly. So, we're hoping that that becomes pretty rapidly adopted. One thing that's going to impact pacing though is, when you change the light capturing capabilities of a camera. Remember that cameras are pretty complex devices, right. So, you have the whole lens system, and you have different chipsets to deal with that imaging, and they're built around an optical chain that is a certain amount of light that's available. So, we're actually improving that. And so, as you improve that to take full advantage of it, you probably need to optimize some other components. So, we do think that though it is relatively easily adoptable, there are things that you would need to do differently to take full advantage of this to deliver an advantage and customer experience.\nMartin Yang: That's really helpful. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: Comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I have a big picture question. During this script, you noted build projects you've undertaken from 2016 to 2019, have an ROIC of over 20%, you're kind of, this is my word, but in a harvesting mode on some of those, how should we think about the case of the investments you've made over the last few years? Just in terms of thinking about how you maintain, you know, sort of the continued benefit from, I don't know where you're investing in, and so that in four years, you can say that, you know, the ones you've done, you know, right now are yielding sort of a similar growth rate? I'm just trying to understand, you know, the building blocks to get us to the future strong revenue growth, given what you've done in the past four years. Thank you.\nTony Tripeny: So, Shannon, that's a great question. The first thing I would say is, you know, our focus right now is on what we call our extend capital. And that extend capital is, you know, how we continue to grow in our businesses. And a lot of the growth that we're experiencing right now really comes from the investments we've made the last couple of years from the extend capital in addition to the build capital. And we'd expect that, you know, we\u2019ve got a lot of extended capital that we're putting in place right now and that's going to continue to support our growth going forward.  You know, given our more Corning trends, and you know, our innovation model and the opportunities that we see out there, that really gives us a chance to perform much better than the underlying markets. And I'm sure at some point, we will be back at looking at build capital. And when we do that, you know, we'll do that with real customer commitments, including, you know, financing.  So, you know, we think this is a great model to run our business with, it's really improved our capital efficiencies, it's improved our return on invested capitals. And, you know, I think from a shareholder standpoint, this is a great way to run our businesses.\nShannon Cross: Great, thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Let's take one more question before we close.\nOperator: Okay. And that comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe following up on the last question, you know, Wendell, you guys mentioned, kind of constraints on the optical side, you know, you've also mentioned, kind of increased ROIC. You've been pretty reserved on, kind of CapEx, rightfully, so kind of during a lower cash flow generation period, but as that picks up, you know, just what should we consider for CapEx for the remainder of the year? You know, we do step-up some of the investments to increase product availability. Thanks.\nTony Tripeny: You know, I think our underlying view on what capital spending is going to be this year is, you know, roughly the same as it's been since the beginning of the year. You know, we knew we were going to have a good year, a strong year with growth. It's a little bit, you know, going faster than maybe what we originally projected. So, maybe capital will go up a little bit more than our original projections, but our original outlook would be pretty similar to what we did in 2020, maybe it'll be a little bit higher than that, but not a lot higher than that.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks.\nAnn Nicholson: Great. All right. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. Before we close, I wanted to let you know that we're going to be attending the Jefferies Virtual Conference on September 1; and the Citi Virtual Conference on September 14. You can find a replay of today's call on our site starting later this morning. Once again, thank you for joining us, and Katherine, you can disconnect all lines.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you and good morning everyone. Today we reported outstanding second quarter results, and we're on track for a strong year. Versus second quarter 2020, sales grew 35% to $3.5 billion. EPS grew 112% to $0.53 on the higher sales and expanding margins. Free cash flow grew 65% to $471 million with first half cash generation of $843 million. No question, we're in great shape. And we see a clear growth story playing out across our businesses. Each of our five segments grew sales by a double-digit percentage year-over-year ranging from 16% for specialty materials to 80% for environmental technologies. Now, of course, 2020 was an easy compare, so I think it's worth noting that even versus second quarter of 2019 we grew total company sales and EPS 17% and 18% respectively. Since the second quarter of 2019, we've added more than half a billion dollars in quarterly sales. About $200 million is from Hemlock and more than $300 million is organic growth, with about 70% of that coming from success of our more Corning content strategy and outperforming the competition. The other 30% of organic growth is from rising with the market. In each of our market access platforms, we're addressing significant and transformational trends. We seek to drive content and expand our total addressable market by combining capabilities from our focused portfolio and prioritizing opportunities for more Corning. Our long-term strategy is built on a complimentary set of three core technologies for our proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms. We're leaders in age and the synergies among them allow us to create distinctive benefits for our customer, improve the return on our investments in R&D, and reduce capital intensity. We create breakthrough products and processes by leveraging the synergies among our core capabilities. Capitalizing on insights we gain through close collaboration with our customers and taking advantage of our existing plants and pilot facilities for early stage production. For example, over the past few years, we have created new to the world products, including ceramic shield, tougher Gorilla Glasses, auto-grade glass, Valor drug packaging, Gen 10.5 display glass, and innovative passive optical solutions that are dramatically increasing the ease and cost efficiency of network deployments. But we're not just creators. We're also builders. We do the manufacturing ourselves, using processes that we invent, and proprietary equipment that we design and build. When growth opportunities arise and demand exceeds our existing capacity, we build state-of-the-art plants to manufacture products at scale. And we locate these plants in close proximity to our customers. A strategy that is likely to continue to pay-off in a post pandemic world. We de-risk these investments by requiring meaningful commitments from customers, often including funding before beginning construction. We last detailed our build investments with you in 2019 when we described our focus, create, build, extend value creation cycle. We pointed out how our build projects were directly responding to customer needs and commitments. We knew that carriers like AT&T and Verizon would need more fiber to densify their networks for 5G. We knew that BOE would need glass for its Gen 10.5 panels, that car companies would need gasoline particulate filters to meet new regulations, that biotech companies would need high density cell culture to support gene therapy, and that smartphone OEMs would need increasingly durable scratch resistant cover glass as they designed thinner phones and bigger cameras. We told you these build projects would increase our capacity to meet committed demand and that as we delivered on that demand, they would increase our revenue and generate excellent returns. We are delivering. Today, the build projects we undertook from 2016 to 2019 are collectively delivering return on invested capital above 20%. They've helped us increase our sales run rate from $10 billion in 2015 and 2016 to our current run rate of $14 billion and they've helped us improve total company ROIC by 3 percentage points. Importantly, each time we build, we increase our scale, and we enhance the opportunity to extend our leadership, and create new innovations. And because we're constantly improving our productivity and capabilities, we can often manufacture these innovations and drive revenue growth without building new facilities. And we actually spend most of our time in this extend part of the cycle it's where we are today. In this [space], we keep creating and extending until we're so successful that demand exceeds our capacity. As we reapply our insights and repurpose our assets, our best-in-the-world capabilities just keep getting better. Every time we pursue an adjacent opportunity, we explore new combinations of capabilities. We push the boundaries in areas where we already lead, and we cross train our people indeed in important ways. In other words, we've created a positive feedback loop that expands our knowledge, increases the relevance of our capabilities, and enhances our value to customers. And this directly fuels our content strategy. We aren't exclusively relying on people buying more stuff we're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying, with that in mind. Let's look at some of the initiatives we're advancing across our market access platforms. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we continue to help transform the way people interact with and use their devices. We capture growth by increasing the value we offer on each of those devices. In the quarter, consistent with our strategy to obtain customer commitments and supportive build initiatives, Apple awarded Corning an additional $45 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to help expand our manufacturing capacity in the United States and to support our R&D. To date, we've received $495 million in total from Apple's fund. We've also launched another chapter in our More Corning strategy with an important application of our capabilities to enhance the optics of smartphone cameras, which is a new category for us. The social media experience is centered around photos. Device designers are adding cameras and increasing lens size. They're also integrating more advanced capabilities, such as telephoto, wide angle lenses, and infrared sensors.  These features naturally increase the prominence of the lens surface area, which in turn increases the likelihood of scratches and damage. And to Corning, just last week, we announced Gorilla Glass with DX and DX+ for mobile phone cameras. Our DX increases image quality and camera durability by providing a composite glass material that combines low reflection with scratch resistance approaching sapphire. Samsung is the first adopter.  Turning to Automotive, OEMs are designing creative and safer vehicles with technology that enhances the driving experience. We're uniquely suited to address these trends. We're pursuing a $100 per car content opportunity across emissions, precision glass products, and auto-glass solutions. And we recently entered a new product category in automotive, Curved Mirror Solutions. Our solutions are enabling the augmented reality head up display in Hyundai's new electric crossover, the IONIQ 5. The system essentially turns the windshield into a display screen, letting drivers keep their eyes on the road, while assessing navigation and speed information directly in their line of sight. Additionally, a new generation of gasoline particulate filters is helping us on our way to surpassing $500 million in annual GPF sales well ahead of our original timeframe. Turning to Life Sciences, we're delivering growth on multiple fronts. We're seeing ongoing demand in support of the global pandemic response. Our inventions are helping advance the transition to cell and gene therapies. And we're making significant strides toward building a Valor Glass franchise addressing a multi-billion dollar content opportunity in the pharmaceutical packaging market. In the second quarter, we further increased valid production capacity and secured additional customer wins. We worked with Thermo Fisher and OPTIMA pharma to demonstrate solutions that increase bio filling speed by nearly 70% thereby alleviating a critical bottleneck in the medical supply chain. Our collaboration features a combination of Corning's Valor vials and OPTIMA's ultra high-speed fill/finish solutions. Thermo Fisher called the results, \u2018a game changer in their ability to serve patients.' Turning to display, we've experienced the most favorable pricing environment in more than a decade. And we announced a second moderate increase to our display glass substrate prices. Stepping back, we're the lowest cost producer of display glass, which makes us significantly more profitable than our competitors, our superior products [innovation capabilities] and deep customer relationships enable us to enhance our leadership position. Meanwhile, the emergence of Gen 10.5 has given us a unique opportunity. Other market for large sized keys is expected and projected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2024. And Gen 10.5 half glass provides the most economical approach for larger sets. We recently hosted the official opening ceremony for our Gen 10.5 facility in the city of Wuhan. This site is co-located with a large BOE plant, allowing Corning to deliver Gen 10.5 glass substrates more efficiently to our customer for its production of large size display panels. Gen 10.5 provides strong economics for our shareholders, while creating options to use earlier generation fusion tanks for new applications such as automotive and cover glass. To illustrate, remember that we launched our Gorilla Glass business back in 2007 by repurposing some of our existing fusion assets. Over time, repurposing has resulted in us avoiding more than a billion dollars in capital spending. Finally, let's look at optical communications. We're energized by the momentum that is building in this business. We see that momentum confirmed by multiple sources. First is network need. Demand on the network has only been increasing. Broadband usage for June was up 33% versus pre-pandemic levels and up 10% versus June 2020, which was a peak quarantine period. Global 5G subscriptions have grown to almost 300 million and they're on track to double that by the end of 2021 according to industry projections. The second confirmation is customer commitments. And many of our customers are actually being quite public about their plans. We believe we're in the early innings of a large capital deployment cycle across 5G, fiber-to-the-home, and hyperscale data centers. On AT&T earnings call last week, their CEO said that by year-end they expect to have expanded their fiber footprint by 3 million locations, including both business and consumer customers. Deutsche Telekom's Managing Director recently shared that by 2024 they're planning to have about 10 million homes passed and 97% 5G coverage. He said, \u2018the expansion of high performance networks is our top priority, whether with 5G and mobile communications, or fiber optic broadband expansion. To achieve this, we are massively increasing the investments in our network.' And Microsoft CEO recently shared his perspective on expanding data center capacity to meet cloud demand. He said, \u2018Digital adoption curves aren't slowing down. In fact, they're accelerating, and it's just the beginning.' Of course, the third confirmation is our order book, which is perhaps the most important indicator of growth over the next few quarters. Here, we're seeing year-over-year growth in double-digit percentages in both carrier and enterprise networks. During the quarter, we extended our technology and market leadership in Optical Communications by introducing little solutions that speed network deployment. We launched [Corning SMF-28 Contour fiber], which offers an industry first combination of superior bendability, compatibility with other fibers, and low signal loss. We also launched EDGE Rapid Connect solutions that increase fiber density and reduce customer installation time by up to 70%.  Across our markets, you can see that our value creation model is driving growth and that key trends are converging around our capabilities. We're helping our customers move toward a world with nearly infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth, with large lifelike displays where cars are cleaner, autonomous, and connected, where medicines are individualized, effective, and safe, and where you can do more from your mobile device protected by cover materials that are more and more capable. Now, I'll wrap up my remarks today with one final point. I've always said that how we do things is as important as what we accomplish. So, I'd like to take a moment to emphasize that we're committed to making a difference wherever we can. We're building on more than a century of honest, respectful, and fair behavior. And such behavior must continuously characterize all our actions, including progress toward improving our environmental, social, and governance programs. To share insight into our approach, we recently issued our annual report on diversity, equity, and inclusion. And we published our first sustainability report. On all dimensions, Corning is operating exceptionally well focused on providing value for all of our stakeholders. I want to thank our incredibly dedicated employees around the world for their continued hard work. And I look forward to updating you on our progress as we build on our momentum in the second half of the year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insight on the quarter. So first on the cadence for growth, at this time, we're going to place where, what is that if we could make more, we could sell more. And that's where our attention is. So, our cadence is going to relate more to that than normal seasonality that you'd see in optical communications. And so, we expect that cadence to continue to be strong and aimed primarily at our productivity. Thanks for the question Wamsi. I think it's a little early for us to be able to give you some guidance on how we feel about pricing next year. Without a doubt, our very long-term strategy that we have been pursuing here continues to bear fruit. And we're seeing pricing stabilization continue to improve throughout the time period of that effort. And there's many things that are going on technically, and with our strategic moves that lower the pricing intensity of the environment. So, we would expect all those factors to continue to be in place. But one quarter out, right now, it's probably about as far as we'd like to guide at this time on pricing. I'm sorry, Wamsi. Thanks Asiya. So, let's start with the first part. So, in general, remember, our outperformance in the market is driven by our More Corning strategy like, now there's a number of great examples, but one, of course is smartphone demand where over the last number of years, smartphone demand has been pretty constant, right. It really hasn't grown. The law revenues have grown in excess of 40%. And so that content started really plays out, across really all the different device categories. So, there's always a degree of mitigation of the impact of what's going on with consumer behavior at any given point of time. So, that's first to put in context. Going forward, what we've tried to do is place that range of outcomes of consumer behavior into our guides, and into the way in which we're thinking about and planning our business in the near-term. We invest though in the long-term, right. So, we're really behind those technology trends in the More Corning strategy and then \u2013 so for us, you know, being able to call it one quarter for the other doesn't really impact our core investment strategies. But we get a ton of information because we serve those markets so broadly. We try to integrate that into the points of view that we give to you. So, I guess short version is, it's in there. Our point of view is that all that is in there, and we'll update the point of view as we learn more. Great question. So things are going great for us right now in auto glass. And we should get around to figuring out the right way to update you guys on that progress. So, everything is going fine with the innovations, everything's going fine with the industry. We just have to get our act together to decide how do we best help our investors understand our trajectory in that business. So, thank you for the reminder. That's on our to-do list. And when you think about scaling that, Steve, you have a pretty good model, I think of what the incremental should play out, and the bulk of that [delta] is our investment in this delta innovation. So, I think if you think about it that way, you've got the right sort of [boxed car]. And as to how quickly it goes away, as fast as we can make it, right. We're just coming of the production cycle here and it's progressing, but like, often with innovations, you know, it's what you don't know that surprises you as opposed to what you know. So, we should be humble in predicting the exact end of the drag. So Rod, I think it's an excellent question. And we don't know the exact answer right now. And I think anybody who says they do know the exact answer is probably being prideful. Okay. So, that's why [we're sued]. That's why we're approaching it the way that we are, which is to say, because we look to our guide, we're going to account for those things that we don't know yet that could arise from an inflationary standpoint.  And also on our mitigation actions, you see us begin to take pricing action, to [more equitably] share some of the supply chain pressures and shipping pressures that we feel. I think will \u2013 all of us will learn more here in the coming quarters.  And then as we do, we'll be able to give you, I think, a much better point of view on what happens with those cost structures, but as well, what our plans are to make sure that we're doing the right things around pricing, around cost mitigation to make sure those don't unfairly burden our shareholders. Thanks Martin. We're quite excited about this opportunity as well. So, thanks for calling it out. The way the supply chain works is, we will literally provide that part, a cover part. So, both the underlying structure, the glass structures, as well as the material we use to drive the composite to be able to improve the optics and durability of those cameras. So, we've built the supply chain to be able to have that roll into, really the same plants that ultimately glass parts go to, to build phones. So, we feel pretty good that we have the capability that we've built the capability to serve the market. And so now it will be, how quickly will the technology be adopted? Because it is new, it is a new feature for phones. It does improve camera performance pretty darn significantly. So, we're hoping that that becomes pretty rapidly adopted. One thing that's going to impact pacing though is, when you change the light capturing capabilities of a camera. Remember that cameras are pretty complex devices, right. So, you have the whole lens system, and you have different chipsets to deal with that imaging, and they're built around an optical chain that is a certain amount of light that's available. So, we're actually improving that. And so, as you improve that to take full advantage of it, you probably need to optimize some other components. So, we do think that though it is relatively easily adoptable, there are things that you would need to do differently to take full advantage of this to deliver an advantage and customer experience."

            "content": "Thank you, Wendell, and good morning everyone. As Wendell said, we are on track for a strong year. Second quarter results were outstanding. We added almost $1 billion in sales year-over-year, a half a billion in sales over pre-pandemic levels, and we generated significant operating and free cash flow. We also improve margins both sequentially and year-over-year, which contributed to our strong EPS. Across the board, our progress has been very positive. In particular, pre-pandemic comparisons highlight our strength. We are confident this momentum will continue. In our markets, Corning's unique capabilities put us at the center of a substantial growth trend, while our content strategy drives outperformance and we have a highly effective value creation model in place to deliver profitable growth and create shareholder value. Now, let me walk you through the key metrics and drivers of our second quarter performance. Sales increased 35% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, a strong run rate. Net income was $459 million, up 111% and EPS was $0.53, up 112% year-over-year. We saw continued strength across our business segments. Optical Communications delivered its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, and we expect to see that trend continue.  Display Technologies was up sequentially and year-over-year and continues to experience the most favorable pricing environment in more than a decade. Life Sciences and environmental outperformed their markets and grew significantly versus last year's pandemic lows. Our margins expanded. Sequentially gross margin improved 200 basis points to 37.8% and operating margin improved 120 basis points to 18.3%. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin expanded 450 basis points and operating margin expanded 710 basis points. During the quarter, we continue to face supply chain disruptions and inflationary headwinds. Planning and increased output allowed us to reduce costly air freight, but the sequential improvement was offset by increases in shipping rates and the cost of certain raw materials such as resin, a key component in our optical and Life Sciences businesses. In total, we felt about the same 150 basis points drag on margins, as in Q1. Now, while we don't expect significant improvement on the supply chain cost in the short-term, we do expect them to normalize over time. And we're taking mitigating actions, including raising prices in selected product lines. Now, as is usual in the second quarter, operating expenses in dollars increased sequentially. The increase was greater than in prior years because of larger variable compensation accruals consistent with our rising outlook. Free cash flow was $471 million, up $186 million year-over-year. Cumulative free cash flow for the first half of 2021 was $843 million. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the second half of the year and to suppress our 2020 total by a wide margin. Now, let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our businesses. In Display Technology, second quarter sales were $939 million, up 9% sequentially, and 25% versus 2020. Net income was $248 million, up 16% sequentially and 63% year-over-year. And Q2 sequential prices increased moderately, as we implemented a price increase during the quarter. For the third quarter, we are moderately increasing glass prices once again. We believe the pricing environment will remain favorable going forward. Three factors will continue to drive this. First, we expect glass supply to remain short to tight in the upcoming quarters. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Now, we receive a lot of questions on how pandemic has impacted the display industry. For example, will there be fewer TVs sold in 2021 or in 2022, and what's the impact on the glass market? So, let me take a moment to explain our view. I'll focus on televisions since they represent about 70% of the glass market. Since LCD TVs emerged as mainstream technology in 2004, LCD television units have only been down three times and never two years in a row, and annual glass demand has never declined. Since 2014, television sell-through units are typically range bound between 225 million and 235 million, while average screen size grows about an inch and a half a year. In 2020, global TV units increase 4% above the trend line to about 242 million. Screen size growth was about 1.2 inches, about 20% below trend. A lot of smaller TVs sold probably to accommodate more people living, working, and studying from home. In total, glass demand was up mid-single-digits. Now, entering the year, we expected and continue to expect the market to revert the trend, implying a decrease in TV units, especially smaller TVs, and for normal growth of 1.5 inches in screen size to return. We now have retail data through the first half of 2021 and it is largely confirmatory. TV units declined by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year while average trade size growth returned to the 1.5 inches per year trend. Unit volume for TVs, 65-inches and larger increased over 20%, and smaller televisions were down by a high-single-digit percentage. Now, consistent with math and history, the glass market grew. So, halfway through the year, our expectations for TV units being down year-over-year and seeing screen size growing approximately 1.5 inches are playing out. Looking ahead to 2022, we think TV units and screen size will continue to follow historical trends. That means TV units will be within the typical range and average screen size will grow about 1.5 inches. Now, we have yet to see how the current holiday retail season plays out. So, we don't have enough information to definitively comment too much on next year. But it is worth noting that TV units, which are declining this year, have never declined two years in a row. And next year is a World Cup year and TV units have never declined in a World Cup year. And finally, the biggest driver of retail glass growth in most years is the increase in screen size.  We would expect the average screen size to once again grow 1.5 inches next year. Now where we find our views based on this year's holiday retail season, which is still in front of us, and we will keep you updated. Let's move to Optical Communications, which continues its growth in \u2013 with sales surpassing a billion dollars, up 21% year-over-year, and 15% sequentially. Sales increased by a double-digit percentage in both carrier and enterprise networks sequentially and year-over-year. Net income was $148 million of 83% year-over-year and 33% sequentially. Higher volume and better operational performance drove the improvement. The environment is extremely favorable. Demand on networks is at an all-time high. In response, operators are expanding network capacity, capabilities, and access. The pace of data centers builds is accelerating, and capital spending by our customers is increasing. Governments around the world are announcing and initiating plans to extend the reach of broadband. All this points to the start of a strong, sustained investment phase across the industry. We are the market leaders and we're well-positioned to capture significant growth as network investment increases. Our solutions improve the speed and capital efficiency of [Technical Difficulty]; additionally Corning is the only large scale Indian manufacturer of Optical Solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. Our broad customer base and unquestioned technology leadership put us squarely at the center of customer investments for fiber-to-the-home, rural broadband, 5G, and hyperscale data centers. In Environmental Technologies, second quarter results were $407 million, up 81% year-over-year, but down 8% sequentially. Net income improved year-over-year to $81 million and also grew sequentially, partly due to improved freight and logistics costs versus Q1. Car related sales increase 68% year-over-year as vehicle production [Technical Difficulty] and GPF adoption continued in Europe and China. Auto markets continue to be constrained by chip shortages, which impacted our automotive sales sequentially in the second quarter. We are monitoring in-market demand and supply chain activity as we go through the second half of the year. We remain on track to build a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business ahead of our original timeframe. We continue to innovate to solve our customer's most challenging problems, and have recently begun to ship next generation GPS to help OEMs achieve even lower levels of emissions. In diesel, sales grew 101% year-over-year driven by continued customer adoption of advanced after treatment in China, and continued strength in the North American heavy duty truck market. Specialty Materials delivered another outstanding quarter. Following first quarter year-over-year at [28%], the second quarter was up 16% year-over-year, with sales of $483 million. Demand remains strong for our premium cover glass materials in IT products. During the quarter, our premium glasses and surfaces supported multiple new phone and IT launches including 16 smartphones along with 6 laptops and tablets, featuring Gorilla Glass. Demand also remained strong for advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturing, which are essential for deep ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography. Now investments and innovations that are moving towards commercialization resulted in lower net income then in 2020. As we've noted before, newer innovations can face high cost as we develop and scale our manufacturing processes. We anticipate that profitability will improve as we come up the learning curve and improve utilization. Life Sciences second quarter sales were $312 million, up 28% year-over-year, and 4% sequentially driven by ongoing recovery in academic and pharmaceutical research labs and continued strong demand for bio production vessels and diagnostic related consumables.  Net income was $52 million, up 68% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven by the higher sales and solid operating performance. So, our business has performed very well and our markets are strong. That said, let me take a moment to reiterate our commitment to financial stewardship and capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect that to continue going forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership, and reward shareholders. Our first priority for use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through our RD&E investments, capital spending, and strategic acquisitions. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. This year, we increased our quarterly dividend by 9% and resumed share buybacks by repurchasing and retiring 4% of our outstanding common shares from Samsung Display. In closing, we had an excellent quarter. Our performance relative to both 2020 and 2019 adds to our confidence that we are on track for an outstanding year. For the third quarter, we expect core sales in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. And we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.54 to $0.59. Our value creation model is working. We are pursuing opportunities that utilize capabilities from our focused and cohesive portfolio to drive growth. By repurposing and reapplying capabilities, we're increasing our probability of success, lowering our cost of innovation, and becoming more capital efficient. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year goes on. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann? And Tim, I think you're right. I mean, we certainly do have operating leverage that will come from this business as it continues to grow. We do have some headwinds that we're facing. I'd mention the inflationary headwinds with rising costs and we're, you know, working to mitigate those. So, you know, in terms of the actual pace of how that leverage happens is, you know, we need to play out over the next couple of quarters, but there's definitely operating leverage there. So, you know, right now, you know, we're clearly facing a lot of supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure. And what we saw in the first quarter was, of course, a lot of that, you know, relative to freight and logistics, we had plans to mitigate that, we actually did those mitigations, but then there were other things that occurred, you know particularly around increased resin cost.  So as, you know, we think about the guide, in particular of the guide for the third quarter, you know, we thought it was prudent to assume that that 150 basis points drag that's, you know, coming from those inflationary and supply chain logistics costs would continue. And you know, again, do the same thing.  We got lots of things to mitigate those and including, in some cases, raising prices on certain product lines. But at least we think for at least for the next couple of quarters, we'll continue to see that drag. We do believe it will mitigate over time, but exactly how long it takes to mitigate that, you know, we just need you to \u2013 we just need to let it play out. Yeah, that's how we should think about it. I mean, as I said, we do have some plans to mitigate some of that. We've actually implemented those plans. We just thought, as we were, you know, thinking about the guidance, you know, what happened to us in Q2, you know, it could happen to us again in Q3, where we have new areas, where we have inflationary pressure.  So, that's how we're thinking about it. It's not that we're not taking actions, but we just think from a guidance standpoint, that's about right. And then in terms of the impact on the projects and the Specialty Materials, I mean they did have an impact on our gross margin and on our operating margin, and you specifically saw that impact when you look at the specialty materials results. Yeah, you know, Mehdi the way we always think about this is, what really matters over time is what happens in the end consumer demand and you know, where the channels, you know, go in any given quarter will, of course, you know make a difference in any quarterly number, but what we're really focused on is the longer-term trend there. And as I, you know, pointed out is that, you know, we expected coming into the year for TV units to be down, and for screen size to grow the inch and a half and at least halfway through the year, that's what we're seeing.  As we look at the next year, we'd expect to be back on the trend line that we had previously been on. And, you know, just a reminder that, you know, TV units haven't been down two years in a row, haven't been down in a World Cup year. And what really drives the growth is the screen size growth. And we expect that to be up an inch and a half. So, what we need to do is actually get through the big selling season, and then we'll have more insights once we do that. So, we are seeing in other raw material areas, but, you know the biggest one that we saw in the second quarter was really in the resins? You know, it's just, [indiscernible] and shipping freight, you know, areas like that. We do think in the shipping and freight areas, you know, we saw some improvement in the second quarter, and we'd expect that to continue. You know, so, you know, I think that's exactly how this is going to play out over the next several quarters.  It is certainly hard to predict. We think it's prudent to think it is going to be there and we fought it in, you know, our guidance was based on the assumption that that was, you know, continue into the third quarter. We do believe this will normalize our mitigating actions will, you know, have an impact. So, I'm not worried about it in the longer-term, but certainly in the nearer-term, I'm more concerned about it. So, I think from a display margin standpoint, I mean, clearly what has happened is, we've been doing a lot of build investments and as we've talked about before and as Wendell talked about, you know, when those build investments come online, you know, we have outstanding operating performance. And that's what you're really seeing in display. For sure, the pricing is also helping, but it is really what's happening from an operating performance standpoint. In terms of the China markets actually been kind of exactly where it was before. We haven't really seen much of a change there. And, you know, we're obviously monitoring it closely to see if something changes. So, Shannon, that's a great question. The first thing I would say is, you know, our focus right now is on what we call our extend capital. And that extend capital is, you know, how we continue to grow in our businesses. And a lot of the growth that we're experiencing right now really comes from the investments we've made the last couple of years from the extend capital in addition to the build capital. And we'd expect that, you know, we've got a lot of extended capital that we're putting in place right now and that's going to continue to support our growth going forward.  You know, given our more Corning trends, and you know, our innovation model and the opportunities that we see out there, that really gives us a chance to perform much better than the underlying markets. And I'm sure at some point, we will be back at looking at build capital. And when we do that, you know, we'll do that with real customer commitments, including, you know, financing.  So, you know, we think this is a great model to run our business with, it's really improved our capital efficiencies, it's improved our return on invested capitals. And, you know, I think from a shareholder standpoint, this is a great way to run our businesses. You know, I think our underlying view on what capital spending is going to be this year is, you know, roughly the same as it's been since the beginning of the year. You know, we knew we were going to have a good year, a strong year with growth. It's a little bit, you know, going faster than maybe what we originally projected. So, maybe capital will go up a little bit more than our original projections, but our original outlook would be pretty similar to what we did in 2020, maybe it'll be a little bit higher than that, but not a lot higher than that."

[Operator Instructions] It is my pleasure to introduce you to Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the first quarter, the largest difference between our GAAP and core results stemmed from noncash mark-to-market gains associated with the company's currency hedging contracts. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this increased GAAP earnings in Q1 by $308 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges provide us \u2013 protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than five years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the interactive analyst segment. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported a strong start to what we expect to be an outstanding year. For the first quarter, we grew sales 29% year-over-year to $3.3 billion. We grew EPS by 125% to $0.44. Free cash flow of $372 million builds on the momentum we established in the second half of 2020. All five of our segments delivered double-digit sales and net income growth year-over-year, with sales growth rates ranging from 50% for display to 38% for environmental. But last year was an easy compare. So I think it's worth noting that total company sales are up 14% since the first quarter of 2019. No question, we're in a strong position. This morning, I want to take a closer look at how all our businesses are achieving key milestones and contributing to Corning's success. I'll frame my remarks around three points. First, invention is fundamental to our long-term strategy. Through our relentless commitment to R&D, we developed category-defining products to transform industries and enhance lives. Second, as we partner closely with our customers to move their industries forward, we unlock new ways to integrate more Corning content into their ecosystems. This is a powerful growth mechanism. And finally, we continue to build a stronger, more resilient company, one that is committed to rewarding shareholders while supporting our customers, our people and our communities. Now let me expand on my first point. We're living in a world that Corning anticipated exactly a decade ago in our video, A Day Made of Glass. It's a world where technology underpins every facet of human life; a world of communication and connection, where massive bandwidth facilitates real-time information and on-demand connections and people stay connected through a virtual environment that is literally at their fingertips. Let's think about what it means as displays and touchscreen devices make their way to the very center of daily life. The demands we're putting on today's screens and the expectations we have for tomorrow's imply a very specific set of properties. The requirements for precision glass and ceramics become more and more exacting. We need a material that is strong, yet thin and lightweight, flexible and conformable, durable, damage-resistant and impermeable, stable enough to withstand hostile weather, extreme temperatures and cleaning agents. It needs to be touch-friendly and look elegant. It must scale for very large applications and yet be useful in the palm of your hand or on your wrist. The material must also be operable with a world of technical capabilities that lie just below the surface, enabling complex electronic circuits and nano scale structure. And it must be mindful of the environment. When it comes to the critical components that enable high technology systems in multiple markets that we serve, the bar just keeps getting higher. This leads to a world where precision glass and ceramics win. And we have been winning. When we examine the growth in all our business today, we see key trends converging around our capabilities at a very exciting pace. In short, we're vital to progress. We succeed through sustained investments in R&D and years of material science and process engineering knowledge. Everything begins with our cohesive portfolio. Corning is one of the world's most proficient innovators in materials science. We combine our unparalleled expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with our proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms to develop category defining products that transform industries and enhance lives. Today, our inventions clean the air we all breathe, connect people to information and each other, provide the window through which we access information and entertainment. And they help facilitate the discovery and delivery of new medicines. And we're building in each of these areas. We're helping our customers move toward a world with nearly infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth; with large lifelike displays, where cars are cleaner, autonomous and connected; where medicines are individualized, effective and safe; and where you can do more right from your mobile device, protected by cover materials that can withstand even greater reviews. That leads me to my second point. As we work closely with our customers to advance these visions, we find ways to solve their toughest technology challenges. Our probability of success increases as we apply more of our world-class capabilities, and our cost of innovation declines as we reapply talent and repurpose our existing assets. As we apply our focused portfolio, we invent solutions that add even more value to our customers' offerings, and this provides a powerful growth mechanism. We aren't exclusively relying on people just buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. Now through that lens, let's look at our progress across our market access platforms. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we continue to help transform the way people interact with and use their devices. And we're capturing significant growth by increasing the value we offer on each of those devices. As we advance state-of-the-art for cover materials, we drive sustained outperformance across up and down markets. We've grown specialty sales every year from 2016 to today despite smartphone unit sales being roughly flat or down each year. Over that five-year period, we've added more than $750 million in sales on a base of more than $1 billion. Fast Company recently recognized our achievements in this space. Noting both Ceramic Shield and Gorilla Glass Victus, the magazine named Corning The Most Innovative Company in Consumer Electronics for 2021. We see a similar growth story playing out in automotive since 2017, the peak year for car sales. Our auto sales are up more than 40%, while global car sales are down 20%. We're helping customers navigate an industry that is expected to change more in the next 10 years than it has in the past 15. And as we do, we're working to capture and expand $100 per car content opportunity across emissions, auto glass solutions and other technical glass products, including our patented 3D ColdForm technology. We were thrilled to see the world premier event for the all-electric EQS for Mercedes. Its hyper screen features a Gorilla Glass cover almost five feet wide. We've also launched a new generation of GPS. They're helping vehicles including hybrids, achieve even lower levels of fine particulate emissions. And they're helping us exceed a $500 million GPF business ahead of our original time frame. In Life Sciences, we are delivering growth on two fronts. First, demand is growing based on COVID-19 vaccines and diagnostics. Second, we're becoming increasingly relevant as we help the industry move towards cell engine-based therapies, and that shift translates into more of our content per drug sold. Looking longer term, we're making significant strides toward building a Valor Glass franchise, addressing a multibillion-dollar content opportunity in pharmaceutical packaging markets. We doubled Valor vial production in quarter one versus quarter four. And to-date, the company has shipped enough Valor vials for hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Corning also expanded its agreement with the U.S. government to boost capacity for vials to $261 million, a $57 million increase from our initial June 2020 agreement. Turning to display. We're leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver stable returns. I'm pleased to note that in quarter one, we experienced the most favorable first quarter pricing environment in more than a decade. And we announced a moderate increase to our display glass substrate prices for the second quarter. Stepping back. We're the lowest-cost producer of display glass, which makes us significantly more profitable than our competitors. Our superior products, innovation capabilities and deep customer relationships enable us to maintain our leadership position. And our flexible fusion manufacturing platform allows us to match operating capacity with demand. Meanwhile, the emergence of Gen 10.5 has given us a unique opportunity. Demand for large-sized TVs continues to grow. 75-inch sets were up more than 60% last year. These TVs are most efficiently made on the largest fabs, and Corning is well positioned to drive more content into the market in 2021 with its Gen 10.5 plants in China. Finally, let's look at optical. I'm energized by the outlook for this business. We gauge the market by three indicators. First is network need, and we can all see that demand on the network is only increasing. Second is customer statements. Broadly, network operators are making encouraging announcements on capital investment for 5G and hyperscale data center deployments. And there's also good news on fiber-to-the-home. AT&T\u2019s CEO, John Stankey recently said that fiber underpins the connectivity we deliver, serving both wired and wireless. His company announced plans to increase its fiber-to-the-home footprint by an additional three million customer locations across more than 90 metro areas in 2021. Verizon CFO, Matt Ellis said the fiber serves as the critical backbone to our 5G deployment. Our commitments with our vendor partners, such as Samsung, Nokia, Ericsson and Corning, represent key strategic agreements to drive innovation in 5G. And finally, the third indicator that we watch is our order book. We're seeing orders and sales increase. And we're also seeing multiple governments starting to shape policy that asserts broadband is a basic right. They're developing action plans to take optical solutions to many more homes. The White House is calling for more than $120 billion to bring high-speed Internet to every American. Just looking at the two biggest efforts, the Rural Opportunity Development Fund and the President's infrastructure plan, we see a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Corning. Additionally, the UK launched its \u00a35 billion Project Gigabit. The plan is to bring next-generation broadband to more than 1 million hard-to-reach homes and businesses. And the European Commission is calling for \u20ac135 billion to support the rollout of rapid broadband services to all regions and households starting in 2021. In addition, we remain the unquestioned technology and market leader. We consistently create new products and extend our lead by delivering solutions that help our customers realize their network visions faster, better and cheaper. Simultaneously, we're driving productivity improvements to increase capacity and lower our cost. In total, we're feeling very good about optical. So I've talked about how we invest to create and make innovations that solve tough challenges, deliver for our customers and grow. Now I want to add on my final point. As we effectively build our strength as a company, we will continue to reward our shareholders. The strength of our businesses results in significant cash generation. Our first priority is to invest for growth. And we are committed to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic buybacks. In the first quarter, we announced a 9% increase to our dividend. And earlier this month, we seized a great opportunity to resume share buybacks. Through our recent transaction with Samsung display, we repurchased 4% of our outstanding shares. This is a great deal for our shareholders and it's great news for Corning that Samsung retained a 9% long-term ownership stake in the company. We see their investment as validation of Corning's innovation road map and the value of our capabilities. As we look ahead, this only adds to our confidence. Shifting to a broader view of our stakeholder base, we're committed to sharing resources and leadership on a range of important issues. We continue to support vital human services and emergency relief in our communities around the world. Our Office of Racial Equality and Social Unity has made significant strides. In North Carolina, we've established a five-year partnership with NCANT, the largest historically black university in the United States to provide scholarships through 2026. The funding focuses on enhancing STEM education, helping students become community classroom teachers and boosting the number of graduates in other fields critical to the nation's workforce. In New York, we're providing hands-on support on police reform. We're also energized around our sustainability efforts. The U.S. EPA has once again named Corning an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year. Recently, Verizon publicly recognized our sustainable practices. And I am pleased to announce that we'll publish our first sustainability report in the coming months. On all dimensions, Corning is operating exceptionally well, and our capabilities are vital to progress on multiple fronts. We're succeeding at building a stronger, more resilient company. I want to thank our incredibly dedicated employees around the world for their commitment to our company, to the communities we serve and to each other. And I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insight on the quarter.\nTony Tripeny: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to reiterate that Corning had another excellent quarter. We closed 2020 with strong momentum and built on that momentum by delivering sales, EPS and cash flow above our expectations. We are off to a great start, and we expect that strong demand and positive momentum to continue throughout the year. Now let me walk you through our first quarter performance. Sales were $3.3 billion, which translates to a year-over-year increase of 29%. We posted double-digit sales and net income growth year-over-year across all of our segments. Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials delivered particularly strong year-over-year growth, posting sales increases of 38% and 28%, respectively, and net income gains of 111% and 78%, respectively. Optical Communications posted its second quarter of year-over-year growth, and we expect to see that trend continue. And notably, display experienced the most favorable first quarter pricing environment we\u2019ve seen in more than a decade. During the quarter, multiple events disrupted global supply chains. Like many other companies, we experienced elevated freight and logistics costs across our businesses and we expedited shipments to meet our customers' expanding demand. This ultimately reduced profits by approximately $50 million. As a result, our margins were below normalized levels. This was most pronounced in our Environmental Technologies, Optical Communications and Display businesses. We will continue to do what it takes to deliver for our customers. But we'll also take steps to mitigate these costs, and we expect to see them begin to decline in the second quarter and normalize longer term. Operating margin was 17.1%. That's an improvement of 730 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We grew operating income of 125% year-over-year. EPS came in at $0.45, which is more than double year-over-year. Free cash flow of $372 million was up $691 million versus first quarter 2020, and it equates to 39% of our 2020 total. This adds to our confidence that we will generate significantly more free cash flow than 2020. So even with the disruptions from the Suez to storms, to continued COVID challenges, it was a very strong quarter. Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our businesses. In Display Technologies, first quarter sales were $863 million, up 3% sequentially and up 50% year-over-year. Net income was $213 million, up 40% year-over-year. Now net income declined slightly sequentially because of the timing and flows of incentives associated with expansions in China. Corning's volume grew by a low single-digit percentage sequentially and Q1 sequential prices remain consistent with Q4 levels. Now we continue to see strong in-market demand. Retail demand for large-sized TVs and IT products, including notebook PCs, are both on track for another year of double-digit growth. As a reminder, growth in large-sized TVs is the most important driver for us as we are well positioned to capture that growth with Gen 10.5, which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing. Panel makers are running at high utilizations, and glass demand is robust. And we continue to expect the glass market to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2021. Against this backdrop, issues at our competitors have created glass shortages in an already tight supply environment. Our primary operational focus is to supply our customers' demand. Corning experienced the most favorable first quarter glass pricing environment in more than a decade. And we have increased cost in logistics, energy, raw materials and other operational expenses. As a result, we are moderately increasing glass prices in the second quarter. We believe the pricing environment will remain favorable going forward. Three factors will continue to drive this. First, we expect glass supply to remain short to tight in the upcoming quarters. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Looking ahead, we expect that glass supply will continue to be short to tight, and we will continue to partner with our customers to maximize our glass supply. In Optical Communications, first quarter sales were $937 million, up 80% year-over-year. Sales were up in both enterprise and carrier networks driven by the accelerated pace of data center builds and increased capital spending on network capacity expansion and fiber-to-the-home projects. Net income was $111 million, up 283%. The improvement was driven by incremental volume and strong cost performance. There are some extremely encouraging announcements coming from leading network operators as well as governments around the world that point to the start of a strong investment phase across the industry. Clearly, there is a lot of excitement surrounding network deployment and optical fiber's role in delivering both basic and next-generation services to end customers. We are well positioned to capture a significant amount of that upside in the market. Corning is the industry leader and the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. This puts us squarely at the center of growth trajectories in fiber-to-the-home, 5G and hyperscale data centers. We've returned to growth in Optical Communications, and we remain confident that we will continue to grow. In Environmental Technologies, first quarter sales were $441 million, up 38% year-over-year. Net income was $74 million, up 111% year-over-year. Diesel sales grew 44% year-over-year driven by customers continuing to adopt more advanced after-treatment in China and by a stronger-than-expected North America heavy-duty truck market. Automotive sales were up 34% year-over-year as the global auto market improved and GPF adoption continued in Europe and China. And we are well on our way and ahead of our original time frame to build a $500 million gas particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect, and adoption in China continues as China's 6A implementation of the regulations began during the first quarter. In Specialty Materials, first quarter sales of $451 million were up 28% year-over-year due to strong demand for premium cover materials, strength in the IT market and demand for semiconductor-related optical glasses. Net income was $91 million, up 78% from 2020 as a result of higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs. Connectivity and computation continues to grow in importance, creating strength and resilience in the smartphone, IT and semiconductor markets. And we outperformed that strong market. Our premium glasses and surfaces supported new phones and IT launches, including more than 25 smartphones and 12 laptops and tablets featuring Gorilla Glass. And we are capturing high demand for our industry-leading advanced optics materials, which are essential for deep and extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography.\\ In 2020, EUV systems accounted for more than 30% of all semiconductor lithography equipment expenditures. Our customers believe these systems will grow significantly over the next five years. So we see growth for our semiconductor-related materials well beyond resolution of the current and well-publicized capacity tightness. Life Sciences first quarter sales were $300 million, up 16% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, driven by continued strong demand for diagnostics, growth in bioproduction and recovery in lab research markets. Net income was $48 million, up 26% year-over-year and 14% sequentially driven by the higher sales and solid operating performance. Now I'd like to turn to our commitment to financial stewardship and capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect to continue going forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders. Our first priority for our use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic M&A. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. In February, we announced a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend. In April, share \u2013 we resumed share buybacks by repurchasing 4% of our outstanding common shares from Samsung display. We are pleased that Samsung will remain a significant shareholder. Their ownership demonstrates confidence in the value of Corning's capabilities, our ongoing technology collaborations and our combined innovation leadership. The repurchases will be immediately accretive to EPS starting in Q2. We will remain opportunistic during the year surrounding additional share repurchases. In closing, we had an excellent quarter relative to both 2020 and in 2019. Demand is high across our businesses. Our more Corning strategy is working, and we are operating very well with all segments growing year-over-year. We are growing our top and bottom line and generating strong free cash flow. For the second quarter, we expect core sales of $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion and earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.53. And for the rest of the year, we expect that momentum to continue. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year goes on. With that, let\u2019s move to Q&A. Ann?\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, Tony. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good morning. And thanks for all the color on the call so far. Wendell, I was wondering if you can maybe put some perspective on the current optical cycle from two points. One is the differences maybe in the market served by region application versus prior cycles, where you're strong, where you maybe have opportunities? And secondly, your own innovation, what could drive better content for you, market outgrowth, et cetera. And then, Tony, just on the other sales line, can you maybe break that out a little bit and give us some color on what was in that this quarter? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks, Steven. In terms of this build cycle, I think the most interesting thing about it is how demanding it is? The nature of network builds is the big civil works projects, and they're big capital investments. And so they tend to be made with very long-term anticipation of growing demand. What's happened is during the pandemic, the networks sort of burn through their guardrail that they always tend to have. That was try to be about 18 months ahead of any demand. And so now you're feeling it. They're feeling the revenue opportunity even earlier as they build. So that provides a little more impetus. So that's like the first thing, I think, that's a little different than build cycles that you and I have seen in the past, Steven. There's much less on spec, more on, hey, the baseline demand has just moved up. There's more work from home. There's more need for bandwidth. There's more cloud. There's more \u2013 and it's here today. And so I think that's one thing. I think the second thing is our \u2013 the entry of fiber optics in a significant way into wireless. So historically in 4G systems or 3G, they've been relatively fiber-poor. They haven't been big consumers of fiber. But with 5G, those cells need to be so much closer to the consumer, to their customers. You need more densification, and that's driving a lot more glass into the wireless network. So it sort of put us in this position, Steven, where sort of like whichever network wins or whichever network, they tend to emphasize, it will be glass-rich. Now if that wasn't already more than you wanted to know, I think the third thing is that operators are building more converged networks. Especially the big folks used to run a wireless network separate from wireline, there would even be separation between what is aimed at consumers versus businesses. And now they're their very best returns were by putting in fixed glass networks and then being able to serve as many different offerings off the tip of that fiber. So in general, this has built a pretty good build case for the technology cycle continuing to move our way along with the build cycle. As you heard me say in the opening, one of the things we're doing when you sort of see that converged nature and you see more cloud is it's driving our innovation wheel to be able to find ways for people to install networks and have them be able to go in faster, less expensively and now greater using much less materials. And we have a whole suite of products that we're just starting to introduce that are going to help make this build cycle be a more effective investment for our customers.\nTony Tripeny: And then, Steve, in terms of the other segment, sales were about $270 million, a couple of hundred million dollars over last year. Vast majority of those sales were from Hemlock. Hemlock had a strong quarter, but we also saw a little bit of an increase in both our auto glass and in our Ballard business on a year-over-year basis.\nSteven Fox: Great. Appreciate all the color. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hey, thanks for taking my question. It was just on display. I wanted to understand the difference relative to when you talk about retail demand being strong, you talked about double-digit growth. But for the glass market, you're talking about mid-single-digit demand. And that overall grass market outlook sounds very similar to what you've talked about in previous years despite a much stronger market this year. So is that really just a capacity constraint that's limiting the glass market demand? And does that push some demand into next year? I just wanted to better understand that difference. Thank you.\nTony Tripeny: No, I think from an overall standpoint, you're right. I mean, we're expecting the demand this year to be similar to what's happened in past years. And that, of course, is really driven by what happens with large screen-sized TVs. And so what we're pointing out is how important, not only those are, but that's where we're seeing a lot of good demand. I think one of the other changes that have happened over the last couple of years is IT is also having stronger demand and what we've seen in the last couple of years. And given the work-from-home and study-from-home environment, we expect that to continue. So I mean, we expect our what really drives this market, as you know, Samik, is what happens from a screen size standpoint. We'd expect our screen size to be up in that 1.5 inch plus just like it has in the past, and that would drive that marketplace. The one thing I would note is the one market where demand isn't as strong from a TV standpoint is in China. And China hasn't been as strong in the last couple of years. And we would expect that to change over time. And when that changes, we do think that, that will be additional demand that isn't in the marketplace today. Whether that happens in the back half of this year or next year, we'll just have to wait to see.\nWendell Weeks: Yes. And Samik, what you're basically noting, and I think it's an astute observation is that, that demand above sort of our normal screen size growth is getting met by a reduction in the value chain downstream of us. So your question of does that basically put more demand out into next year, that's a good one. It all depends on how that supply chain ends overall. But I think it's a very good observation.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thanks for the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRod Hall: Yes, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask two, I suppose. One would be the inventory levels on TVs. I know that, Wendell, you talked just a second ago about the supply shortages and how that mix is with demand. I'm just curious, when you guys think the inventory levels out there will be back to something like a new normal, whatever that is? And then secondly, I wanted to ask on C-band auctions and the optical business, whether you've detected any delays in deployment of optical fiber around some of that C-band spectrum build out and 5G build out? Or do you think that the deployment of all that starts maybe this summer? Just kind of trying to figure out what the timing expectation for that optical demand, particularly in the U.S., is around C-band and 5G? Thanks.\nTony Tripeny: So I think in terms of the TV inventory levels, as Wendell said, we did see significant demand last year. And that definitely and continue to see good demand in the first quarter. And that clearly is impacting what's happening from an inventory level standpoint. And that is where we're seeing the continued reduction in those areas. And whether that sorts itself out by the end of the year or into next year really depends on what level of demand continues on a going-forward basis and not only on these large-sized TVs and IT, but also on IT products and then whatever eventually happens from a standpoint in China also.\nWendell Weeks: And on the C-band piece, I think just take your question divided in these two pieces. First, just look at the value that C-band auction, Rod, is one of the things I take away from that is the value of densification. Because the way you increase the returns on those relatively big amounts they spend on spectrum is you can spread it up. You can reuse the same basic spectrum as long as you increase the densification of your network and decrease the serving area of that particular spectrum. So I think it really provides powerful economic interest in sort of fiber-rich wireless networks over time. So I think that's good news. As far as the actual timing goes, because of the converged nature of the networks, I don't know off the top of my head, Rod. Let us check into it, and we'll get back to you if we have any deep insight, okay?\nRod Hall: Great. Okay, thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Are any of the baby businesses in the other segment graduating to the adult segments anytime soon, say, auto glass or Valor Glass? Or when do you think those businesses grow up?\nWendell Weeks: John, don\u2019t make me laugh on my earnings call, but yes, I think that's an excellent question. We're arguing about just that. And when do they move fully into our map structures, our market access platforms, we're not quite ready to have them graduate yet. But it's \u2013 but we're in the midst of that exact dialogue, sir.\nTony Tripeny: Yes. I mean, I think \u2013 as I said, we saw growth on a year-over-year basis in both of those businesses, and we feel good about that. And I think there's definite benefit of having them in the other segment in terms of the real focus that we get, but then we also leverage our market access platforms at the same time. So we will definitely continue to debate that internally.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Wendell, I was hoping you could talk more broadly about if the constraints in the semiconductor space are creating any particular challenges for Corning across its business lines? And if I could, Tony, could you talk about the gross margins in the quarter? I understood your comment around the $50 million headwind because of some of the increased logistical freight cost, synergy costs. But can you talk about why we're not seeing potentially better gross margins, given the pricing and volumes that you're seeing in display, in particular? And maybe underlying that, what is actually happening with like-for-like margins across the segments? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: First, cover that Tony.\nTony Tripeny: Sure. I mean, Wamsi, as you know, our stated goal is to expand our operating margins and improve our return on invested capital. And the good news is we're doing just that. And we believe these results are very good. And we think operating margin is the right place to judge our profitability. And the reason we focus on it, it's where we're utilizing our focus portfolio to capture synergies across our businesses. And you saw this expansion in operating margin. You saw it in Q3 and Q4 last year on a year-over-year basis, and you see it again in Q1. Our Q1 operating margin 17.1%, which was up considerably from last year, and our operating margin in terms of dollars was up 125%. So I mean, this is good performance and in line with where we were actually from a pre-pandemic standpoint. But as you noted, it was also included 150 basis points of cost from the $50 million of freight and logistics cost. And when you adjust for that, then it's extremely strong performance from a margin standpoint. And the good news is these costs will start to decline in Q2. They're going to normalize longer-term. And as that happens, you'd expect to see continued expansions from a margin standpoint. Now one question we get a lot is, well, what does Hemlock do to our margins? And this is a really good example of why we think if you're going to judge our profitability, operating margins is the right place to judge it. Is it actually a drag on our gross margin percentage? On average, it's about 50 basis points. But in Q1 because we had a little bit stronger business in Hemlock, it was actually greater than that. But it is slightly accretive on an operating margin standpoint. And that's why we think it's important to think about things from an operating standpoint. So from where we sit, we think it was really good performance in Q1. And you'd expect to see improved profitability as we turn to a more normalized environment.\nWamsi Mohan: Wendell, could you follow-up on the semi side?\nWendell Weeks: Sure. It's definitely impacting auto, display and our Mobile Consumer Electronics industries. But really, in all three of those, our backlog has been strong enough that we're not feeling it in our sales. So we're watching it really closely. But so far, we're not \u2013 we're just not feeling it in our revenue, although we know that it is definitely impacting the industry like auto is or in IT. They can't get it up, but we're still growing really strongly into that. So more to come, we'll look at it closely. And any insights that you pick up along the way, we would appreciate as well, sir.\nWamsi Mohan: Thanks, Wendell.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citi. Your line is open.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for the color, and thanks for all the incremental comments this far. I just have a couple of questions. One on CapEx. It came in a little bit shorter than what I was expecting. Should we expect this run rate to continue for the remainder of the year? Or was there any onetime this quarter? And then just the commentary so far on demand, backlog, order pipeline seems really strong. I know Corning did use to provide annual guidance or at least annual color across the various segments. Any reason why that's not the case this particular quarter? And should we expect that in the future quarters? Thanks you.\nTony Tripeny: Yes. I think from a CapEx standpoint, what we said back in January is we thought CapEx would be pretty similar to what occurred in 2020. And we still think that's likely to be the case. As you noted, our demand is very strong. And so as we get out further into the year, is it possible we'd spend a little bit more CapEx in order to meet that demand? That's certainly always a possibility. But I think from an overall standpoint, where we were back in January is still the right place. And if for some reason that were to change in a big way, of course, that always comes with committed customer demand. And so that's a good thing. And then in terms of our full year guidance, I mean, clearly, we're very happy about the momentum that we've experienced in Q4 and in Q1. And as with the guide we gave, we expect to continue from a Q2 standpoint. There's just still a lot of uncertainty in the world and a lot of general uncertainty. And so we're very just focused right now on delivering in the near term and keeping that momentum going.\nWendell Weeks: If I can just add to both, I think as you think about cash flow, CapEx and then our guide, fundamentally, our cash flow is really strong when we're not in a big build cycle. And that's what you're seeing right now as we are in to create and extend pieces of our value creation cycle. And you see it with our quarter one free cash flow conversion was 90%. And you should really expect this type of very powerful cash flow from us when we're not in a significant build cycle. It takes us about 18 months to get one of these big plants up, and then it takes us a while to fill it. We're now benefiting from the wisdom of our past build cycles. And so that's going to continue to be strong. On guidance, we've listened really closely to our investment communities. And what we've tried to do is \u2013 the feedback we've gotten is sort of what would be most valuable would be to move to the more macro sales and EPS level and to take it a quarter at a time for now. And then as we continue to progress under this method, if you or others have thoughts on how we could additionally improve our ability to communicate with investors, we'll be really open to it. So more conversation to come, and we look forward to your input.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nMartin Yang: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Wendell, can you maybe comment on where we are in the hyperscale data center investments? And maybe any additional color, comment on their action in the next 12 to 18 months will be appreciated. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Great. So short version is they're increasing their investments in hyperscale really across the board. Our various folks are more vague versus more direct, right? But what you see is really across the board in hyper, folks are commenting that they are going to continue to increase their investment in data centers as they're going forward here in this year. So we're actually in a build cycle for them as well. Good news is we have the capacity. We're ready to go. And we're seeing that demand as you saw in quarter one, and we're going to continue to see it. And I'm really excited about some of our potential innovations in that space that will, once again, create that more Corning, more of our content, why we reduce hyperscale's carbon footprint. We reduce its cost and increase their ability to get them up fast.\nMartin Yang: Great. Thanks.\nAnn Nicholson: Operator, we\u2019ll squeeze in one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long: Thank you. Thanks for getting me on to bell here. Two, if I could. Maybe, Tony, for you. Could you talk a little bit about operating expenses? I get the focus on op margin over gross margin. It looks like a pretty good number in Q1. How do we think about the cadence there, given you guys have done some refocusing on the OpEx side, but also we should start seeing some return to travel and things like that and incentive payments and whatnot? And then second, on the Life Sciences business, could you talk a little bit about \u2013 you've obviously had two really strong quarters there. Do you think there's been some pull-forward? Or do you think we're kind of at new higher levels for that business? Thank you.\nTony Tripeny: Yes Tim, from an operating expense standpoint, you're right. We remain very focused on that during the pandemic. We took a lot of actions, which saved us roughly a couple of hundred million dollars during the year. And we've said all along that those costs return as we return to normal, and I would expect to continue to see those increase somewhat as we go into the second and to the third quarter. Kind of the historic operating expense percentages that we've had, I think that's where you're going to end up from an overtime standpoint. Clearly, we remain very focused on it, but I just \u2013 I do think that you do see increases as business goes up. But the thing to keep in mind is that, of course, with the leverage that we're getting from a margin standpoint that we'd expect our operating margins to go up, just like they experienced as we did on a year-over-year basis in Q1 and also as we saw in Q3 and Q4. And then from a Life Sciences standpoint, I think that this is an ongoing business level. I mean, this is strength that we've seen across our businesses. Our orders are actually very strong. Our backlog is strong. And I mean, this is a level of business that we'd expect going forward, and we expect to see continued growth in that business actually.\nWendell Weeks: Yes. It's all \u2013 I think you're asking is because of the real crunch in the Life Sciences businesses, people are trying to react to everything that was needed for the pandemic. You do create some high variability in supply chains, and we'll experience some of that. But in general, because of where we're positioned with our products and our innovations, we're sort of going down the journey in Life Sciences. It looks a lot like our other market access platforms, where the areas that we've invested are going to grow faster than the underlying markets, and our innovations are going to lead to a more Corning story. And therefore, I believe we are in an elevated growth environment for Life Sciences going forward as our innovations just become more relevant to the secular trends in that industry.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Tim; thank you, Wendell. And thanks operator, thank you all for joining us this morning. Before we close, I wanted to let everyone know that we will attend the JPMorgan Virtual Tech and Internet Conference on May 26 and the Bernstein conference on June 2. Finally, a web replay of today's call will be available on our site starting later this morning. Once again, thanks for joining us. And operator, you can disconnect all lines.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported a strong start to what we expect to be an outstanding year. For the first quarter, we grew sales 29% year-over-year to $3.3 billion. We grew EPS by 125% to $0.44. Free cash flow of $372 million builds on the momentum we established in the second half of 2020. All five of our segments delivered double-digit sales and net income growth year-over-year, with sales growth rates ranging from 50% for display to 38% for environmental. But last year was an easy compare. So I think it's worth noting that total company sales are up 14% since the first quarter of 2019. No question, we're in a strong position. This morning, I want to take a closer look at how all our businesses are achieving key milestones and contributing to Corning's success. I'll frame my remarks around three points. First, invention is fundamental to our long-term strategy. Through our relentless commitment to R&D, we developed category-defining products to transform industries and enhance lives. Second, as we partner closely with our customers to move their industries forward, we unlock new ways to integrate more Corning content into their ecosystems. This is a powerful growth mechanism. And finally, we continue to build a stronger, more resilient company, one that is committed to rewarding shareholders while supporting our customers, our people and our communities. Now let me expand on my first point. We're living in a world that Corning anticipated exactly a decade ago in our video, A Day Made of Glass. It's a world where technology underpins every facet of human life; a world of communication and connection, where massive bandwidth facilitates real-time information and on-demand connections and people stay connected through a virtual environment that is literally at their fingertips. Let's think about what it means as displays and touchscreen devices make their way to the very center of daily life. The demands we're putting on today's screens and the expectations we have for tomorrow's imply a very specific set of properties. The requirements for precision glass and ceramics become more and more exacting. We need a material that is strong, yet thin and lightweight, flexible and conformable, durable, damage-resistant and impermeable, stable enough to withstand hostile weather, extreme temperatures and cleaning agents. It needs to be touch-friendly and look elegant. It must scale for very large applications and yet be useful in the palm of your hand or on your wrist. The material must also be operable with a world of technical capabilities that lie just below the surface, enabling complex electronic circuits and nano scale structure. And it must be mindful of the environment. When it comes to the critical components that enable high technology systems in multiple markets that we serve, the bar just keeps getting higher. This leads to a world where precision glass and ceramics win. And we have been winning. When we examine the growth in all our business today, we see key trends converging around our capabilities at a very exciting pace. In short, we're vital to progress. We succeed through sustained investments in R&D and years of material science and process engineering knowledge. Everything begins with our cohesive portfolio. Corning is one of the world's most proficient innovators in materials science. We combine our unparalleled expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with our proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms to develop category defining products that transform industries and enhance lives. Today, our inventions clean the air we all breathe, connect people to information and each other, provide the window through which we access information and entertainment. And they help facilitate the discovery and delivery of new medicines. And we're building in each of these areas. We're helping our customers move toward a world with nearly infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth; with large lifelike displays, where cars are cleaner, autonomous and connected; where medicines are individualized, effective and safe; and where you can do more right from your mobile device, protected by cover materials that can withstand even greater reviews. That leads me to my second point. As we work closely with our customers to advance these visions, we find ways to solve their toughest technology challenges. Our probability of success increases as we apply more of our world-class capabilities, and our cost of innovation declines as we reapply talent and repurpose our existing assets. As we apply our focused portfolio, we invent solutions that add even more value to our customers' offerings, and this provides a powerful growth mechanism. We aren't exclusively relying on people just buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. Now through that lens, let's look at our progress across our market access platforms. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we continue to help transform the way people interact with and use their devices. And we're capturing significant growth by increasing the value we offer on each of those devices. As we advance state-of-the-art for cover materials, we drive sustained outperformance across up and down markets. We've grown specialty sales every year from 2016 to today despite smartphone unit sales being roughly flat or down each year. Over that five-year period, we've added more than $750 million in sales on a base of more than $1 billion. Fast Company recently recognized our achievements in this space. Noting both Ceramic Shield and Gorilla Glass Victus, the magazine named Corning The Most Innovative Company in Consumer Electronics for 2021. We see a similar growth story playing out in automotive since 2017, the peak year for car sales. Our auto sales are up more than 40%, while global car sales are down 20%. We're helping customers navigate an industry that is expected to change more in the next 10 years than it has in the past 15. And as we do, we're working to capture and expand $100 per car content opportunity across emissions, auto glass solutions and other technical glass products, including our patented 3D ColdForm technology. We were thrilled to see the world premier event for the all-electric EQS for Mercedes. Its hyper screen features a Gorilla Glass cover almost five feet wide. We've also launched a new generation of GPS. They're helping vehicles including hybrids, achieve even lower levels of fine particulate emissions. And they're helping us exceed a $500 million GPF business ahead of our original time frame. In Life Sciences, we are delivering growth on two fronts. First, demand is growing based on COVID-19 vaccines and diagnostics. Second, we're becoming increasingly relevant as we help the industry move towards cell engine-based therapies, and that shift translates into more of our content per drug sold. Looking longer term, we're making significant strides toward building a Valor Glass franchise, addressing a multibillion-dollar content opportunity in pharmaceutical packaging markets. We doubled Valor vial production in quarter one versus quarter four. And to-date, the company has shipped enough Valor vials for hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Corning also expanded its agreement with the U.S. government to boost capacity for vials to $261 million, a $57 million increase from our initial June 2020 agreement. Turning to display. We're leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver stable returns. I'm pleased to note that in quarter one, we experienced the most favorable first quarter pricing environment in more than a decade. And we announced a moderate increase to our display glass substrate prices for the second quarter. Stepping back. We're the lowest-cost producer of display glass, which makes us significantly more profitable than our competitors. Our superior products, innovation capabilities and deep customer relationships enable us to maintain our leadership position. And our flexible fusion manufacturing platform allows us to match operating capacity with demand. Meanwhile, the emergence of Gen 10.5 has given us a unique opportunity. Demand for large-sized TVs continues to grow. 75-inch sets were up more than 60% last year. These TVs are most efficiently made on the largest fabs, and Corning is well positioned to drive more content into the market in 2021 with its Gen 10.5 plants in China. Finally, let's look at optical. I'm energized by the outlook for this business. We gauge the market by three indicators. First is network need, and we can all see that demand on the network is only increasing. Second is customer statements. Broadly, network operators are making encouraging announcements on capital investment for 5G and hyperscale data center deployments. And there's also good news on fiber-to-the-home. AT&T's CEO, John Stankey recently said that fiber underpins the connectivity we deliver, serving both wired and wireless. His company announced plans to increase its fiber-to-the-home footprint by an additional three million customer locations across more than 90 metro areas in 2021. Verizon CFO, Matt Ellis said the fiber serves as the critical backbone to our 5G deployment. Our commitments with our vendor partners, such as Samsung, Nokia, Ericsson and Corning, represent key strategic agreements to drive innovation in 5G. And finally, the third indicator that we watch is our order book. We're seeing orders and sales increase. And we're also seeing multiple governments starting to shape policy that asserts broadband is a basic right. They're developing action plans to take optical solutions to many more homes. The White House is calling for more than $120 billion to bring high-speed Internet to every American. Just looking at the two biggest efforts, the Rural Opportunity Development Fund and the President's infrastructure plan, we see a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Corning. Additionally, the UK launched its \u00a35 billion Project Gigabit. The plan is to bring next-generation broadband to more than 1 million hard-to-reach homes and businesses. And the European Commission is calling for \u20ac135 billion to support the rollout of rapid broadband services to all regions and households starting in 2021. In addition, we remain the unquestioned technology and market leader. We consistently create new products and extend our lead by delivering solutions that help our customers realize their network visions faster, better and cheaper. Simultaneously, we're driving productivity improvements to increase capacity and lower our cost. In total, we're feeling very good about optical. So I've talked about how we invest to create and make innovations that solve tough challenges, deliver for our customers and grow. Now I want to add on my final point. As we effectively build our strength as a company, we will continue to reward our shareholders. The strength of our businesses results in significant cash generation. Our first priority is to invest for growth. And we are committed to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic buybacks. In the first quarter, we announced a 9% increase to our dividend. And earlier this month, we seized a great opportunity to resume share buybacks. Through our recent transaction with Samsung display, we repurchased 4% of our outstanding shares. This is a great deal for our shareholders and it's great news for Corning that Samsung retained a 9% long-term ownership stake in the company. We see their investment as validation of Corning's innovation road map and the value of our capabilities. As we look ahead, this only adds to our confidence. Shifting to a broader view of our stakeholder base, we're committed to sharing resources and leadership on a range of important issues. We continue to support vital human services and emergency relief in our communities around the world. Our Office of Racial Equality and Social Unity has made significant strides. In North Carolina, we've established a five-year partnership with NCANT, the largest historically black university in the United States to provide scholarships through 2026. The funding focuses on enhancing STEM education, helping students become community classroom teachers and boosting the number of graduates in other fields critical to the nation's workforce. In New York, we're providing hands-on support on police reform. We're also energized around our sustainability efforts. The U.S. EPA has once again named Corning an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year. Recently, Verizon publicly recognized our sustainable practices. And I am pleased to announce that we'll publish our first sustainability report in the coming months. On all dimensions, Corning is operating exceptionally well, and our capabilities are vital to progress on multiple fronts. We're succeeding at building a stronger, more resilient company. I want to thank our incredibly dedicated employees around the world for their commitment to our company, to the communities we serve and to each other. And I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insight on the quarter. Thanks, Steven. In terms of this build cycle, I think the most interesting thing about it is how demanding it is? The nature of network builds is the big civil works projects, and they're big capital investments. And so they tend to be made with very long-term anticipation of growing demand. What's happened is during the pandemic, the networks sort of burn through their guardrail that they always tend to have. That was try to be about 18 months ahead of any demand. And so now you're feeling it. They're feeling the revenue opportunity even earlier as they build. So that provides a little more impetus. So that's like the first thing, I think, that's a little different than build cycles that you and I have seen in the past, Steven. There's much less on spec, more on, hey, the baseline demand has just moved up. There's more work from home. There's more need for bandwidth. There's more cloud. There's more \u2013 and it's here today. And so I think that's one thing. I think the second thing is our \u2013 the entry of fiber optics in a significant way into wireless. So historically in 4G systems or 3G, they've been relatively fiber-poor. They haven't been big consumers of fiber. But with 5G, those cells need to be so much closer to the consumer, to their customers. You need more densification, and that's driving a lot more glass into the wireless network. So it sort of put us in this position, Steven, where sort of like whichever network wins or whichever network, they tend to emphasize, it will be glass-rich. Now if that wasn't already more than you wanted to know, I think the third thing is that operators are building more converged networks. Especially the big folks used to run a wireless network separate from wireline, there would even be separation between what is aimed at consumers versus businesses. And now they're their very best returns were by putting in fixed glass networks and then being able to serve as many different offerings off the tip of that fiber. So in general, this has built a pretty good build case for the technology cycle continuing to move our way along with the build cycle. As you heard me say in the opening, one of the things we're doing when you sort of see that converged nature and you see more cloud is it's driving our innovation wheel to be able to find ways for people to install networks and have them be able to go in faster, less expensively and now greater using much less materials. And we have a whole suite of products that we're just starting to introduce that are going to help make this build cycle be a more effective investment for our customers. Yes. And Samik, what you're basically noting, and I think it's an astute observation is that, that demand above sort of our normal screen size growth is getting met by a reduction in the value chain downstream of us. So your question of does that basically put more demand out into next year, that's a good one. It all depends on how that supply chain ends overall. But I think it's a very good observation. And on the C-band piece, I think just take your question divided in these two pieces. First, just look at the value that C-band auction, Rod, is one of the things I take away from that is the value of densification. Because the way you increase the returns on those relatively big amounts they spend on spectrum is you can spread it up. You can reuse the same basic spectrum as long as you increase the densification of your network and decrease the serving area of that particular spectrum. So I think it really provides powerful economic interest in sort of fiber-rich wireless networks over time. So I think that's good news. As far as the actual timing goes, because of the converged nature of the networks, I don't know off the top of my head, Rod. Let us check into it, and we'll get back to you if we have any deep insight, okay? John, don't make me laugh on my earnings call, but yes, I think that's an excellent question. We're arguing about just that. And when do they move fully into our map structures, our market access platforms, we're not quite ready to have them graduate yet. But it's \u2013 but we're in the midst of that exact dialogue, sir. First, cover that Tony. Sure. It's definitely impacting auto, display and our Mobile Consumer Electronics industries. But really, in all three of those, our backlog has been strong enough that we're not feeling it in our sales. So we're watching it really closely. But so far, we're not \u2013 we're just not feeling it in our revenue, although we know that it is definitely impacting the industry like auto is or in IT. They can't get it up, but we're still growing really strongly into that. So more to come, we'll look at it closely. And any insights that you pick up along the way, we would appreciate as well, sir. If I can just add to both, I think as you think about cash flow, CapEx and then our guide, fundamentally, our cash flow is really strong when we're not in a big build cycle. And that's what you're seeing right now as we are in to create and extend pieces of our value creation cycle. And you see it with our quarter one free cash flow conversion was 90%. And you should really expect this type of very powerful cash flow from us when we're not in a significant build cycle. It takes us about 18 months to get one of these big plants up, and then it takes us a while to fill it. We're now benefiting from the wisdom of our past build cycles. And so that's going to continue to be strong. On guidance, we've listened really closely to our investment communities. And what we've tried to do is \u2013 the feedback we've gotten is sort of what would be most valuable would be to move to the more macro sales and EPS level and to take it a quarter at a time for now. And then as we continue to progress under this method, if you or others have thoughts on how we could additionally improve our ability to communicate with investors, we'll be really open to it. So more conversation to come, and we look forward to your input. Great. So short version is they're increasing their investments in hyperscale really across the board. Our various folks are more vague versus more direct, right? But what you see is really across the board in hyper, folks are commenting that they are going to continue to increase their investment in data centers as they're going forward here in this year. So we're actually in a build cycle for them as well. Good news is we have the capacity. We're ready to go. And we're seeing that demand as you saw in quarter one, and we're going to continue to see it. And I'm really excited about some of our potential innovations in that space that will, once again, create that more Corning, more of our content, why we reduce hyperscale's carbon footprint. We reduce its cost and increase their ability to get them up fast. Yes. It's all \u2013 I think you're asking is because of the real crunch in the Life Sciences businesses, people are trying to react to everything that was needed for the pandemic. You do create some high variability in supply chains, and we'll experience some of that. But in general, because of where we're positioned with our products and our innovations, we're sort of going down the journey in Life Sciences. It looks a lot like our other market access platforms, where the areas that we've invested are going to grow faster than the underlying markets, and our innovations are going to lead to a more Corning story. And therefore, I believe we are in an elevated growth environment for Life Sciences going forward as our innovations just become more relevant to the secular trends in that industry."

            "name": "Tony Tripeny",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to reiterate that Corning had another excellent quarter. We closed 2020 with strong momentum and built on that momentum by delivering sales, EPS and cash flow above our expectations. We are off to a great start, and we expect that strong demand and positive momentum to continue throughout the year. Now let me walk you through our first quarter performance. Sales were $3.3 billion, which translates to a year-over-year increase of 29%. We posted double-digit sales and net income growth year-over-year across all of our segments. Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials delivered particularly strong year-over-year growth, posting sales increases of 38% and 28%, respectively, and net income gains of 111% and 78%, respectively. Optical Communications posted its second quarter of year-over-year growth, and we expect to see that trend continue. And notably, display experienced the most favorable first quarter pricing environment we've seen in more than a decade. During the quarter, multiple events disrupted global supply chains. Like many other companies, we experienced elevated freight and logistics costs across our businesses and we expedited shipments to meet our customers' expanding demand. This ultimately reduced profits by approximately $50 million. As a result, our margins were below normalized levels. This was most pronounced in our Environmental Technologies, Optical Communications and Display businesses. We will continue to do what it takes to deliver for our customers. But we'll also take steps to mitigate these costs, and we expect to see them begin to decline in the second quarter and normalize longer term. Operating margin was 17.1%. That's an improvement of 730 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We grew operating income of 125% year-over-year. EPS came in at $0.45, which is more than double year-over-year. Free cash flow of $372 million was up $691 million versus first quarter 2020, and it equates to 39% of our 2020 total. This adds to our confidence that we will generate significantly more free cash flow than 2020. So even with the disruptions from the Suez to storms, to continued COVID challenges, it was a very strong quarter. Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our businesses. In Display Technologies, first quarter sales were $863 million, up 3% sequentially and up 50% year-over-year. Net income was $213 million, up 40% year-over-year. Now net income declined slightly sequentially because of the timing and flows of incentives associated with expansions in China. Corning's volume grew by a low single-digit percentage sequentially and Q1 sequential prices remain consistent with Q4 levels. Now we continue to see strong in-market demand. Retail demand for large-sized TVs and IT products, including notebook PCs, are both on track for another year of double-digit growth. As a reminder, growth in large-sized TVs is the most important driver for us as we are well positioned to capture that growth with Gen 10.5, which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing. Panel makers are running at high utilizations, and glass demand is robust. And we continue to expect the glass market to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2021. Against this backdrop, issues at our competitors have created glass shortages in an already tight supply environment. Our primary operational focus is to supply our customers' demand. Corning experienced the most favorable first quarter glass pricing environment in more than a decade. And we have increased cost in logistics, energy, raw materials and other operational expenses. As a result, we are moderately increasing glass prices in the second quarter. We believe the pricing environment will remain favorable going forward. Three factors will continue to drive this. First, we expect glass supply to remain short to tight in the upcoming quarters. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Looking ahead, we expect that glass supply will continue to be short to tight, and we will continue to partner with our customers to maximize our glass supply. In Optical Communications, first quarter sales were $937 million, up 80% year-over-year. Sales were up in both enterprise and carrier networks driven by the accelerated pace of data center builds and increased capital spending on network capacity expansion and fiber-to-the-home projects. Net income was $111 million, up 283%. The improvement was driven by incremental volume and strong cost performance. There are some extremely encouraging announcements coming from leading network operators as well as governments around the world that point to the start of a strong investment phase across the industry. Clearly, there is a lot of excitement surrounding network deployment and optical fiber's role in delivering both basic and next-generation services to end customers. We are well positioned to capture a significant amount of that upside in the market. Corning is the industry leader and the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. This puts us squarely at the center of growth trajectories in fiber-to-the-home, 5G and hyperscale data centers. We've returned to growth in Optical Communications, and we remain confident that we will continue to grow. In Environmental Technologies, first quarter sales were $441 million, up 38% year-over-year. Net income was $74 million, up 111% year-over-year. Diesel sales grew 44% year-over-year driven by customers continuing to adopt more advanced after-treatment in China and by a stronger-than-expected North America heavy-duty truck market. Automotive sales were up 34% year-over-year as the global auto market improved and GPF adoption continued in Europe and China. And we are well on our way and ahead of our original time frame to build a $500 million gas particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect, and adoption in China continues as China's 6A implementation of the regulations began during the first quarter. In Specialty Materials, first quarter sales of $451 million were up 28% year-over-year due to strong demand for premium cover materials, strength in the IT market and demand for semiconductor-related optical glasses. Net income was $91 million, up 78% from 2020 as a result of higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs. Connectivity and computation continues to grow in importance, creating strength and resilience in the smartphone, IT and semiconductor markets. And we outperformed that strong market. Our premium glasses and surfaces supported new phones and IT launches, including more than 25 smartphones and 12 laptops and tablets featuring Gorilla Glass. And we are capturing high demand for our industry-leading advanced optics materials, which are essential for deep and extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography.\\ In 2020, EUV systems accounted for more than 30% of all semiconductor lithography equipment expenditures. Our customers believe these systems will grow significantly over the next five years. So we see growth for our semiconductor-related materials well beyond resolution of the current and well-publicized capacity tightness. Life Sciences first quarter sales were $300 million, up 16% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, driven by continued strong demand for diagnostics, growth in bioproduction and recovery in lab research markets. Net income was $48 million, up 26% year-over-year and 14% sequentially driven by the higher sales and solid operating performance. Now I'd like to turn to our commitment to financial stewardship and capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect to continue going forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders. Our first priority for our use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic M&A. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. In February, we announced a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend. In April, share \u2013 we resumed share buybacks by repurchasing 4% of our outstanding common shares from Samsung display. We are pleased that Samsung will remain a significant shareholder. Their ownership demonstrates confidence in the value of Corning's capabilities, our ongoing technology collaborations and our combined innovation leadership. The repurchases will be immediately accretive to EPS starting in Q2. We will remain opportunistic during the year surrounding additional share repurchases. In closing, we had an excellent quarter relative to both 2020 and in 2019. Demand is high across our businesses. Our more Corning strategy is working, and we are operating very well with all segments growing year-over-year. We are growing our top and bottom line and generating strong free cash flow. For the second quarter, we expect core sales of $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion and earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.53. And for the rest of the year, we expect that momentum to continue. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year goes on. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann? And then, Steve, in terms of the other segment, sales were about $270 million, a couple of hundred million dollars over last year. Vast majority of those sales were from Hemlock. Hemlock had a strong quarter, but we also saw a little bit of an increase in both our auto glass and in our Ballard business on a year-over-year basis. No, I think from an overall standpoint, you're right. I mean, we're expecting the demand this year to be similar to what's happened in past years. And that, of course, is really driven by what happens with large screen-sized TVs. And so what we're pointing out is how important, not only those are, but that's where we're seeing a lot of good demand. I think one of the other changes that have happened over the last couple of years is IT is also having stronger demand and what we've seen in the last couple of years. And given the work-from-home and study-from-home environment, we expect that to continue. So I mean, we expect our what really drives this market, as you know, Samik, is what happens from a screen size standpoint. We'd expect our screen size to be up in that 1.5 inch plus just like it has in the past, and that would drive that marketplace. The one thing I would note is the one market where demand isn't as strong from a TV standpoint is in China. And China hasn't been as strong in the last couple of years. And we would expect that to change over time. And when that changes, we do think that, that will be additional demand that isn't in the marketplace today. Whether that happens in the back half of this year or next year, we'll just have to wait to see. So I think in terms of the TV inventory levels, as Wendell said, we did see significant demand last year. And that definitely and continue to see good demand in the first quarter. And that clearly is impacting what's happening from an inventory level standpoint. And that is where we're seeing the continued reduction in those areas. And whether that sorts itself out by the end of the year or into next year really depends on what level of demand continues on a going-forward basis and not only on these large-sized TVs and IT, but also on IT products and then whatever eventually happens from a standpoint in China also. Yes. I mean, I think \u2013 as I said, we saw growth on a year-over-year basis in both of those businesses, and we feel good about that. And I think there's definite benefit of having them in the other segment in terms of the real focus that we get, but then we also leverage our market access platforms at the same time. So we will definitely continue to debate that internally. Sure. I mean, Wamsi, as you know, our stated goal is to expand our operating margins and improve our return on invested capital. And the good news is we're doing just that. And we believe these results are very good. And we think operating margin is the right place to judge our profitability. And the reason we focus on it, it's where we're utilizing our focus portfolio to capture synergies across our businesses. And you saw this expansion in operating margin. You saw it in Q3 and Q4 last year on a year-over-year basis, and you see it again in Q1. Our Q1 operating margin 17.1%, which was up considerably from last year, and our operating margin in terms of dollars was up 125%. So I mean, this is good performance and in line with where we were actually from a pre-pandemic standpoint. But as you noted, it was also included 150 basis points of cost from the $50 million of freight and logistics cost. And when you adjust for that, then it's extremely strong performance from a margin standpoint. And the good news is these costs will start to decline in Q2. They're going to normalize longer-term. And as that happens, you'd expect to see continued expansions from a margin standpoint. Now one question we get a lot is, well, what does Hemlock do to our margins? And this is a really good example of why we think if you're going to judge our profitability, operating margins is the right place to judge it. Is it actually a drag on our gross margin percentage? On average, it's about 50 basis points. But in Q1 because we had a little bit stronger business in Hemlock, it was actually greater than that. But it is slightly accretive on an operating margin standpoint. And that's why we think it's important to think about things from an operating standpoint. So from where we sit, we think it was really good performance in Q1. And you'd expect to see improved profitability as we turn to a more normalized environment. Yes. I think from a CapEx standpoint, what we said back in January is we thought CapEx would be pretty similar to what occurred in 2020. And we still think that's likely to be the case. As you noted, our demand is very strong. And so as we get out further into the year, is it possible we'd spend a little bit more CapEx in order to meet that demand? That's certainly always a possibility. But I think from an overall standpoint, where we were back in January is still the right place. And if for some reason that were to change in a big way, of course, that always comes with committed customer demand. And so that's a good thing. And then in terms of our full year guidance, I mean, clearly, we're very happy about the momentum that we've experienced in Q4 and in Q1. And as with the guide we gave, we expect to continue from a Q2 standpoint. There's just still a lot of uncertainty in the world and a lot of general uncertainty. And so we're very just focused right now on delivering in the near term and keeping that momentum going. Yes Tim, from an operating expense standpoint, you're right. We remain very focused on that during the pandemic. We took a lot of actions, which saved us roughly a couple of hundred million dollars during the year. And we've said all along that those costs return as we return to normal, and I would expect to continue to see those increase somewhat as we go into the second and to the third quarter. Kind of the historic operating expense percentages that we've had, I think that's where you're going to end up from an overtime standpoint. Clearly, we remain very focused on it, but I just \u2013 I do think that you do see increases as business goes up. But the thing to keep in mind is that, of course, with the leverage that we're getting from a margin standpoint that we'd expect our operating margins to go up, just like they experienced as we did on a year-over-year basis in Q1 and also as we saw in Q3 and Q4. And then from a Life Sciences standpoint, I think that this is an ongoing business level. I mean, this is strength that we've seen across our businesses. Our orders are actually very strong. Our backlog is strong. And I mean, this is a level of business that we'd expect going forward, and we expect to see continued growth in that business actually."

It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAnn Nicholson : Thank you, Crystal, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.  I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.  You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments are related to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.  For the fourth quarter, the difference between GAAP and core EPS stemmed primarily from restructuring charges as well as noncash mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's currency hedging contracts and foreign debt. In total, these increased core earnings in the fourth quarter by $256 million. As a reminder, the mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.  A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast, and we encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks : Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results. Throughout the year, a series of pandemic-driven effects continued to ripple across the global economy. Nevertheless, we executed well to grow sales and advanced strategic initiatives, while addressing the implications that the current environment poses for margins and cash generation.  For the fourth quarter, sales of $3.6 billion and EPS of $0.47 were both at the high end of our guided range. And for the full year, building on our strong 2021, we grew sales by 5% to $14.8 billion and EPS by 1% to $2.09. Gross margin was 36%. Free cash flow was $1.24 billion. I'm pleased with the sales growth we continue to deliver, despite confronting what is essentially recession level demand in markets that constitute about half of our sales. Cars, televisions, smartphones, laptops and tablets are all well below what we estimate as the normal range.  Now we've offset this weak consumer demand with the strength of our positions in the growing optical communications and solar markets as well as ongoing outperformance by our businesses versus our end markets. That said, profitability and free cash flow are not where we need them to be.  So I'd like to deviate from our usual format for these calls, in which I focus on our progress across our market access platforms. Today, I want to give you some insight and perspective on the external dynamics driving our financial results, and I'll discuss what we're doing to address those dynamics.  Since 2020, the external environment has been characterized by the sweeping impact of the pandemic, including supply chain disruptions, depressed productivity, large swings in consumer spending and inflation. When the pandemic hit, our core priorities were protecting our people and delivering for our customers.  So throughout 2022, we operated with elevated staffing and higher-than-normal inventory levels. In addition, persistent and sometimes quite unpredictable, inflation added to the cost of raw materials we purchased, the cost to produce and ship our products and the inventory we maintained. As a result, our growth in profitability and cash flow have lagged our sales growth.  While we took action to improve profitability and cash generation throughout 2022 and made good progress during the first half of the year, it became clear that more was needed. So we took additional and significant actions in the fourth quarter, including raising prices, again, in optical communications and life sciences to more appropriately share the inflationary cost with our customers.  Adjusting our productivity ratios to get closer to historical metrics without impacting our ability to supply and capture future growth and normalizing inventory. Because our productivity and supply chains have improved, in the near term, we expect to maintain reliable supply for our customers at current inventory levels or below. Now all of these actions will improve our margins and cash flow throughout 2023.  Now as you may have already inferred from our press release this morning, we expect both first quarter sales and profitability to be anomalous from a historical perspective. Typically, our first quarter sales declined about 5% sequentially and margins declined about 1 to 2 points. This year, we expect first quarter sales to decline by more than normal seasonality. In contrast, we expect our margins to increase sequentially due to the benefits of our recent actions.  What's driving our below seasonal outlook for the first quarter sales is the situation unfolding in China, where consumer sentiment was already low. In December, China shifted its approach to the pandemic and a significant wave of COVID outbreaks ensued. This resulted in lower consumer spending and workforce shortages, which have, in turn, impact the demand for our products as well, particularly in Display, Environmental and Specialty Materials. We expect China to overcome these issues and demand to improve, but it's too early to call the specific timing of improvements in consumer sentiments and demand. We'll keep you posted as we learn more. In the interim, we continue to be well positioned to capture growth and drive innovation. And as our sales grow, we expect to benefit from operating leverage and our profitability to improve further. Given -- I think it's too early to call the rebound in China, it's difficult to be definitive on our full year results. Here's what I can say.  First, our quarter 1 sales are not an indication of our 2023 run rate. Second, I'd be disappointed if sales didn't grow sequentially in the second quarter, and we didn't see year-over-year growth in the second half. Finally, the benefits of our fourth quarter profit and cash flow actions will be significant throughout 2023. As we see consumer demand return and our revenues increase, we expect to see our profitability increase.  Now having shared our near-term perspective, I want to underscore how great we feel about our focused portfolio and long-term prospects. As we evaluate our trajectory, given the uncertainties, and there are a lot of them, one thing that is certain is the relevance of our leadership capabilities to secular trends. Across each of our markets, we are capturing a compelling set of long-term growth opportunities with more to come.  In Optical Communications, we're building on a record $5 billion 2022. And we believe we are still in the early phases of a multiyear build cycle driven by broadband, 5G densification and cloud computing. Cable and fiber demand remains especially robust. If we could make more, we could sell more.  In solar, we continue to capture significant upside tied to growth in the renewable energy industry, and we see excellent growth potential as we contribute to a sustainable U.S.-based solar supply chain and benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act. In display, we maintained stable price and a very strong market position throughout the ongoing industry correction. We expect to emerge from the correction with strengthened customer relationships of refreshed manufacturing fleet and increasing sales and profit.  In mobile consumer electronics, we anticipate ongoing strong adoption of our innovations, and we expect to continue outperforming the markets we serve through our product leadership, our more Corning approach and our ongoing collaboration with industry leaders.  Moving to automotive. We've been outperforming the market throughout a period of industry constraint. We remain focused on building our $100 per car content opportunity, and we're pleased by our progress as evidenced by our strong growth in Automotive Glass Solutions in 2022. And we'll be ready to capture even more growth as adoption of our technology continues and car sales return.  Finally, in Life Sciences, we're focused on delivering differentiated tools to support the discovery and delivery of cell-based medicines and modern drugs. Our operations are improving as the industry completes its correction from the unprecedented demand shifts caused by COVID.  So now I've gone through the macro uncertainty that characterizes the near term, and I've told you what we're doing to deal with those uncertainties. I also outlined the rich set of growth opportunities we're capturing over the long term. And I believe our progress so far is a testament to what we can achieve going forward.  Let's take a look back at the 2020 to 2023 strategy and growth framework that we introduced in 2019, shortly before the onset of the pandemic. Our goals included sales growth at a compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8%. From 2019 through 2022, we grew at greater than 8% CAGR, even in the face of the ongoing and universally experienced external challenges.  Over the past 4 years, we've advanced significant strategic initiatives. We delivered key fiber-to-the-home and data center solutions to meet surging demand and facilitate a period of strong growth in optical communications. We delivered on our gasoline particulate filter content opportunity in automotive, and we introduced ceramic shield with Apple, both of which have driven strong outperformance versus depressed end markets.  We ran our Gen 10.5 plants to extend our leadership in the glass for large televisions, and we made major progress on our emerging innovations. We gained significant traction in our Automotive Glass Solutions business, and our pharmaceutical packaging portfolio leaped forward to play a central role in the global health fight over the past 3 years. Our vials and tubing have supported the delivery now of more than 8 billion COVID-19 doses in more than 50 countries. In sum, we've delivered multiyear sales growth in a challenging environment. We've extended our leadership position across our markets, and we have paved the way for future growth. I think these are outstanding achievements.  Now as I wrap up my remarks, here's what I'd like to leave you with today. Since the start of the pandemic, we protected our people and, as evidenced in our sales growth, delivered for our customers. We've now completed significant additional actions to improve our profitability and cash generation. The unfolding situation in China certainly impacts our sales in the short term. But despite this, we expect to see the benefits of these recent pricing and productivity actions take hold in the first quarter.  Overall, we will continue to focus on operating each of our business as well and adjusting to meet the needs of the moment, while simultaneously advancing growth initiatives and capabilities that will drive success as the global economy stabilizes. Our focused and cohesive portfolio provides strategic resilience that is evident in our results even in the current environment. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver durable, multiyear growth with improved margins and cash generation.  Now I'll turn the call over to Ed so he can get into the details of our financial priorities, along with our results and outlook.\nEd Schlesinger: Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. Building on last year's strong performance, we grew full year sales 5% to $14.8 billion and EPS 1% to $2.09. We outperformed our consumer-facing end markets, we continue to capture growth in solar and we delivered record sales of $5 billion in optical communications. In total, we had a solid year, and our results reflect our resilience in the face of ongoing external challenges.  As you heard from Wendell, our profitability and cash flow have lagged our strong sales growth. To address this, we took further actions, including raising prices again in Optical Communications and Life Sciences to more appropriately share the inflationary costs with our customers, adjusting our productivity ratios closer to historical metrics without impacting our ability to supply and capture future growth and reducing inventory by $115 million in the fourth quarter. We will start to see the benefits of these actions in the first quarter despite suppressed sales from the disruption and low consumer sentiment in China that Wendell described.  With that, I will turn to our fourth quarter performance. Sales in the fourth quarter were $3.6 billion and EPS was $0.47, both coming in at the high end of our guidance. Fourth quarter gross margin was 34%, down 250 basis points sequentially. And operating margin was 14%, down 290 basis points sequentially, both including the impact of reducing inventory. EPS was favorably impacted by $0.03 due to a tax adjustment. Through the third quarter, our estimated tax rate was 20.5%. Our actual 2022 tax rate was 19.3%. The required adjustment resulted in an unusually low 15% core tax rate in the fourth quarter.  Now let's take a closer look at our segment results for the fourth quarter and full year, beginning with Optical Communications. Fourth quarter sales were $1.2 billion, down $122 million sequentially, reflecting the slower pacing of customer projects that we discussed on our last call. Net income was $130 million, down $53 million sequentially on lower volume and the impact of reducing inventory. The strength of the first 3 quarters of 2022 drove annual sales to an all-time high of $5 billion, reflecting a 15% increase, while net income grew 20% year-over-year to $661 million.  Moving to Display. On our last call, we said we believed panel maker utilization had reached bottom in September, but it was too early to call the timing or the shape of the recovery. We were then very encouraged to see panel maker utilization levels climbed in October and then again in November, indicating a recovery had begun. However, in December, China reopened and a significant wave of COVID outbreaks ensued, panel maker utilization leveled off in December and has since decreased in January. We believe that panel maker utilization will resume its recovery.  In January, panel makers are operating below the current reduced rate of demand. I'll cover more on our Display outlook in a moment. Display sales in the fourth quarter grew 14% sequentially to $783 million. Net income was $171 million, up 28% sequentially on strong execution and the additional volume. Fourth quarter glass price was consistent with the third quarter as expected. For the full year, sales were $3.3 billion and net income was $769 million, both down year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the industry correction in the second half. Glass price for the full year was consistent with 2021. We anticipate glass price in the first quarter of '23 to be consistent with the fourth quarter, and we expect the favorable glass pricing environment we experienced over the last few years to continue, driven by 2 factors: first, glass makers continue to align supply to demand. Corning and other glass makers have been taking additional tanks offline for maintenance and repairs after an extended period of glass tightness. As we've told you before, we are taking this opportunity to upgrade our fleet with the latest technology, and we are actively managing the timing of tank restarts to align our supply to demand.  Another factor is glassmakers profitability. It is challenging for glass makers who have high fixed costs to maintain profitability during this period of low volume and high inflation. We have maintained stable price and market position through this industry correction and as demonstrated in the fourth quarter when the market recovers, incrementals from our increased volume will be meaningful.  In Specialty Materials, fourth quarter sales of $505 million were down 3%, but we outperformed our markets driven by customer product launches and continued strong demand for premium glasses and advanced optics products. Full year sales were $2 billion, flat year-over-year. Gorilla Glass sales were down 5%, outperforming the smartphone market, which was down 11% and IT market, which was down 15%. Advanced Optics grew sales 12% driven by the strength of our next-generation semiconductor equipment materials.  Full year net income was $340 million, down 8% year-over-year due to continued investment in next-generation materials for consumer electronics and semiconductor equipment as well as new markets, such as bendable devices and augmented reality.  In Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $394 million, up 12% year-over-year. And net income was $69 million, up 28% year-over-year. Sequentially, fourth quarter sales were down 7%, impacted by a decline in China OEM production levels in December, driven by similar COVID dynamics I mentioned in Display.  Full year sales of $1.6 billion were flat versus 2021 as light and heavy-duty markets in China remain weak and global auto market growth was restricted. Net income for the full year increased 9% to $292 million as we improved our productivity and raised prices.  Turning to Life Sciences. Fourth quarter sales were $294 million, down sequentially and year-over-year, impacted by lower demand for COVID-related products. Fourth quarter net income was down, driven by lower sales and the impact of reducing inventory.  Full year sales of $1.2 billion were consistent with a strong 2021, while net income was $153 million, down 21% as the unexpected shift in demand away from COVID-related products led to a significantly lower productivity in our manufacturing operations.  And finally, in Hemlock and emerging growth businesses, sales in the fourth quarter were $462 million, up 22% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. And full year sales were $1.7 billion, up 34% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for polysilicon as we continue to see robust demand for both semiconductor and solar grade polysilicon. We also saw strong growth in Automotive Glass Solutions and Pharmaceutical Technologies.  To close out my segment recap, we're pleased that our more Corning approach and secular trends in optical and solar enabled us to grow sales and outperform our markets.  Turning to our outlook. We maintain an attractive long-term trajectory and are well positioned to capture growth. Looking at the near term, typically, in the first quarter, our sales declined about 5% sequentially and margins declined about 1 to 2 points. This quarter, we expect a sequential sales decline of 6% to 11%. In contrast, with the recent price and productivity actions we've taken, we expect about a 1- to 2-point margin improvement in the first quarter.  In total, for the quarter, we anticipate core sales in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion and EPS in the range of $0.35 to $0.42. Our first quarter sales outlook reflects the current dynamics in China since COVID restrictions were lifted in December. The situation has impacted consumer sentiment and labor availability, which is playing out across some of the industries we serve. For example, in Display, as I mentioned, we saw panel maker utilization decline in January back to October levels. With that, we now believe the display industry recovery has been delayed by at least a quarter. And in environmental, we expect the lower OEM production levels we saw in December to remain in the first quarter.  We will have a better feel for the situation in China after the Lunar New Year, and we'll share more with you as we go through the quarter. As a reminder, the first quarter is usually our lowest volume quarter of the year. So we expect sales to grow sequentially in the second quarter. And I'll also note that we expect 2023 full year capital expenditures to be consistent with 2022.  Before I close, I want to cover 2 other topics. First, I want to take a minute to address currency exchange rates. As a reminder, we have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect our cash flow, enhance our ability to invest and protect shareholder returns. Our largest exposure is the Japanese yen.  As we've previously shared with investors, we have most of 2023 hedged. We now also have most of 2024 hedged. We expect to keep our core rate at 1-0-7, at least through the end of 2024. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received more than $2 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception.  Second, as CFO, in addition to investing for organic growth, my top priorities include maintaining a strong and efficient balance sheet and returning excess cash to shareholders. Examples include creating one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is 25 years, with only $1 billion in debt coming due in the next 5 years and no significant debt coming due in any given year. And our interest rate exposure is very low because essentially all our debt instruments are fixed rate.  Additionally, over the last 4 years, we have consistently returned excess cash to shareholders even throughout the pandemic, and one of the ways we do that is through dividends. We have grown our dividend 35% since 2019, and we have increased our dividend for 12 consecutive years. Our dividend yield is top quartile in the S&P 500 at 3%. As we enter 2023, we will recommend that our Board approve an increase in the quarterly dividend, raising the annual rate from $1.08 to $1.12 per share.  Stepping back, our long-term growth drivers all remain intact. As markets recover, sales growth will resume and we're well positioned to continue capturing growth tied to key secular trends, such as optical and solar. In the face of ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we grew our sales 5% in 2022 and delivered a CAGR of greater than 8% since 2019. We have adapted to meet near-term needs, taking actions throughout this period. And while our profitability and cash flow have been impacted, we expect to see the benefits of additional actions we took in Q4, in our Q1 results and throughout the year.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A.\nAnn Nicholson : Thank you, Ed. Crystal, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: I have one for Ed, one for Wendell. Ed, you said your core rate will be 107 through 2024, but I would imagine your transactions are increasingly happening away from this core rate. How should we think about the impact of the yen as we think about 2023 and 2024 if the hedge rate is significantly away from the core rate? And for Wendell, can you talk about Corning's role in both bendable and augmented reality since Ed mentioned it in the script? I'm kind of curious on the technology that you're bringing. And b, any thoughts on commercial availability for these products, particularly by flagship customers?\nEd Schlesinger: Yes. Wamsi, this is Ed. I'll take your yen question first. So just for clarity, our hedges are actually close to our core rate in '23 and 2024. And we have most of our exposure hedged, and that's why we expect to keep our core rate at 107. With the recent strengthening in the yen in December and January, we were able to put more hedges in place for 2024.\nWamsi Mohan: It is -- sorry, Ed, if I could just follow up on that. Is the cost to hedge significantly different in '23 and '24?\nEd Schlesinger: No, not significantly different.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks for your question on bendable and augmented reality. For bendable, we have 2 significant opportunities, one of which is we're relatively matured in, which is we make the mother glass upon which the displays are manufactured to be able to do a bendable display. Actually to make one of those displays consumes more glass than sort of a typical LCD does. Second, where the bulk of our innovation investment -- new innovation investment has been is in the cover material for bendables. This effort has led to many of the bendable devices that you see today. It still is not a product that we believe is meeting the true needs of the customer. So we have a whole series of new innovations that we're doing to try to take that technology and make it be able to be mainstream rather than just a novelty. This effort is going to continue for the next number of years, and you can expect to see us introduce new products in that space. In augmented reality, 2 major efforts. One has, once again, be COVID-related, and I don't want to talk about that in too much detail. And then two, is we make the material and sometimes the wave guys that create that digital light field in front of your eyes. And so we have significant efforts in both these areas, augmented reality, embryonic industry, but quite exciting for the long term.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Martin Yang from Oppenheimer.\nMartin Yang: My first question is about the guidance. Can you talk about the sequential growth in EPS? I think implied from the guidance adjusting for the tax benefit, EPS decline more sequentially comparing to core revenue. Is there anything else we should be looking for, for OpEx knowing that the margin -- gross margin is likely to improve sequentially?\nEd Schlesinger: Martin, I'll take that one. No, I think actually, our margins, both gross and operating margin, should improve sequentially in the guidance we've given you. Obviously, we've given a range for both sales and earnings per share. And you're right, if you adjust for the tax rate, it's actually a reasonable level of incrementals on the lower sales. Remember, sales are going down 6% to 11% sequentially.\nWendell Weeks: So Martin, yes, I think you're doing your math correctly. You're seeing a pretty significant increase for us in our profitability at both the gross and operating margin lines and somewhat muted by the delta in tax rate from quarter 4 to quarter 1. I think you've got it.\nMartin Yang: Got it. And then a question on automotive glass, you highlighted as one of the growth areas. Can you maybe talk about, is it more in the infotainment side? Or are you seeing adoptions for windshield and or the external glasses?\nA \u2013Wendell Weeks: The bulk of our current revenues are in the interior set of products. The growth rate is highest in our exterior. What\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019ve seen all the trends on the interior with these very large curved displays being introduced in more and more products. And when that happens, that is by and large us with our patented ColdForm technology. But as well, especially with electric vehicles, because they are so quiet, you experience them as noisy, at least the outside world is more noisy. And so as a result of that and the amount of energy it takes to maintain the HVAC system within an electric vehicle, we\u2019re seeing the adoption of laminated technologies beyond the windshield in sidelights, [rooms], backlights. And quite often, that is leading to adoption of one of our new technologies, which we pair with Gorilla to create a unique laminate structure that is both performance, weight and cost advantage. And we\u2019re seeing very nice take-up of that as well.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: I actually had a question or a 2-part question on display. I know you outlined your thoughts around display and the lower panel maker utilization you're seeing in 1Q. Could you just give us a bit more color on sort of what are the range of sort of volume changes you're expecting sequentially into 1Q? What sort of typical seasonality there in terms of volume? How much of a difference or variance to the normal seasonality are you expecting in display in 1Q? And sir, the second part to that, I know you outlined China consumer spending as a sort of a watch point here, but any thoughts on TV sales or TV unit sales for the year, even if it's markets outside of China at this point?\nWendell Weeks: Samik, let me make sure I understand your first question. I understand your second one. So you're asking how we expect to see beyond quarter 1 in panel maker utilization within the quarter?\nSamik Chatterjee: Within the quarter, panel maker utilization and volumes related to normal seasonality in 1Q?\nWendell Weeks: Okay. So I think -- to answer the Q1 one, I'm actually going to start a little bit. I'm going to go back in time, talk a little bit about Q4. You will remember on our last quarterly conference call, what we talked about was that -- we called that panel maker utilization was at bottom in September, but it was too early to tell sort of timing and shape of the recovery. As we entered into quarter 4, we saw a significant increase in panel maker utilization in October and then another significant increase in panel maker utilization in November. And we -- our models were telling us that information, along with panel price increases and what we were seeing in order behavior in the industry, meant that the recovery was underway and that recovery would continue to arc upwards after adjusting for seasonality through Q1 and throughout this year. In December, when China changed its approach to the pandemic, we saw panel maker utilization rather than continue its next step up sort of level off. And then as we look at January, it looks to us like as they reduced it back really about to the levels we saw in October, that the recovery is sort of delayed a quarter is the way we would tend to think about it, adjusting for seasonality. And then that ties to your retail piece. So we would expect panel maker utilization to grow through the year because as Ed shared with you, this UT now -- the production rate is below the even relatively depressed level of set demand that we see in the end market. Which takes us to the next part of your question, which is we would expect to see the retail market recover as the year goes on. And it doesn't have to be much, even relatively flattish set demand year-over-year, given the state of panel maker utilization, will still result in pretty significant growth for us at the glass level.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Shannon Cross from Credit Suisse.\nShannon Cross: I wanted to talk about Hemlock, which was an outperformer this quarter. Wendell, can you talk a bit about the long-term opportunity that you see for polysilicon and sort of the trajectory, especially with the IRA? And then Ed, maybe could you talk about the margin potential for this segment? Because I would assume there's a fair amount of scale leverage that's there as you're able to utilize some of the excess manufacturing capacity that you have?\nWendell Weeks: So our goal, Shannon, we'd like to build about $1 billion solar business for us here at the company, and it could take a variety of different product forms. It's too early right now for us to make any specific announcements. But given the IRA, we see many opportunities to both grow and enhance the profitability of this business.\nEd Schlesinger: Again, Shannon, I would add 2 things. One, sort of Hemlock's overall gross margin is similar to our corporate average in the same zone sort of in normal circumstances, half the business or more is semiconductor and you've got solar, right? So you've got those both product sets in there. That's all within our Hemlock and emerging growth segment. And then the second thing I would add is that we have added solar capacity which was, as we described, very inexpensive capacity because it was previously mothballed. We were able to turn it back on. As we think about the next phases of growth, there may be some costs to do that and there may be just some impacts to gross margin as we go along that journey. But in the current state it's in, think of it as around the average for Corning.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors.\nSteven Fox: I was just wondering if you can maybe explain the productivity ratio improvements or the adjustments that you talked about in terms of what kind of costs were involved and what exactly you were doing there from both a near-term standpoint and what it implies for your ability to maybe control your own destiny on the cost side should end markets remain tough this year?\nEd Schlesinger: Yes. Thanks, Steve. Maybe the way to think about it is as we talk about what our priorities were through the pandemic, one of them was serving our customers. And we disproportionately erred on the side of being able to do that, right? In the beginning, when inflation was coming in, we made sure that we got our customers what they needed over time, we were able to raise price and offset that. And similarly, in the production space, we did whatever we needed to do to ensure that we have the products available to ship to our customers, in a very difficult supply chain environment in a very difficult pandemic environment where being able to staff your factories, have all the materials you need and be able to make the products you need was very difficult over this sort of long sweep of time starting in '21 and running through the end. So we've been able to improve the way we operate, improve our yields, improve our staffing levels and in some cases, take some adjustments and realign our capacity allow us to get back to what we would consider to be our benchmark or our historical productivity metrics. So making sure we have the right output at the right cost at every level in all of our factories. That's our objective. We're not completely there yet, but we've taken a lot more action in the fourth quarter, and we've made a significant amount of progress that will improve our cost and therefore, improve our gross margin.\nSteven Fox: And just longer-term implications for all that?\nEd Schlesinger: Well, I think longer term, it almost if you think about it, it gets us back to being able to operate like we did pre-pandemic, right? Pre all of the supply chain disruption, we are humble, at least I will be humble here that we have been surprised by a lot of things, including this recent change in the way China has operated during the pandemic, which clearly impacts us and our customers and our suppliers. But putting that aside, I feel like we now are able to run more like we did pre-pandemic levels, which then allows us to grow as our demand comes back and our margin should get back closer to our historical levels.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Josh Spector from UBS.\nJosh Spector: I was just curious in specialty. Is there a way to think about the pace of new content wins over this next year? So you shared you grew almost 10 percentage points greater than the market in '22. How would that metric look in '23 based on what you know now?\nWendell Weeks: We have a number of significant new content, new value-added products that will begin to be introduced for upcoming model launches. So we would expect to have sort of a more Corning dynamic happen again. Now the actual degree of overperformance will really depend upon the success and pace of adoption of those new innovations. So I'd like to see both how our product does add sort of our customers' unique products using this technology does before I would characterize a specific numeric level of outperformance.\nJosh Spector: Okay. And if I could just follow up on the cost side of things. So you talked about your productivity. Is there anything we should be considering energy or otherwise flowing through differently for you guys given your hedging strategies over the past couple of years?\nEd Schlesinger: Yes, Josh, I think with respect to inflation, as we've shared sort of throughout the year, we continue to be surprised primarily to the negative on all the things that we consider sort of input costs to run our business. Things have normalized a little bit as we come to the back half, and I think our price increases are allowing us to get to close to sort of neutrality as we go into 2023. Energy is certainly a cost that remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels, as do many other costs, by the way. I mean I think even though the rate of inflation has slowed and, in some cases, retracted, we're not back to pre-pandemic levels of costs for inputs. So I think it's -- energy is certainly one to watch, but nothing specific that I'd call out as we go into 2023.\nWendell Weeks: I think, Josh, that we're -- we've been able to -- with the actions we took in the fourth quarter, which is pretty significant. We've been able to catch up to the inflation that we have experienced, like looking in the rearview mirror. And that's one of the reasons that we're able to have the step up in our profitability in quarter 1 or sequentially from quarter 4. I think where we still have work to do is really in the area of what you're asking about, which is how accurately we see what's coming at us from an inflation standpoint and sort of getting ahead of the game. We're still working through that. Got a great team on supply chain who's trying to help us do it, but I think we need to improve there some more, Josh.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tim Long from Barclays.\nTim Long: Yes, I'd like to ask kind of a 2-parter on the optical coms business. First, kind of on the revenue side. It felt like last quarter or through the quarter, it was mostly like one large carrier that was part of the weakness. Now it seems like it's a little more distributed. It looked like enterprise was kind of weak in the quarter, and a lot of folks are worried about cloud spending into next year. So can you just talk a little bit about kind of the maybe enterprise telco mix there or how you see the dynamics differently in those 2 markets? And then secondly, obviously, profitability was weak in the quarter. Could you talk about that? Is that just component cost or is there something else going on? There's a pretty big dip in profitability there.\nWendell Weeks: So I think that perhaps it was any other industry players who would have just said this was one player. But I've always said it is -- in the carrier space, we had a number of carriers who were pacing their projects and also relative to what they've been doing to manage their supply chains one way or the other. Yes, clouds had a ton of activity as well. But by and large, we still think this is a carrier story. And we're -- we expect to work through that as we go through quarter 1 and then get the benefit of elevated demand levels as we go through the rest of the year.\nEd Schlesinger: Yes. And I'll take the cost one or the margin one, profitability one. I think Opto is a good example of sort of all of the things we've talked about, inflation impacting the segment significantly, productivity levels impacting the segment significantly. Those things are depressing margins in optical. And the fourth quarter volumes also came down, and we also took inventory down in the fourth quarter in optical. And all of those things impacted our margins. So it's sort of a good example of all the things we've talked about. However, on the positive side, the actions we've talked about significantly impact optical as well. So as we go into 2023, that's a place where we would expect to see profitability improvement.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank.\nMatt Niknam: Just 2 if I could. One, maybe bigger picture. As we think about maybe a slower start to the year, EPS, I think, is implied to be about $0.38 at the midpoint in 1Q. Is there any framework to use when thinking about the trajectory for EPS in 2Q onwards? And really what I'm getting at is any visibility you have towards when you get back to maybe a $2 a share sort of annualized EPS run rate? And then maybe just a follow-on to the last question. On Optical, have you seen any inflections or resumption of activity in 1Q? And then maybe when you would anticipate a more meaningful bounce back this year?\nWendell Weeks: So to the first question, what we've tried to do with our profitability actions is that to have that sort of run rate in EPS that you're talking about, that's a $2 run rate to be when we hit revenues that are like quarter 4, sort of 3,6, 3, 7 level. That's when with our actions on productivity and pricing that if they are effective, which we believe they are. Then, at that revenue level, that's when you should expect that type of EPS level. That's the way we're thinking about it, and that's the way we're modeling it. Did that answer your question, sir?\nMatt Niknam: That does. That does. And then just on Optical, have you seen any sort of resumption or bounce back yet in 1Q?\nWendell Weeks: Quarter 1 is like no time to call optical, right? So let me get another month or 2 into it, and we should be able to tell you how this all looks. We're very close with our customers. We're watching what they're doing. We're talking to them a lot on their project timing. And we just finished executing perhaps the most significant price increase -- not perhaps, the most significant price increase in my 30-plus years of being associated with optical communications, and we did it successfully, which gives you an idea of the extent of planned demand in this business.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Asiya Merchant from Citi.\nAsiya Merchant: But just on free cash flow, Ed. Just -- I know a lot of questions have been asked on revenue, sales and how you guys think about margin improvement. Can you shed some light on cash flow and your adjusted free cash flow post the levels in '22?\nEd Schlesinger: Yes, sure, Asiya. I mean I think on capital, I shared our view that we expect to hold CapEx similar in 2023 as we did to 2022, and that was sort of similar to the prior year as well. And I think what you saw in 2022 that really impacted our operating cash flow the most was the inventory build. We built about $500 million of inventory in the year. So obviously, that negatively impacts our operating cash flow. Our goal is to make inventory go the other way. We made a small step in the fourth quarter here. And even not building inventory, just holding inventory flat helps our cash flow going forward. So our goal is to make our operating cash flow go up, keep our CapEx flattish, and so that should make free cash flow go up. But we've got work to do to be able to do that, and it's primarily in the inventory space.\nAsiya Merchant: Okay. And are you expecting like a lot of resumption in share buyback here? I know you talked about dividends -- an increase in dividends. How should we think about the pre -- how should we think about share repurchase in '23?\nEd Schlesinger: Yes, I'm not going to guide that specifically. But what I would say is our priorities are investing for organic growth, and we will continue to do that. We believe there's a lot of opportunity out there. That's sort of the highest priority for our operating cash flow, and then we want to return cash to shareholders. We shared what we plan to do on the dividend. And then, of course, buybacks are important to us. As a reminder, we did a very large buyback in 2020 -- I'm sorry, 2021 with Samsung's conversion of their preferred shares. We bought back about 4% of our outstanding shares, and that sort of is still -- we're still paying for that. We've got one more tranche to pay for that in April of 2023. And then we'll have that behind us. That should give us more flexibility. And buybacks, of course, will remain important.\nAnn Nicholson : Operator, I think we're out of time. So I'm just going to shut us down for today. And I want to thank everybody for joining us. Before we close, I want to let you know that we're going to attend the Susquehanna Financial Group 12th Annual Tech Conference on March 2. And on March 7, we'll be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology Media and Telecom Conference. Additionally, we'll be hosting some management visits to investor offices in select cities. And finally, a web play of today's call will be available on our site starting later this morning. So once again, thanks for joining us. Operator, that concludes our call. You can disconnect all lines.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Schlesinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. Building on last year's strong performance, we grew full year sales 5% to $14.8 billion and EPS 1% to $2.09. We outperformed our consumer-facing end markets, we continue to capture growth in solar and we delivered record sales of $5 billion in optical communications. In total, we had a solid year, and our results reflect our resilience in the face of ongoing external challenges.  As you heard from Wendell, our profitability and cash flow have lagged our strong sales growth. To address this, we took further actions, including raising prices again in Optical Communications and Life Sciences to more appropriately share the inflationary costs with our customers, adjusting our productivity ratios closer to historical metrics without impacting our ability to supply and capture future growth and reducing inventory by $115 million in the fourth quarter. We will start to see the benefits of these actions in the first quarter despite suppressed sales from the disruption and low consumer sentiment in China that Wendell described.  With that, I will turn to our fourth quarter performance. Sales in the fourth quarter were $3.6 billion and EPS was $0.47, both coming in at the high end of our guidance. Fourth quarter gross margin was 34%, down 250 basis points sequentially. And operating margin was 14%, down 290 basis points sequentially, both including the impact of reducing inventory. EPS was favorably impacted by $0.03 due to a tax adjustment. Through the third quarter, our estimated tax rate was 20.5%. Our actual 2022 tax rate was 19.3%. The required adjustment resulted in an unusually low 15% core tax rate in the fourth quarter.  Now let's take a closer look at our segment results for the fourth quarter and full year, beginning with Optical Communications. Fourth quarter sales were $1.2 billion, down $122 million sequentially, reflecting the slower pacing of customer projects that we discussed on our last call. Net income was $130 million, down $53 million sequentially on lower volume and the impact of reducing inventory. The strength of the first 3 quarters of 2022 drove annual sales to an all-time high of $5 billion, reflecting a 15% increase, while net income grew 20% year-over-year to $661 million.  Moving to Display. On our last call, we said we believed panel maker utilization had reached bottom in September, but it was too early to call the timing or the shape of the recovery. We were then very encouraged to see panel maker utilization levels climbed in October and then again in November, indicating a recovery had begun. However, in December, China reopened and a significant wave of COVID outbreaks ensued, panel maker utilization leveled off in December and has since decreased in January. We believe that panel maker utilization will resume its recovery.  In January, panel makers are operating below the current reduced rate of demand. I'll cover more on our Display outlook in a moment. Display sales in the fourth quarter grew 14% sequentially to $783 million. Net income was $171 million, up 28% sequentially on strong execution and the additional volume. Fourth quarter glass price was consistent with the third quarter as expected. For the full year, sales were $3.3 billion and net income was $769 million, both down year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the industry correction in the second half. Glass price for the full year was consistent with 2021. We anticipate glass price in the first quarter of '23 to be consistent with the fourth quarter, and we expect the favorable glass pricing environment we experienced over the last few years to continue, driven by 2 factors: first, glass makers continue to align supply to demand. Corning and other glass makers have been taking additional tanks offline for maintenance and repairs after an extended period of glass tightness. As we've told you before, we are taking this opportunity to upgrade our fleet with the latest technology, and we are actively managing the timing of tank restarts to align our supply to demand.  Another factor is glassmakers profitability. It is challenging for glass makers who have high fixed costs to maintain profitability during this period of low volume and high inflation. We have maintained stable price and market position through this industry correction and as demonstrated in the fourth quarter when the market recovers, incrementals from our increased volume will be meaningful.  In Specialty Materials, fourth quarter sales of $505 million were down 3%, but we outperformed our markets driven by customer product launches and continued strong demand for premium glasses and advanced optics products. Full year sales were $2 billion, flat year-over-year. Gorilla Glass sales were down 5%, outperforming the smartphone market, which was down 11% and IT market, which was down 15%. Advanced Optics grew sales 12% driven by the strength of our next-generation semiconductor equipment materials.  Full year net income was $340 million, down 8% year-over-year due to continued investment in next-generation materials for consumer electronics and semiconductor equipment as well as new markets, such as bendable devices and augmented reality.  In Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $394 million, up 12% year-over-year. And net income was $69 million, up 28% year-over-year. Sequentially, fourth quarter sales were down 7%, impacted by a decline in China OEM production levels in December, driven by similar COVID dynamics I mentioned in Display.  Full year sales of $1.6 billion were flat versus 2021 as light and heavy-duty markets in China remain weak and global auto market growth was restricted. Net income for the full year increased 9% to $292 million as we improved our productivity and raised prices.  Turning to Life Sciences. Fourth quarter sales were $294 million, down sequentially and year-over-year, impacted by lower demand for COVID-related products. Fourth quarter net income was down, driven by lower sales and the impact of reducing inventory.  Full year sales of $1.2 billion were consistent with a strong 2021, while net income was $153 million, down 21% as the unexpected shift in demand away from COVID-related products led to a significantly lower productivity in our manufacturing operations.  And finally, in Hemlock and emerging growth businesses, sales in the fourth quarter were $462 million, up 22% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. And full year sales were $1.7 billion, up 34% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for polysilicon as we continue to see robust demand for both semiconductor and solar grade polysilicon. We also saw strong growth in Automotive Glass Solutions and Pharmaceutical Technologies.  To close out my segment recap, we're pleased that our more Corning approach and secular trends in optical and solar enabled us to grow sales and outperform our markets.  Turning to our outlook. We maintain an attractive long-term trajectory and are well positioned to capture growth. Looking at the near term, typically, in the first quarter, our sales declined about 5% sequentially and margins declined about 1 to 2 points. This quarter, we expect a sequential sales decline of 6% to 11%. In contrast, with the recent price and productivity actions we've taken, we expect about a 1- to 2-point margin improvement in the first quarter.  In total, for the quarter, we anticipate core sales in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion and EPS in the range of $0.35 to $0.42. Our first quarter sales outlook reflects the current dynamics in China since COVID restrictions were lifted in December. The situation has impacted consumer sentiment and labor availability, which is playing out across some of the industries we serve. For example, in Display, as I mentioned, we saw panel maker utilization decline in January back to October levels. With that, we now believe the display industry recovery has been delayed by at least a quarter. And in environmental, we expect the lower OEM production levels we saw in December to remain in the first quarter.  We will have a better feel for the situation in China after the Lunar New Year, and we'll share more with you as we go through the quarter. As a reminder, the first quarter is usually our lowest volume quarter of the year. So we expect sales to grow sequentially in the second quarter. And I'll also note that we expect 2023 full year capital expenditures to be consistent with 2022.  Before I close, I want to cover 2 other topics. First, I want to take a minute to address currency exchange rates. As a reminder, we have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect our cash flow, enhance our ability to invest and protect shareholder returns. Our largest exposure is the Japanese yen.  As we've previously shared with investors, we have most of 2023 hedged. We now also have most of 2024 hedged. We expect to keep our core rate at 1-0-7, at least through the end of 2024. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received more than $2 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception.  Second, as CFO, in addition to investing for organic growth, my top priorities include maintaining a strong and efficient balance sheet and returning excess cash to shareholders. Examples include creating one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is 25 years, with only $1 billion in debt coming due in the next 5 years and no significant debt coming due in any given year. And our interest rate exposure is very low because essentially all our debt instruments are fixed rate.  Additionally, over the last 4 years, we have consistently returned excess cash to shareholders even throughout the pandemic, and one of the ways we do that is through dividends. We have grown our dividend 35% since 2019, and we have increased our dividend for 12 consecutive years. Our dividend yield is top quartile in the S&P 500 at 3%. As we enter 2023, we will recommend that our Board approve an increase in the quarterly dividend, raising the annual rate from $1.08 to $1.12 per share.  Stepping back, our long-term growth drivers all remain intact. As markets recover, sales growth will resume and we're well positioned to continue capturing growth tied to key secular trends, such as optical and solar. In the face of ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we grew our sales 5% in 2022 and delivered a CAGR of greater than 8% since 2019. We have adapted to meet near-term needs, taking actions throughout this period. And while our profitability and cash flow have been impacted, we expect to see the benefits of additional actions we took in Q4, in our Q1 results and throughout the year.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A. Yes. Wamsi, this is Ed. I'll take your yen question first. So just for clarity, our hedges are actually close to our core rate in '23 and 2024. And we have most of our exposure hedged, and that's why we expect to keep our core rate at 107. With the recent strengthening in the yen in December and January, we were able to put more hedges in place for 2024. No, not significantly different. Martin, I'll take that one. No, I think actually, our margins, both gross and operating margin, should improve sequentially in the guidance we've given you. Obviously, we've given a range for both sales and earnings per share. And you're right, if you adjust for the tax rate, it's actually a reasonable level of incrementals on the lower sales. Remember, sales are going down 6% to 11% sequentially. Again, Shannon, I would add 2 things. One, sort of Hemlock's overall gross margin is similar to our corporate average in the same zone sort of in normal circumstances, half the business or more is semiconductor and you've got solar, right? So you've got those both product sets in there. That's all within our Hemlock and emerging growth segment. And then the second thing I would add is that we have added solar capacity which was, as we described, very inexpensive capacity because it was previously mothballed. We were able to turn it back on. As we think about the next phases of growth, there may be some costs to do that and there may be just some impacts to gross margin as we go along that journey. But in the current state it's in, think of it as around the average for Corning. Yes. Thanks, Steve. Maybe the way to think about it is as we talk about what our priorities were through the pandemic, one of them was serving our customers. And we disproportionately erred on the side of being able to do that, right? In the beginning, when inflation was coming in, we made sure that we got our customers what they needed over time, we were able to raise price and offset that. And similarly, in the production space, we did whatever we needed to do to ensure that we have the products available to ship to our customers, in a very difficult supply chain environment in a very difficult pandemic environment where being able to staff your factories, have all the materials you need and be able to make the products you need was very difficult over this sort of long sweep of time starting in '21 and running through the end. So we've been able to improve the way we operate, improve our yields, improve our staffing levels and in some cases, take some adjustments and realign our capacity allow us to get back to what we would consider to be our benchmark or our historical productivity metrics. So making sure we have the right output at the right cost at every level in all of our factories. That's our objective. We're not completely there yet, but we've taken a lot more action in the fourth quarter, and we've made a significant amount of progress that will improve our cost and therefore, improve our gross margin. Well, I think longer term, it almost if you think about it, it gets us back to being able to operate like we did pre-pandemic, right? Pre all of the supply chain disruption, we are humble, at least I will be humble here that we have been surprised by a lot of things, including this recent change in the way China has operated during the pandemic, which clearly impacts us and our customers and our suppliers. But putting that aside, I feel like we now are able to run more like we did pre-pandemic levels, which then allows us to grow as our demand comes back and our margin should get back closer to our historical levels. Yes, Josh, I think with respect to inflation, as we've shared sort of throughout the year, we continue to be surprised primarily to the negative on all the things that we consider sort of input costs to run our business. Things have normalized a little bit as we come to the back half, and I think our price increases are allowing us to get to close to sort of neutrality as we go into 2023.

So I think it's -- energy is certainly one to watch, but nothing specific that I'd call out as we go into 2023. Yes. And I'll take the cost one or the margin one, profitability one. I think Opto is a good example of sort of all of the things we've talked about, inflation impacting the segment significantly, productivity levels impacting the segment significantly. Those things are depressing margins in optical. And the fourth quarter volumes also came down, and we also took inventory down in the fourth quarter in optical. And all of those things impacted our margins. So it's sort of a good example of all the things we've talked about. However, on the positive side, the actions we've talked about significantly impact optical as well. So as we go into 2023, that's a place where we would expect to see profitability improvement. Yes, sure, Asiya. I mean I think on capital, I shared our view that we expect to hold CapEx similar in 2023 as we did to 2022, and that was sort of similar to the prior year as well. And I think what you saw in 2022 that really impacted our operating cash flow the most was the inventory build. We built about $500 million of inventory in the year.

And even not building inventory, just holding inventory flat helps our cash flow going forward. So our goal is to make our operating cash flow go up, keep our CapEx flattish, and so that should make free cash flow go up. But we've got work to do to be able to do that, and it's primarily in the inventory space. Yes, I'm not going to guide that specifically. But what I would say is our priorities are investing for organic growth, and we will continue to do that. We believe there's a lot of opportunity out there. That's sort of the highest priority for our operating cash flow, and then we want to return cash to shareholders. We shared what we plan to do on the dividend. And then, of course, buybacks are important to us. As a reminder, we did a very large buyback in 2020 -- I'm sorry, 2021 with Samsung's conversion of their preferred shares. We bought back about 4% of our outstanding shares, and that sort of is still -- we're still paying for that. We've got one more tranche to pay for that in April of 2023. And then we'll have that behind us. That should give us more flexibility. And buybacks, of course, will remain important."

            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results. Throughout the year, a series of pandemic-driven effects continued to ripple across the global economy. Nevertheless, we executed well to grow sales and advanced strategic initiatives, while addressing the implications that the current environment poses for margins and cash generation.  For the fourth quarter, sales of $3.6 billion and EPS of $0.47 were both at the high end of our guided range. And for the full year, building on our strong 2021, we grew sales by 5% to $14.8 billion and EPS by 1% to $2.09. Gross margin was 36%. Free cash flow was $1.24 billion. I'm pleased with the sales growth we continue to deliver, despite confronting what is essentially recession level demand in markets that constitute about half of our sales. Cars, televisions, smartphones, laptops and tablets are all well below what we estimate as the normal range.  Now we've offset this weak consumer demand with the strength of our positions in the growing optical communications and solar markets as well as ongoing outperformance by our businesses versus our end markets. That said, profitability and free cash flow are not where we need them to be.  So I'd like to deviate from our usual format for these calls, in which I focus on our progress across our market access platforms. Today, I want to give you some insight and perspective on the external dynamics driving our financial results, and I'll discuss what we're doing to address those dynamics.  Since 2020, the external environment has been characterized by the sweeping impact of the pandemic, including supply chain disruptions, depressed productivity, large swings in consumer spending and inflation. When the pandemic hit, our core priorities were protecting our people and delivering for our customers.  So throughout 2022, we operated with elevated staffing and higher-than-normal inventory levels. In addition, persistent and sometimes quite unpredictable, inflation added to the cost of raw materials we purchased, the cost to produce and ship our products and the inventory we maintained. As a result, our growth in profitability and cash flow have lagged our sales growth.  While we took action to improve profitability and cash generation throughout 2022 and made good progress during the first half of the year, it became clear that more was needed. So we took additional and significant actions in the fourth quarter, including raising prices, again, in optical communications and life sciences to more appropriately share the inflationary cost with our customers.  Adjusting our productivity ratios to get closer to historical metrics without impacting our ability to supply and capture future growth and normalizing inventory. Because our productivity and supply chains have improved, in the near term, we expect to maintain reliable supply for our customers at current inventory levels or below. Now all of these actions will improve our margins and cash flow throughout 2023.  Now as you may have already inferred from our press release this morning, we expect both first quarter sales and profitability to be anomalous from a historical perspective. Typically, our first quarter sales declined about 5% sequentially and margins declined about 1 to 2 points. This year, we expect first quarter sales to decline by more than normal seasonality. In contrast, we expect our margins to increase sequentially due to the benefits of our recent actions.  What's driving our below seasonal outlook for the first quarter sales is the situation unfolding in China, where consumer sentiment was already low. In December, China shifted its approach to the pandemic and a significant wave of COVID outbreaks ensued. This resulted in lower consumer spending and workforce shortages, which have, in turn, impact the demand for our products as well, particularly in Display, Environmental and Specialty Materials. We expect China to overcome these issues and demand to improve, but it's too early to call the specific timing of improvements in consumer sentiments and demand. We'll keep you posted as we learn more. In the interim, we continue to be well positioned to capture growth and drive innovation. And as our sales grow, we expect to benefit from operating leverage and our profitability to improve further. Given -- I think it's too early to call the rebound in China, it's difficult to be definitive on our full year results. Here's what I can say.  First, our quarter 1 sales are not an indication of our 2023 run rate. Second, I'd be disappointed if sales didn't grow sequentially in the second quarter, and we didn't see year-over-year growth in the second half. Finally, the benefits of our fourth quarter profit and cash flow actions will be significant throughout 2023. As we see consumer demand return and our revenues increase, we expect to see our profitability increase.  Now having shared our near-term perspective, I want to underscore how great we feel about our focused portfolio and long-term prospects. As we evaluate our trajectory, given the uncertainties, and there are a lot of them, one thing that is certain is the relevance of our leadership capabilities to secular trends. Across each of our markets, we are capturing a compelling set of long-term growth opportunities with more to come.  In Optical Communications, we're building on a record $5 billion 2022. And we believe we are still in the early phases of a multiyear build cycle driven by broadband, 5G densification and cloud computing. Cable and fiber demand remains especially robust. If we could make more, we could sell more.  In solar, we continue to capture significant upside tied to growth in the renewable energy industry, and we see excellent growth potential as we contribute to a sustainable U.S.-based solar supply chain and benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act. In display, we maintained stable price and a very strong market position throughout the ongoing industry correction. We expect to emerge from the correction with strengthened customer relationships of refreshed manufacturing fleet and increasing sales and profit.  In mobile consumer electronics, we anticipate ongoing strong adoption of our innovations, and we expect to continue outperforming the markets we serve through our product leadership, our more Corning approach and our ongoing collaboration with industry leaders.  Moving to automotive. We've been outperforming the market throughout a period of industry constraint. We remain focused on building our $100 per car content opportunity, and we're pleased by our progress as evidenced by our strong growth in Automotive Glass Solutions in 2022. And we'll be ready to capture even more growth as adoption of our technology continues and car sales return.  Finally, in Life Sciences, we're focused on delivering differentiated tools to support the discovery and delivery of cell-based medicines and modern drugs. Our operations are improving as the industry completes its correction from the unprecedented demand shifts caused by COVID.  So now I've gone through the macro uncertainty that characterizes the near term, and I've told you what we're doing to deal with those uncertainties. I also outlined the rich set of growth opportunities we're capturing over the long term. And I believe our progress so far is a testament to what we can achieve going forward.  Let's take a look back at the 2020 to 2023 strategy and growth framework that we introduced in 2019, shortly before the onset of the pandemic. Our goals included sales growth at a compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8%. From 2019 through 2022, we grew at greater than 8% CAGR, even in the face of the ongoing and universally experienced external challenges.  Over the past 4 years, we've advanced significant strategic initiatives. We delivered key fiber-to-the-home and data center solutions to meet surging demand and facilitate a period of strong growth in optical communications. We delivered on our gasoline particulate filter content opportunity in automotive, and we introduced ceramic shield with Apple, both of which have driven strong outperformance versus depressed end markets.  We ran our Gen 10.5 plants to extend our leadership in the glass for large televisions, and we made major progress on our emerging innovations. We gained significant traction in our Automotive Glass Solutions business, and our pharmaceutical packaging portfolio leaped forward to play a central role in the global health fight over the past 3 years. Our vials and tubing have supported the delivery now of more than 8 billion COVID-19 doses in more than 50 countries. In sum, we've delivered multiyear sales growth in a challenging environment. We've extended our leadership position across our markets, and we have paved the way for future growth. I think these are outstanding achievements.  Now as I wrap up my remarks, here's what I'd like to leave you with today. Since the start of the pandemic, we protected our people and, as evidenced in our sales growth, delivered for our customers. We've now completed significant additional actions to improve our profitability and cash generation. The unfolding situation in China certainly impacts our sales in the short term. But despite this, we expect to see the benefits of these recent pricing and productivity actions take hold in the first quarter.  Overall, we will continue to focus on operating each of our business as well and adjusting to meet the needs of the moment, while simultaneously advancing growth initiatives and capabilities that will drive success as the global economy stabilizes. Our focused and cohesive portfolio provides strategic resilience that is evident in our results even in the current environment. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver durable, multiyear growth with improved margins and cash generation.  Now I'll turn the call over to Ed so he can get into the details of our financial priorities, along with our results and outlook. Thanks for your question on bendable and augmented reality. For bendable, we have 2 significant opportunities, one of which is we're relatively matured in, which is we make the mother glass upon which the displays are manufactured to be able to do a bendable display. Actually to make one of those displays consumes more glass than sort of a typical LCD does. Second, where the bulk of our innovation investment -- new innovation investment has been is in the cover material for bendables. This effort has led to many of the bendable devices that you see today. It still is not a product that we believe is meeting the true needs of the customer. So we have a whole series of new innovations that we're doing to try to take that technology and make it be able to be mainstream rather than just a novelty. This effort is going to continue for the next number of years, and you can expect to see us introduce new products in that space. In augmented reality, 2 major efforts. One has, once again, be COVID-related, and I don't want to talk about that in too much detail. And then two, is we make the material and sometimes the wave guys that create that digital light field in front of your eyes. And so we have significant efforts in both these areas, augmented reality, embryonic industry, but quite exciting for the long term. So Martin, yes, I think you're doing your math correctly. You're seeing a pretty significant increase for us in our profitability at both the gross and operating margin lines and somewhat muted by the delta in tax rate from quarter 4 to quarter 1. I think you've got it. Samik, let me make sure I understand your first question. I understand your second one. So you're asking how we expect to see beyond quarter 1 in panel maker utilization within the quarter? Okay. So I think -- to answer the Q1 one, I'm actually going to start a little bit. I'm going to go back in time, talk a little bit about Q4. You will remember on our last quarterly conference call, what we talked about was that -- we called that panel maker utilization was at bottom in September, but it was too early to tell sort of timing and shape of the recovery. As we entered into quarter 4, we saw a significant increase in panel maker utilization in October and then another significant increase in panel maker utilization in November. And we -- our models were telling us that information, along with panel price increases and what we were seeing in order behavior in the industry, meant that the recovery was underway and that recovery would continue to arc upwards after adjusting for seasonality through Q1 and throughout this year. In December, when China changed its approach to the pandemic, we saw panel maker utilization rather than continue its next step up sort of level off. And then as we look at January, it looks to us like as they reduced it back really about to the levels we saw in October, that the recovery is sort of delayed a quarter is the way we would tend to think about it, adjusting for seasonality. And then that ties to your retail piece. So we would expect panel maker utilization to grow through the year because as Ed shared with you, this UT now -- the production rate is below the even relatively depressed level of set demand that we see in the end market. Which takes us to the next part of your question, which is we would expect to see the retail market recover as the year goes on. And it doesn't have to be much, even relatively flattish set demand year-over-year, given the state of panel maker utilization, will still result in pretty significant growth for us at the glass level. So our goal, Shannon, we'd like to build about $1 billion solar business for us here at the company, and it could take a variety of different product forms. It's too early right now for us to make any specific announcements. But given the IRA, we see many opportunities to both grow and enhance the profitability of this business. We have a number of significant new content, new value-added products that will begin to be introduced for upcoming model launches. So we would expect to have sort of a more Corning dynamic happen again. Now the actual degree of overperformance will really depend upon the success and pace of adoption of those new innovations. So I'd like to see both how our product does add sort of our customers' unique products using this technology does before I would characterize a specific numeric level of outperformance. I think, Josh, that we're -- we've been able to -- with the actions we took in the fourth quarter, which is pretty significant. We've been able to catch up to the inflation that we have experienced, like looking in the rearview mirror. And that's one of the reasons that we're able to have the step up in our profitability in quarter 1 or sequentially from quarter 4. I think where we still have work to do is really in the area of what you're asking about, which is how accurately we see what's coming at us from an inflation standpoint and sort of getting ahead of the game. We're still working through that. Got a great team on supply chain who's trying to help us do it, but I think we need to improve there some more, Josh. So I think that perhaps it was any other industry players who would have just said this was one player. But I've always said it is -- in the carrier space, we had a number of carriers who were pacing their projects and also relative to what they've been doing to manage their supply chains one way or the other. Yes, clouds had a ton of activity as well. But by and large, we still think this is a carrier story. And we're -- we expect to work through that as we go through quarter 1 and then get the benefit of elevated demand levels as we go through the rest of the year. So to the first question, what we've tried to do with our profitability actions is that to have that sort of run rate in EPS that you're talking about, that's a $2 run rate to be when we hit revenues that are like quarter 4, sort of 3,6, 3, 7 level. That's when with our actions on productivity and pricing that if they are effective, which we believe they are. Then, at that revenue level, that's when you should expect that type of EPS level. That's the way we're thinking about it, and that's the way we're modeling it. Did that answer your question, sir? Quarter 1 is like no time to call optical, right? So let me get another month or 2 into it, and we should be able to tell you how this all looks. We're very close with our customers. We're watching what they're doing. We're talking to them a lot on their project timing. And we just finished executing perhaps the most significant price increase -- not perhaps, the most significant price increase in my 30-plus years of being associated with optical communications, and we did it successfully, which gives you an idea of the extent of planned demand in this business."

It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Corning's Q3 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.  I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments related to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.  For the third quarter, the primary difference between GAAP and core EPS was from primarily noncash charges associated with capacity optimization and noncash mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's currency hedging contracts.  This increased core earnings in the third quarter by $234 million. To be clear, these charges and mark-to-market accounting have no impact on our cash flow. Reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access Corning results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live. They're also available on our website for downloading.  And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported solid third quarter results that demonstrate strong execution. We continue to operate each of our business as well and our focus on leadership and distinctive capabilities allow us to capitalize on important secular trends and drive our More Corning approach. Sales were $3.7 billion, up slightly versus a strong third quarter last year, and EPS was $0.51. We were able to offset a sales decline in display technologies with growth in optical communications and solar. While we believe that display panel maker production bottomed in September, we would like to see additional positive evidence before guiding a significant recovery in glass demand.  In total, we performed well despite the economic environment. Before we get into the details, I wanted to set some context on what we're facing across our markets. On our last call, we told you that end markets in multiple businesses were down. A smartphone sales in the second quarter declined 8% year-over-year, panel maker utilization in June 2022 was at its lowest level since 2009. And yearly, automotive production was 10 million to 15 million vehicles below its pre-COVID rate.  Several of these dynamics continued or even intensified in the third quarter. A smartphone unit sales declined 14% year-over-year in the quarter, with tablet and notebook demand down 17%. Panel maker utilization decreased even further from its June level with September being the lowest month of the quarter and annual automotive production is still 10 million to 15 million cars short due to continued component shortages.  Nevertheless, we delivered results within our guidance range and expectations. We continue to benefit from infrastructure investments in broadband and clean energy, two secular trends we're strategically positioned to address. We delivered 16% year-over-year growth in Optical Communications, and we captured ongoing demand in the solar market, which contributed to 33% year-over-year growth in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses.  So let's take a deeper look. What we're seeing in some of our key markets, how we're responding. And why we're confident that our strategy continues to position us to deliver profitable multiyear growth. I'll start with display. In the third quarter, the glass market and our volume both decreased almost 25% sequentially and which significantly reduced our sales and profitability. In September, panel maker utilization reached the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2008.  More than a year ago, we said we expected a correction in the display industry during 2022. In the second quarter, panel makers began reducing production levels with accelerated reductions in June. In the third quarter, panel maker production reached an even lower level. And we believe that panel maker production reached the bottom in September.  So now the question is, when will the glass market recover? Now our answer is that we would like to see additional positive evidence before we guide a robust recovery in glass demand. We've maintained stable price and market position during this whole correction. Consequently, we expect our volume and profitability to increase sharply when panel maker utilization rebounds and we expect to exit the correction with strengthened customer relationships and importantly, a refreshed manufacturing fleet. As always, we will keep you informed as we progress.  Overall, we feel very good about our execution in display. In mobile consumer electronics, customer product launches and strength in semiconductor drove sequential growth in Specialty Materials. As I noted, smartphone and IT retail unit sales declined significantly in the quarter. We now expect smartphones to be down about 12% for the year. And we expect notebook and tablet demand to decline 15%. We expect the year-over-year decline in smartphones, notebooks and tablets to be greater in the second half than in the first half. This will limit the growth we normally see in our second half sales relative to the first half.  Now that said, we continue to outperform the market through our product leadership, our more Corning approach and our ongoing collaboration with industry leaders.  Over the long term, our content strategy in mobile consumer electronics will help us grow. As we continue to develop and launch premium glasses and optical treatments,for existing and new form factors.  Additionally, we're executing our more Corning approach in the semiconductor industry. In July, Senator, Chuck Schumer and New York Governor, Kathy Hochul, joined us to announce government funding that supports an expansion of our advanced optics facilities, which made equipment and materials vital to semiconductor manufacturing. Of course, semiconductors are fundamental to virtually all technology we interact with today. We've helped advance the industry for more than 50 years, and our expansion will keep us well positioned to support nearly every step of the chip manufacturing process and to respond to new customer needs, including products for EUV technology.  Let's turn to automotive. In Environmental Technologies, we delivered sales and profit growth despite the constraints on vehicle production, and we're outperforming the market for the year. We continue to adjust our operations to effectively navigate the variability in auto production and we are prepared to meet demand when industry production increases to normal rates.  We're also generating significant wins in our Automotive Glass Solutions business. Pull is strong for our technical glass and optics innovations.  During the quarter, CarUX, a leading car display company owned by Innolux, announced its use of our patented cold-form technology to help drive the future of auto interior displays. Corning continues to be well positioned to further grow its automotive business as the industry offers more advanced, designed-oriented cabins and enhanced driver assistance features.  Let's move to Optical Communications, which was the largest contributor to third quarter sales. The industry continues to experience a large multiyear wave of growth for passive optical networks, and we continue to increase our capacity to support this growth.  In August, U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, joined AT&T CEO, John Stankey, and me to announce a new manufacturing facility in Arizona. You may recall Secretary Raimondo's leadership helped pass infrastructure legislation dedicated to the idea of Internet for all. Our new plant will boost optical cable capacity to meet record demand.  In September, we opened a new optical fiber manufacturing plant in Poland to serve committed demand. And we're innovating to support every phase of broadband deployment as network access is increasingly viewed as a fundamental human right.  In the quarter, we announced additions to our Evolv connectivity portfolio which helps operators streamline permitting, accelerate field installation and optimize network testing. Optical sales have grown 22% and for the first 3 quarters of the year, setting us up for another strong year of growth. However, we expect fourth quarter sales to be down sequentially due to the timing of customer projects.  Turning to solar. The renewable energy industry is evolving rapidly, and our ongoing growth continues to indicate that the market's behavior is more closely tied to a global imperative than the current economic trends. We reenergized our participation in the solar market by starting up idle capacity and securing customer commitments through new long-term take-or-pay contracts for solar grade polysilicon. Third quarter sales grew significantly year-over-year, and we will benefit from the state of Michigan's infrastructure investment program, which will help us expand operations to meet increasing global demand for polysilicon. We believe that Corning's broader technical and manufacturing capabilities, our 3 and 4, will prove to be highly relevant and helping advance the renewable energy industry, and we see excellent growth potential in solar.  Now as I conclude my remarks, here's what I'd like to leave you with today. We remain very well positioned to deliver profitable multiyear growth and we'll continue to execute with discipline. We'll invest where we see strength and will pace to meet demand. Our cohesive and focused portfolio provides strategic resilience that is playing out well in this current environment. We've established a deep relevance to secular trends along with the ability to drive more content into our markets over time. We've been leading in the automotive and life science markets for 100 years, display for 80 years, telecommunication for 50 and mobile consumer electronics since the inception of smart devices.  The basis of our ongoing success is our distinctive set of capabilities and long track record of life-changing and even life-saving inventions.  In the past, what enables us to power through moments like the present while maintaining an attractive long-term growth trajectory.  Now let me turn the call over to Ed, who will share more details on our results, financial priorities and outlook.\nEdward Schlesinger: Thanks, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by emphasizing that we're executing well in a challenging environment. Our performance in the third quarter was a proof point of the inherent balance of our cohesive portfolio and the fact that our More Corning approach is working. We're built to be resilient even in a downturn.  Now let's look at our financial results for the third quarter. Sales were $3.7 billion, up 1% from a strong third quarter in 2021. Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses all delivered year-over-year growth.  In September, Display Technologies experienced the lowest panel maker utilization levels since 2008, resulting in a 28% year-over-year decline in sales for the segment in the third quarter. In Specialty Materials, we outperformed the smartphone market, which was down double digits year-over-year.  Turning to profitability. Gross margin was 36.1% and operating margin was 16.9%, down sequentially 140 and 190 basis points, respectively, driven by the lower volume in display technologies.  In the third quarter, free cash flow was $255 million, and year-to-date, it was $866 million, keeping us on pace for another year of healthy cash generation. And despite the challenging environment during the quarter, we were able to offset significantly lower volume in display technologies, and we outperformed our underlying markets overall.  Now let's turn to the segment results. In Optical Communications, sales grew 16% year-over-year, reaching $1.3 billion. Our year-over-year growth was driven by network operator investments in 5G, broadband and the cloud. Net income was $183 million, up 32% and year-over-year, driven by leverage from strong incremental volume. Passive Optical Networks continue to experience a large multiyear wave of growth. We believe that this demand is strongly supported by private and public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the population. We continue to secure customer commitments, and we're investing to appropriately scale production to serve our incremental demand from current and new customers. And we're also taking further pricing actions to more appropriately shared recent cost increases in energy and certain raw materials with our customers.  As we've mentioned in the past, this business can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, and you'll see that play out in the fourth quarter as we expect optical sales to be down sequentially based on the timing of customer projects.  Now moving to Display. As we updated you in September, panel makers reduced their production levels below our already low expectations. The lower volume resulted in display sales declining 28% year-over-year and 22% sequentially, and we saw a 46% year-over-year and 41% sequential decline in net income due to the high fixed cost nature of glass manufacturing. In the third quarter, glass price was once again consistent sequentially. And we believe the glass pricing environment will remain favorable and factors that continue to drive that favorable pricing include glass supply-demand balance as panel makers reduce production, Corning and other glass makers took additional tanks offline for maintenance and repairs after an extended period of glass tightness.  And we're also taking this opportunity to upgrade some of our fleet with our latest technology which enables us to reduce cost and extend the life of new tanks. As we continue to work through these upgrades, we are actively managing restarts to align our supply to demand.  Another factor is glass maker profitability. It is challenging for glass makers who have high fixed costs to maintain profitability during periods of low volume and the current inflationary environment amplifies that challenge. We expect fourth quarter glass prices to be consistent with the third quarter and glass prices to be stable or up in subsequent quarters.  So overall, we continue to operate from a position of strength in the display market. And as Wendell noted, while we believe that panel maker utilization reached the bottom in September, we would like to see more evidence before we got a significant recovery in glass demand. But when glass demand grows, we expect our volume to increase and our profitability to improve.  In Specialty Materials, the market for smartphones was down 14% and tablets and notebooks were down 17%. We outperformed the market with sales down only 7% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for premium glasses, and strength in semiconductor materials. Third quarter sales were up 7% sequentially, driven by demand for our premium cover materials to support customer product launches.  And adding to our resilience in the segment, Advanced Optics delivered record sales for the second quarter in a row, and we are bringing additional capacity online at our facilities in Fairport and Canton, New York. Net income for the segment was $96 million, down 10% year-over-year due to lower volume and continued development expense related to next-generation products. The weakness in the smartphone tablet and notebook markets intensified in the quarter, and we expect fourth quarter sales and profitability to be down sequentially and year-over-year. Long term, we expect to outperform the market as we continue to develop and launch new premium glasses and optical treatments.  Turning to Environmental Technologies. In the third quarter, sales were $425 million, up 10% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. The Automotive production improved from a very low second quarter as China demand recovered after second quarter COVID lockdowns. However, vehicle production remains constrained due to the continued component shortages.  In addition to our sales growth, we improved profitability with net income up 45% year-over-year. Our content-driven strategy is working, gasoline particulate filters remain a critical component of that strategy, driving revenue even in a weakened market. Our next-generation filters are now shipping to customers as emission standards reach near 0 levels and require enhanced filtration performance.  In Life Sciences, sales were $312 million, consistent sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. Lower demand for COVID-related products was offset by growth in research products. Net income was $43 million. We continue to commercialize innovations, including the new cell and gene therapy production platform. And looking ahead, we expect to see continued growth in both research and bio process.  Finally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses, sales were $407 million, up 33% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. We continue to see increased demand for semiconductor grade polysilicon and strong demand for solar materials, and we continue to ramp solar capacity and sign up new customers with long-term take-or-pay contracts.  In September, Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies announced that it was awarded $104 million in additional funding from BARDA to support our planned capacity expansion for advanced, high-quality pharmaceutical glass tubing and vials. These expansions are designed to help the health care industry rapidly scale manufacturing to address current and future public health challenges.  Now I want to take a minute to talk about currency exchange rates. As you know, the dollar has been strengthening over the past year. As a reminder, we have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect our cash flow, enhance our ability to invest and provide shareholder returns. Our largest exposure is the yen, and we have most of next year hedged. We expect our core rate to remain the same in 2023.  We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received more than $2 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception.  Now let's turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect sales in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.65 billion and EPS in the range of $0.41 to $0.47. Now our fourth quarter guidance reflects several factors. In Optical Communications, pacing of customer projects will impact sales for the quarter. In Specialty Materials, we expect a sequential decline driven by lower demand in the smartphone, notebook and tablet markets. And of course, the biggest element in our guidance is Display. As I noted, we do not yet have enough positive evidence to guide significant improvement in glass demand from September levels. We expect free cash flow to be strong in the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we expect free cash flow in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.  Now I'd like to wrap up with a few key takeaways. As I noted at the opening of my remarks, we're executing well. And because of our inherent balance of our cohesive portfolio and our More Corning approach, we're built to be resilient even in a downturn as evidenced by the performance of Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies this quarter. Our long-term growth drivers all remain intact, and we're well positioned to continue capturing growth tied to key secular trends such as Optical Communications and solar.  In the meantime, we will continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and employ a highly disciplined approach to capital allocation. Given the external environment, we're taking actions to preserve profitability, tightly manage capital expenditures and prioritize cash flow.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Ed. Crystal, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna.\nMehdi Hosseini: Two things I want to dig into. Is there a minimum OpEx that you can offer us? I understand there are a lot of moving parts, especially with macro headwinds. And I'm just trying to better understand how flexible you are with managing expenses.  And the same thing with CapEx, there is no visibility as to when display will show a rebound. So should we assume that the CapEx trend into next year will show a decline on a year-over-year basis?\nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. Mehdi, what I would say on OpEx, we're certainly taking actions to pause spending in this current environment. As I mentioned, our goal is going to be to protect profitability and to protect our cash flow. I don't think, given the fact that we feel good about our long-term growth drivers, we're going to take significant actions at least at this point in time.  And with respect to capital, we're definitely pausing spending here as we go into the fourth quarter, and you should see the rate of our spending coming down a little bit.\nAnn Nicholson: Our next question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors.\nSteven Fox: Two questions on Optical, if I could. First of all, in terms of some of the project pauses or push-ups you're seeing, what gives you confidence that it's not something worse and that you see more delays, especially as you get into the winter months and with some of the issues in Europe?  And then secondly, can you give us a sense for how the ramping of the plants, the new plants for Optical has helped -- I assume it helped margins during the quarter and how that helps into next year and what the offset is with the build-out for Arizona.\nWendell Weeks: So Steve, first as to the macro, and you follow it all pretty closely. Macro demand in Opto is incredibly strong. But as you know, what we do is we try to make sure that we're supporting those customers that will be big, long-term players and the nature of telecommunications is that there is -- it's a pretty concentrated industry. So all that tends to happen is when some of our bigger customers end up changing their timing or altering their timing that's what leads to the lumpiness of our revenue. So we're highly confident in the demand drivers here in Opto. And as you know, I tend to be pretty pessimistic on Opto but just sort of overwhelming evidence that demand is very strong.  Now as that -- how long these timing moves can happen? I think you're right to say what can happen during the winter or which tends to be a little bit slower time for us just seasonality-wise. And that's legitimate, whether in the last 3 months or a little longer than 3 months, that's hard to tell. What it's easy to tell though is demand for Opto is super strong.\nSteven Fox: And then on the new plant impact?\nWendell Weeks: And Steve, I was going to say, I think the plants that we recently opened are ramping fine. I feel like we've added some capacity. We'll be able to use that as we go forward, but it takes a little while for all the cost drag to kind of go away and we should see that sort of fully ramped and the financial impact in 2023.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Martin Yang from Oppenheimer.\nMartin Yang: First, can you maybe share with us 1 or 2 mostly closely monitored a reliable leading indicator for display segment where you will be more comfortable calling a recovery after seeing changes in those indicators? .\nWendell Weeks: Great question, Martin. So our analytics are really good at being able to say, for instance, last year, we said there was going to be a correction in 2022. And then they're very good at doing things like calling a bottom because we can tell sort of where our panel makers are operating, and what exactly is happening with their inventory, et cetera. They're not as good at following the exact timing of a turn.  So for instance, our analytics would have said the panel maker industry should have started. It's correction in a much more robust way in quarter 4 of last year in quarter 2, but they didn't actually start until quarter 2 and then accelerated into quarter 3.  So though we're really comfortable with our analytics, they we're a bottom. The calling on when that upswing comes now really gets into sort of what is the psychological behavior of buyers in this industry. And so the way we tend to try to do that, it's a little softer but we do take a look at panel price inflection points. So that's where the absolute level is, but when do they turn and that is actually a buy signal for buyers, right, and it makes signal for panel makers.  How is the retail and set maker commentary as we have interviews with them constantly? How are they actually feeling about what it is they're seeing because that's going to drive their behavior. And then finally is just how tight things are becoming in the value chain overall.  So as we look at all those things, what we'd say is we can't tell yet what exact month we see the sharp recovery, right? We'll need to see more of that accumulate. But we can't say with pretty high confidence that September was a bottom. And now it's just a question of when do we pop up.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Wendell to follow up on that prior question, would you say -- you guys have disclosed in the past levels of weeks of inventory in the display supply chain. I was wondering if you could characterize maybe not in absolute, but at least in relative terms where we are relative to past cycles in terms of weeks of inventory? And Ed, if I could, I appreciate the fact that you guys are largely hedged for 2023, but the yens obviously moved to . Your core rate is . Maybe you can give investors a little bit of a longer-term view on the yen hedging strategy and maybe some calibration on potential impact beyond 2023, how investors should think about it?\nWendell Weeks: Thanks, Wamsi. Value chain inventory, we would say right now is at the healthy range and is starting to approach sort of a little bit tight for healthy. So that's like one of the analytics where we can say, \"Okay, right, that the correction has done what it is it's supposed to do. So that's how we're feeling about overall value chain inventory. Does that answer your question on that item?\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, it does, Wendell. I was just wondering if there was any -- like I think you guys have mentioned in the past 10 to 15 weeks, depending on various times in various cycles. And are we at the lower end of that or at the higher end of that? And does that give you some increased confidence that we're at the bottom of sort of where utilization rates could be?\nWendell Weeks: So the pandemic sort of changed what is healthy and what's not healthy and all the challenges in the supply chain. But what we should do is we should probably update you if this is a question that you have sort of how we view it overall. And Ed will follow up with you and give you the benefit of our thinking of how we analyze the industry.\nEdward Schlesinger: And Wamsi, on the yen or on currency in general, I'll make a couple of comments. So I think you know we're obviously long in the yen. We are short in other currencies. Most currencies are weak -- or weakening versus the dollar. So we are taking an opportunity during this time period in some of the currencies where we're short. And they're weakening against the dollar to put hedges in place farther out, right? So we're trying to be opportunistic despite the fact that the yen is weak and that obviously impacts our overall core rates as we think about them sort of as a basket of exposures.  And then with respect to the yen, we continue to look for ways to protect ourselves beyond 2023. We do have some hedges in place beyond 2023 and the farther out you go, the spot rate or the forward rate -- sorry, the forward rate is below where the current spot rate is, and that affords us some opportunity to do things further out. So we'll keep investors updated. We understand how people are thinking about it, and we're going to be opportunistic and try to protect ourselves at this current core rate level.\nOperator: And our next question, please. Our next question comes from Tim Long from Barclays.\nTim Long: Two questions, if I could, on the Optical segment. First, could you talk a little bit about -- you talked about the timing deals happens a lot in this industry. Maybe just looking at the next few quarters, are you seeing that a little bit more in the telco side or the data center side? Maybe if you can just parse out how those 2 splits are looking in the pipeline. And then on the telco side, we're increasingly hearing throughout the world about pressures on macro and energy costs and whatnot potentially affecting fiber builds, which have been obviously really strong over the last few years. Are you starting to hear more caution from the customer base looking out maybe a little bit on the telco side because of macro? Or do you think there's enough government initiatives and just push for broadband to make that still a spending priority for the telco vertical?\nWendell Weeks: Right. So I'd say that it is for our numbers like our post because when you've got macro environment that's really strong. And then all that's really happening is customer timing. So then it really ends up us being able to answer from our order book, what's going on. And in our order book, it would basically be some key telcos is just what's affecting our project timing more than anything else, right?  And so those are long-term projects. And so they kick off one, they conclude one, they start another. And so those can be lumpy.  In terms of the macro, I don't know that we're the right ones to ask because there's so much demand, and we're still short especially in fiber and cable, that we'll tend to get more signals that they want more and more and they share how aggressive their plans are. So we're probably getting a lot more of that than we are the sort of macro, are they cautious.  The combination of major government programs around the world that don't really start to kick in for almost another year, right, as well as catching up to all the demand that happened during the pandemic and how much of their capacity basic their guardrail capacity got consumed by demand as well as the 5G, cloud, all the broadband initiatives, all these things still a really sort of positive bullish signal to us. That doesn't mean that you're not right that they may be experiencing something in macro. We're just not hearing it. Does that make sense?\nTim Long: Yes, that does. Very, very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS.\nJoshua Spector: Just two quick ones, if I can. So just curious on your level of confidence on the pricing comments in display. A little bit surprised talking about up pricing there still into next year. It seems a little bit early at this point. So I'm curious if that depends on utilization rates increasing or is that something you see playing out potentially regardless of that scenario?  And then just a follow-up on the restructuring charges in the quarter. Can you just provide some comments on kind of what was restructured within the Emerging Growth Businesses?\nWendell Weeks: So our confidence on price really has been driven by our performance throughout this correction and going into where our prices have been up to stable throughout every single stage of it, including here in this last quarter.  So you heard from Ed sort of the dynamics that is bit of led to this but we feel good about where we're at, and we expect pricing to continue to be stable as we exit the correction as it has been up to stable throughout going into the correction and to the bottom of the correction.\nEdward Schlesinger: And Josh, I'll make a comment on the restructuring charges. So what you saw this quarter was primarily related to sort of an early-stage business, moving more towards commercialization. Oftentimes, we have Gen 1 assets. And as we move into like a high-volume manufacturing state, we advance our technology. Our cost goes down significantly and we sort of obsolete those Gen 1 assets, and that's the primary driver of what happened in the third quarter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Shannon Cross from Credit Suisse.\nShannon Cross: I wanted to ask a bit about solar. Can you talk about what you're thinking may be the contribution from the IRA and a backlog or how we should think about orders and then potential for additional capacity over time? Because it seems to me like this could be a big opportunity for Hemlock, especially if you start bringing more capacity back to the U.S.\nEdward Schlesinger: Shannon, so first, I would say we feel great about our Solar business. That was a great part of our ability to offset the lower volume of display in the third quarter. And our orders are strong, and we continue to sign customers up and sell out the capacity we've brought online. And we see that as a secular growth trend going forward. I think as we've shared, we have more capacity that we can bring online and we're in the process of evaluating that and the exact timing of when all that will happen. And we're certainly taking a look through all of the legislation that recently passed and how that impacts us. I think you can all -- you can view that as all positive for us, and we'll come back over time and talk a little bit about it more in detail.\nWendell Weeks: Shannon, you're right to look at it and say, \"Gosh, I think this is probably really good for Corning.\" And we'll update you as we turn into the year on what we think that will mean.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam: Just two, if I could. First, more on the macro and demand backdrop. I know there was a question asked about Optical. But more broadly across your end markets, are you seeing tighter financial conditions impacting your customers' propensity to invest heading into next year?  And then secondly, on pricing, I know you've talked a little bit about pricing increases, it sounds like there's a little bit more that could be coming in Optical. Just wondering if you've seen any sort of pushback or hesitancy to digest these increases in light of maybe some of the tighter financial conditions.\nWendell Weeks: So we're seeing the economic conditions really play out in our end markets. So as I shared in my opening that as whether it's in smartphones, notebooks, panel maker utilization, automotive, we're seeing those markets that are highly consumer electronics-related or highly consumer-related to be down significantly already. As of yet, that has definitely caused our customers so they pace. We haven't seen them come off their long-term ideas about what they have to invest in.  Much like us, our customers take a long time to build productive capacity and develop new technologies. So, so far, we haven't seen a reduction in their long-term appetite. Most people see that the economic concerns are already happening to them. So the real question is, when does it come out as opposed to getting ready for it. So I'd say that's sort of the animal spirits we're experiencing so far.  On price, yes, we are saying that in Opto, we've experienced some more inflation, and we will go -- going to be approaching our customers to more appropriately share that in this coming quarter. Throughout the year, we have done actually quite a good job of being able to share the inflation we experienced with our customers with price increases really across our business base. So, so far, we've been able to do that successfully and ask me the question again next quarter, and I'll tell you how this latest round went.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: I guess I had a similar macro question for you, Wendell, which is, I mean, for a long time, you've been outperforming most of the underlying markets you participate in, and the driver there has been more Corning content in every end market. I'm just thinking as we sort of go into next year and the macro is tougher, have you seen in past down cycles, any change in customer willingness to sort of continue to increase Corning content, particularly in sort of a challenging macro. And any sort of pushback that you're seeing on pricing as well at this time given that inflation is obviously something you need to pass through. But at the same time, the macro is starting to worsen a bit more than expected. So are you starting to see any hesitation from customers as well in those negotiations?\nWendell Weeks: Great question. Most of our More Corning plays tend to reduce our customers' cost or improve their ability to deliver a vital customer function that they see. So in macro, I'd say, no, that we're not seeing a reduction in their capability. Let me give you a good example on cloud-based players. So on our latest set of innovations basically involve us being able to deliver totally engineered connectivity systems so that we save 40% of materials for them we can say, months and installation time.  We improved the quality of everything. And so that in total, you give us a lot more price, a lot more revenue but it saves you money in time. That is like a typical angle for us in More Corning, and we're continuing to see good adoption of those. Your question. Interesting is when you move into mobile consumer electronics is you're seeing some differing strategies. There's just some clear power winners that have happened there who continue to invest really strongly in improving the product attributes that they offer to their customers. And some of our other mobile consumer electronics players, particularly in China, sort of have lost in that premium battle and are doing a little bit less of our key innovations. But in total, the winners are investing more with us. So -- and [indiscernible] still think that fundamental More Corning strategy is playing out well, very strong heartbeat. So that is still playing out. But I do understand the question. It's an interesting question. It's unique.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Maybe first question on Optical. I know it's been asked a couple of times, but just to kind of circle around it, that it's a couple of Americas-based service providers? Or is it more global in just what we're seeing? I know you said it was mostly within the telcos, but just wanted to get a sense is that largely concentrated within the U.S. or international? And then maybe a second question for me. Inventories have been a pretty big use of cash this year. Just wanted to get a sense of major drivers of that and if that's part of what you would expect to revert in Q4 to help with the -- achieve free cash flow generation targets.\nWendell Weeks: First question, North America based, right, and relatively limited in terms of its -- the number of people that are involved. So telco North America based, just timing. And I think if you just talk to the industry more broadly, you'll see that , to refrain from almost all of our customers is we can't get enough. And so that's still the backdrop, that's still the heartbeat and it's just timing and a few key customers.\nEdward Schlesinger: And Meta, on inventory, you're right. You can see it in our cash flow. We've definitely built a lot of inventory through September and we definitely need to make that reverse. That's what we're thinking, it will start to happen in the fourth quarter and as we go into 2023. I mean I think there are a few factors that drive it higher. And it's one of the reasons why we haven't been able to sort of slow it down and reverse it sooner. First and foremost, just in general, the supply chain has been difficult, and we want to make sure we can serve our customers, so we're carrying a little more inventory than we might otherwise have. And as we brought our sales forecast down for the back half of the year, we need to sort of catch up and digest a little bit of the inventory that we have and that we've produced. And then lastly, just the cost of the inventory, right? So as inflation hits us, it manifests itself in inventory, and then we get that back as we raise price when we sell that through. So there's a little bit of a delay in that. Those are really the factors that drive it up. And yes, our goal is to get it down starting here in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna.\nMehdi Hosseini: Just a quick follow-up. If I were to go back to late 2019, 2020, the last time that your Display revenue were declining, the averaged 20% net income. And if I fast forward to your Q3, your revenues are about $70 million less than that period, but you're still able to get almost to 20% net margin. Is it just a reflection of the trends that have come offline? Or is this something else that helps with relatively better margin given the lower revenue volume, an insight would be great.\nWendell Weeks: Awesome question. So first, I'd say you're right. And that's one of the things that why we feel good about our execution in display during this correction. So what you're seeing come through is all that tremendous improvement in productivity that our new technology brings and the outstanding cost performance that we've been able to do with that. So with a long period of time of prices being stable to up. And so that is what we've been trying to do in Display. That has been our strategy in Display as we build our strength through this time period. Very stable pricing, a very stable market position and then use our big technology lever to continue to drive our cost performance and drive up our profitability. And it's one of the things we're excited about when we see these -- the correction be over and the market start to move up and glass demand to go up because the incrementals will be powerful and a beautiful thing to behold.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Mehdi and thanks, Wendell. Okay. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Before we close, I wanted to let you know that we will attend the Credit Suisse 26th Annual Technology Conference on November 29 and the Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 8.  Additionally, we'll be hosting management visits to investor offices in select cities. Finally, a replay of today's call will be available on our site starting later this morning.  So once again, thank you all for joining us. Operator, that concludes our call. Please disconnect all lines.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Edward Schlesinger",
            "content": "Thanks, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by emphasizing that we're executing well in a challenging environment. Our performance in the third quarter was a proof point of the inherent balance of our cohesive portfolio and the fact that our More Corning approach is working. We're built to be resilient even in a downturn.  Now let's look at our financial results for the third quarter. Sales were $3.7 billion, up 1% from a strong third quarter in 2021. Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses all delivered year-over-year growth.  In September, Display Technologies experienced the lowest panel maker utilization levels since 2008, resulting in a 28% year-over-year decline in sales for the segment in the third quarter. In Specialty Materials, we outperformed the smartphone market, which was down double digits year-over-year.  Turning to profitability. Gross margin was 36.1% and operating margin was 16.9%, down sequentially 140 and 190 basis points, respectively, driven by the lower volume in display technologies.  In the third quarter, free cash flow was $255 million, and year-to-date, it was $866 million, keeping us on pace for another year of healthy cash generation. And despite the challenging environment during the quarter, we were able to offset significantly lower volume in display technologies, and we outperformed our underlying markets overall.  Now let's turn to the segment results. In Optical Communications, sales grew 16% year-over-year, reaching $1.3 billion. Our year-over-year growth was driven by network operator investments in 5G, broadband and the cloud. Net income was $183 million, up 32% and year-over-year, driven by leverage from strong incremental volume. Passive Optical Networks continue to experience a large multiyear wave of growth. We believe that this demand is strongly supported by private and public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the population. We continue to secure customer commitments, and we're investing to appropriately scale production to serve our incremental demand from current and new customers. And we're also taking further pricing actions to more appropriately shared recent cost increases in energy and certain raw materials with our customers.  As we've mentioned in the past, this business can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, and you'll see that play out in the fourth quarter as we expect optical sales to be down sequentially based on the timing of customer projects.  Now moving to Display. As we updated you in September, panel makers reduced their production levels below our already low expectations. The lower volume resulted in display sales declining 28% year-over-year and 22% sequentially, and we saw a 46% year-over-year and 41% sequential decline in net income due to the high fixed cost nature of glass manufacturing. In the third quarter, glass price was once again consistent sequentially. And we believe the glass pricing environment will remain favorable and factors that continue to drive that favorable pricing include glass supply-demand balance as panel makers reduce production, Corning and other glass makers took additional tanks offline for maintenance and repairs after an extended period of glass tightness.  And we're also taking this opportunity to upgrade some of our fleet with our latest technology which enables us to reduce cost and extend the life of new tanks. As we continue to work through these upgrades, we are actively managing restarts to align our supply to demand.  Another factor is glass maker profitability. It is challenging for glass makers who have high fixed costs to maintain profitability during periods of low volume and the current inflationary environment amplifies that challenge. We expect fourth quarter glass prices to be consistent with the third quarter and glass prices to be stable or up in subsequent quarters.  So overall, we continue to operate from a position of strength in the display market. And as Wendell noted, while we believe that panel maker utilization reached the bottom in September, we would like to see more evidence before we got a significant recovery in glass demand. But when glass demand grows, we expect our volume to increase and our profitability to improve.  In Specialty Materials, the market for smartphones was down 14% and tablets and notebooks were down 17%. We outperformed the market with sales down only 7% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for premium glasses, and strength in semiconductor materials. Third quarter sales were up 7% sequentially, driven by demand for our premium cover materials to support customer product launches.  And adding to our resilience in the segment, Advanced Optics delivered record sales for the second quarter in a row, and we are bringing additional capacity online at our facilities in Fairport and Canton, New York. Net income for the segment was $96 million, down 10% year-over-year due to lower volume and continued development expense related to next-generation products. The weakness in the smartphone tablet and notebook markets intensified in the quarter, and we expect fourth quarter sales and profitability to be down sequentially and year-over-year. Long term, we expect to outperform the market as we continue to develop and launch new premium glasses and optical treatments.  Turning to Environmental Technologies. In the third quarter, sales were $425 million, up 10% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. The Automotive production improved from a very low second quarter as China demand recovered after second quarter COVID lockdowns. However, vehicle production remains constrained due to the continued component shortages.  In addition to our sales growth, we improved profitability with net income up 45% year-over-year. Our content-driven strategy is working, gasoline particulate filters remain a critical component of that strategy, driving revenue even in a weakened market. Our next-generation filters are now shipping to customers as emission standards reach near 0 levels and require enhanced filtration performance.  In Life Sciences, sales were $312 million, consistent sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. Lower demand for COVID-related products was offset by growth in research products. Net income was $43 million. We continue to commercialize innovations, including the new cell and gene therapy production platform. And looking ahead, we expect to see continued growth in both research and bio process.  Finally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses, sales were $407 million, up 33% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. We continue to see increased demand for semiconductor grade polysilicon and strong demand for solar materials, and we continue to ramp solar capacity and sign up new customers with long-term take-or-pay contracts.  In September, Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies announced that it was awarded $104 million in additional funding from BARDA to support our planned capacity expansion for advanced, high-quality pharmaceutical glass tubing and vials. These expansions are designed to help the health care industry rapidly scale manufacturing to address current and future public health challenges.  Now I want to take a minute to talk about currency exchange rates. As you know, the dollar has been strengthening over the past year. As a reminder, we have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect our cash flow, enhance our ability to invest and provide shareholder returns. Our largest exposure is the yen, and we have most of next year hedged. We expect our core rate to remain the same in 2023.  We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received more than $2 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception.  Now let's turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect sales in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.65 billion and EPS in the range of $0.41 to $0.47. Now our fourth quarter guidance reflects several factors. In Optical Communications, pacing of customer projects will impact sales for the quarter. In Specialty Materials, we expect a sequential decline driven by lower demand in the smartphone, notebook and tablet markets. And of course, the biggest element in our guidance is Display. As I noted, we do not yet have enough positive evidence to guide significant improvement in glass demand from September levels. We expect free cash flow to be strong in the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we expect free cash flow in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.  Now I'd like to wrap up with a few key takeaways. As I noted at the opening of my remarks, we're executing well. And because of our inherent balance of our cohesive portfolio and our More Corning approach, we're built to be resilient even in a downturn as evidenced by the performance of Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies this quarter. Our long-term growth drivers all remain intact, and we're well positioned to continue capturing growth tied to key secular trends such as Optical Communications and solar.  In the meantime, we will continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and employ a highly disciplined approach to capital allocation. Given the external environment, we're taking actions to preserve profitability, tightly manage capital expenditures and prioritize cash flow.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A. Yes. Mehdi, what I would say on OpEx, we're certainly taking actions to pause spending in this current environment. As I mentioned, our goal is going to be to protect profitability and to protect our cash flow. I don't think, given the fact that we feel good about our long-term growth drivers, we're going to take significant actions at least at this point in time.  And with respect to capital, we're definitely pausing spending here as we go into the fourth quarter, and you should see the rate of our spending coming down a little bit. And Wamsi, on the yen or on currency in general, I'll make a couple of comments. So I think you know we're obviously long in the yen. We are short in other currencies. Most currencies are weak -- or weakening versus the dollar. So we are taking an opportunity during this time period in some of the currencies where we're short. And they're weakening against the dollar to put hedges in place farther out, right? So we're trying to be opportunistic despite the fact that the yen is weak and that obviously impacts our overall core rates as we think about them sort of as a basket of exposures.  And then with respect to the yen, we continue to look for ways to protect ourselves beyond 2023. We do have some hedges in place beyond 2023 and the farther out you go, the spot rate or the forward rate -- sorry, the forward rate is below where the current spot rate is, and that affords us some opportunity to do things further out. So we'll keep investors updated. We understand how people are thinking about it, and we're going to be opportunistic and try to protect ourselves at this current core rate level. And Josh, I'll make a comment on the restructuring charges. So what you saw this quarter was primarily related to sort of an early-stage business, moving more towards commercialization. Oftentimes, we have Gen 1 assets. And as we move into like a high-volume manufacturing state, we advance our technology. Our cost goes down significantly and we sort of obsolete those Gen 1 assets, and that's the primary driver of what happened in the third quarter. Shannon, so first, I would say we feel great about our Solar business. That was a great part of our ability to offset the lower volume of display in the third quarter. And our orders are strong, and we continue to sign customers up and sell out the capacity we've brought online. And we see that as a secular growth trend going forward. I think as we've shared, we have more capacity that we can bring online and we're in the process of evaluating that and the exact timing of when all that will happen. And we're certainly taking a look through all of the legislation that recently passed and how that impacts us. I think you can all -- you can view that as all positive for us, and we'll come back over time and talk a little bit about it more in detail. And Meta, on inventory, you're right. You can see it in our cash flow. We've definitely built a lot of inventory through September and we definitely need to make that reverse. That's what we're thinking, it will start to happen in the fourth quarter and as we go into 2023. I mean I think there are a few factors that drive it higher. And it's one of the reasons why we haven't been able to sort of slow it down and reverse it sooner. First and foremost, just in general, the supply chain has been difficult, and we want to make sure we can serve our customers, so we're carrying a little more inventory than we might otherwise have. And as we brought our sales forecast down for the back half of the year, we need to sort of catch up and digest a little bit of the inventory that we have and that we've produced. And then lastly, just the cost of the inventory, right? So as inflation hits us, it manifests itself in inventory, and then we get that back as we raise price when we sell that through. So there's a little bit of a delay in that. Those are really the factors that drive it up. And yes, our goal is to get it down starting here in the fourth quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported solid third quarter results that demonstrate strong execution. We continue to operate each of our business as well and our focus on leadership and distinctive capabilities allow us to capitalize on important secular trends and drive our More Corning approach. Sales were $3.7 billion, up slightly versus a strong third quarter last year, and EPS was $0.51. We were able to offset a sales decline in display technologies with growth in optical communications and solar. While we believe that display panel maker production bottomed in September, we would like to see additional positive evidence before guiding a significant recovery in glass demand.  In total, we performed well despite the economic environment. Before we get into the details, I wanted to set some context on what we're facing across our markets. On our last call, we told you that end markets in multiple businesses were down. A smartphone sales in the second quarter declined 8% year-over-year, panel maker utilization in June 2022 was at its lowest level since 2009. And yearly, automotive production was 10 million to 15 million vehicles below its pre-COVID rate.  Several of these dynamics continued or even intensified in the third quarter. A smartphone unit sales declined 14% year-over-year in the quarter, with tablet and notebook demand down 17%. Panel maker utilization decreased even further from its June level with September being the lowest month of the quarter and annual automotive production is still 10 million to 15 million cars short due to continued component shortages.  Nevertheless, we delivered results within our guidance range and expectations. We continue to benefit from infrastructure investments in broadband and clean energy, two secular trends we're strategically positioned to address. We delivered 16% year-over-year growth in Optical Communications, and we captured ongoing demand in the solar market, which contributed to 33% year-over-year growth in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses.  So let's take a deeper look. What we're seeing in some of our key markets, how we're responding. And why we're confident that our strategy continues to position us to deliver profitable multiyear growth. I'll start with display. In the third quarter, the glass market and our volume both decreased almost 25% sequentially and which significantly reduced our sales and profitability. In September, panel maker utilization reached the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2008.  More than a year ago, we said we expected a correction in the display industry during 2022. In the second quarter, panel makers began reducing production levels with accelerated reductions in June. In the third quarter, panel maker production reached an even lower level. And we believe that panel maker production reached the bottom in September.  So now the question is, when will the glass market recover? Now our answer is that we would like to see additional positive evidence before we guide a robust recovery in glass demand. We've maintained stable price and market position during this whole correction. Consequently, we expect our volume and profitability to increase sharply when panel maker utilization rebounds and we expect to exit the correction with strengthened customer relationships and importantly, a refreshed manufacturing fleet. As always, we will keep you informed as we progress.  Overall, we feel very good about our execution in display. In mobile consumer electronics, customer product launches and strength in semiconductor drove sequential growth in Specialty Materials. As I noted, smartphone and IT retail unit sales declined significantly in the quarter. We now expect smartphones to be down about 12% for the year. And we expect notebook and tablet demand to decline 15%. We expect the year-over-year decline in smartphones, notebooks and tablets to be greater in the second half than in the first half. This will limit the growth we normally see in our second half sales relative to the first half.  Now that said, we continue to outperform the market through our product leadership, our more Corning approach and our ongoing collaboration with industry leaders.  Over the long term, our content strategy in mobile consumer electronics will help us grow. As we continue to develop and launch premium glasses and optical treatments,for existing and new form factors.  Additionally, we're executing our more Corning approach in the semiconductor industry. In July, Senator, Chuck Schumer and New York Governor, Kathy Hochul, joined us to announce government funding that supports an expansion of our advanced optics facilities, which made equipment and materials vital to semiconductor manufacturing. Of course, semiconductors are fundamental to virtually all technology we interact with today. We've helped advance the industry for more than 50 years, and our expansion will keep us well positioned to support nearly every step of the chip manufacturing process and to respond to new customer needs, including products for EUV technology.  Let's turn to automotive. In Environmental Technologies, we delivered sales and profit growth despite the constraints on vehicle production, and we're outperforming the market for the year. We continue to adjust our operations to effectively navigate the variability in auto production and we are prepared to meet demand when industry production increases to normal rates.  We're also generating significant wins in our Automotive Glass Solutions business. Pull is strong for our technical glass and optics innovations.  During the quarter, CarUX, a leading car display company owned by Innolux, announced its use of our patented cold-form technology to help drive the future of auto interior displays. Corning continues to be well positioned to further grow its automotive business as the industry offers more advanced, designed-oriented cabins and enhanced driver assistance features.  Let's move to Optical Communications, which was the largest contributor to third quarter sales. The industry continues to experience a large multiyear wave of growth for passive optical networks, and we continue to increase our capacity to support this growth.  In August, U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, joined AT&T CEO, John Stankey, and me to announce a new manufacturing facility in Arizona. You may recall Secretary Raimondo's leadership helped pass infrastructure legislation dedicated to the idea of Internet for all. Our new plant will boost optical cable capacity to meet record demand.  In September, we opened a new optical fiber manufacturing plant in Poland to serve committed demand. And we're innovating to support every phase of broadband deployment as network access is increasingly viewed as a fundamental human right.  In the quarter, we announced additions to our Evolv connectivity portfolio which helps operators streamline permitting, accelerate field installation and optimize network testing. Optical sales have grown 22% and for the first 3 quarters of the year, setting us up for another strong year of growth. However, we expect fourth quarter sales to be down sequentially due to the timing of customer projects.  Turning to solar. The renewable energy industry is evolving rapidly, and our ongoing growth continues to indicate that the market's behavior is more closely tied to a global imperative than the current economic trends. We reenergized our participation in the solar market by starting up idle capacity and securing customer commitments through new long-term take-or-pay contracts for solar grade polysilicon. Third quarter sales grew significantly year-over-year, and we will benefit from the state of Michigan's infrastructure investment program, which will help us expand operations to meet increasing global demand for polysilicon. We believe that Corning's broader technical and manufacturing capabilities, our 3 and 4, will prove to be highly relevant and helping advance the renewable energy industry, and we see excellent growth potential in solar.  Now as I conclude my remarks, here's what I'd like to leave you with today. We remain very well positioned to deliver profitable multiyear growth and we'll continue to execute with discipline. We'll invest where we see strength and will pace to meet demand. Our cohesive and focused portfolio provides strategic resilience that is playing out well in this current environment. We've established a deep relevance to secular trends along with the ability to drive more content into our markets over time. We've been leading in the automotive and life science markets for 100 years, display for 80 years, telecommunication for 50 and mobile consumer electronics since the inception of smart devices.  The basis of our ongoing success is our distinctive set of capabilities and long track record of life-changing and even life-saving inventions.  In the past, what enables us to power through moments like the present while maintaining an attractive long-term growth trajectory.  Now let me turn the call over to Ed, who will share more details on our results, financial priorities and outlook. So Steve, first as to the macro, and you follow it all pretty closely. Macro demand in Opto is incredibly strong. But as you know, what we do is we try to make sure that we're supporting those customers that will be big, long-term players and the nature of telecommunications is that there is -- it's a pretty concentrated industry. So all that tends to happen is when some of our bigger customers end up changing their timing or altering their timing that's what leads to the lumpiness of our revenue. So we're highly confident in the demand drivers here in Opto. And as you know, I tend to be pretty pessimistic on Opto but just sort of overwhelming evidence that demand is very strong.  Now as that -- how long these timing moves can happen? I think you're right to say what can happen during the winter or which tends to be a little bit slower time for us just seasonality-wise. And that's legitimate, whether in the last 3 months or a little longer than 3 months, that's hard to tell. What it's easy to tell though is demand for Opto is super strong. And Steve, I was going to say, I think the plants that we recently opened are ramping fine. I feel like we've added some capacity. We'll be able to use that as we go forward, but it takes a little while for all the cost drag to kind of go away and we should see that sort of fully ramped and the financial impact in 2023. Great question, Martin. So our analytics are really good at being able to say, for instance, last year, we said there was going to be a correction in 2022. And then they're very good at doing things like calling a bottom because we can tell sort of where our panel makers are operating, and what exactly is happening with their inventory, et cetera. They're not as good at following the exact timing of a turn.  So for instance, our analytics would have said the panel maker industry should have started. It's correction in a much more robust way in quarter 4 of last year in quarter 2, but they didn't actually start until quarter 2 and then accelerated into quarter 3.  So though we're really comfortable with our analytics, they we're a bottom. The calling on when that upswing comes now really gets into sort of what is the psychological behavior of buyers in this industry. And so the way we tend to try to do that, it's a little softer but we do take a look at panel price inflection points. So that's where the absolute level is, but when do they turn and that is actually a buy signal for buyers, right, and it makes signal for panel makers.  How is the retail and set maker commentary as we have interviews with them constantly? How are they actually feeling about what it is they're seeing because that's going to drive their behavior. And then finally is just how tight things are becoming in the value chain overall.  So as we look at all those things, what we'd say is we can't tell yet what exact month we see the sharp recovery, right? We'll need to see more of that accumulate. But we can't say with pretty high confidence that September was a bottom. And now it's just a question of when do we pop up. Thanks, Wamsi. Value chain inventory, we would say right now is at the healthy range and is starting to approach sort of a little bit tight for healthy. So that's like one of the analytics where we can say, \"Okay, right, that the correction has done what it is it's supposed to do. So that's how we're feeling about overall value chain inventory. Does that answer your question on that item? So the pandemic sort of changed what is healthy and what's not healthy and all the challenges in the supply chain. But what we should do is we should probably update you if this is a question that you have sort of how we view it overall. And Ed will follow up with you and give you the benefit of our thinking of how we analyze the industry. Right. So I'd say that it is for our numbers like our post because when you've got macro environment that's really strong. And then all that's really happening is customer timing. So then it really ends up us being able to answer from our order book, what's going on. And in our order book, it would basically be some key telcos is just what's affecting our project timing more than anything else, right?  And so those are long-term projects. And so they kick off one, they conclude one, they start another. And so those can be lumpy.  In terms of the macro, I don't know that we're the right ones to ask because there's so much demand, and we're still short especially in fiber and cable, that we'll tend to get more signals that they want more and more and they share how aggressive their plans are. So we're probably getting a lot more of that than we are the sort of macro, are they cautious.  The combination of major government programs around the world that don't really start to kick in for almost another year, right, as well as catching up to all the demand that happened during the pandemic and how much of their capacity basic their guardrail capacity got consumed by demand as well as the 5G, cloud, all the broadband initiatives, all these things still a really sort of positive bullish signal to us. That doesn't mean that you're not right that they may be experiencing something in macro. We're just not hearing it. Does that make sense? So our confidence on price really has been driven by our performance throughout this correction and going into where our prices have been up to stable throughout every single stage of it, including here in this last quarter.  So you heard from Ed sort of the dynamics that is bit of led to this but we feel good about where we're at, and we expect pricing to continue to be stable as we exit the correction as it has been up to stable throughout going into the correction and to the bottom of the correction. Shannon, you're right to look at it and say, \"Gosh, I think this is probably really good for Corning.\" And we'll update you as we turn into the year on what we think that will mean. So we're seeing the economic conditions really play out in our end markets. So as I shared in my opening that as whether it's in smartphones, notebooks, panel maker utilization, automotive, we're seeing those markets that are highly consumer electronics-related or highly consumer-related to be down significantly already. As of yet, that has definitely caused our customers so they pace. We haven't seen them come off their long-term ideas about what they have to invest in.  Much like us, our customers take a long time to build productive capacity and develop new technologies. So, so far, we haven't seen a reduction in their long-term appetite. Most people see that the economic concerns are already happening to them. So the real question is, when does it come out as opposed to getting ready for it. So I'd say that's sort of the animal spirits we're experiencing so far.  On price, yes, we are saying that in Opto, we've experienced some more inflation, and we will go -- going to be approaching our customers to more appropriately share that in this coming quarter. Throughout the year, we have done actually quite a good job of being able to share the inflation we experienced with our customers with price increases really across our business base. So, so far, we've been able to do that successfully and ask me the question again next quarter, and I'll tell you how this latest round went. Great question. Most of our More Corning plays tend to reduce our customers' cost or improve their ability to deliver a vital customer function that they see. So in macro, I'd say, no, that we're not seeing a reduction in their capability. Let me give you a good example on cloud-based players. So on our latest set of innovations basically involve us being able to deliver totally engineered connectivity systems so that we save 40% of materials for them we can say, months and installation time.  We improved the quality of everything. And so that in total, you give us a lot more price, a lot more revenue but it saves you money in time. That is like a typical angle for us in More Corning, and we're continuing to see good adoption of those. Your question. Interesting is when you move into mobile consumer electronics is you're seeing some differing strategies. There's just some clear power winners that have happened there who continue to invest really strongly in improving the product attributes that they offer to their customers. And some of our other mobile consumer electronics players, particularly in China, sort of have lost in that premium battle and are doing a little bit less of our key innovations. But in total, the winners are investing more with us. So -- and [indiscernible] still think that fundamental More Corning strategy is playing out well, very strong heartbeat. So that is still playing out. But I do understand the question. It's an interesting question. It's unique. First question, North America based, right, and relatively limited in terms of its -- the number of people that are involved. So telco North America based, just timing. And I think if you just talk to the industry more broadly, you'll see that , to refrain from almost all of our customers is we can't get enough. And so that's still the backdrop, that's still the heartbeat and it's just timing and a few key customers. Awesome question. So first, I'd say you're right. And that's one of the things that why we feel good about our execution in display during this correction. So what you're seeing come through is all that tremendous improvement in productivity that our new technology brings and the outstanding cost performance that we've been able to do with that. So with a long period of time of prices being stable to up. And so that is what we've been trying to do in Display. That has been our strategy in Display as we build our strength through this time period. Very stable pricing, a very stable market position and then use our big technology lever to continue to drive our cost performance and drive up our profitability. And it's one of the things we're excited about when we see these -- the correction be over and the market start to move up and glass demand to go up because the incrementals will be powerful and a beautiful thing to behold."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Corning Incorporated Quarter Two 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning\u2019s Q2 2022 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the second quarter, the largest difference between GAAP and core results stems from noncash mark-to-market gains associated with the company's currency hedging contracts. This increased GAAP earnings in Q2 by $203 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now, I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced strong second quarter results. We captured additional content opportunities across our markets, despite an extremely challenging external environment. And we delivered on growing demand in optical and solar. Sales were $3.8 billion, up 7% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.57, up 8% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $440 million and total first half free cash flow was $611 million. Gross margin and operating margin expanded 90 basis points and 120 basis points respectively from the first quarter 2022 levels. Now our improved profitability was primarily driven by the benefits of pricing actions that we took to more appropriately share the impact of inflation with our customers. In total, we delivered in line with our expectations, even though dynamics in three of our largest markets played out at the lower end of our assumptions. In the last month of the quarter, panel maker utilization rates declined to the lowest levels since the first quarter of 2009, when we were at the height of the financial crisis. Auto production continued significantly below normal with virtually no cars sold in Shanghai in April, due to COVID-19 restrictions and with European new car registrations for June at the lowest levels since 1996. In the second quarter, smartphone sales declined 11% year-over-year, primarily stemming from COVID lockdowns in China. In the face of these industry dynamics, we delivered outstanding results, in line with our guidance. We did what we said we were going to do including continued growth and improved profitability. We view the resilience we've demonstrated as a strong proof point that our strategy is working. In the third quarter, we expect the challenges in these three markets to continue. At the same time, we expect an ongoing benefit from secular trends in optical and solar. Both factors are reflected in our guidance. We now expect third quarter sales to be roughly consistent sequentially and to grow year-over-year. We expect full year sales to slightly exceed $15 billion and to grow in a range of 6% to 8%. Now, Ed will elaborate more in just a moment. Now with that in mind, I want to expand on our path to $15 billion and look at the dynamics playing out in four critical market: display, optical communications, solar, and mobile consumer electronics. And I'll address what we're experiencing, how it is reflected in our financials and how we're driving our performance. Let's start with display. We are executing well against our strategy. We had been updating you on the panel maker utilization correction for a year now. Panel makers accelerated reductions in the second quarter. The sharpest reduction was in June and our volume declined in line with panel maker utilization and the market. We expect June's low production level to continue throughout the entire third quarter and our volume to, again, decline in line with the market. Our guidance reflects our view of panel makers\u2019 second half production. And we expect our second half volume to be lower than the first half. At the same time, we have always said, we expect to maintain price stability through this correction. That is exactly what happened in the second quarter, as expected, price was up sequentially. And we expect third quarter price to be consistent with the second quarter. As panel makers lower utilization, we are seeing glass makers idle their tanks to perform maintenance and repairs and thereby lower capacity. We are managing our own tank repairs and restarts to align our supply to demand after running flat out for a very, very long time. As a result, we expect glass supply and demand to remain in balance. We feel good about our execution and strategy in display, as we continue to operate from a position of strength. We are the industry leader with a global manufacturing footprint, cost advantages, distinctive capabilities and leadership in Gen 10.5, where we are well positioned to capture long-term growth in large size TVs. Let's move to optical communications, which was the largest contributor to our second quarter growth. We believe the industry is at the beginning of a large multi-year wave of growth for passive optical networks. And we're well positioned to capture that growth. We're pursuing three significant secular trends: broadband, 5G, and the cloud. We've got major innovation programs underway for each category and we're seeing robust traction with our customers. Momentum continues to build in this business and you can see this in our financials. Second quarter sales grew 10% sequentially, faster than we expected and 22% year-over-year to reach $1.3 billion and we expect to grow year-over-year again in the third quarter and even faster than the market for the full year due to growing demand for our innovations. Take, for example, our edge pre-engineered systems for cloud operators. Now this product had its biggest quarter to-date in the second quarter. These solutions much like FlexNAP for broadband provide customers with a simpler greener solution to minimize the number of cables, cable trays and hardware needed. The simple value prop is speed. We\u2019re helping get capacity installed much faster, eliminating labor bottlenecks in the industry. Our innovative manufacturing process, which completes splicing at a fraction of the cost and at much higher quality, dramatically reduces on site labor. So we\u2019re accelerating our customer\u2019s ability to scale their networks and build cloud capacity all while driving more Corning solutions into the market. Our visibility and confidence in the adoption of edge products is high because network planning decisions happen well ahead of deployment and we are winning now. Turning to solar. The renewable energy industry is evolving rapidly and our ongoing growth suggests that the market\u2019s behavior is more closely tied to a global imperative than simply current economic trends. We recently re-energized our participation in the solar market by turning on idle capacity and securing customer commitments through new long-term take or pay contracts for solar grade polysilicon. In the quarter, sales grew significantly, which is reflected in our top line growth. Looking ahead, we believe that Corning\u2019s broader technical and manufacturing capabilities our three and our four, will prove highly relevant in helping advance the industry. We expect year-over-year growth to continue in the second half and we see excellent growth potential in this business. In mobile consumer electronics, smartphone and IT retail unit sales were down. However, we\u2019re outperforming in this market through our more Corning approach, product leadership and ongoing collaboration with true industry leaders. The benefits of our strategy are evident in our results. Specialty material sales were consistent with a strong second quarter of 2021 and net income grew 12% year-over-year. We expect to deliver growth in the back half in this down market as customers adopt our innovations for their product launches. Overall, Corning is executing very well commercially and technically. Despite all the temporary macro challenges, we delivered a solid quarter. We\u2019ve added more than $700 million in sales in the first half, reflecting an increase of more than 10% year-over-year. And EPS has grown even faster, up 14% in the same time period from $0.97 to $1.11. So you can see that strong secular growth in optical and solar and our more Corning approach is offsetting weakness in the display, automotive and mobile consumer electronics markets. We expect to continue performing well in a challenging environment to close out another strong year. Our cohesive and focus portfolio provides us with a strategic resilience that is playing out well in the current environment and will serve us well in the future. Stepping back, we\u2019ve been leading in the automotive and life science markets for 100 years, display for 80 years, telecommunications for 50 and mobile consumer electronics since the inception of smart devices. The basis of our ongoing successes are distinctive set of capabilities and long track record of life changing and life saving inventions. Now this is particularly important in times like the present. We\u2019ve made great progress, building a more balanced and resilient company. We are structured to and focused on outperforming our markets consistently. Corning\u2019s deep relevance to secular trends, along with our ability to drive more content into our markets over time will enable us to maintain our strength through this economic downturn and emerge stronger on the other side. As we look to both the immediate future and longer-term, we\u2019re confident that our investments and our focused and cohesive portfolio together with our financial discipline will help us drive durable, profitable multi-year growth. In fact, our R&D engine has never been stronger. And a new generation of distinguished leaders has stepped up to drive us through our next exciting period of transformation. This quarter, we appointed Dr. Jaymin Amin as our Chief Technology Officer. A 25 year Corning veteran Jaymin has worked with some of the company\u2019s most influential and innovative customers on ground breaking advancements, including his work launching and commercializing Gorilla Glass. Jaymin\u2019s leadership, technical expertise and experience with Corning scientific capabilities will help take us to the next level of innovation. I\u2019d also like to thank David Morse. I deeply appreciate his leadership and contributions over the years as one of our most accomplished technology leaders. He received his PhD from MIT when he was only 23 years old and he retired last month after nearly 50 years with the company. David has created a strong foundation that Jaymin will continue to build on, adding to my confidence that Corning\u2019s greatest contributions are yet to come. Now, let me turn the call over to Ed, who will share more details on our results, financial priorities and outlook.\nEd Schlesinger: Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to preface my remarks today with three key takeaways on the quarter. We\u2019re executing well and successfully navigating the current environment. We\u2019re driving top line growth, improved profitability and strong cash flow with high single digit year-over-year sales and EPS growth. And we\u2019re employing a highly disciplined approach toward investing for the long-term. With that said, let\u2019s walk through the details on the quarter. Total company sales reached nearly $3.8 billion, growing 7% year-over-year, highlights included sales growth of more than 20% in optical and strong growth in solar. We met our goal of improving gross margin and operating margin, sequentially driven by previously announced pricing actions across the organization. Gross margin grew 90 basis points and operating margin grew 120 basis points. Net income was $489 million, up 7% year-over-year and EPS was $0.57, which represents an 8% increase year-over-year. We generated $440 million of free cash flow in the quarter, keeping the company on pace for another year of strong cash generation and we invested $353 million in CapEx. I\u2019d also like to comment on the impact of currency. We have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect cash flow, enhanced our ability to invest and provide shareholder returns. Our largest exposure is to the end, which has been weakening. We have most of next year hedged and we expect our core rate to remain the same in 2023. We\u2019re pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We\u2019ve received more than $2 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the operational rigor our teams displayed during the quarter. We successfully raised prices to more appropriately share the impact of higher inflation with our customers. We successfully navigated extended COVID-19 lockdowns in China, a sharp correction in panel maker utilization in the display market, lower demand for smartphones and an additional temporary step down in China automotive production. And we\u2019re capitalizing on our market leadership and strong secular growth in optical and solar. Second quarter results reflect the benefits of our focused and cohesive portfolio, particularly the balance it provides. Now let\u2019s go through the segments. In Optical Communications, sales grew 22% year-over-year, reaching $1.3 billion for the second quarter. Year-over-year sales growth was driven by 5G, broadband, and the cloud. Net income was $182 million, up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong volume and price increases. We believe we\u2019re in the early phases of a multi-year build cycle across multiple segments in the passive optical market. We\u2019re responding to this demand by ramping up production and opening new facilities as always we de-risk these investments by requiring meaningful commitments from customers often including funding before beginning construction. In the second quarter, Display Technologies sales were $878 million, down 8% sequentially. Panel makers have been reducing their utilization rates for the last few quarters. In June, we saw a significant decline in panel maker production versus April and May. And our volume declined in line with this change and the market. Importantly, glass price was up slightly sequentially. This coupled with solid execution resulted in net income declining 3% sequentially, less than half the sales decline. In the third quarter, we expect June\u2019s low panel maker production levels to continue, and our volume to decline in line with the market and lower average utilization resulting in our glass volume down mid teens sequentially. We expect third quarter glass price to be consistent with the second quarter. The factors we use to assess the pricing environment in the display glass market continue to support a favorable pricing environment. First is glass supply demand balance. Currently, glass makers are taking tanks offline for maintenance and repairs after an extended period of glass tightness. We are actively managing tank repairs and restarts to align our supply to demand. These actions result in lower glass capacity in the market. Additionally, after running flat out for so long, we need to replenish our inventory toward optimal levels to reduce excess logistics costs. And lastly, glass maker profitability also supports favorable pricing. In this inflationary environment it is challenging for glass makers who have high fixed costs to maintain profitability during periods of low volume. Additionally, our customers depend on us for our market leading supply reliability, enabling us to build on our strong competitive position. So overall, we feel good about our execution against our goal to stabilize returns in Display. The pricing environment is stable. We have maintained our pricing and when volume returns, our sales and profitability will improve. In Specialty Materials, sales were consistent with a strong second quarter 2021. Net income was $91 million, up 12% year-over-year. We achieved these results despite the smartphone and IT markets being down. Our more Corning approach, product leadership and ongoing collaboration with industry leaders are enabling our outperformance in this market. Specifically, we maintained revenue and profitability driven by the adoption of our premium cover materials. We also continue to benefit from the strength of the semiconductor equipment industry. In fact, we expect to see continued investments in the industry to meet rapidly growing demand and to support increased stability in the supply chain to ensure we are prepared to capture growth. We just announced an expansion of our advanced optics operations in New York state. And as Wendell mentioned, we expect Specialty Materials sales growth in the back half driven by customer product launches. In Environmental Technologies, second quarter auto production experienced constraints due to prolonged chip shortages, the Russia-Ukraine war, and COVID-19 lockdowns in China. As a result, second quarter sales were $356 million, down 13% both sequentially and year-over-year. In the automotive industry, this will be the third year in a row production has been unable to meet end market demand. Since 2019, auto markets have declined around 16%. In contrast, we have outperformed the market and our sales were up about 5% over the same period. We\u2019re pursuing content opportunities that generate sales beyond end market demand such as additional adoption of GPS in new regions. We expect an uptick in sales in the third quarter driven primarily by a resumption of auto production in China following COVID lockdowns. We remain prepared to serve demand globally as supply constraints ease and auto production increases. In Life Sciences, sales of $312 million remain consistent year-over-year and sequentially and net income of $37 million was down. Lower demand for COVID related products was offset by growth in research and bioproduction products. Additionally, COVID lockdowns in China impacted sales and profitability. Looking ahead, we expect to see continued growth in research and bioproduction, and we\u2019re well positioned to meet that demand with recent capacity investments designed to improve efficiency and enable us to better support global customers. Finally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses, sales reached $418 million, a 45% increase year-over-year, and an 11% increase sequentially. This strong performance was largely driven by our production ramp to meet new long-term solar take-or-pay contracts. During the quarter, Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies also contributed to strong sales as we saw continued adoption of our pharmaceutical packaging solutions for critical drugs. And Automotive Glass Solutions delivered year-over-year growth as well. During the quarter, Continental recognized the business as one of its \u201cSuppliers of the Year\u201d for our AutoGrade Corning Gorilla Glass technology, another proof point on our progress toward a $100 per car opportunity. In sum, the multiple growth drivers and our market leadership across our portfolio create an inherent resiliency that enables us to consistently outperform our markets. Now turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect sales roughly consistent with the second quarter in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.85 billion. We expect continued strong sales in Optical Communications, Hemlock\u2019s solar products, and Specialty Materials to offset lower display volume, which is expected to be down mid-teens from the second quarter as I noted earlier. We expect EPS in the range of $0.51 to $0.55 for the third quarter. While we expect the benefits of our pricing actions to continue the lower volume in display will impact profitability. Our most likely outcome for the full year is to slightly exceed $15 billion in sales as we shared with you in April. We now expect sales to be up 6% to 8%, and we expect to grow EPS in line with sales. Our guidance factors in a range of probabilities for the market challenges that we\u2019ve outlined this morning. As I wrap up my remarks today, I\u2019ll end by saying, we\u2019re very pleased with the results of the quarter and the first half of the year. We\u2019re growing profitably. And we remain highly disciplined in our approach to investment decisions, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and delivering solid free cash flow. This gives us the ability and flexibility to address evolving market conditions. We\u2019re also expanding capacity to support committed customer demand all while carefully monitoring the external environment to pace appropriately. We\u2019re confident in the many levers at our disposal to manage through any environment and come out the other side stronger, while advancing our long-term growth initiatives. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Ed. Krystal, we\u2019re ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. And your line is now open.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Can you hear me?\nAnn Nicholson: Yes, please, Steve.\nSteven Fox: Hi. I guess, I was wondering if you can go back and talk about the optical business a little bit more. It\u2019s obviously got a lot of new product momentum and has had extremely strong growth. Some of your carrier customers have recently called out some weakness on subscribers and other consumer demand. How do we think about sort of optical maybe not just for the next couple quarters, but say if we think about it for the next year in the face of macro pressures, how confident are you in its ability to continue to grow? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks for the question, Steve. Yes, we\u2019ve seen all those comments and of course we talk directly to leadership of all of our major carrier customers. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing. And then let\u2019s just step back and talk about just what the some of the other macro forces are behind it. So what we\u2019re hearing from them is their investment in fiber optics is their top strategic priority. And so that even as they take a look at what they can do with different elements of their capital spending plans and their investment plans that they\u2019re prioritizing their investment in our product sets. And they\u2019re actually asking us to commit to supply more into next year and beyond. So we\u2019re in the midst of that type of discussion with our customers. So a little early to tell exactly where that all will turn out, but will be public as that gets a little bit closer. So I would say right now all of our demand signals continue to be quite robust and if we could make more fiber and cable, we could sell more fiber and cable, and we\u2019re seeing continued strong demand as we look into next year or so. Did that answer your question, Steven?\nSteven Fox: It did. And then I just probably should have thrown this into the question, which is, could you just maybe expand that Wendell to talk about cloud demand as well? And I\u2019ll pass it on from there. Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: In cloud, they continue to see pretty strong revenue performance in cloud, as I\u2019m sure you have seen. And in general, the pandemic put some of those major infrastructure programs a little bit behind where they would like them. So we\u2019re continuing to see demand there. That\u2019s very robust. The main thing that\u2019s providing any volatility in our cloud based demand tends to be their ability to actually get their installations done on time to actually get all the labor that they need to actually get the construction going. And it also plays very nicely into some of our new innovations that use tremendously less labor. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re seeing strong take up of our new innovations in cloud. So although cloud is \u2013 will always go with sort of how can they run their construction projects. Overall, we\u2019re seeing nothing but a strong demand signal out of our customers there.\nSteven Fox: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. And your line is now open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. I was wondering if you can update us around your assumption for TV units for 2022 and maybe initial look into 2023. And are you expecting growth or decline of glass at retail at this point, given what\u2019s happening at panel makers? And if I could on Specialty Materials profitability, if we look at that both on a year-on-year or on a sequential basis or roughly flat revenues, you have significant improvement in profitability. And I was wondering if you could talk about the drivers there? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: On Display, as you would\u2019ve heard in our opening, we are \u2013 we expect our volume to be in line with where panel makers are taking their utilization and down some 15% in quarter three. As we take a look at retail what we\u2019d say is we\u2019d expect TV units to probably be down this year now, especially given what has happened with the China shutdowns. But it could be flat. And I think it\u2019s just too early for us to talk about next year. This is a pretty significant correction that we\u2019re working our way through and the real critical spot for us is we want to be able to continue to execute our strategy and have that our price be stable, have our market position stay stable. And then we\u2019ll be there for as television unit demand and panel maker utilization comes up, we\u2019ll see our profitability climb in line.\nEd Schlesinger: And I\u2019ll take your second question, Wamsi on Specialty Materials. So couple things, one, first I think, we\u2019re performing well in this segment, right? The market is down and we\u2019re flattish. It\u2019s a great more Corning story for us. So we\u2019re outperforming the market there. And then secondly, I think on the profitability side, it\u2019s primarily about the continued adoption of our new cover materials and us adding content into the market. That\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the profitability relative to the flat sales.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you so much.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. And your line is now open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes. Hi, thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my question was just on the 4Q guide here. The implied earnings guide does represent a recovery from the 3Q levels. And I\u2019m just curious about what\u2019s the driver for the increase in earnings going from 3Q to 4Q that you\u2019re embedding. And I would assume that you\u2019re expecting Display to contribute to that, just given the sort of relevance of the segment itself, and hence what\u2019s driving the expectation that Display rebounds from 3Q to 4Q as well? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks, Samik. So I think maybe stepping back a little bit on the guide, if I think about both the third quarter and the full year, what we\u2019ve tried to do is reflect the highest probability range that we can for sort of all the dynamics we\u2019re seeing across all of our markets. And as we talked about in Display, it\u2019s \u2013 there was a pretty sharp correction down in June. We\u2019re expecting that to continue into the third quarter, but we have a range of how we see that playing out. And then the same thing holds true related to demand in China, which obviously impacts automotive in the back half of the year. It\u2019ll impact potentially smartphones and maybe even Life Sciences, right? So if you think about our guide, there\u2019s a high end and a low end and sort of our view of a most probable outcome. And so, yes, we\u2019re expecting the fourth quarter to probably be a little bit better than the third quarter, depending on where you pick within that range we\u2019ve given you for the third quarter and it\u2019s certainly possible if sort of things play out as they normally do. You would see an uptick in Display. That\u2019s definitely in the range of probabilities in terms of how we\u2019ve thought about it.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. And your line is now open.\nRod Hall: Yes. Thank you for the questions. I wanted to start with a high level question for Wendell, and then I have a question on solar as well. I just, Wendell, what we\u2019ve seen in consumer is deterioration of the low end and maybe the mid-range as well, a little bit, the smartphone industry, et cetera. I\u2019m wondering if you think that the higher end consumer, do you see any evidence that is not still hanging in there or what are your expectations for the higher end consumer in the back end of the year at some of your exposure there? And then I\u2019ll follow up with the solar question after that answer, if it\u2019s okay.\nWendell Weeks: Rod, I would agree with your observation and concerned insightful observation that the more premium end is doing better than the low end and the largest deterioration has been in that piece of the market. We think that relative outperformance will be there, but we don\u2019t like in our guide, we\u2019re not reflecting a belief that it\u2019s just going to be bimodal, right. We think everybody\u2019s going to get impacted and it\u2019s a timing question. But you\u2019ll still have relative outperformance in the premium end and that\u2019s the way we look at it. Is that the question you were asking Rod? [Ph]\nRod Hall: Yes. I think I just was curious to see whether you thought did you of course have a lot more data sometimes than we do? Whether that high end would follow the low end, or I think it probably will, but I was just curious what your opinion of that was so?\nWendell Weeks: Yes. We\u2019re seeing the impact of that being below where we would\u2019ve thought it would be really driven, I think primarily by this combination of China shutdowns and inflation. So it\u2019s below what we would have normally expected it to be, but it is, we are still seeing outperformance run.\nRod Hall: Right. Okay. Thanks Wendell. And then on solar, we had estimated about a third of the Hemlock and Emerging Growth Business revenue with solar last year. And I'm wondering maybe Ed or Wendell, if you guys could double click on that a little bit for us this year? Talk about what you think the proportion of those total revenues might look like for solar this year. And I'm also curious how gated that is by supply. In other words, are you just selling everything you can make? Could you sell more if you were able to turn on even more supply, just curious kind of how that all is shaping up right now? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Yes. Thanks Rod. So on solar, I think the way to think about it is through the year, last year and into sort of the second quarter of this year, we continued to ramp our solar sales. We were originally selling out of inventory and we sort of sold all that out and then we started production back up in the fourth quarter. And so it has become a greater part of the sales in Hemlock and Emerging Growth segment. In addition to that, what I would say is, we are getting to be capacity constrained. I mean, we're selling for the most part, what we can make, we'll get a little better at making and we'll have a little more capacity in the back half and as we go into 2023, but not a lot of capacity. And I think the important thing to think [Technical Difficulty] make we'll get a little better at making and we'll have a little more capacity in the back half and as we go into 2023, but not a lot of capacity. And I think the important thing to think about is, we've signed customers up for multi-year take or pay contracts to essentially sell out that capacity. So we feel really good about that demand and our ability to supply it. We have more capacity that we could turn on. It would be a decision we'd have to make based on the dynamics in the market and our ability to continue to get customers to take that volume either by giving us cash or signing up for long-term commitments.\nRod Hall: But I just \u2013 with energy prices where they are, wouldn't it make sense to, it would seem solar demand is only going to go one way. Would you agree with that?\nWendell Weeks: [Technical Difficulty] to supply it, we have more capacity that we could turn on. It would be a decision we'd have to make based on the dynamics in the market and our ability to continue to get customers to take that volume either by giving us cash or signing up for long-term commitments.\nRod Hall: But I just \u2013 with energy prices where they are, wouldn't it make sense to, it would seem solar demand is only going to go one way. Would you agree with that?\nWendell Weeks: Yes, I think the good \u2013 the demand is high. I do agree. I think we're cautious in this space and we want to make sure that we've got good commitment for any additional demand that we would turn on. We'll update you as that plays itself out in the back half of this year and into 2023.\nEd Schlesinger: Just add some there, Rod, I think your instincts are right, that you have a bold case for solar. What makes us really insist on committed demand from our customers and to make sure that that our customers are taking on more of the risk under their shareholders than ours would take is because geopolitics also plays a role. So energy always has geopolitics play a role and solar is no different and so given that, is why we want to make sure that if we add \u2013 if we bring on more capacity that our shareholders basically are getting a nice free shot on goal.\nRod Hall: That's great. Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate all the color.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Josh Spector from UBS. And your line is now open. Mr. Spector, please make sure your line is not on mute.\nJosh Spector: Sorry. For some reason it cut out. I didn't hear my name. Thanks for taking my question. Just as a high level, curious, I mean, you seem relatively bullish on optical. Maybe those expectations are roughly unchanged, clearly display expectations moved a bit. In the rest of the portfolio, would you say your second half expectations have changed significantly? Or are they relatively similar to how you saw things a few months ago and trying to think about that relative in terms of the medium to longer term growth for some of those segments as well? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Yes. I would say, the biggest change probably going back a quarter is what happened in China with respect to lockdowns in the second quarter. That impacted demand and the supply chain in that part of the world significantly. And obviously it impacted us. And I think in the range of how we see the back half, a lot of that is what happens in China, across the board sort of in all of our markets for the part, other than optical. And I would say that there aren't any significant changes. Other than that, the one thing I'd add is in auto, in general, we were expecting a higher auto market at the beginning of the year, both in China, but in totality. And I think our view of that market is that it's still constrained. We think end market demand is there, but the industry is constrained and therefore, our expectations are a little lower than maybe they were a quarter ago.\nJosh Spector: Okay, thank you.\nEd Schlesinger: And I'd say all the mega \u2013 the trends, the big secular trends that we are behind and we're investing up for as well as sort of the more Corning strategy that looks to us like it is holding up quite well, even in these sort of challenging macro environment. And we would expect that to continue. There's other little things that are moving around in our range that have to do with our ability to bring up capacity. Optical, we're running maybe about a quarter behind on some of the capacity that we would've thought, we would've had available to sell this year. And that's now that growth will now push into next year. There's a lot of puts and takes, but in total, we are feeling quite good about where we placed our bets and the efficacy of our content driven strategy.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. And your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Now, want to go back to the display and want to get your thoughts on your customers ability to produce panel, especially since panel process are the cash cost. Why shouldn't the glass market enable lower costs and improve affordability by lowering key material costs like glass. Unless you tell me that the market is not elastic, any thoughts here would be great. And I have a follow up.\nWendell Weeks: Well, it's a good question. Our main contribution to panel makers cost structure is the ability of our innovations to dramatically lower the overall production cost of panel making. For instance, a Gen 10.5 facility can manufacture panels roughly at a 30% lower cost for large size TVs than the Gen 8.5 that preceded it. And so for us to deliver those type of innovations also requires us to invest and we require a return on that investment. So we believe glass is already a great buy for our customers. And the best way that we can help them be successful is to continue to be very reliable suppliers and continue to innovate and help the fact that they add way more cost downstream of us than the cost that re-represented their total. And as we can improve their productivity, life gets better for them. Price elasticity wise, panel prices are already plenty low and we would expect that to help flow in to television set manufacturers and that to in turn help activate end consumers who are quite sensitive to pricing, but nothing we can do is going to make a significant Delta in that overall market price elasticity, sir.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you. Thanks for detail. And just quick follow-up on cash flow inventories are up Q-o-Q and year-over-year. Should I assume that that 110 days of inventory would trend down into the second half of the calendar year?\nEd Schlesinger: Yes. Hi Mehdi, I think a couple things to think about. First, it's a difficult supply chain environment. We want to make sure we can supply our customers. So we probably have a little more inventory than we might otherwise have. That will eventually go back to normal, hard to call the timing on that. I think the second thing is, if you think about the inflationary impacts, we see and we talk about them mostly in the context of our P&L, they also sit in inventory, right. So you have higher raw material costs and higher costs to produce. And so some of the higher balance sheet, you see, the higher dollars is related to inflation as well. Now that gets passed along in the form of price. So the profitability is the same, but you're carrying a little bit more of that on your balance sheet.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Martin Yang from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nMartin Yang: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So can you maybe give us a bit more insight into specialty materials, especially the part excluding advanced semiconductor material. Have you observed more of a consistent increase of mix either for new products or exposure to premier customers in the past two years for specialty materials?\nWendell Weeks: Yes. I think you correctly identified the dynamic, Martin. It is sort of our content-driven strategy has been in mobile consumer electronics like a number of our markets is not just account on people buying more stuff, buying more phones, but to put more Corning content into the smart devices that people already buy. And so each of those new innovations tends to have more value to it and therefore add to our content. And that's why despite flat to down smartphone market, we've grown our revenues some 40% or more is it's basically that content strategy.\nMartin Yang: Got it. I think there are a couple products in the past. We can sort of point to, to support this view, but in a, let's say looking into next two years, do you see a, more of a regular schedule release of new products that will carry on the trend?\nWendell Weeks: We \u2013 yes, we have new innovations that we have lined up that we\u2019re seeing a good strong interest in and adoption of. So, yes, we continue to see that strategy be able to play out successfully in the years to come. Now at the same time, all of that innovation, all of that new technology adoption does happen in a broader macroeconomic context, right? So how that will impact our customers launch plans and the like. I think would remain to be seen. But the fundamental structure of the strategy is in place.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Mr. Niknam, your line is now open please make sure you\u2019re not on mute.\nMatt Niknam: Hi. Sorry, I had the same cut out of my name when you were calling it out. Thanks for taking the question. So in the past, you\u2019ve talked about 6% to 8% growth CAGR between 2020 and 2023. And I think Ed, you may have mentioned it\u2019s somewhat relevant still at a recent industry conference. So I\u2019m just curious in light of recent macro events, any updates you can share and maybe more broadly any expectations on when we could see an updated long-term guide? And then just a quick follow-up in terms of operating leverage. I think last quarter you talked about EPS growth, maybe outpacing top line by a bit. It looks like we\u2019re maybe lacking some of that operating leverage. I\u2019m wondering is that entirely just display trends or anything else maybe to consider in terms of that mix shift on the margin side? Thanks.\nEd Schlesinger: Yes. Thanks for the questions. So, on the sales side, I think we gave you our guide for the year and we\u2019re in that zone. And we\u2019re not going to give new long-term guidance right now, primarily just because of all the challenges we articulated on the call. It\u2019s a very dynamic external environment. At some point we\u2019ll certainly update you about 2023 and perhaps longer-term. But I think the \u2013 as Wendell said earlier, the secular growth trends are all intact and we feel really good about them over the long-term, despite sort of this current challenging environment. And then on the operating leverage side, I think the primary driver for sure this year is what\u2019s happening in display. Volume going down, panel maker utilization going down the market going down and our volume following is just a significant impact on our profitability. So that\u2019s the real primary driver on the earnings per share side this year.\nMatt Niknam: And for gross margin, I know in the past, you had talked about 1Q being the trough. Is that still the case as you get the benefit of positive pricing actions going forward?\nEd Schlesinger: Yes. You\u2019re right. We did say that and we still, for sure, believe the first quarter was the trough. As you saw in our results, we stepped up about 1 point in the second quarter. That\u2019s really all about the pricing actions we had talked about. We feel great about those actions. And although the inflationary environment is still with us, we\u2019ll continue to raise price. And so over a period of time, that should be a favorable tailwind to margins. I would just caution that it will be a slow march in this environment.\nMatt Niknam: Perfect. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Great. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Asiya Merchant from Citi. Your line is open.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for the question. Apologize if it\u2019s been asked before as I was switching between a couple of calls. Just on the optical side, anything you can share about the demand that you\u2019re seeing from the hyperscalers versus the telco operators. We\u2019ve been hearing some rumblings about hyperscalers stepping down some CapEx investments. And so if you can share any color on that that would be great. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: So we continue to see demand from both. Without doubt carrier demand has been highly stimulated by everything that\u2019s going on with both public policy as well as them having to catch up to sort of everything that happened in the pandemic. As we went into the pandemic, actually they lowered their CapEx spend maybe by about two-thirds for both safety and just cash preservation terms, all while during the pandemic demand sword with like broadband use up some 50%, cloud revenue up some 60%, 70%. And during that time period, both hyperscalers and carriers were pretty constrained. Now all of them build ahead of demand. They tend to want to have about 18 months of supply, at least in place to be able to take in the volatility of their customer\u2019s bandwidth demands. So we sort of went through that and we have to re-establish that. So in all of them, we have felt that sort of pull as well as they look ahead, they see strong growth. So in general, things are still flashing green. You\u2019re right, that will have certain of the hyperscalers at different times back off some of their stronger megawatt projections, but in all of them, we pretty much have a range on how many megawatts we think they can get in and which where we\u2019re aimed, if that makes sense to you.\nAsiya Merchant: Okay. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Great. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Timothy Long from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTimothy Long: Thank you. Just a two-parter back on optical comms if I can. One, could you talk a little bit about, you mentioned capacity increases and maybe being a little bit behind where you need to be. Could you just give us a timeline there were there some capacity increases that that helped Q2 and with cadence of kind of adding capacity to that business over the next few quarters? And then secondly, just on leverage there, last \u2013 we have seen some very good margin leverage on the higher sales. It\u2019s just one quarter, but sequentially kind of flat margins there with the higher ASPs. Is that something we can expect to see unfold over the next few quarters as that business continues to do well a little bit more operating leverage. Thank you.\nEd Schlesinger: Yes. So thanks, Tim. So on capacity, we\u2019ve been talking about adding capacity it\u2019s fiber and cable capacity primarily this year. We have a little bit coming on in the third quarter and a little more in the fourth quarter. And as you heard Wendell say, we\u2019re a little behind, probably a quarter or so relative to what we thought, maybe three, six months ago, so some of that capacity will help us more in the first half of 2023 versus in 2022. We did have a really strong quarter and we sell a mix of products and on the connectivity side where we have capacity that helped our quarter significantly in the second quarter. And I think on the operating leverage, you\u2019re exactly right. Optical happens to be one of the businesses that has had a lot of inflation. We have raised prices successfully there and that has helped us kind of normalize our margins and slowly march them up there as well. And I think you can continue \u2013 you should continue to expect to see that, but again, just caution that it will be a slow march up in this environment.\nTimothy Long: Okay. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: We got time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our final question from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe to your guys\u2019 comment at the end that you would be evaluating macro for any change in build plans. Just wanted to kind of verify, like, have you guys changed any build plans yet for 2022, even if that\u2019s kind of moving within segments. And then maybe on the second question, you guys noted kind of a couple times labor being the gating item for kind of further optical business or rollouts. Just wanting to get a sense of, even when it comes to cloud, are there \u2013 is it really just still labor or are there other elements of the supply chain that need to kind of come into place to get further build activity there? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Let me take the first one. And then we\u2019ll go into the more detailed second one. So in the first one, I wouldn\u2019t characterize that we\u2019ve been holding back on our investments due to the macro. What we are doing is making sure first at the operating level, like for instance, in display. We\u2019re taking the opportunity to take our tanks down for repair and putting in new technology packages. And we just simply won\u2019t restart them until such times, as we have really nice clarity on our customer\u2019s demand. And in that way we\u2019ll keep supply and demand in balance. And we have similar things like that as we can feather one way or the other. In opto, if you\u2019re aimed at that in opto, in connectivity, we have now brought it because when we think about opto, you need fiber, you need cable and you need connectivity to build these passive optical networks. And in connectivity, we successfully brought up enough capacity in the first half, so that we feel pretty good about our ability to meet customer\u2019s ramps there that we see. In fiber and cable, if we could make more, we could sell more. And it was just that the way the supply chains work, construction work, we\u2019re just going a little bit behind where we would like to be on some of our ramps and we\u2019ll pick those up next year. In every case where we do a significant investment, we have committed demand from a customer and we ask some substantial financial commitment from them. So we would expect to continue to build with them to the extent that they offer that type of commitment and therefore an appropriate sharing of risk with our shareholders. So that\u2019s sort of in macro. And then to your specific question, I would say, without question labor remains the top issue for installations, whether it\u2019s in hypers or it\u2019s in carriers. That remains one of the more tightly \u2013 one of the tightest pieces on the critical path. At the same time, you\u2019re quite right to point out that you move in this economic situation in this sort of odd moment, we all find ourselves in. You move from one bottleneck to another to another. So I\u2019m quite sure you\u2019re right, if we were able to resolve labor, there\u2019d be something else.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Appreciate the answer.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Meta. Thanks, Wendell. And I want to thank you all for joining us this morning. Before we close, I\u2019ll let you know that we\u2019re going to attend Citi\u2019s Global Technology Conference on September 8th and Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference on September 13th. Additionally, we\u2019ll be hosting some visits with investors in select cities over the quarter. A web replay of today\u2019s call will be available on our site starting later this morning. Thanks everybody for joining us. Operator that concludes our call. Please disconnect all lines.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Ed Schlesinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to preface my remarks today with three key takeaways on the quarter. We're executing well and successfully navigating the current environment. We're driving top line growth, improved profitability and strong cash flow with high single digit year-over-year sales and EPS growth. And we're employing a highly disciplined approach toward investing for the long-term. With that said, let's walk through the details on the quarter. Total company sales reached nearly $3.8 billion, growing 7% year-over-year, highlights included sales growth of more than 20% in optical and strong growth in solar. We met our goal of improving gross margin and operating margin, sequentially driven by previously announced pricing actions across the organization. Gross margin grew 90 basis points and operating margin grew 120 basis points. Net income was $489 million, up 7% year-over-year and EPS was $0.57, which represents an 8% increase year-over-year. We generated $440 million of free cash flow in the quarter, keeping the company on pace for another year of strong cash generation and we invested $353 million in CapEx. I'd also like to comment on the impact of currency. We have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect cash flow, enhanced our ability to invest and provide shareholder returns. Our largest exposure is to the end, which has been weakening. We have most of next year hedged and we expect our core rate to remain the same in 2023. We're pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received more than $2 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception. Overall, I'm pleased with the operational rigor our teams displayed during the quarter. We successfully raised prices to more appropriately share the impact of higher inflation with our customers. We successfully navigated extended COVID-19 lockdowns in China, a sharp correction in panel maker utilization in the display market, lower demand for smartphones and an additional temporary step down in China automotive production. And we're capitalizing on our market leadership and strong secular growth in optical and solar. Second quarter results reflect the benefits of our focused and cohesive portfolio, particularly the balance it provides. Now let's go through the segments. In Optical Communications, sales grew 22% year-over-year, reaching $1.3 billion for the second quarter. Year-over-year sales growth was driven by 5G, broadband, and the cloud. Net income was $182 million, up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong volume and price increases. We believe we're in the early phases of a multi-year build cycle across multiple segments in the passive optical market. We're responding to this demand by ramping up production and opening new facilities as always we de-risk these investments by requiring meaningful commitments from customers often including funding before beginning construction. In the second quarter, Display Technologies sales were $878 million, down 8% sequentially. Panel makers have been reducing their utilization rates for the last few quarters. In June, we saw a significant decline in panel maker production versus April and May. And our volume declined in line with this change and the market. Importantly, glass price was up slightly sequentially. This coupled with solid execution resulted in net income declining 3% sequentially, less than half the sales decline. In the third quarter, we expect June's low panel maker production levels to continue, and our volume to decline in line with the market and lower average utilization resulting in our glass volume down mid teens sequentially. We expect third quarter glass price to be consistent with the second quarter. The factors we use to assess the pricing environment in the display glass market continue to support a favorable pricing environment. First is glass supply demand balance. Currently, glass makers are taking tanks offline for maintenance and repairs after an extended period of glass tightness. We are actively managing tank repairs and restarts to align our supply to demand. These actions result in lower glass capacity in the market. Additionally, after running flat out for so long, we need to replenish our inventory toward optimal levels to reduce excess logistics costs. And lastly, glass maker profitability also supports favorable pricing. In this inflationary environment it is challenging for glass makers who have high fixed costs to maintain profitability during periods of low volume. Additionally, our customers depend on us for our market leading supply reliability, enabling us to build on our strong competitive position. So overall, we feel good about our execution against our goal to stabilize returns in Display. The pricing environment is stable. We have maintained our pricing and when volume returns, our sales and profitability will improve. In Specialty Materials, sales were consistent with a strong second quarter 2021. Net income was $91 million, up 12% year-over-year. We achieved these results despite the smartphone and IT markets being down. Our more Corning approach, product leadership and ongoing collaboration with industry leaders are enabling our outperformance in this market. Specifically, we maintained revenue and profitability driven by the adoption of our premium cover materials. We also continue to benefit from the strength of the semiconductor equipment industry. In fact, we expect to see continued investments in the industry to meet rapidly growing demand and to support increased stability in the supply chain to ensure we are prepared to capture growth. We just announced an expansion of our advanced optics operations in New York state. And as Wendell mentioned, we expect Specialty Materials sales growth in the back half driven by customer product launches. In Environmental Technologies, second quarter auto production experienced constraints due to prolonged chip shortages, the Russia-Ukraine war, and COVID-19 lockdowns in China. As a result, second quarter sales were $356 million, down 13% both sequentially and year-over-year. In the automotive industry, this will be the third year in a row production has been unable to meet end market demand. Since 2019, auto markets have declined around 16%. In contrast, we have outperformed the market and our sales were up about 5% over the same period. We're pursuing content opportunities that generate sales beyond end market demand such as additional adoption of GPS in new regions. We expect an uptick in sales in the third quarter driven primarily by a resumption of auto production in China following COVID lockdowns. We remain prepared to serve demand globally as supply constraints ease and auto production increases. In Life Sciences, sales of $312 million remain consistent year-over-year and sequentially and net income of $37 million was down. Lower demand for COVID related products was offset by growth in research and bioproduction products. Additionally, COVID lockdowns in China impacted sales and profitability. Looking ahead, we expect to see continued growth in research and bioproduction, and we're well positioned to meet that demand with recent capacity investments designed to improve efficiency and enable us to better support global customers. Finally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses, sales reached $418 million, a 45% increase year-over-year, and an 11% increase sequentially. This strong performance was largely driven by our production ramp to meet new long-term solar take-or-pay contracts. During the quarter, Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies also contributed to strong sales as we saw continued adoption of our pharmaceutical packaging solutions for critical drugs. And Automotive Glass Solutions delivered year-over-year growth as well. During the quarter, Continental recognized the business as one of its \u201cSuppliers of the Year\u201d for our AutoGrade Corning Gorilla Glass technology, another proof point on our progress toward a $100 per car opportunity. In sum, the multiple growth drivers and our market leadership across our portfolio create an inherent resiliency that enables us to consistently outperform our markets. Now turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect sales roughly consistent with the second quarter in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.85 billion. We expect continued strong sales in Optical Communications, Hemlock's solar products, and Specialty Materials to offset lower display volume, which is expected to be down mid-teens from the second quarter as I noted earlier. We expect EPS in the range of $0.51 to $0.55 for the third quarter. While we expect the benefits of our pricing actions to continue the lower volume in display will impact profitability. Our most likely outcome for the full year is to slightly exceed $15 billion in sales as we shared with you in April. We now expect sales to be up 6% to 8%, and we expect to grow EPS in line with sales. Our guidance factors in a range of probabilities for the market challenges that we've outlined this morning. As I wrap up my remarks today, I'll end by saying, we're very pleased with the results of the quarter and the first half of the year. We're growing profitably. And we remain highly disciplined in our approach to investment decisions, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and delivering solid free cash flow. This gives us the ability and flexibility to address evolving market conditions. We're also expanding capacity to support committed customer demand all while carefully monitoring the external environment to pace appropriately. We're confident in the many levers at our disposal to manage through any environment and come out the other side stronger, while advancing our long-term growth initiatives. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A. And I'll take your second question, Wamsi on Specialty Materials. So couple things, one, first I think, we're performing well in this segment, right? The market is down and we're flattish. It's a great more Corning story for us. So we're outperforming the market there. And then secondly, I think on the profitability side, it's primarily about the continued adoption of our new cover materials and us adding content into the market. That's really what's driving the profitability relative to the flat sales. Just add some there, Rod, I think your instincts are right, that you have a bold case for solar. What makes us really insist on committed demand from our customers and to make sure that that our customers are taking on more of the risk under their shareholders than ours would take is because geopolitics also plays a role. So energy always has geopolitics play a role and solar is no different and so given that, is why we want to make sure that if we add \u2013 if we bring on more capacity that our shareholders basically are getting a nice free shot on goal. And I'd say all the mega \u2013 the trends, the big secular trends that we are behind and we're investing up for as well as sort of the more Corning strategy that looks to us like it is holding up quite well, even in these sort of challenging macro environment. And we would expect that to continue. There's other little things that are moving around in our range that have to do with our ability to bring up capacity. Optical, we're running maybe about a quarter behind on some of the capacity that we would've thought, we would've had available to sell this year. And that's now that growth will now push into next year. There's a lot of puts and takes, but in total, we are feeling quite good about where we placed our bets and the efficacy of our content driven strategy. Yes. Hi Mehdi, I think a couple things to think about. First, it's a difficult supply chain environment. We want to make sure we can supply our customers. So we probably have a little more inventory than we might otherwise have. That will eventually go back to normal, hard to call the timing on that. I think the second thing is, if you think about the inflationary impacts, we see and we talk about them mostly in the context of our P&L, they also sit in inventory, right. So you have higher raw material costs and higher costs to produce. And so some of the higher balance sheet, you see, the higher dollars is related to inflation as well. Now that gets passed along in the form of price. So the profitability is the same, but you're carrying a little bit more of that on your balance sheet. Yes. Thanks for the questions. So, on the sales side, I think we gave you our guide for the year and we're in that zone. And we're not going to give new long-term guidance right now, primarily just because of all the challenges we articulated on the call. It's a very dynamic external environment. At some point we'll certainly update you about 2023 and perhaps longer-term. But I think the \u2013 as Wendell said earlier, the secular growth trends are all intact and we feel really good about them over the long-term, despite sort of this current challenging environment. And then on the operating leverage side, I think the primary driver for sure this year is what's happening in display. Volume going down, panel maker utilization going down the market going down and our volume following is just a significant impact on our profitability. So that's the real primary driver on the earnings per share side this year. Yes. You're right. We did say that and we still, for sure, believe the first quarter was the trough. As you saw in our results, we stepped up about 1 point in the second quarter. That's really all about the pricing actions we had talked about. We feel great about those actions. And although the inflationary environment is still with us, we'll continue to raise price. And so over a period of time, that should be a favorable tailwind to margins. I would just caution that it will be a slow march in this environment. Yes. So thanks, Tim. So on capacity, we've been talking about adding capacity it's fiber and cable capacity primarily this year. We have a little bit coming on in the third quarter and a little more in the fourth quarter. And as you heard Wendell say, we're a little behind, probably a quarter or so relative to what we thought, maybe three, six months ago, so some of that capacity will help us more in the first half of 2023 versus in 2022. We did have a really strong quarter and we sell a mix of products and on the connectivity side where we have capacity that helped our quarter significantly in the second quarter. And I think on the operating leverage, you're exactly right. Optical happens to be one of the businesses that has had a lot of inflation. We have raised prices successfully there and that has helped us kind of normalize our margins and slowly march them up there as well. And I think you can continue \u2013 you should continue to expect to see that, but again, just caution that it will be a slow march up in this environment."

            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced strong second quarter results. We captured additional content opportunities across our markets, despite an extremely challenging external environment. And we delivered on growing demand in optical and solar. Sales were $3.8 billion, up 7% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.57, up 8% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $440 million and total first half free cash flow was $611 million. Gross margin and operating margin expanded 90 basis points and 120 basis points respectively from the first quarter 2022 levels. Now our improved profitability was primarily driven by the benefits of pricing actions that we took to more appropriately share the impact of inflation with our customers. In total, we delivered in line with our expectations, even though dynamics in three of our largest markets played out at the lower end of our assumptions. In the last month of the quarter, panel maker utilization rates declined to the lowest levels since the first quarter of 2009, when we were at the height of the financial crisis. Auto production continued significantly below normal with virtually no cars sold in Shanghai in April, due to COVID-19 restrictions and with European new car registrations for June at the lowest levels since 1996. In the second quarter, smartphone sales declined 11% year-over-year, primarily stemming from COVID lockdowns in China. In the face of these industry dynamics, we delivered outstanding results, in line with our guidance. We did what we said we were going to do including continued growth and improved profitability. We view the resilience we've demonstrated as a strong proof point that our strategy is working. In the third quarter, we expect the challenges in these three markets to continue. At the same time, we expect an ongoing benefit from secular trends in optical and solar. Both factors are reflected in our guidance. We now expect third quarter sales to be roughly consistent sequentially and to grow year-over-year. We expect full year sales to slightly exceed $15 billion and to grow in a range of 6% to 8%. Now, Ed will elaborate more in just a moment. Now with that in mind, I want to expand on our path to $15 billion and look at the dynamics playing out in four critical market: display, optical communications, solar, and mobile consumer electronics. And I'll address what we're experiencing, how it is reflected in our financials and how we're driving our performance. Let's start with display. We are executing well against our strategy. We had been updating you on the panel maker utilization correction for a year now. Panel makers accelerated reductions in the second quarter. The sharpest reduction was in June and our volume declined in line with panel maker utilization and the market. We expect June's low production level to continue throughout the entire third quarter and our volume to, again, decline in line with the market. Our guidance reflects our view of panel makers' second half production. And we expect our second half volume to be lower than the first half. At the same time, we have always said, we expect to maintain price stability through this correction. That is exactly what happened in the second quarter, as expected, price was up sequentially. And we expect third quarter price to be consistent with the second quarter. As panel makers lower utilization, we are seeing glass makers idle their tanks to perform maintenance and repairs and thereby lower capacity. We are managing our own tank repairs and restarts to align our supply to demand after running flat out for a very, very long time. As a result, we expect glass supply and demand to remain in balance. We feel good about our execution and strategy in display, as we continue to operate from a position of strength. We are the industry leader with a global manufacturing footprint, cost advantages, distinctive capabilities and leadership in Gen 10.5, where we are well positioned to capture long-term growth in large size TVs. Let's move to optical communications, which was the largest contributor to our second quarter growth. We believe the industry is at the beginning of a large multi-year wave of growth for passive optical networks. And we're well positioned to capture that growth. We're pursuing three significant secular trends: broadband, 5G, and the cloud. We've got major innovation programs underway for each category and we're seeing robust traction with our customers. Momentum continues to build in this business and you can see this in our financials. Second quarter sales grew 10% sequentially, faster than we expected and 22% year-over-year to reach $1.3 billion and we expect to grow year-over-year again in the third quarter and even faster than the market for the full year due to growing demand for our innovations. Take, for example, our edge pre-engineered systems for cloud operators. Now this product had its biggest quarter to-date in the second quarter. These solutions much like FlexNAP for broadband provide customers with a simpler greener solution to minimize the number of cables, cable trays and hardware needed. The simple value prop is speed. We're helping get capacity installed much faster, eliminating labor bottlenecks in the industry. Our innovative manufacturing process, which completes splicing at a fraction of the cost and at much higher quality, dramatically reduces on site labor. So we're accelerating our customer's ability to scale their networks and build cloud capacity all while driving more Corning solutions into the market. Our visibility and confidence in the adoption of edge products is high because network planning decisions happen well ahead of deployment and we are winning now. Turning to solar. The renewable energy industry is evolving rapidly and our ongoing growth suggests that the market's behavior is more closely tied to a global imperative than simply current economic trends. We recently re-energized our participation in the solar market by turning on idle capacity and securing customer commitments through new long-term take or pay contracts for solar grade polysilicon. In the quarter, sales grew significantly, which is reflected in our top line growth. Looking ahead, we believe that Corning's broader technical and manufacturing capabilities our three and our four, will prove highly relevant in helping advance the industry. We expect year-over-year growth to continue in the second half and we see excellent growth potential in this business. In mobile consumer electronics, smartphone and IT retail unit sales were down. However, we're outperforming in this market through our more Corning approach, product leadership and ongoing collaboration with true industry leaders. The benefits of our strategy are evident in our results. Specialty material sales were consistent with a strong second quarter of 2021 and net income grew 12% year-over-year. We expect to deliver growth in the back half in this down market as customers adopt our innovations for their product launches. Overall, Corning is executing very well commercially and technically. Despite all the temporary macro challenges, we delivered a solid quarter. We've added more than $700 million in sales in the first half, reflecting an increase of more than 10% year-over-year. And EPS has grown even faster, up 14% in the same time period from $0.97 to $1.11. So you can see that strong secular growth in optical and solar and our more Corning approach is offsetting weakness in the display, automotive and mobile consumer electronics markets. We expect to continue performing well in a challenging environment to close out another strong year. Our cohesive and focus portfolio provides us with a strategic resilience that is playing out well in the current environment and will serve us well in the future. Stepping back, we've been leading in the automotive and life science markets for 100 years, display for 80 years, telecommunications for 50 and mobile consumer electronics since the inception of smart devices. The basis of our ongoing successes are distinctive set of capabilities and long track record of life changing and life saving inventions. Now this is particularly important in times like the present. We've made great progress, building a more balanced and resilient company. We are structured to and focused on outperforming our markets consistently. Corning's deep relevance to secular trends, along with our ability to drive more content into our markets over time will enable us to maintain our strength through this economic downturn and emerge stronger on the other side. As we look to both the immediate future and longer-term, we're confident that our investments and our focused and cohesive portfolio together with our financial discipline will help us drive durable, profitable multi-year growth. In fact, our R&D engine has never been stronger. And a new generation of distinguished leaders has stepped up to drive us through our next exciting period of transformation. This quarter, we appointed Dr. Jaymin Amin as our Chief Technology Officer. A 25 year Corning veteran Jaymin has worked with some of the company's most influential and innovative customers on ground breaking advancements, including his work launching and commercializing Gorilla Glass. Jaymin's leadership, technical expertise and experience with Corning scientific capabilities will help take us to the next level of innovation. I'd also like to thank David Morse. I deeply appreciate his leadership and contributions over the years as one of our most accomplished technology leaders. He received his PhD from MIT when he was only 23 years old and he retired last month after nearly 50 years with the company. David has created a strong foundation that Jaymin will continue to build on, adding to my confidence that Corning's greatest contributions are yet to come. Now, let me turn the call over to Ed, who will share more details on our results, financial priorities and outlook. Thanks for the question, Steve. Yes, we've seen all those comments and of course we talk directly to leadership of all of our major carrier customers. Here's what we're hearing. And then let's just step back and talk about just what the some of the other macro forces are behind it. So what we're hearing from them is their investment in fiber optics is their top strategic priority. And so that even as they take a look at what they can do with different elements of their capital spending plans and their investment plans that they're prioritizing their investment in our product sets. And they're actually asking us to commit to supply more into next year and beyond. So we're in the midst of that type of discussion with our customers. So a little early to tell exactly where that all will turn out, but will be public as that gets a little bit closer. So I would say right now all of our demand signals continue to be quite robust and if we could make more fiber and cable, we could sell more fiber and cable, and we're seeing continued strong demand as we look into next year or so. Did that answer your question, Steven? In cloud, they continue to see pretty strong revenue performance in cloud, as I'm sure you have seen. And in general, the pandemic put some of those major infrastructure programs a little bit behind where they would like them. So we're continuing to see demand there. That's very robust. The main thing that's providing any volatility in our cloud based demand tends to be their ability to actually get their installations done on time to actually get all the labor that they need to actually get the construction going. And it also plays very nicely into some of our new innovations that use tremendously less labor. And so that's one of the reasons we're seeing strong take up of our new innovations in cloud. So although cloud is \u2013 will always go with sort of how can they run their construction projects. Overall, we're seeing nothing but a strong demand signal out of our customers there. On Display, as you would've heard in our opening, we are \u2013 we expect our volume to be in line with where panel makers are taking their utilization and down some 15% in quarter three. As we take a look at retail what we'd say is we'd expect TV units to probably be down this year now, especially given what has happened with the China shutdowns. But it could be flat. And I think it's just too early for us to talk about next year. This is a pretty significant correction that we're working our way through and the real critical spot for us is we want to be able to continue to execute our strategy and have that our price be stable, have our market position stay stable. And then we'll be there for as television unit demand and panel maker utilization comes up, we'll see our profitability climb in line. Thanks, Samik. So I think maybe stepping back a little bit on the guide, if I think about both the third quarter and the full year, what we've tried to do is reflect the highest probability range that we can for sort of all the dynamics we're seeing across all of our markets. And as we talked about in Display, it's \u2013 there was a pretty sharp correction down in June. We're expecting that to continue into the third quarter, but we have a range of how we see that playing out. And then the same thing holds true related to demand in China, which obviously impacts automotive in the back half of the year. It'll impact potentially smartphones and maybe even Life Sciences, right? So if you think about our guide, there's a high end and a low end and sort of our view of a most probable outcome. And so, yes, we're expecting the fourth quarter to probably be a little bit better than the third quarter, depending on where you pick within that range we've given you for the third quarter and it's certainly possible if sort of things play out as they normally do. You would see an uptick in Display. That's definitely in the range of probabilities in terms of how we've thought about it. Rod, I would agree with your observation and concerned insightful observation that the more premium end is doing better than the low end and the largest deterioration has been in that piece of the market. We think that relative outperformance will be there, but we don't like in our guide, we're not reflecting a belief that it's just going to be bimodal, right. We think everybody's going to get impacted and it's a timing question. But you'll still have relative outperformance in the premium end and that's the way we look at it. Is that the question you were asking Rod? [Ph] Yes. We're seeing the impact of that being below where we would've thought it would be really driven, I think primarily by this combination of China shutdowns and inflation. So it's below what we would have normally expected it to be, but it is, we are still seeing outperformance run. Yes. Thanks Rod. So on solar, I think the way to think about it is through the year, last year and into sort of the second quarter of this year, we continued to ramp our solar sales. We were originally selling out of inventory and we sort of sold all that out and then we started production back up in the fourth quarter. And so it has become a greater part of the sales in Hemlock and Emerging Growth segment. In addition to that, what I would say is, we are getting to be capacity constrained. I mean, we're selling for the most part, what we can make, we'll get a little better at making and we'll have a little more capacity in the back half and as we go into 2023, but not a lot of capacity. And I think the important thing to think [Technical Difficulty] make we'll get a little better at making and we'll have a little more capacity in the back half and as we go into 2023, but not a lot of capacity. And I think the important thing to think about is, we've signed customers up for multi-year take or pay contracts to essentially sell out that capacity. So we feel really good about that demand and our ability to supply it. We have more capacity that we could turn on. It would be a decision we'd have to make based on the dynamics in the market and our ability to continue to get customers to take that volume either by giving us cash or signing up for long-term commitments. [Technical Difficulty] to supply it, we have more capacity that we could turn on. It would be a decision we'd have to make based on the dynamics in the market and our ability to continue to get customers to take that volume either by giving us cash or signing up for long-term commitments. Yes, I think the good \u2013 the demand is high. I do agree. I think we're cautious in this space and we want to make sure that we've got good commitment for any additional demand that we would turn on. We'll update you as that plays itself out in the back half of this year and into 2023. Yes. I would say, the biggest change probably going back a quarter is what happened in China with respect to lockdowns in the second quarter. That impacted demand and the supply chain in that part of the world significantly. And obviously it impacted us. And I think in the range of how we see the back half, a lot of that is what happens in China, across the board sort of in all of our markets for the part, other than optical. And I would say that there aren't any significant changes. Other than that, the one thing I'd add is in auto, in general, we were expecting a higher auto market at the beginning of the year, both in China, but in totality. And I think our view of that market is that it's still constrained. We think end market demand is there, but the industry is constrained and therefore, our expectations are a little lower than maybe they were a quarter ago. Well, it's a good question. Our main contribution to panel makers cost structure is the ability of our innovations to dramatically lower the overall production cost of panel making. For instance, a Gen 10.5 facility can manufacture panels roughly at a 30% lower cost for large size TVs than the Gen 8.5 that preceded it. And so for us to deliver those type of innovations also requires us to invest and we require a return on that investment. So we believe glass is already a great buy for our customers. And the best way that we can help them be successful is to continue to be very reliable suppliers and continue to innovate and help the fact that they add way more cost downstream of us than the cost that re-represented their total. And as we can improve their productivity, life gets better for them. Price elasticity wise, panel prices are already plenty low and we would expect that to help flow in to television set manufacturers and that to in turn help activate end consumers who are quite sensitive to pricing, but nothing we can do is going to make a significant Delta in that overall market price elasticity, sir. Yes. I think you correctly identified the dynamic, Martin. It is sort of our content-driven strategy has been in mobile consumer electronics like a number of our markets is not just account on people buying more stuff, buying more phones, but to put more Corning content into the smart devices that people already buy. And so each of those new innovations tends to have more value to it and therefore add to our content. And that's why despite flat to down smartphone market, we've grown our revenues some 40% or more is it's basically that content strategy. We \u2013 yes, we have new innovations that we have lined up that we're seeing a good strong interest in and adoption of. So, yes, we continue to see that strategy be able to play out successfully in the years to come. Now at the same time, all of that innovation, all of that new technology adoption does happen in a broader macroeconomic context, right? So how that will impact our customers launch plans and the like. I think would remain to be seen. But the fundamental structure of the strategy is in place. So we continue to see demand from both. Without doubt carrier demand has been highly stimulated by everything that's going on with both public policy as well as them having to catch up to sort of everything that happened in the pandemic. As we went into the pandemic, actually they lowered their CapEx spend maybe by about two-thirds for both safety and just cash preservation terms, all while during the pandemic demand sword with like broadband use up some 50%, cloud revenue up some 60%, 70%. And during that time period, both hyperscalers and carriers were pretty constrained. Now all of them build ahead of demand. They tend to want to have about 18 months of supply, at least in place to be able to take in the volatility of their customer's bandwidth demands. So we sort of went through that and we have to re-establish that. So in all of them, we have felt that sort of pull as well as they look ahead, they see strong growth. So in general, things are still flashing green. You're right, that will have certain of the hyperscalers at different times back off some of their stronger megawatt projections, but in all of them, we pretty much have a range on how many megawatts we think they can get in and which where we're aimed, if that makes sense to you. Let me take the first one. And then we'll go into the more detailed second one. So in the first one, I wouldn't characterize that we've been holding back on our investments due to the macro. What we are doing is making sure first at the operating level, like for instance, in display. We're taking the opportunity to take our tanks down for repair and putting in new technology packages. And we just simply won't restart them until such times, as we have really nice clarity on our customer's demand. And in that way we'll keep supply and demand in balance. And we have similar things like that as we can feather one way or the other. In opto, if you're aimed at that in opto, in connectivity, we have now brought it because when we think about opto, you need fiber, you need cable and you need connectivity to build these passive optical networks. And in connectivity, we successfully brought up enough capacity in the first half, so that we feel pretty good about our ability to meet customer's ramps there that we see. In fiber and cable, if we could make more, we could sell more. And it was just that the way the supply chains work, construction work, we're just going a little bit behind where we would like to be on some of our ramps and we'll pick those up next year. In every case where we do a significant investment, we have committed demand from a customer and we ask some substantial financial commitment from them. So we would expect to continue to build with them to the extent that they offer that type of commitment and therefore an appropriate sharing of risk with our shareholders. So that's sort of in macro. And then to your specific question, I would say, without question labor remains the top issue for installations, whether it's in hypers or it's in carriers. That remains one of the more tightly \u2013 one of the tightest pieces on the critical path. At the same time, you're quite right to point out that you move in this economic situation in this sort of odd moment, we all find ourselves in. You move from one bottleneck to another to another. So I'm quite sure you're right, if we were able to resolve labor, there'd be something else."

[Operator Instructions] It is my pleasure to introduce you to Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, Katherine, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning\u2019s first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company\u2019s financial reports. You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments related to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the first quarter, the largest differences between our GAAP and core results stem from non-cash mark-to-market gains associated with the company\u2019s currency hedging contracts and non-cash impairment charges. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this increased GAAP earnings in the first quarter by $138 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using constant currency rates aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We are very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We have received more than $1.9 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception almost 10 years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They are also available on our website for downloading. And now, I will turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. We're off to an outstanding start in 2022 with strong first quarter sales and improved profitability. Sales grew 15% over the first quarter of 2021 to $3.7 billion. EPS increased 20% year-over-year to $0.54. Free cash flow was $171 million. We saw broad based strength across our businesses, and we effectively navigated a complex geopolitical and external operating environment. Gross margin of 36.6% and operating margin of 17.6%, both expanded sequentially and year-over-year. The improvements were primarily driven by benefits of pricing actions across all our businesses. Historically, prices are usually down in the first quarter. However, as I told you last quarter, we negotiated with customers to increase prices in our long-term contracts to share increased costs more appropriately. And therefore, this year, price in total was up both sequentially and year-over-year. We expect price to be up again in the second quarter. Specifically in display, we achieved a slight price increase in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we expect price to be up slightly sequentially, and glass supply and demand to remain tight. You'll hear more from Ed on the display market and our outlook. Now, let's take a closer look at how we performed in each of our Market-Access Platforms. In Display, we continue to operate from a position of strength. We delivered 11% year-over-year sales and net income growth, driven by higher glass volume and slightly higher price. In Optical Communications, we grew sales 28% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, representing 32% of total sales. Optical Communications is our largest market access platform by sales, and we expect significant growth to continue. Operators are expanding their networks. The pace of datacenter construction is accelerating and fiber rich wireless deployments are underway. We continue to be energized by the momentum that is building in this business, and we're well-positioned to capture growth. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, specialty materials outperformed the market with year-over-year sales growth of 9%, driven by significant demand for our premium cover materials and advanced optics products. In automotive, our environmental technology sales declined year-over-year due to customer production constraints. However, we continue to outperform the market. Sales were up in our Automotive Glass business, and I'll talk more about that in a minute. In Life Sciences, we grew year-over-year, advanced key innovations for cell and gene therapy and expanded supply of glass vials and tubing. Based on the quarter and our expectation of continued strong demand, we are raising our sales expectations for the year to above $15 billion. Our results speak for themselves. We've been delivering consistent growth with more balanced contributions across the company. And you'll hear more about that from Ed in just a minute. So how do we do this? Our strong position stems from a complementary set of three core technologies, four proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms. We're leaders in each. We captured growth opportunities by combining, integrating and evolving these capabilities to help our customers drive their industries forward. And in so doing, we drive more Corning content into the products people are already buying. We typically spend the majority of our time discussing the results within our five segments. However, important growth opportunities for our more Corning strategy also reside in the segment we have historically referred to as other. To better reflect the significant contributions and potential of these initiatives, we've renamed it Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. This segment grew 38% year-over-year in the first quarter. So today, I'm going to spend some time talking about what's going on, and how it underscores our confidence that we will continue to deliver durable, multiyear profitable growth. Hemlock currently delivers most of the sales in the segment. Hemlock manufactures ultra-pure poly silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries. As a reminder, Corning owns 80.5% of Hemlock as a result of Hemlock's purchase of DuPont's ownership in the company in 2020. This was a great transaction for Corning. We didn't put any money into the transaction, and we gained an additional 40% interest in Hemlock's strong semiconductor business, that also has the upside potential reflected in the solar market. Recently, we secured multiyear take or pay commitments for solar, and we expect demand to grow. Additionally, as the renewable energy industry evolves, we believe that Corning's technical and manufacturing capabilities are three and four can provide significant benefits. We believe this business has excellent growth potential. The other two major contributors in this segment are Automotive Glass and Pharmaceutical Glass Packaging. And we're making good progress on these two large opportunities, and both are prime examples of our focused and cohesive portfolio in action. So, let's take a look at how we reapply and reuse our capabilities to drive ongoing value, starting with automotive glass. There's no denying it. The driving experience is rapidly evolving. Drivers want more connected and autonomous features. And the basis of competition is moving from the engine to the cabin. Automakers are responding to these trends. Car design is getting less analog and more digital, fewer buttons and more large screens with touch capability. Nearly universally, the solution is more glass. And as automakers address the opportunities and the challenges they face, they're looking for glass to provide both form and function. To meet their needs, we've reapplied our existing capabilities, expertise and experience in the automotive market. We started with a fusion draw asset that provide pristine flat glass in our Display and Mobile Consumer Electronics market access platforms. And we took insight from Gorilla Glass to create better, more sustainable products that offer superior economics and help our customers advance the transformation of their industry. Poll for our technical glass products is strongest in auto interiors. We've answered with auto grade Gorilla Glass. It provides our signature toughness and optics tailored for the automotive use case to bring the smartphone experience into the car. We've also developed and patented ColdForm technology. By removing heat from the glass shaping process, ColdForm improved yields, saves money, and ultimately delivers a better, more sustainable product at a lower cost than HotForm glass. It enables dashboard and console displays that follow the natural curves of the car's interior, protected by a single, thin piece of precision glass. Our customers can bend the glass to suit their design needs right at the end of their own display module assembly. Looking ahead, we continue to pursue multiple opportunities for our interior and exterior glass innovations. We've entered a new product category with our curved mirror solutions for head up displays, and we're providing Gorilla Glass to Jeep's iconic Wrangler, and Gladiator. We're also working on OLED lighting, and we're in the early stages of delivering glass solutions for the sensors that are critical for autonomous vehicles. What this all adds up to is an increasingly significant business created by applying our more Corning approach. Our Automotive Glass Solutions business is helping us capture $100 per car opportunity. We've already been awarded over a $1 billion of multiyear business across multiple manufacturers and numerous car makes and models. And we're confident in our growth trajectory as we continue to build on this exciting opportunity. Now let's look at another key emerging growth business. We drew on our glass science capabilities to develop a pharmaceutical packaging solution with both exceptional strength and enhanced chemical stability relative to incumbent porous silica vials. Porous silica glass is inherently prone to issues such as delamination. Shifting to aluminosilicate base eliminates this risk and optimizes vials for our ion exchange process. As with the auto example that I just shared, we applied our experience making tough damage resistant glass to the pharmaceutical vial market. And we drew on our deep relationships and years of experience in the life sciences market to deepen our understanding of customers problems and collaborate very closely on our solution. We started with glass tubing and then applied our expertise and extrusion and precision forming to convert the glass into vials. And we leverage our experience in vapor deposition to apply a coating that helps vials travel more quickly through the drug filling process. The result was valid glass. And I think it's fair to say that this is a product no one else in the world could have invented. Last fall, we expanded our portfolio by unpacking the valor technology stack to launch a new product that helps address supply chain challenges. Our new velocity vials use already approved packaging with a patented coating. Velocity is helping drugmakers increase efficiency and throughput to drive faster manufacturing of vaccines and other medications to help meet significant global demand. Today, our solutions are clearly showing their strength. Our portfolio of vials and tubing has enabled the delivery of 5.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines. And demand continues to be strong. In the first quarter, our vial production was up more than 150% versus 2021. And our tubing production is expected to increase more than 25% this year, as we ramp capacity. We also recently announced a new long-term supply and development agreement with West pharmaceutical to enable advanced injectable drug packaging and delivery systems for the pharmaceutical industry. This partnership is designed to help speed the commercialization phase for biologic drug developers by avoiding costly time intensive barriers, so they can successfully bring important new drug discoveries to market faster. In total, we're helping to create a future for pharmaceutical manufacturing that offers higher quality, greater efficiency and better sustainability. Stepping back, I think you can see why our customers value our capabilities. We provide unique solutions to move industries forward, all while making the world just a little bit better. Because of this, we're able to thrive in up and down markets. Combined with the measures we're taking to improve margins, we're confident in our ability to drive long-term, profitable growth. Now, as I conclude my remarks, I'll leave you with a final thought. The confluence of the consequential events that we're experiencing today, and the need to operate effectively to serve our stakeholders has required that we all embrace creative new ways of doing business. And at Corning, our values are evident in our actions. We outline much of our progress in our 2021 sustainability, and DE&I reports, which published last month. And this quarter, we built on our success through actions including financial support for humanitarian efforts in the Ukraine and surrounding countries. And continued progress on the greenhouse gas goals we announced at the end of last year. I'm excited about the year ahead and look forward to updating you on our progress. Now let me turn the call over to Ed, who will share more details on our results, financial priorities, and outlook.\nEdward Schlesinger: Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. I want to begin today by saying how encouraged and energized I am by the way our company is performing. We've started 2022 from a position of strength. We are successfully navigating against the complex external operating environment. We're confident in our ability to deliver on a short and long-term profitable growth opportunities to create compelling value for shareholders. Starting with the short-term, we had an extremely strong quarter, commercially, operationally and financially. We delivered year-over-year top and bottom-line growth and we improved margins as our pricing actions began to take hold. Total company sales surpassed $3.7 billion, growing 15% year-over-year, highlighted by a nearly 30% increase in optical sales, a slight increase in display glass prices and continued demand for Hemlock solar materials. Net income for the quarter was $465 million, up 16% year-over-year, and EPS was $0.54, up 20% year-over-year, both growing at a faster rate than sales. We generated $171 million in free cash flow in the quarter and we are on track for another strong year of cash generation. In terms of capital deployment, we invested $383 million in CapEx. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27, which reflects the 12.5% increase announced in January, and we repurchased approximately $150 million of outstanding shares. Taking a closer look at profitability, first quarter gross margin expanded 10 basis points sequentially, and 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the benefits of our pricing actions. Typically, aggregate price for the company and gross margin percent decline sequentially in the first quarter. This year both increased as we took price actions across all businesses. Additionally, first quarter operating margin expanded 140 basis points sequentially, and 50 basis points year-over-year. As we've previously discussed, we continue to experience increases in key input costs. We are tackling these challenges on multiple fronts. We're leveraging relationships with our suppliers to secure favorable long-term raw material pricing, our strategic approach to manufacture in region and to co-locate with customers has helped to shield us from some of the elevated freight and logistics costs. And most importantly, we are increasing price to more appropriately share rising costs of raw materials. We will continue our focus on these unusual costs as well as our normal rigorous cost reduction efforts. Combined with our pricing actions, we expect our gross margin percent to improve from the first quarter. I'm proud of the operational rigor our teams continue to apply and deliver. We're navigating with discipline and agility while capitalizing on our strong market positions. And we see -- we see the benefits in our improving profitability. With that background, let's take a closer look at our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales grew 28% year-over-year, reaching $1.2 billion for the first quarter as network operators increased capital spending. Net income was $166 million, up 50% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Corning continues to outpace the passive optical market and capture growth, which is driven by increased spending on 5G and broadband projects, along with the accelerated pace of data center builds as applications rapidly move to the cloud. Looking ahead, we continue to see strong demand for our Optical Communication Solutions. We believe the industry is at the beginning of a large multiyear wave of growth for passive optical networks. Project momentum is strong across our customer base. And as the broadband equity access and deployment program rolls out, it could add as much as a $1 billion a year to our market for 4 years, as starting as early is 2023. We believe that the combination of private network and public infrastructure investments will push the market into double-digit growth over the next few years, and that our solutions provide advantages, particularly lower labor requirements for customers. In Display, sales grew 11% year-over-year to 959 million. Net income was $236 million also up 11% year-over-year. Sequentially, the price for display glass was up slightly. As we have previously discussed, the display industry is driven by three main factors; retail demand, panel makers production and glass makers ability to supply panel makers. We continue to expect that glass at retail will grow in 2022 by a high single digit percentage driven by average screen size growth and TV unit growth. Over the last several months panel makers have been reducing their capacity utilization rate. We expect additional utilization reductions in the second quarter and we've reflected that expectation in our guidance. Nevertheless, similar to Q1, we expect second quarter price to be up slightly sequentially and glass supply and demand to remain tight. Two factors add to glass supply demand tightness. First, over the last 18 months, we have extended tanks beyond they're designed to life to support customer demand. Second, we have completely depleted our inventory, leading to higher logistics cost and missed opportunities. So, we plan to shutdown end of life tanks, upgrade to the latest technology and begin to replenish our inventory levels to ensure excellent service for our customers. We feel good about our outlook for 2022. We've completed long-term share agreements that cover well over 90% of our planned volume for the year. In 2022, overall, we expect glass supply to remain tight to balanced and the pricing environment to remain favorable. In total, we are very pleased with displays performance, and we're operating from a position of strength. In Specialty Materials, sales grew 9% year-over-year to $493 million. Net income was $75 million, down 18% year-over-year. This sales growth was driven by our more Corning strategy. Take the Samsung Galaxy S22 series for example. Our cover materials are on the front and back of these devices, including all five rear cameras on the Galaxy S22 Ultra. Also, we continue to benefit from the strength of our new-to-the-world. Apple's iPhone 13 launch and legacy product lines like the iPhone 12, which features ceramic shield resulted in increased premium glass sales year-over-year. In the quarter, investments in innovations that are moving towards commercialization resulted in lower net income versus first quarter 2021. We expect growth to accelerate and profitability to improve throughout the year as we introduce new innovations and capture more content per device. In the first quarter, environmental technology sales declined 7% year-over-year due to automaker production constraints. Net income was $74 million consistent with 2021. The auto industry has been experiencing variability from ongoing shortages of chips, components and raw materials. As a result, auto production has been paced by component availability versus consumer demand. Once these constraints are relieved, automakers will be able to increase production to satisfy pent-up vehicle demand, and we would expect significant sales growth from current levels. Moving to Life Sciences. Sales increased 3% year-over-year to $310 million. Net income was $42 million, down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by COVID-related operational challenges in the first half of the quarter, which impacted our output. We expect growth going forward with strong demand for our products and production output increasing over first quarter levels. Finally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses, sales increased 38% year-over-year to $375 million primarily driven by strong performance at Hemlock as we continue to see increased demand for solar materials. Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies also contributed to year-over-year growth. Our portfolio of vials and tubing has enabled the delivery of 5.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines. And automotive glass solutions grew year-over-year as well. The company has been awarded more than a $1 billion of business from multiple manufacturers and numerous car makes and models. In summary, we grew organic sales $500 million this quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we are growing faster than our end markets driven by our more Corning strategy. And as we look ahead, we're confident that our content driven strategy will continue to create outperformance and growth. Now let's talk about our outlook for the second quarter and how we're viewing the year. For the second quarter, we expect $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion in sales with EPS of $0.54 to $0.59. We expect benefits from pricing actions to accelerate in the quarter. And this guidance reflects our view of the most probable outcomes of potential COVID-19 lockdowns in China. For the full year, we're now expecting to exceed $15 billion in sales with growth at a high single-digit percentage. We expect EPS to grow up to a few percentage points faster than sales and gross margin to expand from the first quarter. And we anticipate another year of strong free cash flow in 2022. Our priorities for capital allocation remain the same, investing in profitable growth opportunities across our market access platforms, extending our leadership and rewarding our shareholders. We expect our return on invested capital to increase as we continue to reuse and repurpose assets, secure customer commitments and deliver on high ROIC projects. We're continuing to build a stronger, more resilient company that can deliver multiyear consistent and profitable growth. Now, as I wrap up my formal remarks, I'd like to leave you with a few key highlights. We're off to a great start in Q1. We see strong demand across all our businesses, and our pricing actions are beginning to take hold with more coming in the second quarter. In Display, we achieved a slight price increase in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we expect price to be up slightly sequentially, and glass and the supply and demand to remain tight. We expect Q2 sales in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion and EPS to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.59. And our guidance reflects our view of the most probable outcomes of potential COVID-19 lockdowns in China. We have an incredible set of opportunities across all of our market access platforms. For example, we see multiyear double-digit growth in optical. And in mobile consumer electronics, we have an exciting innovations in our pipeline that will deliver growth in the second half of this year and beyond. In total, we're a stronger and more balanced company today than we were even 5 years ago. And we are focused on commercial and operational execution to achieve broad based profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Ann for Q&A.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks. Katherine, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRod Hall: Yes, good morning. Thanks for the question. Really solid set of numbers here. I guess the -- one of the areas standing out to us is the display strength. And you'd called out pricing and supply demand meeting each other. I just wonder if maybe if you could talk a little bit about the inventory levels there. I know. Ed, in your comments, you said that you're still replenishing inventory. Can you talk a little bit about how much longer it takes to get to a point of inventory that you're satisfied with, and then I have a follow-up to that? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks for the comments, Rod. It's Wendell. The -- our inventory is still well below where we would like it to be in display for service levels. We're hoping to have the opportunity in quarter two to rebuild it, remains to be seen whether or not we can - whether or not demand will allow us to be able to get that to the service levels we'd like. Right now, if you would ask us, we'd say probably wouldn't be till later in the year. Before we could get our service levels to the spot that we would like that have a little bit more contained logistics cost, a little bit easier for our customers to pull when they need it.\nRod Hall: Okay, great. Thanks. Wendell. And then I also wanted to -- I wanted to just ask about capacity constrain. I know in the past you guys have talked about optical and Hemlock both being constrained. I know Hemlock capacity, it seemed like you could bring on pretty quickly. Optical, I know there's a facility in Poland under construction. I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about where we are in terms of capacity constrain there, and bringing new capacity on for those two particular units?\nWendell Weeks: That's a great question. If we could make more, we could sell more. So, we are -- you quite rightly point out the already announced capacity expansions. And as always, we're working with our customers to see if they're willing to make the appropriate level of commitments to be able to make us feel comfortable that we would add additional capacity. Those discussions have not been completed as of yet. So, what we are doing is we're focusing on ramping the already announced expansions and we're trying to accelerate those as much as we can. Demand remains robust.\nRod Hall: Great. Okay. Thanks a lot, Wendell. I really appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two follow-ups. One, on the margin profile is interesting. The Display margin declined sequentially despite a slight increase, but other segments have materially increased in margin. And I just want to understand how those dynamics have played out. Was it just a display higher cost? Or did you have a better ability to raise prices out of the display? And I have a follow-up.\nEdwardSchlesinger: Yes, hi. This is Ed. So, I think in the aggregate, the primary driver of our margin profile increase is raising price. As Wendell mentioned, and we talked a little bit about in our formal remarks, price was actually up in the quarter sequentially. So that's driving the increase in our margins in the aggregate. It plays out a little differently across all of our business segments.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Just a quick follow-up on Optical. You highlighted, I think I heard you incremental revenue of a $1 billion. You also highlighted how you're tied to capacity. How do you see adding capacity? How -- what's the lead times for optical? And what would it take for you to realize this incremental revenue? I think you said $1 billion.\nEdwardSchlesinger: Yes. sSo we have capacity in Optical coming online in the back half of this year, that will increase our capacity and allow us as you heard Wendell say to meet some of the unmet demand we have right now. And then as we see the demand profile playing out, we will make decisions around when we would add additional capacity. Obviously, having customer commitments will be a big part in how and when we do that.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question, Katherine?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you. Just first a clarification on free cash flow. It was much lower than what I was expecting, given your profitability and revenue. What should we expect for free cash flow cadence for the remainder of the year? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nEdwardSchlesinger: Yes. Hi, Asiya. So, a couple of things I would say on free cash flow. First, generally, Q1 is the low quarter for us relative to the rest of the year. We expect sales to expand. So we built some working capital in the quarter. You'll see that inventory was up from the beginning of the quarter. So that's a driver of why free cash flow was a little low. And if you think about it relative to last year, we were at a much lower sales level and not necessarily expecting as much growth. So we didn't build as much inventory. In fact, we actually depleted inventory a little bit in Q1. I think you can think of us having similar year, as we've had in 2021 with respect to free cash flow this year.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Okay, thank you. And then just on Display and cover glass demand, I understand pricing is obviously working in your favor for those segments and in aggregate. Do you also expect display unit demand to go up here in the second quarter and as the year progresses, I know at one point you were talking about China demand and just TV unit demand increasing as the year progresses, given World Cup that we have in the back half? Is that kind of still the outlook that you think just given the macro headwinds that are there for consumer spending.\nWendell Weeks: So, in retail for Display, basically after sort of above trendline, retail sales at the beginning of the pandemic. Last year, television sales were down, sort of well below mean, well below the trend line. And so, this year, we -- and really the rest of the industry expect retail to revert towards, but not actually reaching the mean. And therefore, it'd be up year-over-year. As we looked at the quarter one retail data, we -- it was a little bit lower than what our models would have anticipated. And but we still anticipate growth for the year and we reflected some of that lower growth rate into the guidance that we have given you. So that's what we think is going on in Display. Does that address your question?\nAsiya Merchant: Yes. And then similarly, on smartphones, which are more of a covered glass story, I mean, there is talks, as you know, just dour outlook for smartphones with the exception of a few OEMs that are doing well. What's kind of baked into your outlook for specialty glass for the remainder of the year? Because I think you said growth should accelerate from the 9% level that you guys delivered in 1Q.\nEdwardSchlesinger: So, for us in Mobile Consumer Electronics, it's really so much more of a content story than a unit growth story. If you look over the last number of years, smartphone sales have been relatively flat and like our revenues been up over 40%. So, it's really a more a Corning content story. We expect that content story to continue to be favorable for us as we move through the next couple of years, at least.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question. We have a question from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nMartin Yang: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. You highlighted some impact from China lockdowns to be baked into your guidance. Can you maybe go into more details on how are you directly or indirectly affected by the lockdowns? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Yes. Hi, Martin. I would say that, for sure, we're seeing an impact across the entire supply chain, us, our customers and our suppliers. We're managing through it quite well. And we've reflected the perspective that will continue to see sort of rolling lock downs, if you will, through various different jurisdictions in China. I would say we're not expecting sort of a full Chinese economic shutdown in the way we think about our guidance. What we do, and we think our way through this, because we have to develop our different operating models is -- what we -- it was doing a lot of work with our various professionals to try to take a look at what are the most probabilistic outcomes here? What are the more probable outcomes, and then to design our operating contours to meet those? And how would we flex in certain ways to make sure that we're able to protect our people and still be able to serve our customers. And then what we\u2019ve done is we've taken those potential outcomes, and then tried to build those into the financial guidance that we have given to you.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: We have a question from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good morning. I guess I had a question on pricing. I think one of the concerns going into your results was there was a big increase in metals, oil prices that might have affected your input costs beyond what you had contracted forward. How do we get comfortable with the idea that if inflation continues to be a negative surprise that you are able to pass through pricing on a pretty timely basis. I imagine it's different by different. I imagine it's different by different business units, and then I had a follow-up if I could.\nWendell Weeks: So, we're deployed against that, Steven, as you know, right. And we are -- I think the best evidence for our ability to do that was just in our Q1 results, and in our Q2 guide. So that being said, as always, let's see how the cost profiles evolve. So far, what we have discovered is that our customers are working with us in partnership to more appropriately share the increased cost that we experience. We would expect that to continue.\nSteven Fox: Okay, that's helpful. And then just maybe on the auto grade glass number. The $1 billion of business that you've booked. Can you put that in perspective relative to just how all these new models are coming out? I think there's like 25 or 26, new EV models coming out in 2022 alone. What percentage of sort of that -- those new models are you capturing? Where maybe content is higher? Like, can you give us an idea of where you are in sort of going after that iceberg? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Steve, that's a great question. Let's reflect some on that. And let's have and get back to you and try to think about the best way to address that sort of that second question.\nSteven Fox: Okay.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you.\nSteven Fox: All right. Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open.\nJosh Spector: Yes. Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments earlier about specialty glass and smartphones. You guys are pretty prescriptive in terms of the content opportunity in auto. Do you have a similar kind of number when you think about smartphones, in terms of content per unit? I mean, you say you expect that to increase. But is there a dollar number or a quantitative way we should think about that for the next couple of years?\nWendell Weeks: That's an -- you guys are asking excellent questions. That's another excellent question. We do expect it to increase. I'm sort of not at liberty to say, sort of, in what way because that would give some insight into. Some of our customers were exciting new product of features. But let us think a little bit about is there a more macro index way to think about your question, because that's a reasonable question and let us reflect on that one, too.\nJosh Spector: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one, I did want to see if you can give us a bit more color about the margins in Optical Communication. You had really strong margins there, about 100 basis points up sequentially. Is that again, a lot of price driven by your pricing actions. And maybe you can talk to how you think about margin progression from here on, particularly, how easy is it to take pricing actions with some of the service provider customers? And I\u2019ve a quick follow-up. Thanks.\nEdwardSchlesinger: Yes, thanks. The -- I would say the primary driver is price in Optical Communications. Of course, as sales go up, we would expect margins to go up as well. I think as we go forward, as Wendell mentioned, we will continue to look to increase price and you will see how input costs play out. And that will certainly impact how our margin progresses. But we do expect gross margin in total for the company to go up from the first quarter.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And for my follow-up, if I can just create a full year guide, you're guiding toward high single-digit revenue growth versus mid-single-digit prior. It doesn't sound like display or environmental are big drivers of that. So, if you can just help us understand a bit more at the segment level. What are the big drivers in terms of changing expectations? And if pricing or sort of getting better price realization through the quarter helped sort of increase that target as well. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Certainly better price realization helps on the revenue line. And I would say optical continues to gain strength. But we have some good contributions really across the platform in a pretty balanced way. But it is Optical continues to provide a lot of our year-over-year growth this year continues to be a nice driver for us.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long: Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on the Optical business. Could you talk a little bit, it looks like the telco business was very strong, but enterprise ticked down a little bit. What's going on with that piece of the business? Is it just kind of lumpiness of hyperscale? Or is there anything else going on there? And when you think about the capacity improvements that you're seeing in the second half, what -- what's driving that, which of the businesses and maybe just one -- last one on that hyperscale piece, if you can talk about maybe pricing between hyperscale and telco? Is it similarly easy to push the higher price into both of those verticals? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Okay, let's take them in order. I think, Tim, first of all, you've got to write on enterprise versus telecom thing. I think it's just timing, right? We see nothing systemic. We continue to see strong demand in both platforms for us. The -- I got the pricing one. So, for the pricing one -- pricing is always challenging. These are all very big players. I wouldn't construe one as being easier than the other. What I would say is that both understand the situations that we face, and both value us very much for our ability to supply in the innovations that we bring. There's an interesting little sort of, I think, sub story that is going on for us. And it's also behind some of our numbers this year, is we're introducing a number of new innovations that once again introduce more Corning into the solutions. As everybody is struggling with installation, both having getting enough people and the accelerating cost of doing installation, whether you're trying to build hyperscale, you're trying to build a wireline or you're trying to build a wireless network. What we've done is we've introduced and we're going to continue to introduce a series of very new products that dramatically reduce installation time -- in installation, labor, content especially the need for highly skilled labor. So those are also increasing the amount of revenue per link that we receive. So really, it's also a more a Corning strategy that you're going to see drive our results strongly as well. Did I miss one for you, Tim? Did you have another that I missed [multiple speakers]?\nTim Long: I just wanted to understand the capacity increases that you have planned for Optical kind of what -- is that just the same broad-based demand? Is there anything more specific that's feeding that need?\nWendell Weeks: Yes, we have both fiber and cable capacity coming online, so that sort of feeds almost everything we do across all of our customers. So that will give us capacity in many places in the Optical space.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Ed, you noted improvement in gross margin sequentially here in the second quarter. I was hoping maybe you could calibrate that a little bit. Should we expect gross margins to also be up on a year-on-year basis in the second quarter and how about for the full year? And I\u2019ve a follow-up.\nEdwardSchlesinger: So, I would say that we you should think of about it sequentially, it's just easier for us in terms of how we think about it, because of increasing inflation and increasing prices. If you get $1 of inflation and you offset that with $1 of price, your gross margin dollars are flat, but your percentage actually goes down. So, you sort of have this headwind you have to overcome. So through the year, we expect to overcome that headwind because we have price coming in, and we'll continue to grow our sales. So, I think of it as gross margin going up sequentially from Q1 to Q2.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Ed. One point Tony had said he did not expect to change the yen hedge level under his tenure, and the yen has clearly moved a lot recently. He obviously stuck to that. But can you give us some explicit levels where you're hedged at for the next 3 years, just given the magnitude of the move in the yen be helpful to recalibrate all of us on how far away from 107? If you're going to move away from 107, how far away from that you're considering to re-hedge or already hedged that? And just what -- how much of your exposure is hedged at 107 in the next couple of years? Thank you.\nEdwardSchlesinger: Yes. Thanks for that question. So, a couple of things. First, I just want to step back a little bit and remind everyone we hedge the yen and other Asian currencies, where we have significant exposure. We think of it as sort of a basket of exposures. We've been doing that for quite some time, we've been successful. And you've heard us say we've almost have $2 billion worth of cash received under these programs, we've been successful. We're pretty fully hedged out, 18 months or so. And then we have a material amount of our exposure hedged beyond that certainly in '23, and then we have hedges into 2024, and even some hedges in some of those currencies beyond that. So, I would not anticipate us certainly for the next couple of years changing our core rate from 107.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you so much.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: We have a question from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatthewNiknam: Hey, thanks for taking the question. So, most of the model and housekeeping related questions have been asked, so I'm going to ask a higher level one. And so, on the commentary and prepared remarks, you talked about the company's strong top line growth potential, obviously, some operating leverage as well, though. It seems like there's a disconnect between fundamentals and stock valuation, which hasn't necessarily rerated to reflect the upside. And so, I'm wondering, what do you think the Street's most under appreciating? And then what can the company do to help maybe unlock some more value in shares? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: I think that the thing that Street most misses is that we have two big dynamics going on that maybe we had to adjust to. First is the success of our more Corning strategy. More and more of our content is being adopted into products that our customers already buy. And that gives us a lot of revenue leverage that is not dependent upon just people buying more stuff. That content story is very powerful one. And I think was also reflected in some of the questions that we got earlier in the call that were really good questions. And perhaps, we need to do a little bit better job of giving folks an idea of the power of that leverage is they think long-term about it. The next is, we are on top of some major secular trends. And the reason we've been around 170 years is we're really good at starting early on major technology trends that use our three core technologies at our four manufacturing and engineering platforms. And we're against trends that long-term are going to just be very powerful. You even saw some of them play out sort of in the surprises that people got in Q1. So Optical Communications people continue to underestimate mainly because they're missing just one a strong macro secular trend it is for now in 5G for cloud, as well as enhanced broadband across the globe. Even within Display, I think the big secular trend was the move to larger and larger displays, which are best expressed through Gen 10.5, which because of our long-term thoughtful technology innovations, we have our sort of unfair share of the expression of as displays go bigger. A new one, I think that people are beginning to get a grasp on, but still not yet reflecting is this sort of opportunity in renewable energy that are material set about 3 or 4 can potentially bring. And all of those were just in Q1. Plus, we have that same sort of big, macro secular trends in a number of our other areas. And I think in general, folks tend to be a little bit slow in realizing that those are the trend lines that any company is following. And we just need to continue to put up the type of results that you seen us do here, and that are in our guide for Q2 and for the year. And part of us believes that nothing will help change minds quite like consistent performance on our part, and that's where we focus.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, Wendell.\nMatthewNiknam: That's great. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Operator, we can squeeze in one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Maybe jumping [ph] on the renewable energy piece, just wanted to see if Hemlock is -- are you guys still selling on the inventory there? Or when would you expect capacity to ramp up there? And then maybe just on the Display business, just what is the timing of some of those tanks being taken offline? Thanks.\nEdwardSchlesinger: Hi, Meta. So, in terms of Hemlock, as we've shared, we had a lot of inventory. We sold out almost all that inventory in 2021 and we started to ramp capacity in the fourth quarter. We shared that on our last conference call, and we've been ramping that capacity through the first quarter, we're sort of almost at the rate at which we want to be, to be able to serve the demand we have. And so, a little bit of inventory sold in Q1, but really now starting to sell the product that we're producing, and would expect to do that for the remainder of this year and forward. And then, in terms of Display, tanks, I think, as Wendell mentioned earlier, I think a lot of that will depend on how much demand we see in the second quarter. So, we definitely need to take those tanks down and replenish our inventory as we work through it, but part of that will be how robust the demand is in Q2.\nWendell Weeks: So we've tried to do is reflect that. And really, for us now, our manufacturing platforms is a little of a Rubik's Cube, because those manufacturing platforms serve our Mobile Consumer Electronics business, our Automotive business, and our Display business. And so what we need to do is sort of find different ways to get those technology upgrades in getting much needed repairs and maintenance. And so, putting that all together is what we try to reflect in our guide. I think one of the things that makes it challenging to evaluate from outside is that really with the way we make product. So our manufacturing platform serves many different outlets. So it's like hard to drive a direct line between what's happening in panels and directly into what will happen into our glass manufacturing. Because really we have demand overall for our fusion platform and our overall melting capability. That's a long way of basically saying we're feathering it in whenever we can, and we tried to reflect our best understanding in our guide to you.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you so much.\nAnn Nicholson: Great. Thanks, Meta, and thank you everybody for joining us today. Before we close, I wanted to let everyone know that we will attend the JP Morgan Global Technology Media and Communications Conference on May 24. The Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference on June 2, the Bank of America Securities Global Technology Conference on June 8; and the Fox Advisors Virtual Transportation Technology Conference on June 23. Additionally, we're going to be hosting management visits to investor offices in select cities. Finally, a replay of today's call will be available on our website starting later this morning. Once again, thanks for joining us. Katherine, that concludes our call. Please disconnect all lines.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Edward Schlesinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. I want to begin today by saying how encouraged and energized I am by the way our company is performing. We've started 2022 from a position of strength. We are successfully navigating against the complex external operating environment. We're confident in our ability to deliver on a short and long-term profitable growth opportunities to create compelling value for shareholders. Starting with the short-term, we had an extremely strong quarter, commercially, operationally and financially. We delivered year-over-year top and bottom-line growth and we improved margins as our pricing actions began to take hold. Total company sales surpassed $3.7 billion, growing 15% year-over-year, highlighted by a nearly 30% increase in optical sales, a slight increase in display glass prices and continued demand for Hemlock solar materials. Net income for the quarter was $465 million, up 16% year-over-year, and EPS was $0.54, up 20% year-over-year, both growing at a faster rate than sales. We generated $171 million in free cash flow in the quarter and we are on track for another strong year of cash generation. In terms of capital deployment, we invested $383 million in CapEx. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27, which reflects the 12.5% increase announced in January, and we repurchased approximately $150 million of outstanding shares. Taking a closer look at profitability, first quarter gross margin expanded 10 basis points sequentially, and 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the benefits of our pricing actions. Typically, aggregate price for the company and gross margin percent decline sequentially in the first quarter. This year both increased as we took price actions across all businesses. Additionally, first quarter operating margin expanded 140 basis points sequentially, and 50 basis points year-over-year. As we've previously discussed, we continue to experience increases in key input costs. We are tackling these challenges on multiple fronts. We're leveraging relationships with our suppliers to secure favorable long-term raw material pricing, our strategic approach to manufacture in region and to co-locate with customers has helped to shield us from some of the elevated freight and logistics costs. And most importantly, we are increasing price to more appropriately share rising costs of raw materials. We will continue our focus on these unusual costs as well as our normal rigorous cost reduction efforts. Combined with our pricing actions, we expect our gross margin percent to improve from the first quarter. I'm proud of the operational rigor our teams continue to apply and deliver. We're navigating with discipline and agility while capitalizing on our strong market positions. And we see -- we see the benefits in our improving profitability. With that background, let's take a closer look at our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales grew 28% year-over-year, reaching $1.2 billion for the first quarter as network operators increased capital spending. Net income was $166 million, up 50% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Corning continues to outpace the passive optical market and capture growth, which is driven by increased spending on 5G and broadband projects, along with the accelerated pace of data center builds as applications rapidly move to the cloud. Looking ahead, we continue to see strong demand for our Optical Communication Solutions. We believe the industry is at the beginning of a large multiyear wave of growth for passive optical networks. Project momentum is strong across our customer base. And as the broadband equity access and deployment program rolls out, it could add as much as a $1 billion a year to our market for 4 years, as starting as early is 2023. We believe that the combination of private network and public infrastructure investments will push the market into double-digit growth over the next few years, and that our solutions provide advantages, particularly lower labor requirements for customers. In Display, sales grew 11% year-over-year to 959 million. Net income was $236 million also up 11% year-over-year. Sequentially, the price for display glass was up slightly. As we have previously discussed, the display industry is driven by three main factors; retail demand, panel makers production and glass makers ability to supply panel makers. We continue to expect that glass at retail will grow in 2022 by a high single digit percentage driven by average screen size growth and TV unit growth. Over the last several months panel makers have been reducing their capacity utilization rate. We expect additional utilization reductions in the second quarter and we've reflected that expectation in our guidance. Nevertheless, similar to Q1, we expect second quarter price to be up slightly sequentially and glass supply and demand to remain tight. Two factors add to glass supply demand tightness. First, over the last 18 months, we have extended tanks beyond they're designed to life to support customer demand. Second, we have completely depleted our inventory, leading to higher logistics cost and missed opportunities. So, we plan to shutdown end of life tanks, upgrade to the latest technology and begin to replenish our inventory levels to ensure excellent service for our customers. We feel good about our outlook for 2022. We've completed long-term share agreements that cover well over 90% of our planned volume for the year. In 2022, overall, we expect glass supply to remain tight to balanced and the pricing environment to remain favorable. In total, we are very pleased with displays performance, and we're operating from a position of strength. In Specialty Materials, sales grew 9% year-over-year to $493 million. Net income was $75 million, down 18% year-over-year. This sales growth was driven by our more Corning strategy. Take the Samsung Galaxy S22 series for example. Our cover materials are on the front and back of these devices, including all five rear cameras on the Galaxy S22 Ultra. Also, we continue to benefit from the strength of our new-to-the-world. Apple's iPhone 13 launch and legacy product lines like the iPhone 12, which features ceramic shield resulted in increased premium glass sales year-over-year. In the quarter, investments in innovations that are moving towards commercialization resulted in lower net income versus first quarter 2021. We expect growth to accelerate and profitability to improve throughout the year as we introduce new innovations and capture more content per device. In the first quarter, environmental technology sales declined 7% year-over-year due to automaker production constraints. Net income was $74 million consistent with 2021. The auto industry has been experiencing variability from ongoing shortages of chips, components and raw materials. As a result, auto production has been paced by component availability versus consumer demand. Once these constraints are relieved, automakers will be able to increase production to satisfy pent-up vehicle demand, and we would expect significant sales growth from current levels. Moving to Life Sciences. Sales increased 3% year-over-year to $310 million. Net income was $42 million, down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by COVID-related operational challenges in the first half of the quarter, which impacted our output. We expect growth going forward with strong demand for our products and production output increasing over first quarter levels. Finally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses, sales increased 38% year-over-year to $375 million primarily driven by strong performance at Hemlock as we continue to see increased demand for solar materials. Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies also contributed to year-over-year growth. Our portfolio of vials and tubing has enabled the delivery of 5.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines. And automotive glass solutions grew year-over-year as well. The company has been awarded more than a $1 billion of business from multiple manufacturers and numerous car makes and models. In summary, we grew organic sales $500 million this quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we are growing faster than our end markets driven by our more Corning strategy. And as we look ahead, we're confident that our content driven strategy will continue to create outperformance and growth. Now let's talk about our outlook for the second quarter and how we're viewing the year. For the second quarter, we expect $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion in sales with EPS of $0.54 to $0.59. We expect benefits from pricing actions to accelerate in the quarter. And this guidance reflects our view of the most probable outcomes of potential COVID-19 lockdowns in China. For the full year, we're now expecting to exceed $15 billion in sales with growth at a high single-digit percentage. We expect EPS to grow up to a few percentage points faster than sales and gross margin to expand from the first quarter. And we anticipate another year of strong free cash flow in 2022. Our priorities for capital allocation remain the same, investing in profitable growth opportunities across our market access platforms, extending our leadership and rewarding our shareholders. We expect our return on invested capital to increase as we continue to reuse and repurpose assets, secure customer commitments and deliver on high ROIC projects. We're continuing to build a stronger, more resilient company that can deliver multiyear consistent and profitable growth. Now, as I wrap up my formal remarks, I'd like to leave you with a few key highlights. We're off to a great start in Q1. We see strong demand across all our businesses, and our pricing actions are beginning to take hold with more coming in the second quarter. In Display, we achieved a slight price increase in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we expect price to be up slightly sequentially, and glass and the supply and demand to remain tight. We expect Q2 sales in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion and EPS to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.59. And our guidance reflects our view of the most probable outcomes of potential COVID-19 lockdowns in China. We have an incredible set of opportunities across all of our market access platforms. For example, we see multiyear double-digit growth in optical. And in mobile consumer electronics, we have an exciting innovations in our pipeline that will deliver growth in the second half of this year and beyond. In total, we're a stronger and more balanced company today than we were even 5 years ago. And we are focused on commercial and operational execution to achieve broad based profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Ann for Q&A. Yes, hi. This is Ed. So, I think in the aggregate, the primary driver of our margin profile increase is raising price. As Wendell mentioned, and we talked a little bit about in our formal remarks, price was actually up in the quarter sequentially. So that's driving the increase in our margins in the aggregate. It plays out a little differently across all of our business segments. Yes. sSo we have capacity in Optical coming online in the back half of this year, that will increase our capacity and allow us as you heard Wendell say to meet some of the unmet demand we have right now. And then as we see the demand profile playing out, we will make decisions around when we would add additional capacity. Obviously, having customer commitments will be a big part in how and when we do that. Yes. Hi, Asiya. So, a couple of things I would say on free cash flow. First, generally, Q1 is the low quarter for us relative to the rest of the year. We expect sales to expand. So we built some working capital in the quarter. You'll see that inventory was up from the beginning of the quarter. So that's a driver of why free cash flow was a little low. And if you think about it relative to last year, we were at a much lower sales level and not necessarily expecting as much growth. So we didn't build as much inventory. In fact, we actually depleted inventory a little bit in Q1. I think you can think of us having similar year, as we've had in 2021 with respect to free cash flow this year. So, for us in Mobile Consumer Electronics, it's really so much more of a content story than a unit growth story. If you look over the last number of years, smartphone sales have been relatively flat and like our revenues been up over 40%. So, it's really a more a Corning content story. We expect that content story to continue to be favorable for us as we move through the next couple of years, at least. Yes, thanks. The -- I would say the primary driver is price in Optical Communications. Of course, as sales go up, we would expect margins to go up as well. I think as we go forward, as Wendell mentioned, we will continue to look to increase price and you will see how input costs play out. And that will certainly impact how our margin progresses. But we do expect gross margin in total for the company to go up from the first quarter. So, I would say that we you should think of about it sequentially, it's just easier for us in terms of how we think about it, because of increasing inflation and increasing prices. If you get $1 of inflation and you offset that with $1 of price, your gross margin dollars are flat, but your percentage actually goes down. So, you sort of have this headwind you have to overcome. So through the year, we expect to overcome that headwind because we have price coming in, and we'll continue to grow our sales. So, I think of it as gross margin going up sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Yes. Thanks for that question. So, a couple of things. First, I just want to step back a little bit and remind everyone we hedge the yen and other Asian currencies, where we have significant exposure. We think of it as sort of a basket of exposures. We've been doing that for quite some time, we've been successful. And you've heard us say we've almost have $2 billion worth of cash received under these programs, we've been successful. We're pretty fully hedged out, 18 months or so. And then we have a material amount of our exposure hedged beyond that certainly in '23, and then we have hedges into 2024, and even some hedges in some of those currencies beyond that. So, I would not anticipate us certainly for the next couple of years changing our core rate from 107. Hi, Meta. So, in terms of Hemlock, as we've shared, we had a lot of inventory. We sold out almost all that inventory in 2021 and we started to ramp capacity in the fourth quarter. We shared that on our last conference call, and we've been ramping that capacity through the first quarter, we're sort of almost at the rate at which we want to be, to be able to serve the demand we have. And so, a little bit of inventory sold in Q1, but really now starting to sell the product that we're producing, and would expect to do that for the remainder of this year and forward. And then, in terms of Display, tanks, I think, as Wendell mentioned earlier, I think a lot of that will depend on how much demand we see in the second quarter. So, we definitely need to take those tanks down and replenish our inventory as we work through it, but part of that will be how robust the demand is in Q2."

            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. We're off to an outstanding start in 2022 with strong first quarter sales and improved profitability. Sales grew 15% over the first quarter of 2021 to $3.7 billion. EPS increased 20% year-over-year to $0.54. Free cash flow was $171 million. We saw broad based strength across our businesses, and we effectively navigated a complex geopolitical and external operating environment. Gross margin of 36.6% and operating margin of 17.6%, both expanded sequentially and year-over-year. The improvements were primarily driven by benefits of pricing actions across all our businesses. Historically, prices are usually down in the first quarter. However, as I told you last quarter, we negotiated with customers to increase prices in our long-term contracts to share increased costs more appropriately. And therefore, this year, price in total was up both sequentially and year-over-year. We expect price to be up again in the second quarter. Specifically in display, we achieved a slight price increase in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we expect price to be up slightly sequentially, and glass supply and demand to remain tight. You'll hear more from Ed on the display market and our outlook. Now, let's take a closer look at how we performed in each of our Market-Access Platforms. In Display, we continue to operate from a position of strength. We delivered 11% year-over-year sales and net income growth, driven by higher glass volume and slightly higher price. In Optical Communications, we grew sales 28% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, representing 32% of total sales. Optical Communications is our largest market access platform by sales, and we expect significant growth to continue. Operators are expanding their networks. The pace of datacenter construction is accelerating and fiber rich wireless deployments are underway. We continue to be energized by the momentum that is building in this business, and we're well-positioned to capture growth. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, specialty materials outperformed the market with year-over-year sales growth of 9%, driven by significant demand for our premium cover materials and advanced optics products. In automotive, our environmental technology sales declined year-over-year due to customer production constraints. However, we continue to outperform the market. Sales were up in our Automotive Glass business, and I'll talk more about that in a minute. In Life Sciences, we grew year-over-year, advanced key innovations for cell and gene therapy and expanded supply of glass vials and tubing. Based on the quarter and our expectation of continued strong demand, we are raising our sales expectations for the year to above $15 billion. Our results speak for themselves. We've been delivering consistent growth with more balanced contributions across the company. And you'll hear more about that from Ed in just a minute. So how do we do this? Our strong position stems from a complementary set of three core technologies, four proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms. We're leaders in each. We captured growth opportunities by combining, integrating and evolving these capabilities to help our customers drive their industries forward. And in so doing, we drive more Corning content into the products people are already buying. We typically spend the majority of our time discussing the results within our five segments. However, important growth opportunities for our more Corning strategy also reside in the segment we have historically referred to as other. To better reflect the significant contributions and potential of these initiatives, we've renamed it Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. This segment grew 38% year-over-year in the first quarter. So today, I'm going to spend some time talking about what's going on, and how it underscores our confidence that we will continue to deliver durable, multiyear profitable growth. Hemlock currently delivers most of the sales in the segment. Hemlock manufactures ultra-pure poly silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries. As a reminder, Corning owns 80.5% of Hemlock as a result of Hemlock's purchase of DuPont's ownership in the company in 2020. This was a great transaction for Corning. We didn't put any money into the transaction, and we gained an additional 40% interest in Hemlock's strong semiconductor business, that also has the upside potential reflected in the solar market. Recently, we secured multiyear take or pay commitments for solar, and we expect demand to grow. Additionally, as the renewable energy industry evolves, we believe that Corning's technical and manufacturing capabilities are three and four can provide significant benefits. We believe this business has excellent growth potential. The other two major contributors in this segment are Automotive Glass and Pharmaceutical Glass Packaging. And we're making good progress on these two large opportunities, and both are prime examples of our focused and cohesive portfolio in action. So, let's take a look at how we reapply and reuse our capabilities to drive ongoing value, starting with automotive glass. There's no denying it. The driving experience is rapidly evolving. Drivers want more connected and autonomous features. And the basis of competition is moving from the engine to the cabin. Automakers are responding to these trends. Car design is getting less analog and more digital, fewer buttons and more large screens with touch capability. Nearly universally, the solution is more glass. And as automakers address the opportunities and the challenges they face, they're looking for glass to provide both form and function. To meet their needs, we've reapplied our existing capabilities, expertise and experience in the automotive market. We started with a fusion draw asset that provide pristine flat glass in our Display and Mobile Consumer Electronics market access platforms. And we took insight from Gorilla Glass to create better, more sustainable products that offer superior economics and help our customers advance the transformation of their industry. Poll for our technical glass products is strongest in auto interiors. We've answered with auto grade Gorilla Glass. It provides our signature toughness and optics tailored for the automotive use case to bring the smartphone experience into the car. We've also developed and patented ColdForm technology. By removing heat from the glass shaping process, ColdForm improved yields, saves money, and ultimately delivers a better, more sustainable product at a lower cost than HotForm glass. It enables dashboard and console displays that follow the natural curves of the car's interior, protected by a single, thin piece of precision glass. Our customers can bend the glass to suit their design needs right at the end of their own display module assembly. Looking ahead, we continue to pursue multiple opportunities for our interior and exterior glass innovations. We've entered a new product category with our curved mirror solutions for head up displays, and we're providing Gorilla Glass to Jeep's iconic Wrangler, and Gladiator. We're also working on OLED lighting, and we're in the early stages of delivering glass solutions for the sensors that are critical for autonomous vehicles. What this all adds up to is an increasingly significant business created by applying our more Corning approach. Our Automotive Glass Solutions business is helping us capture $100 per car opportunity. We've already been awarded over a $1 billion of multiyear business across multiple manufacturers and numerous car makes and models. And we're confident in our growth trajectory as we continue to build on this exciting opportunity. Now let's look at another key emerging growth business. We drew on our glass science capabilities to develop a pharmaceutical packaging solution with both exceptional strength and enhanced chemical stability relative to incumbent porous silica vials. Porous silica glass is inherently prone to issues such as delamination. Shifting to aluminosilicate base eliminates this risk and optimizes vials for our ion exchange process. As with the auto example that I just shared, we applied our experience making tough damage resistant glass to the pharmaceutical vial market. And we drew on our deep relationships and years of experience in the life sciences market to deepen our understanding of customers problems and collaborate very closely on our solution. We started with glass tubing and then applied our expertise and extrusion and precision forming to convert the glass into vials. And we leverage our experience in vapor deposition to apply a coating that helps vials travel more quickly through the drug filling process. The result was valid glass. And I think it's fair to say that this is a product no one else in the world could have invented. Last fall, we expanded our portfolio by unpacking the valor technology stack to launch a new product that helps address supply chain challenges. Our new velocity vials use already approved packaging with a patented coating. Velocity is helping drugmakers increase efficiency and throughput to drive faster manufacturing of vaccines and other medications to help meet significant global demand. Today, our solutions are clearly showing their strength. Our portfolio of vials and tubing has enabled the delivery of 5.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines. And demand continues to be strong. In the first quarter, our vial production was up more than 150% versus 2021. And our tubing production is expected to increase more than 25% this year, as we ramp capacity. We also recently announced a new long-term supply and development agreement with West pharmaceutical to enable advanced injectable drug packaging and delivery systems for the pharmaceutical industry. This partnership is designed to help speed the commercialization phase for biologic drug developers by avoiding costly time intensive barriers, so they can successfully bring important new drug discoveries to market faster. In total, we're helping to create a future for pharmaceutical manufacturing that offers higher quality, greater efficiency and better sustainability. Stepping back, I think you can see why our customers value our capabilities. We provide unique solutions to move industries forward, all while making the world just a little bit better. Because of this, we're able to thrive in up and down markets. Combined with the measures we're taking to improve margins, we're confident in our ability to drive long-term, profitable growth. Now, as I conclude my remarks, I'll leave you with a final thought. The confluence of the consequential events that we're experiencing today, and the need to operate effectively to serve our stakeholders has required that we all embrace creative new ways of doing business. And at Corning, our values are evident in our actions. We outline much of our progress in our 2021 sustainability, and DE&I reports, which published last month. And this quarter, we built on our success through actions including financial support for humanitarian efforts in the Ukraine and surrounding countries. And continued progress on the greenhouse gas goals we announced at the end of last year. I'm excited about the year ahead and look forward to updating you on our progress. Now let me turn the call over to Ed, who will share more details on our results, financial priorities, and outlook. Thanks for the comments, Rod. It's Wendell. The -- our inventory is still well below where we would like it to be in display for service levels. We're hoping to have the opportunity in quarter two to rebuild it, remains to be seen whether or not we can - whether or not demand will allow us to be able to get that to the service levels we'd like. Right now, if you would ask us, we'd say probably wouldn't be till later in the year. Before we could get our service levels to the spot that we would like that have a little bit more contained logistics cost, a little bit easier for our customers to pull when they need it. That's a great question. If we could make more, we could sell more. So, we are -- you quite rightly point out the already announced capacity expansions. And as always, we're working with our customers to see if they're willing to make the appropriate level of commitments to be able to make us feel comfortable that we would add additional capacity. Those discussions have not been completed as of yet. So, what we are doing is we're focusing on ramping the already announced expansions and we're trying to accelerate those as much as we can. Demand remains robust. So, in retail for Display, basically after sort of above trendline, retail sales at the beginning of the pandemic. Last year, television sales were down, sort of well below mean, well below the trend line. And so, this year, we -- and really the rest of the industry expect retail to revert towards, but not actually reaching the mean. And therefore, it'd be up year-over-year. As we looked at the quarter one retail data, we -- it was a little bit lower than what our models would have anticipated. And but we still anticipate growth for the year and we reflected some of that lower growth rate into the guidance that we have given you. So that's what we think is going on in Display. Does that address your question? Yes. Hi, Martin. I would say that, for sure, we're seeing an impact across the entire supply chain, us, our customers and our suppliers. We're managing through it quite well. And we've reflected the perspective that will continue to see sort of rolling lock downs, if you will, through various different jurisdictions in China. I would say we're not expecting sort of a full Chinese economic shutdown in the way we think about our guidance. What we do, and we think our way through this, because we have to develop our different operating models is -- what we -- it was doing a lot of work with our various professionals to try to take a look at what are the most probabilistic outcomes here? What are the more probable outcomes, and then to design our operating contours to meet those? And how would we flex in certain ways to make sure that we're able to protect our people and still be able to serve our customers. And then what we've done is we've taken those potential outcomes, and then tried to build those into the financial guidance that we have given to you. So, we're deployed against that, Steven, as you know, right. And we are -- I think the best evidence for our ability to do that was just in our Q1 results, and in our Q2 guide. So that being said, as always, let's see how the cost profiles evolve. So far, what we have discovered is that our customers are working with us in partnership to more appropriately share the increased cost that we experience. We would expect that to continue. Steve, that's a great question. Let's reflect some on that. And let's have and get back to you and try to think about the best way to address that sort of that second question. Thank you. That's an -- you guys are asking excellent questions. That's another excellent question. We do expect it to increase. I'm sort of not at liberty to say, sort of, in what way because that would give some insight into. Some of our customers were exciting new product of features. But let us think a little bit about is there a more macro index way to think about your question, because that's a reasonable question and let us reflect on that one, too. Certainly better price realization helps on the revenue line. And I would say optical continues to gain strength. But we have some good contributions really across the platform in a pretty balanced way. But it is Optical continues to provide a lot of our year-over-year growth this year continues to be a nice driver for us. Okay, let's take them in order. I think, Tim, first of all, you've got to write on enterprise versus telecom thing. I think it's just timing, right? We see nothing systemic. We continue to see strong demand in both platforms for us. The -- I got the pricing one. So, for the pricing one -- pricing is always challenging. These are all very big players. I wouldn't construe one as being easier than the other. What I would say is that both understand the situations that we face, and both value us very much for our ability to supply in the innovations that we bring. There's an interesting little sort of, I think, sub story that is going on for us. And it's also behind some of our numbers this year, is we're introducing a number of new innovations that once again introduce more Corning into the solutions. As everybody is struggling with installation, both having getting enough people and the accelerating cost of doing installation, whether you're trying to build hyperscale, you're trying to build a wireline or you're trying to build a wireless network. What we've done is we've introduced and we're going to continue to introduce a series of very new products that dramatically reduce installation time -- in installation, labor, content especially the need for highly skilled labor. So those are also increasing the amount of revenue per link that we receive. So really, it's also a more a Corning strategy that you're going to see drive our results strongly as well. Did I miss one for you, Tim? Did you have another that I missed [multiple speakers]? Yes, we have both fiber and cable capacity coming online, so that sort of feeds almost everything we do across all of our customers. So that will give us capacity in many places in the Optical space. I think that the thing that Street most misses is that we have two big dynamics going on that maybe we had to adjust to. First is the success of our more Corning strategy. More and more of our content is being adopted into products that our customers already buy. And that gives us a lot of revenue leverage that is not dependent upon just people buying more stuff. That content story is very powerful one. And I think was also reflected in some of the questions that we got earlier in the call that were really good questions. And perhaps, we need to do a little bit better job of giving folks an idea of the power of that leverage is they think long-term about it. The next is, we are on top of some major secular trends. And the reason we've been around 170 years is we're really good at starting early on major technology trends that use our three core technologies at our four manufacturing and engineering platforms. And we're against trends that long-term are going to just be very powerful. You even saw some of them play out sort of in the surprises that people got in Q1. So Optical Communications people continue to underestimate mainly because they're missing just one a strong macro secular trend it is for now in 5G for cloud, as well as enhanced broadband across the globe. Even within Display, I think the big secular trend was the move to larger and larger displays, which are best expressed through Gen 10.5, which because of our long-term thoughtful technology innovations, we have our sort of unfair share of the expression of as displays go bigger. A new one, I think that people are beginning to get a grasp on, but still not yet reflecting is this sort of opportunity in renewable energy that are material set about 3 or 4 can potentially bring. And all of those were just in Q1. Plus, we have that same sort of big, macro secular trends in a number of our other areas. And I think in general, folks tend to be a little bit slow in realizing that those are the trend lines that any company is following. And we just need to continue to put up the type of results that you seen us do here, and that are in our guide for Q2 and for the year. And part of us believes that nothing will help change minds quite like consistent performance on our part, and that's where we focus. So we've tried to do is reflect that. And really, for us now, our manufacturing platforms is a little of a Rubik's Cube, because those manufacturing platforms serve our Mobile Consumer Electronics business, our Automotive business, and our Display business. And so what we need to do is sort of find different ways to get those technology upgrades in getting much needed repairs and maintenance. And so, putting that all together is what we try to reflect in our guide. I think one of the things that makes it challenging to evaluate from outside is that really with the way we make product. So our manufacturing platform serves many different outlets. So it's like hard to drive a direct line between what's happening in panels and directly into what will happen into our glass manufacturing. Because really we have demand overall for our fusion platform and our overall melting capability. That's a long way of basically saying we're feathering it in whenever we can, and we tried to reflect our best understanding in our guide to you."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Corning Incorporated Quarter Four 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] It is my pleasure to introduce to you Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Invest Relations.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, Shannon, and good morning. Welcome to Corning's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the fourth quarter, the difference between GAAP and core EPS primarily reflected constant currency adjustments, realized gains and unrealized non-cash mark-to-market losses on translated earnings contracts and non-cash translation losses on Japanese yen denominated debt as well as restructuring and asset write-off charges. As a reminder, these mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the investor relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast and we encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now, I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. Today we reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Sales for the fourth quarter were $3.3 billion and EPS was $0.39, in line with expectations. Free cash flow was $0.5 billion. Gross margin was 37%, consistent with the third quarter despite lower sequential sales. As I shared with you last quarter, demand in most of our markets is temporarily depressed due to supply chain corrections and macroeconomic factors, therefore our sales are well below long term trends. Nevertheless, the actions we took to improve our profitability and cash flow generation throughout 2023 are evident in our financial performance. And based on detailed assessments, we are confident that we've extended our leadership positions across our markets While our current sales are below trend, we expect that to change in the midterm as our markets begin to normalize. This creates an opportunity for us to increase our sales by more than $3 billion when that happens. As we capture that growth, we expect to deliver powerful incrementals because we already have the required production capacity and technical capabilities in place and the cost is already reflected in our financials. The incremental profit and cash flow annuity created by increasing sales by $3 billion plus is a terrific opportunity for our shareholders, and we expect to start making progress towards realizing that opportunity in 2024. Now it's difficult to call the specific timing of a recovery, but we continue to see signs that it will occur in 2024. As a result, we expect the first quarter to be our low quarter of the year. So, that's a summary of where we are and how we seek to create value in the medium term. I'd like to provide some additional facts and perspective. At the start of 2023, we introduced plans to improve profitability and cash flow in this lower-demand environment. Throughout the year, we took action to restore our productivity ratios to historical levels and to raise price to more appropriately share inflation with our customers. I'm happy to report we delivered on our plans. When you look at our fourth quarter results on a year-over-year basis, the evidence of our progress is quite clear. We increased gross margin by 330 basis points and free cash flow by $110 million to $0.5 billion despite sales being down by more than $350 million. Our profitability and productivity improvements led to significantly improved free cash flow conversion and we expect to continue converting profit to cash at attractive rates going forward. Overall, our results in the quarter and throughout 2023 demonstrate that we continue to make solid progress advancing our market leadership, strengthening our profitability and improving our cash flow generation even in the lower demand environment we're experiencing. As a result, we're entering this year operationally strong. Now we intend to build on this strength. As I previously mentioned, we have an opportunity to increase our sales by more than $3 billion in the medium term. Let's take a deeper look as to why we believe this. I shared a bit of how we're thinking about Optical Communications on the last call. I'll start there again today because it's a significant part of our opportunity. We anticipate Optical Communications sales will spring back because we believe and our carrier customers have confirmed that they purchased excess inventory during the pandemic and that they've been utilizing this inventory to continue deploying their networks. We believe these carriers will soon deplete their inventory and execute on the increased broadband deployment plans they've communicated to us over the last several months. As a result, we expect them to return to their normal purchasing patterns to service their deployments. We also continue to expect speed funding for network builds in underserved areas to begin in the second half of 2024 and continue adding to our addressable market for several years. Additionally, we expect to grow hyperscale sales in support of the growing role of cloud computing and the need to build the second optical network necessary to directly connect the GPUs that drive artificial intelligence. Last quarter, I shared trend lines for fiber shipments, which showed that we are significantly below trend and outlined why we expect our sales to get back on trend. I'd now like to update you on progress during the fourth quarter. Here you see Corning's fiber shipments measured in fiber kilometers since the beginning of 2007. The trend line shows a 7.3% compound annual growth rate over the last decade compared to a 6.6% CAGR for industry fiber shipments over the same period. As I explained during our third quarter call, our fiber shipments in quarter one of 2023 were basically in line with expected market trends, but started to drop below our trend line in quarter two and even more so in quarter three, with our shipments more than 30% below trend line, primarily due to elevated carrier inventory levels. We now have another quarter of data to share. In the Q4, we saw a small uptick in fiber shipments, but they remain more than 30% below trend. More importantly, our regular sit downs with key customers indicate that they are deploying at a higher rate than they are purchasing as they continue to make progress on drawing down inventory. Additionally, they have plans to increase deployments in 2024. We look forward to updating you on takeaways from our next round of sit downs. We're also seeing encouraging signs in hyperscale. Overall orders grew in the fourth quarter and we're seeing the earliest edge of AI related network builds in our order books. Returning to trend adds more than 40% to our revenue run rate for Optical Communications and we are laser focused on doing just that. Beyond that, we expect the strong underlying growth trend to continue far into the future and our sales to grow faster than the market through more Corning innovations. Optical fiber remains the ascendant technology with growing applications in wireless, cloud computing including AI and broadband efforts to connect the unconnected. As those applications grow, we have new product innovations in each that will increase our revenue per installed fiber. Government incentives to ensure everyone has Internet access also extend the long term trend line. Display provides another example of how our sales will spring back. Retail sales During the fourth quarter selling season were softer than industry expectations. Panel makers responded by reducing their fourth quarter utilization levels. Additionally, industry reports indicate that panel makers plan to run at lower utilization levels in the first quarter as they continue to align panel supply to demand with fab shutdowns planned during the Lunar New Year holidays in February. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect the glass market and our volume to be down by a mid-single digit percentage sequentially. For the full year of 2024, our expectations are in line with the industry. We anticipate relatively flat television unit volume, another year of TV screen size growth, and some recovery in PC demand. Combined, this adds mid-single digit growth in glass volume at retail versus 2023. We expect panel maker utilization to increase after the first quarter to meet the expected retail demand. As a result, we expect our financial performance to significantly improve from our first quarter run rate. Longer term, we expect continued volume growth in retail to be mainly driven by television screen size growth as it has the past several years and for some improvement in units as consumer demand normalizes. Well, we expect to win in this market because we are the undisputed technology leader. Our successful development and capability in Gen 10.5 aligns with the continued move to larger sized TVs produced on the lowest cost platforms for large displays. Life Sciences is another segment where market normalization contributes significantly to our expected growth. Customers in North America and in Europe are completing their inventory drawdowns. We are continuing our productivity and operations improvements, and we're refocusing our commercial and production efforts on drug discovery and production as the market returns. We also continue to evolve our products and business model for vials in our pharmaceutical technologies business. In addition to markets returning to normal, we continue to execute our more Corning content opportunities across the company. In Mobile Consumer Electronics and Automotive, we see more Corning as the primary growth mechanism. Let's look first at Mobile Consumer Electronics. Since 2016, handhelds have declined 21%, while our sales of Gorilla Glass have increased 41%. Now, we've done this by advancing the state-of-the-art for cover materials. And this is just a classic more Corning play. We have a strong innovation portfolio in support of our close collaborations with leading OEMs. And we expect to continue delivering new products that increase our content per device. You saw a great example of this earlier in January in our announcement with Samsung about Corning Gorilla Armor, which dramatically enhances sunlight readability and scratch resistance. Extreme ultraviolet lithography, or EUV, a market we serve with our advanced optics products, is another great, more Corning opportunity. We are the market leader for the photo mask and mirror materials of choice for GPUs and other advanced semiconductors. In automotive, proposed US EPA regulations would require adoption of gasoline particulate filters and provide an incremental driver of demand for our market-leading GPF offerings. In terms of more Corning, GPF adds two to three times the content opportunity in ICE vehicles. This would mean significant growth in our environmental business, even in the face of global BEV adoption. Additionally, we're winning both interior and exterior auto glass business, as customers increasingly view our solutions to be system enabling components. As I wrap up, here's what I'd like to leave you with. A majority of our markets are operating below trend. And as a result, our 2023 full year sales are down from the prior year. In this lower demand environment, we have successfully taken actions to improve our profitability and cash flow, and we believe we have extended our leadership positions across our businesses. We are confident that our markets will normalize. And as they do, we have an opportunity to increase our annual sales by more than $3 billion. As we capture that growth, we expect to deliver powerful incrementals since the required capacity and technical capabilities are already in place and the costs are already in our financials. This represents a terrific opportunity for our shareholders. We expect to make progress on this opportunity in 2024 and we believe the first quarter is our low quarter of the year. While it's difficult to call this specific timing of a recovery, we will continue our regular engagements with our large optical customers to review their recent deployments in detail and better understand their plans for deployments in 2024 and beyond. Following the Lunar New Year, we'll have similar meetings with our display customers. And we look forward to updating you in the next few months at investor conferences on our learnings and our progress. As I conclude, I'd like to remind you that the essence of what we do here at Corning is invent, make, and sell. We drive durable multi-year growth by inventing category defining products, developing scalable manufacturing platforms, and building strong trust-based relationships with our customers who are the leaders in their industries. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed, so that he can get into the details of our results and our outlook.\nEd Schlesinger: Thank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone. I will start by summarizing a few key takeaways and then I'll move to the fourth quarter results. Our full year sales were $13.6 billion, down 8%, reflecting our markets being well below long-term trends. Despite the lower sales, we improved profitability and cash flow by restoring productivity ratios back to historical levels and offsetting inflation by raising prices. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we expanded gross margin by 330 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2022, despite sales being down by more than $350 million, and we grew free cash flow sequentially every quarter from first quarter levels. As you heard from Wendell, we have an opportunity to increase our sales by more than $3 billion in the medium term as our markets normalize. And we have in place the necessary production capacity and technical capabilities to service that growth. Our operations and finance teams are collaborating closely on processes and tools to ensure that we capture the growth and operating leverage required to deliver significant incremental profit and cash flow. We expect to make progress during 2024. Moving to fourth quarter results. Sales were $3.3 billion, gross margin was 37%, EPS was $0.39, and free cash flow was $487 million. Now, let me provide some details on our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales for the fourth quarter were $903 million, down 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting temporarily lower demand from carrier customers as they continued to draw down inventory. Net income for the quarter was $88 million, down 3% sequentially on the lower volume. Longer term, we remain confident that Optical Communications market will normalize. We believe that the industry's underlying growth drivers are intact, specifically broadband, 5G, cloud computing, and advanced AI. We will also benefit from public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the US population. And from an order rate perspective, we are beginning to see green shoots in the hyperscale data center space. Moving to Display Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $869 million, down 11% sequentially. The remainder of our second half price increases partially offset a sequential volume decline that was consistent with the market. Results -- retail results during the fourth quarter selling season were softer than industry expectations. Panel makers responded by reducing their fourth quarter utilization levels. Additionally, industry reports indicate that panel makers plan to run at lower utilization levels in the first quarter as they continue to align panel supply to demand with fab shutdowns planned during the Lunar New Year holidays in February. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect the glass market and our volume to be down by a mid-single digit percentage sequentially. For the full year of 2024, our expectations are in line with the industry. We anticipate relatively flat television unit volume, another year of TV screen size growth, and some recovery in PC demand. This adds mid-single digit growth in glass volume at retail versus 2023. We expect panel maker utilization to increase after the first quarter to meet the expected retail demand growth. As a result, we expect our financial performance to significantly improve from our first quarter run rate. Moving to pricing, we successfully executed a double-digit price increase at our customers in the second half of 2023. We expect the pricing environment to remain favorable with glass supply balanced to demand as display glassmakers reduced capacity in 2023. We expect our Q1 2024 glass prices to be consistent with Q4 of 2023. In Specialty Materials, sales in the fourth quarter were $473 million, down 16% sequentially, following strong third quarter sales of our smartphone cover materials in support of customer product launches. Net income was $58 million, down 19% sequentially, reflecting the lower volumes. In Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $429 million, down 4% sequentially, reflecting normal seasonality. Net income was $98 million, consistent sequentially. For the full year, sales increased 11% to $1.8 billion, outpacing the automotive market recovery. Our content-driven growth strategy and increased GPF adoption due to mid-year implementation of China 6b regulations led to our outperformance. In Life Sciences, sales in the fourth quarter were $242 million, up 5% sequentially. Customers in North America and Europe are completing their inventory drawdowns. Additionally, productivity improvements allowed us to improve service levels to better supply the market as it normalizes. Net income improved sequentially to $17 million, up 31%, resulting from higher volume and productivity improvements. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses, sales in the fourth quarter were $356 million, up 9% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher semiconductor polysilicon volume. Now let's turn to our outlook. We expect sales in the first quarter of approximately $3.1 billion. We expect EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.38. The improvements we made in profitability and cash flow will continue to deliver benefits in 2024. We expect gross margin in the first quarter of \u201824 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2023, despite lower sales, and to improve first quarter free cash flow by $200 million to $300 million versus the first quarter of 2023. We expect the first quarter to be our low quarter. We believe we are going to grow from these levels for the following reasons. In Optical Communications, we expect carriers to complete inventory drawdowns and increase deployments throughout the year. We also see orders increasing from hyperscale data center customers. In Display, we expect panel maker utilization to increase from first quarter levels to meet expected full year retail demand. In Life Sciences, we expect markets to continue normalizing. And we plan to deliver more Corning content opportunities in mobile consumer electronics and environmental technologies. Now, I'd like to take a minute to address currency exchange rates. As a reminder, we have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect our cash flow, enhance our ability to invest, and protect shareholder returns. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We have received more than $2.5 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception. Our largest exposure is the Japanese yen. As we've previously shared with investors, we have most of our 2024 yen exposure hedged. We plan to keep our yen core rate at [JPY107] (ph) through the end of 2024. As we look ahead, we are actively working to improve our hedge coverage for 2025. The yen forward curve works in our favor. If you go out one year, the forward yen rate is about JPY7 stronger than today's spot rate. Out two years, it's about JPY12 stronger and so on. Also, the current yen spot rate is significantly weaker than the 30-year average of approximately JPY110. So we believe there will be an opportunity to place additional long-term hedges at more attractive rates. And in combination with hedging, we can institute an industrial solution, like pricing increases for display glass, the first step of which we took in 2023. So that's how we think about it. It will either solve in the currency markets in a reasonable timeframe or will move to an industrial solution. Now before I wrap up, I want to spend a minute on our priorities to maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders. We ended the year with $1.8 billion in cash. We've created one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is 23 years, with only $1.4 billion in debt coming due in the next five years, and no significant debt coming due in any given year. And essentially all of our debt instruments are fixed rate. Additionally, we prioritize returning excess cash to shareholders. We have consistently done this including throughout the pandemic. And one of the ways we do that is through dividends. We have grown our dividend 40% since 2019, and our dividend yield is top quartile in the S&P 500. We will propose that our board maintains a quarterly dividend of $0.28 in the first quarter and we will continue to be opportunistic on share repurchases. Now, here's what I want to leave you with today. We are entering the year operationally and financially strong. We expect the first quarter to be the low quarter of the year. We have an opportunity to capture $3 billion plus in sales over the medium term as markets normalize and we capture more Corning content opportunities. As we do, we are positioned to capture significant incremental profit and cash flow because we have the capacity and capabilities in place and the costs are already in our financials. I look forward to updating you on our progress. And now, I will turn things back over to Ann.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Ed. Shannon, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I joined the call late. So I apologize if you already covered this on the prepared remarks, but can you give us an update on the CapEx clearance for this year? And how you see your cash flows are shaping up throughout the year? And to what extent, when should we expect the company to become more active in buyback program? And I have a follow-up.\nEd Schlesinger: Sure. Thanks, Mehdi, for your question. So first of all, we expect our CapEx in 2024 to be about $1.2 billion below our 2023 levels. As we mentioned, we have the capacity in place to deliver what we expect to be a significant sales opportunity. So we don't necessarily need to add a lot of CapEx. With respect to cash flow, what I shared was that we are guiding Q1 to be about $200 million to $300 million better than the prior year, better than Q1 of 2023. And we expect to continue to make progress on profitability and cash flow as our sales come back. And then I think your last question was around buybacks. Okay, yeah. So, we, of course, we always prioritize in returning cash, excess cash, to shareholders, and we will continue to look to do that through both our dividend and buybacks. I don't have anything specific to report right now on buybacks.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Sorry for multi-part first question, but just if I may quickly squeeze the second question. In the optical business, have you seen any change to increasing broadband access? Is there any update on the BEADS program you can share with us? Or BEADS contribution?\nWendell Weeks: So we continue to expect BEAD funding really to start to translate into demand, the beginning of it, sort of late this year. They are progressing with awarding the grants and it will just take a bit for those to turn into real programs. So we expect sort of late this year.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. I was wondering, Wendell, if you could characterize sort of midterm as you think about the $3 billion opportunity that you're talking about incrementally. And can you give us some sense of how you see that opportunity across your segments? Sounds like you're -- probably most of that is going to be optical, given the magnitude of inventory correction there, but would love any color you can share on that.\nWendell Weeks: Sure. Thanks, Wamsi. So, as you would expect, we expect the market to normalize at a different rate depending on the market. And then we expect our more Corning pieces to come in, in timing with the particular innovation. So those will have some markets that will begin this year. And we'll have some which will make even more progress as time goes on. When we say midterm, by and large we mean that within the next three years that we will see all of it, right? But we'll start to see it beginning to happen sooner in different markets. Does that make sense, Wamsi? Is that responsive to your question?\nWamsi Mohan: Yeah, yeah, that's helpful. And, Wendell, just -- is there -- would you say that the off the $3 billion incremental, half of it is optical, more than that is optical? How would you define sort of how do you can break that out across your segments?\nWendell Weeks: Okay. So it's a little harder to answer that because the actual opportunity between our markets returning to normal and our more Corning activities is larger than the $3 billion. So -- and then we discount back to what we're talking to you about, right? And so therefore, when you do the relative shares, it gets non-trivial to figure out. But I think, Wamsi, your fundamental grasp that the biggest individual mover will be that 40% up opportunity in optical, I think your own thought processes here are really solid.\nWamsi Mohan: Thanks, Wendell. Sorry, if I could just ask one clarifying question\u2026\nWendell Weeks: Sure.\nWamsi Mohan: \u2026on your comment around price or Ed\u2019s comment on price as a lever to offset potentially the currency movement. You've done a great job using your contracts with some of your customers on display such that you've been a price taker and it's kind of eliminated a lot of the price competition for share reasons. Should we think that that regime has sort of ended and now we're in a new regime where you are willing to force pricing and not be a price taker anymore? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: So, I'm not positive I understand your question, but let me tell you how we tend to think about pricing and display. And it really sort of ties back to Ed's commentary around the yen. You've seen us do in really across our whole platform that we have sought to share inflation more appropriately with our customers. And that has led us to be a price increaser across our company and that has helped us improve our profitability. In display, we've been doing that. Perhaps more importantly is almost the reverse of that. What has happened with the yen being so well below, at sort of 130 year -- I mean it\u2019s a 30-year average, is that our customers are getting a lower price real in yen, right, while they sell in dollars. And we're fundamentally seeking to share that more appropriately with our customers. And so what we say is like, either the yen will come back sometime here in the reasonable point of time, right? Or we will raise price to provide an industrial solution to have us be in a position where we can continue to earn the appropriate return on our invested capital in display that our shareholders expect rightly. So what Ed's commentary there on pricing has to do with is really tying around the totality of that situation and how our customers experience their price since we price in yen. Does that make sense to you, sir?\nWamsi Mohan: Yeah, yeah it does, Wendell. Thank you so much.\nAnn Nicholson: All right, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citi. Your line is now open.\nAsiya Merchant: All right, thank you for taking my question. On optical, if I may, it seems like there was an order uptick or some sort of a demand uptick that you mentioned in 4Q. If you could drill down one more into that, if that was from your service provider or cloud customers? And then looking ahead into 1Q, what should we be expecting for optical here better than seasonal trends? And again, if you could drill down if you're seeing that from your service provider or cloud customers, thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks, really excellent question. So first, that tick-up you see, right, in our data, isn't big enough yet for us to go, oh yeah, it's happening the way we expect. Right? It's encouraging, but it's too small for us to over-conclude something analytically. Anecdotally, the conversations with our customers and what we can see from their data is that they are deploying at higher rates for carrier customers, to get to your question of where is it. They continue to deploy in those numbers at higher rates than their purchases. So they continue to draw down numbers in that piece. I think the other -- now moving beyond just that fiber shipment data, right, what else are we seeing? We are beginning to see the tick up already in hyperscale in our order book, not yet in those shipments that you see in that data. So there's an area where we're starting to get nice confirmatory to our anecdotal understanding of what will need to happen with these new Generative AI networks. And we're seeing sort of the cloud and the beginning, the leading edge of that second optical network that will need to get built to do these Generative AI programming. So that is what we're seeing in more of the detail. It's just too early yet for us to over-conclude and call timing. We'll know more in the coming months. Ed and Jeff and Ann are out there speaking with you all, they will make sure they share as we learn more. Does that work for you?\nAsiya Merchant: Yeah, great. And if I may, on display as well, I think it's tough to call when these panel makers come back with their utilization levels off of the 1Q down tick that you guys have talked about and I think the industry has talked about. But if the retail volume happens to be, let's say, mid to high single digits from a glass perspective and you're already starting the year with healthy inventory levels, is it reasonable to assume, like a, sharp snapback in 2Q and 3Q? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nEd Schlesinger: Yeah. Asiya, I'll take that one. And I won't give you a specific quarter. I think that's hard to call. But if you think about the Q1 panel maker utilization levels and a mid-single digit glass market for the year, you would need to see a double digit increase from their current levels in Q1 to achieve that glass market. And even if the glass market were lower than that, let's just say even flat, you would still need to see a double digit increase from their Q1 level. So I think the answer to the sharp part of your question is yes, the timing is obviously harder to call.\nAsiya Merchant: Okay. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe doubling down on Wamsi\u2019s question, just around whether you've seen with the pricing increases on the display business, any changes in share or has it largely played out as expected? And then maybe just second question, on the gross margin stability that you expect into Q1, is that from kind of efficiencies that you found in the business over the last year that are just starting to play in or kind of the pricing increases on the display business or is that from a mix of the business? Just how to think about that stability in Q1 over Q4? Thanks.\nEd Schlesinger: Yeah, hi, Meta. I'm going to -- I'll start with your second question on gross margin. So I think if you think about what we've done throughout \u201822, we improved our productivity across all of our factories significantly and back to historical levels, best demonstrated levels. That's improved our gross margin. We've also raised prices and we're now sort of right side up versus inflation. So that's improved gross margin. And we've certainly taken out some costs as well. So we're able to run at a much more efficient level, even at a lower volume, in a lower volume environment. That's allowed us to hold our gross margin, and we're also managing OpEx well, so that actually helps on the operating margin line. And that's what's allowed us to increase gross margin through the year despite sales falling, and that's why we feel confident around the gross margin or operating margin or both as we go into 2024. And I apologize, can you repeat the first question?\nWendell Weeks: I understood the first question. I think what...\nMeta Marshall: Yeah, just share on...\nWendell Weeks: Did our price increase lead to a disturbance of our market position. And we see no significant change in our market position as a result of our pricing actions to share more appropriately where the yen is at and where inflation is at.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nMartin Yang: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking our question. First question on display. Have you ever done an analysis similar to the chart that presented optical fiber thinking of a normal trendline for display volume in relation to current weakness on retail, particularly in China? China has been weak for quite a few years now. Are we significant below the trend line if there is such a more normal retail demand?\nWendell Weeks: So, excellent question. The answer is yes, we have done those. And we'd be happy to share this. We'll put that on our list to at some point in time this year. To be a little more responsive to the specifics of your question, China is just behaving a little differently than what you would normally expect on display demand as a country goes through its development cycle. And you are right, it seems to be net underperforming. We are not counting on, in the dialogue that we've been having with you about the $3 billion spring that we have. We are not counting on China \u201csort of\u201d reverting to a more traditional demand cycle. We're continuing to expect that to be relatively below trend for the foreseeable future. Does that make sense to you, Martin?\nMartin Yang: Yeah, definitely. Thank you. Another question on specialty, given that the semi-exposure within specialty has been pretty strong, has that changed that segment's seasonality a little bit, where it was more exposed to smartphone cycle, and now do you think that has shifted a little bit?\nWendell Weeks: I still think that the biggest thing that drives the seasonality or the different demand in different, I don't even know what to call it, seasonality, the different demand in different quarters is major product launches. And also major product launches not only of our customers, but also of us introducing a major new category defining product. And any sort of real analysis of this sort of points to it's the product, right? So I don't know that we can over-conclude much beyond that yet, Mark.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you. That's all from me.\nAnn Nicholson: Great. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my questions, and thanks for all the color today on the call. Maybe just the way I'm interpreting your comment about the $3 billion opportunity that you have in front of you is, let's say hypothetically the markets do recover by 4Q of this year, your exit run rate on a quarterly revenue would be somewhere close to $4 billion. And maybe just help us sort of then range bound some of the sort of the revenue opportunities here in terms of if you don't see a macro improvement by the end of the year, what is sort of the exit run rate for the year if you just have the seasonal improvements that you've talked about from 1Q onwards without a material macro improvement that hopefully gives us some sense of where the potential outcomes are here in terms of exiting the year? And then a quick follow-up, I guess, Wendell you mentioned BEAD a few times and the visibility here that it starts late in 2024. One of the suppliers reporting this morning as well is pushing out some of that expectation to early 2025, saying things are looking a bit more delayed than usual, just any more color on what's sort of driving the confidence that it's more 2024 than 2025. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you. I think perhaps, my emphasis was a little wrong in talking about BEAD. We expected to start, this is what I was trying to say, it's not going to be a big mover in 2024. I think your understanding is correct. It starts to become a much bigger mover in 2025. So if I created any dissonance with that understanding that you had, I didn't mean to. I think you have a correct understanding of it. It's just that it actually, it has been not there and now it's going to be there beginning in 2024. But the bulk of it starts after that.\nEd Schlesinger: And, Samik, I'll take the first part of your question. I want to start by just talking a little bit, we did it in our prepared remarks and then a little in Q&A, on the drivers of why we grow and why we think our first quarter is the low quarter. I think in optical, as carriers continue to deplete their inventory, that will come to an end, even if they don't increase their deployment rates, which we think they will, but even if they don't, that is a good demand driver for us that will start at some point this year. Okay? In display, we talked about panel maker utilization being really low in the first quarter and needing to sort of spring up from that level quite significantly. And then in Life Sciences, we're seeing market normalization in North America and Europe and we actually started to see a little bit of that happening even in the fourth quarter, right? So those drivers, we expect to bring our run rate up significantly as we go through the year. The timing is really hard to call. And so I think sitting here today, I would not want to leave you with a specific guide for the fourth quarter or how we exit the year, but just that we believe Q1 is the low. And if we got to levels like you spoke about, okay, that'd be awesome. And we would be well on our way to that $3 billion that Wendell talked about. But even if we don't, we still feel very confident in that window of time that Wendell shared earlier. Does that help?\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes, no, thank you. Thanks for the color. Thank you for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJosh Spector: Yeah, hi, good morning. Two quick ones. First, just on the FX side of it, understanding you're hedging at a lower spot rate today when you look out to \u201825 and you have some industrial options. Is there really a timing or milestone we should be looking at, at some point this year where you would know what the impact might be in 2025, be it you're doing some pricing action, you have hedging locked in, and then you might communicate what that impact would be to us?\nWendell Weeks: Yes.\nJosh Spector: You're not willing to share roughly what that timing would be?\nWendell Weeks: I thought you'd take yes.\nJosh Spector: I'll push a little further.\nWendell Weeks: Yes. And no, we're not going to share what timing we will.\nJosh Spector: All right, fair enough.\nWendell Weeks: It's too involved with our customers. I'm not being non-responsive. That's why I really do think that yes is about right. This is super important with our customers. And so we want to get that pretty well advanced and have a high confidence of where we're going to end up before we share that with our shareholders, right, so that we can make sure we're as accurate as possible. And that's -- so I'm not going to give ourselves an exact timeline, but this year, you can expect us to do that.\nJosh Spector: Got it. Appreciate that. And just quickly on free cash flow, in the first quarter your guidance of up a few hundred million, it would seem that's a pretty low bar given that there was about $0.5 billion of working capital use last year and your expectation on margins are relatively flat. So are there any offsets we should be considering in the first half of the year that maybe make that a little bit less favorable from what we could see otherwise?\nEd Schlesinger: I don't think so. I think we expect to have a nice year on free cash flow for the year. Nothing specific I would call out.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Okay. We can do one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatt Niknam: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. I'll keep it fairly brief. On the $3 billion incremental sales opportunity, maybe for -- a question for Ed, can you just walk us through the incremental growth and operating margins this would come in at? And is it safe to assume there's minimal incremental CapEx here? I\u2019m just trying to understand, is this more opportunity to scale past existing OpEx or is there a gross margin accretion opportunity as well? And then this may be a more open-ended question, but on the macro relative to the last call three months ago, maybe for Wendell, any material changes in customer demand or spending plans across key verticals, i.e., what's really changed would you say, if at all, over the last three months in terms of customer demands or customer conversations you're having? Thanks.\nEd Schlesinger: Yeah, I'll go first, Matt, on your first question. So I'll start off with, we have the capital in place or the capacity in place to deliver the sales. So first, from a cash flow perspective, typically we would add CapEx as we add sales. So that's a positive for free cash flow as we go forward. We also have the depreciation in our P&L for those assets. And then we also have some fixed cash costs that run through our P&L to support those assets. So generally speaking, the fixed costs are already in our P&L. So you would expect our gross margin to accrete at a higher level than our current gross margin level. So that's one operating leverage point or leverage point, if you will. And then I think on OpEx, we can also grow without adding OpEx much from these levels and that creates a second leverage point for us. So that should accrete both gross margin and operating margin from our current levels, and you should start to see that as the volume comes back.\nWendell Weeks: On your question of, in our discussions with our customers, sort of what are the anecdotals, and it's a really good question because sometimes highly quantitative analysis and data points one way and anecdotal evidence points the other, right? And in those situations, that's telling you, there's dissonance there and how do we dive deeper to make sure we have the right data set and how do we create an understanding of those things that are pointing differently. In this case, what we're seeing is the anecdotals are in support of what we're seeing in our deeper analytics in our understanding of being well below our long-term trends and a need for that to revert back towards those underlying huge secular trends that drive our demand over time. So basically reinforcing the opinion of the data. And that is what we tried to reflect in what we discussed with you today.\nMatt Niknam: Very helpful. Thank you both.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Wendell. Thanks, Matt. Thank you everybody for joining us today. Before we close, I wanted to let you know that we'll be attending the Susquehanna Financial Group 13th Annual Technology Conference on March 1st and the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference on March 5th. In addition, we will host management visits to investor offices in select cities. Finally, a replay of today's call will be available on our site starting later this morning. Once again, thank you, and operator, you can disconnect all lines.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Schlesinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone. I will start by summarizing a few key takeaways and then I'll move to the fourth quarter results. Our full year sales were $13.6 billion, down 8%, reflecting our markets being well below long-term trends. Despite the lower sales, we improved profitability and cash flow by restoring productivity ratios back to historical levels and offsetting inflation by raising prices. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we expanded gross margin by 330 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2022, despite sales being down by more than $350 million, and we grew free cash flow sequentially every quarter from first quarter levels. As you heard from Wendell, we have an opportunity to increase our sales by more than $3 billion in the medium term as our markets normalize. And we have in place the necessary production capacity and technical capabilities to service that growth. Our operations and finance teams are collaborating closely on processes and tools to ensure that we capture the growth and operating leverage required to deliver significant incremental profit and cash flow. We expect to make progress during 2024. Moving to fourth quarter results. Sales were $3.3 billion, gross margin was 37%, EPS was $0.39, and free cash flow was $487 million. Now, let me provide some details on our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales for the fourth quarter were $903 million, down 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting temporarily lower demand from carrier customers as they continued to draw down inventory. Net income for the quarter was $88 million, down 3% sequentially on the lower volume. Longer term, we remain confident that Optical Communications market will normalize. We believe that the industry's underlying growth drivers are intact, specifically broadband, 5G, cloud computing, and advanced AI. We will also benefit from public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the US population. And from an order rate perspective, we are beginning to see green shoots in the hyperscale data center space. Moving to Display Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $869 million, down 11% sequentially. The remainder of our second half price increases partially offset a sequential volume decline that was consistent with the market. Results -- retail results during the fourth quarter selling season were softer than industry expectations. Panel makers responded by reducing their fourth quarter utilization levels. Additionally, industry reports indicate that panel makers plan to run at lower utilization levels in the first quarter as they continue to align panel supply to demand with fab shutdowns planned during the Lunar New Year holidays in February. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect the glass market and our volume to be down by a mid-single digit percentage sequentially. For the full year of 2024, our expectations are in line with the industry. We anticipate relatively flat television unit volume, another year of TV screen size growth, and some recovery in PC demand. This adds mid-single digit growth in glass volume at retail versus 2023. We expect panel maker utilization to increase after the first quarter to meet the expected retail demand growth. As a result, we expect our financial performance to significantly improve from our first quarter run rate. Moving to pricing, we successfully executed a double-digit price increase at our customers in the second half of 2023. We expect the pricing environment to remain favorable with glass supply balanced to demand as display glassmakers reduced capacity in 2023. We expect our Q1 2024 glass prices to be consistent with Q4 of 2023. In Specialty Materials, sales in the fourth quarter were $473 million, down 16% sequentially, following strong third quarter sales of our smartphone cover materials in support of customer product launches. Net income was $58 million, down 19% sequentially, reflecting the lower volumes. In Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $429 million, down 4% sequentially, reflecting normal seasonality. Net income was $98 million, consistent sequentially. For the full year, sales increased 11% to $1.8 billion, outpacing the automotive market recovery. Our content-driven growth strategy and increased GPF adoption due to mid-year implementation of China 6b regulations led to our outperformance. In Life Sciences, sales in the fourth quarter were $242 million, up 5% sequentially. Customers in North America and Europe are completing their inventory drawdowns. Additionally, productivity improvements allowed us to improve service levels to better supply the market as it normalizes. Net income improved sequentially to $17 million, up 31%, resulting from higher volume and productivity improvements. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses, sales in the fourth quarter were $356 million, up 9% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher semiconductor polysilicon volume. Now let's turn to our outlook. We expect sales in the first quarter of approximately $3.1 billion. We expect EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.38. The improvements we made in profitability and cash flow will continue to deliver benefits in 2024. We expect gross margin in the first quarter of \u201824 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2023, despite lower sales, and to improve first quarter free cash flow by $200 million to $300 million versus the first quarter of 2023. We expect the first quarter to be our low quarter. We believe we are going to grow from these levels for the following reasons. In Optical Communications, we expect carriers to complete inventory drawdowns and increase deployments throughout the year. We also see orders increasing from hyperscale data center customers. In Display, we expect panel maker utilization to increase from first quarter levels to meet expected full year retail demand. In Life Sciences, we expect markets to continue normalizing. And we plan to deliver more Corning content opportunities in mobile consumer electronics and environmental technologies. Now, I'd like to take a minute to address currency exchange rates. As a reminder, we have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect our cash flow, enhance our ability to invest, and protect shareholder returns. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We have received more than $2.5 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception. Our largest exposure is the Japanese yen. As we've previously shared with investors, we have most of our 2024 yen exposure hedged. We plan to keep our yen core rate at [JPY107] (ph) through the end of 2024. As we look ahead, we are actively working to improve our hedge coverage for 2025. The yen forward curve works in our favor. If you go out one year, the forward yen rate is about JPY7 stronger than today's spot rate. Out two years, it's about JPY12 stronger and so on. Also, the current yen spot rate is significantly weaker than the 30-year average of approximately JPY110. So we believe there will be an opportunity to place additional long-term hedges at more attractive rates. And in combination with hedging, we can institute an industrial solution, like pricing increases for display glass, the first step of which we took in 2023. So that's how we think about it. It will either solve in the currency markets in a reasonable timeframe or will move to an industrial solution. Now before I wrap up, I want to spend a minute on our priorities to maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders. We ended the year with $1.8 billion in cash. We've created one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is 23 years, with only $1.4 billion in debt coming due in the next five years, and no significant debt coming due in any given year. And essentially all of our debt instruments are fixed rate. Additionally, we prioritize returning excess cash to shareholders. We have consistently done this including throughout the pandemic. And one of the ways we do that is through dividends. We have grown our dividend 40% since 2019, and our dividend yield is top quartile in the S&P 500. We will propose that our board maintains a quarterly dividend of $0.28 in the first quarter and we will continue to be opportunistic on share repurchases. Now, here's what I want to leave you with today. We are entering the year operationally and financially strong. We expect the first quarter to be the low quarter of the year. We have an opportunity to capture $3 billion plus in sales over the medium term as markets normalize and we capture more Corning content opportunities. As we do, we are positioned to capture significant incremental profit and cash flow because we have the capacity and capabilities in place and the costs are already in our financials. I look forward to updating you on our progress. And now, I will turn things back over to Ann. Sure. Thanks, Mehdi, for your question. So first of all, we expect our CapEx in 2024 to be about $1.2 billion below our 2023 levels. As we mentioned, we have the capacity in place to deliver what we expect to be a significant sales opportunity. So we don't necessarily need to add a lot of CapEx. With respect to cash flow, what I shared was that we are guiding Q1 to be about $200 million to $300 million better than the prior year, better than Q1 of 2023. And we expect to continue to make progress on profitability and cash flow as our sales come back. And then I think your last question was around buybacks. Okay, yeah. So, we, of course, we always prioritize in returning cash, excess cash, to shareholders, and we will continue to look to do that through both our dividend and buybacks. I don't have anything specific to report right now on buybacks. Yeah. Asiya, I'll take that one. And I won't give you a specific quarter. I think that's hard to call. But if you think about the Q1 panel maker utilization levels and a mid-single digit glass market for the year, you would need to see a double digit increase from their current levels in Q1 to achieve that glass market. And even if the glass market were lower than that, let's just say even flat, you would still need to see a double digit increase from their Q1 level. So I think the answer to the sharp part of your question is yes, the timing is obviously harder to call. Yeah, hi, Meta. I'm going to -- I'll start with your second question on gross margin. So I think if you think about what we've done throughout \u201822, we improved our productivity across all of our factories significantly and back to historical levels, best demonstrated levels. That's improved our gross margin. We've also raised prices and we're now sort of right side up versus inflation. So that's improved gross margin. And we've certainly taken out some costs as well. So we're able to run at a much more efficient level, even at a lower volume, in a lower volume environment. That's allowed us to hold our gross margin, and we're also managing OpEx well, so that actually helps on the operating margin line. And that's what's allowed us to increase gross margin through the year despite sales falling, and that's why we feel confident around the gross margin or operating margin or both as we go into 2024. And I apologize, can you repeat the first question? And, Samik, I'll take the first part of your question. I want to start by just talking a little bit, we did it in our prepared remarks and then a little in Q&A, on the drivers of why we grow and why we think our first quarter is the low quarter. I think in optical, as carriers continue to deplete their inventory, that will come to an end, even if they don't increase their deployment rates, which we think they will, but even if they don't, that is a good demand driver for us that will start at some point this year. Okay? In display, we talked about panel maker utilization being really low in the first quarter and needing to sort of spring up from that level quite significantly. And then in Life Sciences, we're seeing market normalization in North America and Europe and we actually started to see a little bit of that happening even in the fourth quarter, right? So those drivers, we expect to bring our run rate up significantly as we go through the year. The timing is really hard to call. And so I think sitting here today, I would not want to leave you with a specific guide for the fourth quarter or how we exit the year, but just that we believe Q1 is the low. And if we got to levels like you spoke about, okay, that'd be awesome. And we would be well on our way to that $3 billion that Wendell talked about. But even if we don't, we still feel very confident in that window of time that Wendell shared earlier. Does that help? I don't think so. I think we expect to have a nice year on free cash flow for the year. Nothing specific I would call out. Yeah, I'll go first, Matt, on your first question. So I'll start off with, we have the capital in place or the capacity in place to deliver the sales. So first, from a cash flow perspective, typically we would add CapEx as we add sales. So that's a positive for free cash flow as we go forward. We also have the depreciation in our P&L for those assets. And then we also have some fixed cash costs that run through our P&L to support those assets. So generally speaking, the fixed costs are already in our P&L. So you would expect our gross margin to accrete at a higher level than our current gross margin level. So that's one operating leverage point or leverage point, if you will. And then I think on OpEx, we can also grow without adding OpEx much from these levels and that creates a second leverage point for us. So that should accrete both gross margin and operating margin from our current levels, and you should start to see that as the volume comes back."

            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. Today we reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Sales for the fourth quarter were $3.3 billion and EPS was $0.39, in line with expectations. Free cash flow was $0.5 billion. Gross margin was 37%, consistent with the third quarter despite lower sequential sales. As I shared with you last quarter, demand in most of our markets is temporarily depressed due to supply chain corrections and macroeconomic factors, therefore our sales are well below long term trends. Nevertheless, the actions we took to improve our profitability and cash flow generation throughout 2023 are evident in our financial performance. And based on detailed assessments, we are confident that we've extended our leadership positions across our markets While our current sales are below trend, we expect that to change in the midterm as our markets begin to normalize. This creates an opportunity for us to increase our sales by more than $3 billion when that happens. As we capture that growth, we expect to deliver powerful incrementals because we already have the required production capacity and technical capabilities in place and the cost is already reflected in our financials. The incremental profit and cash flow annuity created by increasing sales by $3 billion plus is a terrific opportunity for our shareholders, and we expect to start making progress towards realizing that opportunity in 2024. Now it's difficult to call the specific timing of a recovery, but we continue to see signs that it will occur in 2024. As a result, we expect the first quarter to be our low quarter of the year. So, that's a summary of where we are and how we seek to create value in the medium term. I'd like to provide some additional facts and perspective. At the start of 2023, we introduced plans to improve profitability and cash flow in this lower-demand environment. Throughout the year, we took action to restore our productivity ratios to historical levels and to raise price to more appropriately share inflation with our customers. I'm happy to report we delivered on our plans. When you look at our fourth quarter results on a year-over-year basis, the evidence of our progress is quite clear. We increased gross margin by 330 basis points and free cash flow by $110 million to $0.5 billion despite sales being down by more than $350 million. Our profitability and productivity improvements led to significantly improved free cash flow conversion and we expect to continue converting profit to cash at attractive rates going forward. Overall, our results in the quarter and throughout 2023 demonstrate that we continue to make solid progress advancing our market leadership, strengthening our profitability and improving our cash flow generation even in the lower demand environment we're experiencing. As a result, we're entering this year operationally strong. Now we intend to build on this strength. As I previously mentioned, we have an opportunity to increase our sales by more than $3 billion in the medium term. Let's take a deeper look as to why we believe this. I shared a bit of how we're thinking about Optical Communications on the last call. I'll start there again today because it's a significant part of our opportunity. We anticipate Optical Communications sales will spring back because we believe and our carrier customers have confirmed that they purchased excess inventory during the pandemic and that they've been utilizing this inventory to continue deploying their networks. We believe these carriers will soon deplete their inventory and execute on the increased broadband deployment plans they've communicated to us over the last several months. As a result, we expect them to return to their normal purchasing patterns to service their deployments. We also continue to expect speed funding for network builds in underserved areas to begin in the second half of 2024 and continue adding to our addressable market for several years. Additionally, we expect to grow hyperscale sales in support of the growing role of cloud computing and the need to build the second optical network necessary to directly connect the GPUs that drive artificial intelligence. Last quarter, I shared trend lines for fiber shipments, which showed that we are significantly below trend and outlined why we expect our sales to get back on trend. I'd now like to update you on progress during the fourth quarter. Here you see Corning's fiber shipments measured in fiber kilometers since the beginning of 2007. The trend line shows a 7.3% compound annual growth rate over the last decade compared to a 6.6% CAGR for industry fiber shipments over the same period. As I explained during our third quarter call, our fiber shipments in quarter one of 2023 were basically in line with expected market trends, but started to drop below our trend line in quarter two and even more so in quarter three, with our shipments more than 30% below trend line, primarily due to elevated carrier inventory levels. We now have another quarter of data to share. In the Q4, we saw a small uptick in fiber shipments, but they remain more than 30% below trend. More importantly, our regular sit downs with key customers indicate that they are deploying at a higher rate than they are purchasing as they continue to make progress on drawing down inventory. Additionally, they have plans to increase deployments in 2024. We look forward to updating you on takeaways from our next round of sit downs. We're also seeing encouraging signs in hyperscale. Overall orders grew in the fourth quarter and we're seeing the earliest edge of AI related network builds in our order books. Returning to trend adds more than 40% to our revenue run rate for Optical Communications and we are laser focused on doing just that. Beyond that, we expect the strong underlying growth trend to continue far into the future and our sales to grow faster than the market through more Corning innovations. Optical fiber remains the ascendant technology with growing applications in wireless, cloud computing including AI and broadband efforts to connect the unconnected. As those applications grow, we have new product innovations in each that will increase our revenue per installed fiber. Government incentives to ensure everyone has Internet access also extend the long term trend line. Display provides another example of how our sales will spring back. Retail sales During the fourth quarter selling season were softer than industry expectations. Panel makers responded by reducing their fourth quarter utilization levels. Additionally, industry reports indicate that panel makers plan to run at lower utilization levels in the first quarter as they continue to align panel supply to demand with fab shutdowns planned during the Lunar New Year holidays in February. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect the glass market and our volume to be down by a mid-single digit percentage sequentially. For the full year of 2024, our expectations are in line with the industry. We anticipate relatively flat television unit volume, another year of TV screen size growth, and some recovery in PC demand. Combined, this adds mid-single digit growth in glass volume at retail versus 2023. We expect panel maker utilization to increase after the first quarter to meet the expected retail demand. As a result, we expect our financial performance to significantly improve from our first quarter run rate. Longer term, we expect continued volume growth in retail to be mainly driven by television screen size growth as it has the past several years and for some improvement in units as consumer demand normalizes. Well, we expect to win in this market because we are the undisputed technology leader. Our successful development and capability in Gen 10.5 aligns with the continued move to larger sized TVs produced on the lowest cost platforms for large displays. Life Sciences is another segment where market normalization contributes significantly to our expected growth. Customers in North America and in Europe are completing their inventory drawdowns. We are continuing our productivity and operations improvements, and we're refocusing our commercial and production efforts on drug discovery and production as the market returns. We also continue to evolve our products and business model for vials in our pharmaceutical technologies business. In addition to markets returning to normal, we continue to execute our more Corning content opportunities across the company. In Mobile Consumer Electronics and Automotive, we see more Corning as the primary growth mechanism. Let's look first at Mobile Consumer Electronics. Since 2016, handhelds have declined 21%, while our sales of Gorilla Glass have increased 41%. Now, we've done this by advancing the state-of-the-art for cover materials. And this is just a classic more Corning play. We have a strong innovation portfolio in support of our close collaborations with leading OEMs. And we expect to continue delivering new products that increase our content per device. You saw a great example of this earlier in January in our announcement with Samsung about Corning Gorilla Armor, which dramatically enhances sunlight readability and scratch resistance. Extreme ultraviolet lithography, or EUV, a market we serve with our advanced optics products, is another great, more Corning opportunity. We are the market leader for the photo mask and mirror materials of choice for GPUs and other advanced semiconductors. In automotive, proposed US EPA regulations would require adoption of gasoline particulate filters and provide an incremental driver of demand for our market-leading GPF offerings. In terms of more Corning, GPF adds two to three times the content opportunity in ICE vehicles. This would mean significant growth in our environmental business, even in the face of global BEV adoption. Additionally, we're winning both interior and exterior auto glass business, as customers increasingly view our solutions to be system enabling components. As I wrap up, here's what I'd like to leave you with. A majority of our markets are operating below trend. And as a result, our 2023 full year sales are down from the prior year. In this lower demand environment, we have successfully taken actions to improve our profitability and cash flow, and we believe we have extended our leadership positions across our businesses. We are confident that our markets will normalize. And as they do, we have an opportunity to increase our annual sales by more than $3 billion. As we capture that growth, we expect to deliver powerful incrementals since the required capacity and technical capabilities are already in place and the costs are already in our financials. This represents a terrific opportunity for our shareholders. We expect to make progress on this opportunity in 2024 and we believe the first quarter is our low quarter of the year. While it's difficult to call this specific timing of a recovery, we will continue our regular engagements with our large optical customers to review their recent deployments in detail and better understand their plans for deployments in 2024 and beyond. Following the Lunar New Year, we'll have similar meetings with our display customers. And we look forward to updating you in the next few months at investor conferences on our learnings and our progress. As I conclude, I'd like to remind you that the essence of what we do here at Corning is invent, make, and sell. We drive durable multi-year growth by inventing category defining products, developing scalable manufacturing platforms, and building strong trust-based relationships with our customers who are the leaders in their industries. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed, so that he can get into the details of our results and our outlook. So we continue to expect BEAD funding really to start to translate into demand, the beginning of it, sort of late this year. They are progressing with awarding the grants and it will just take a bit for those to turn into real programs. So we expect sort of late this year. Sure. Thanks, Wamsi. So, as you would expect, we expect the market to normalize at a different rate depending on the market. And then we expect our more Corning pieces to come in, in timing with the particular innovation. So those will have some markets that will begin this year. And we'll have some which will make even more progress as time goes on. When we say midterm, by and large we mean that within the next three years that we will see all of it, right? But we'll start to see it beginning to happen sooner in different markets. Does that make sense, Wamsi? Is that responsive to your question? Okay. So it's a little harder to answer that because the actual opportunity between our markets returning to normal and our more Corning activities is larger than the $3 billion. So -- and then we discount back to what we're talking to you about, right? And so therefore, when you do the relative shares, it gets non-trivial to figure out. But I think, Wamsi, your fundamental grasp that the biggest individual mover will be that 40% up opportunity in optical, I think your own thought processes here are really solid. Sure. So, I'm not positive I understand your question, but let me tell you how we tend to think about pricing and display. And it really sort of ties back to Ed's commentary around the yen. You've seen us do in really across our whole platform that we have sought to share inflation more appropriately with our customers. And that has led us to be a price increaser across our company and that has helped us improve our profitability. In display, we've been doing that. Perhaps more importantly is almost the reverse of that. What has happened with the yen being so well below, at sort of 130 year -- I mean it's a 30-year average, is that our customers are getting a lower price real in yen, right, while they sell in dollars. And we're fundamentally seeking to share that more appropriately with our customers. And so what we say is like, either the yen will come back sometime here in the reasonable point of time, right? Or we will raise price to provide an industrial solution to have us be in a position where we can continue to earn the appropriate return on our invested capital in display that our shareholders expect rightly. So what Ed's commentary there on pricing has to do with is really tying around the totality of that situation and how our customers experience their price since we price in yen. Does that make sense to you, sir? Thanks, really excellent question. So first, that tick-up you see, right, in our data, isn't big enough yet for us to go, oh yeah, it's happening the way we expect. Right? It's encouraging, but it's too small for us to over-conclude something analytically. Anecdotally, the conversations with our customers and what we can see from their data is that they are deploying at higher rates for carrier customers, to get to your question of where is it. They continue to deploy in those numbers at higher rates than their purchases. So they continue to draw down numbers in that piece. I think the other -- now moving beyond just that fiber shipment data, right, what else are we seeing? We are beginning to see the tick up already in hyperscale in our order book, not yet in those shipments that you see in that data. So there's an area where we're starting to get nice confirmatory to our anecdotal understanding of what will need to happen with these new Generative AI networks. And we're seeing sort of the cloud and the beginning, the leading edge of that second optical network that will need to get built to do these Generative AI programming. So that is what we're seeing in more of the detail. It's just too early yet for us to over-conclude and call timing. We'll know more in the coming months. Ed and Jeff and Ann are out there speaking with you all, they will make sure they share as we learn more. Does that work for you? I understood the first question. I think what... Did our price increase lead to a disturbance of our market position. And we see no significant change in our market position as a result of our pricing actions to share more appropriately where the yen is at and where inflation is at. So, excellent question. The answer is yes, we have done those. And we'd be happy to share this. We'll put that on our list to at some point in time this year. To be a little more responsive to the specifics of your question, China is just behaving a little differently than what you would normally expect on display demand as a country goes through its development cycle. And you are right, it seems to be net underperforming. We are not counting on, in the dialogue that we've been having with you about the $3 billion spring that we have. We are not counting on China \u201csort of\u201d reverting to a more traditional demand cycle. We're continuing to expect that to be relatively below trend for the foreseeable future. Does that make sense to you, Martin? I still think that the biggest thing that drives the seasonality or the different demand in different, I don't even know what to call it, seasonality, the different demand in different quarters is major product launches. And also major product launches not only of our customers, but also of us introducing a major new category defining product. And any sort of real analysis of this sort of points to it's the product, right? So I don't know that we can over-conclude much beyond that yet, Mark. Thank you. I think perhaps, my emphasis was a little wrong in talking about BEAD. We expected to start, this is what I was trying to say, it's not going to be a big mover in 2024. I think your understanding is correct. It starts to become a much bigger mover in 2025. So if I created any dissonance with that understanding that you had, I didn't mean to. I think you have a correct understanding of it. It's just that it actually, it has been not there and now it's going to be there beginning in 2024. But the bulk of it starts after that. Yes. I thought you'd take yes. Yes. And no, we're not going to share what timing we will. It's too involved with our customers. I'm not being non-responsive. That's why I really do think that yes is about right. This is super important with our customers. And so we want to get that pretty well advanced and have a high confidence of where we're going to end up before we share that with our shareholders, right, so that we can make sure we're as accurate as possible. And that's -- so I'm not going to give ourselves an exact timeline, but this year, you can expect us to do that. On your question of, in our discussions with our customers, sort of what are the anecdotals, and it's a really good question because sometimes highly quantitative analysis and data points one way and anecdotal evidence points the other, right? And in those situations, that's telling you, there's dissonance there and how do we dive deeper to make sure we have the right data set and how do we create an understanding of those things that are pointing differently. In this case, what we're seeing is the anecdotals are in support of what we're seeing in our deeper analytics in our understanding of being well below our long-term trends and a need for that to revert back towards those underlying huge secular trends that drive our demand over time. So basically reinforcing the opinion of the data. And that is what we tried to reflect in what we discussed with you today."

[Operator Instructions] It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, and good morning. And welcome to Corning\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company\u2019s financial reports. You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. Third quarter GAAP EPS reflected restructuring and asset write-off charges, realized gains and unrealized non-cash mark-to-market losses on currency hedging contracts and non-cash mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company\u2019s Japanese yen denominated debt. As a reminder, mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They are also available on our website for downloading. And now I will turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. Today we reported our third quarter results. As expected, sales were $3.5 billion and EPS was $0.45. Gross margin expanded sequentially to 37% and free cash flow improved to $466 million. Our results demonstrate solid progress on the programs that we have put in place to increase price and improve productivity while lowering inventory. These initiatives led to improved gross margin and cash flow in the quarter despite volume coming in at the low end of our expectations in Optical Communications as carriers continue to draw down inventory and in Display Technologies as panel makers lowered utilization at the end of the quarter. Now let me share a couple of highlights for the quarter. I will start with gross margin. We drove an 80-basis-point sequential expansion to 37% on consistent sales, driven primarily by our pricing actions in Display. Additionally, if you compare the third quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of last year, when we launched our comprehensive plan, sales are down almost $200 million, yet we have expanded gross margin percent by 340 basis points. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect gross margin to be similar even with sales down sequentially. Moving to cash generation, free cash flow of $466 million grew sequentially by $156 million and grew year-over-year by $211 million, up 83% on lower sales. Our gross margin improvements and our ability to run with lower inventory levels, as well as lower CapEx levels are driving these results. Now this all leads to significantly improved free cash flow conversion and we expect to convert profit to cash at a strong rate going forward. Overall, our results in the quarter illustrate that we continue to make solid progress to reset our price and cost levels to enable an even stronger profit and cash flow cycle as our market volumes revert to mean. We also continue to demonstrate progress on our More Corning technology efforts. We extended our market leadership by collaborating with Apple to deliver durable glass with infused color, a first for any smartphone for the back of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus devices. These devices also feature Ceramic Shield, which we collaborated on with Apple to deliver a cover material with unparalleled smartphone performance. We also recently announced Corning Viridian Vials. This new technology can improve filling line efficiency by up to 50%, while reducing vial manufacturing carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by up to 30%. And just yesterday, we announced an expanded collaboration with long-time customer AUO to accelerate the production of their industry-leading large format curved Automotive display modules using our patented ColdForm technology. Stepping back, we are on the right track, enhancing profits, improving cash generation and delivering new products that capture More Corning content opportunities, all while maintaining our leading market positions. The area that continues to be problematic is our customer demand, especially the weaker carrier sales in Optical. So although we have hit our guidance to you for 11 consecutive quarters, weak customer demand has put us consistently at the lower end of our sales expectations over the last year even as we are outperforming on price and productivity plans. More importantly, we are well below the trend line for our operations profile. We have the capacity and the capability to deliver $3 billion plus in additional sales with minimal additional cash investments. As a result, this revenue will have powerful incrementals as it returns as long as we keep our capacity and our capabilities vibrant and ready to go. So as we assess our operations profile, we ask ourselves two broad questions. Will our revenue return and when? The first question is relatively straightforward to address. We simply ask ourselves, what are the long-term trends in our markets and where are we now versus those long-term trends? And then, of course, we need to feel confident that we will win in those markets. Are we the clear market leaders with superior technology offerings, lowest cost platforms and are we advancing More Corning opportunities to increase our value capture for the same volume. So first, let\u2019s look at the trends in our markets. We build our capacity and capabilities around long-term trends. We then modulate our operations and staffing around current volume run rates. So we must understand where our volume run rates are versus trend at all times. We do this for each of our businesses. Let me give you just one example, optical fiber as a good illustration. Here, you see industry shipments measured in fiber kilometers since the beginning of 2004. The trend line shows a 6.6% compound annual growth rate over the last decade. As you can see, the industry has been operating below trend line in the first half of 2023. Because industry shipments are reported with at least a quarter or two delay, I am going to switch to our own shipment data so that we can bring you up to real time, what we saw over the last few quarters and what we are projecting for quarter four. First thing to notice is, the trend line for our shipments has a 7.3% CAGR over the same 10-year period. We have been growing faster than the market. Now this just makes sense with everything we have shared with you about our More Corning strategy. Quarter one of 2023 was basically on track and our shipments started dropping away from the 7.3% CAGR line in quarter two and even more so in quarters three and quarter four. Currently, our shipment run rate is at least 30% below trend line. You can think about the 30% plus gap is carrying through all of our Optical revenues. Remember that fiber accounts for only a portion of our sales, we have significant value to our fiber with our cabling and connectivity solutions. So this gap to trend ripples through our entire Optical product portfolio. We feel the demand drop in our fiber sales, cable sales and equipment sales. We are confident that we will return to the long-term trend line. We believe that as customers deplete their inventories, the industry and our sales will resume growth. Just returning to trend adds more than 40% to our revenue run rate for Optical Communications. So that\u2019s what we mean when we say we will revert to mean and fiber is just one example, we use a similar methodology for key product lines in each of our maps, Automotive, Display, Mobile Consumer Electronics and Life Sciences, all of them. are showing a gap versus long-term trend lines. Right now, because we are operating well below long-term trend lines, we see an enormous opportunity as our markets revert to mean. Now as I noted a moment ago, because we anticipate this recovery across our markets, we need to know we will win as they bounce back. Are we maintaining our leadership position in advancing opportunities to grow faster? In short, yes, are we have built a more advantaged position for 80% plus of our revenues over the last few years. We are the technology leader, as well as the lowest cost producer, and we have built more opportunities to capitalize on growth in our markets, increasing our value capture with our More Corning approach. Let\u2019s look at a few examples. In Optical Communications, fiber optics remains the ascendant technology with growing applications in wireless, cloud computing, including AI and government efforts to connect the unconnected. Within each of these applications, we have new product innovations that will increase our revenue per installed fiber as those applications grow. We are building on our undisputed global cost and technology leadership position, along with our market leadership in North America. In Automotive, new U.S. EPA regulations go into effect starting in 2027. These new regulations force adoption of gasoline particulate filters and we are the inventor and clear market leader in GPS. We expect to see sales as early as 2026. In terms of More Corning, this adds 2 times to 3 times the content opportunity for ICE vehicles in the U.S. This means significant growth in our environmental business even in the face of global BEV adoption. In fact, we will still grow environmental sales up until BEV adoption reaches 40% of all vehicles globally and that is not forecast to happen until the next decade. Keep in mind, we have also built new revenue platforms with the successful introduction of our auto glass for interiors, which is being widely adopted in BEVs and offers hundreds of millions of dollars of growth opportunity for us. In Display, we have been and continue to be the undisputed leader in technology, quality and cost. Our successful development and capability in Gen 10.5 technology aligns with the continued move to larger size TVs with the lowest cost platforms for large displays. We continue to improve productivity, which allows us to free up assets to serve Gorilla Glass, Glass Ceramics and our growing Automotive Glass business. Finally, we continue to build entirely new product platforms that allow us to enter new categories for growth, examples include pharmaceutical packaging, automotive exterior glass for high autonomy systems and the rapidly growing opportunity to reassure U.S. solar capacity. In total, this amounts to a $3 billion plus incremental sales opportunity with minimal cash investment. Taken together, that\u2019s why we believe our revenues will recover. The next question is when? The answer to this question is less clear. Conventional wisdom is that customer demand in telecom display, semiconductor, smartphones, tablets and notebooks, bounces back in the second half of 2024. That seems plausible to us, but rather than trying to predict the timing of the recovery, we will continue to guide one quarter at a time based on our order entry models until visibility improves. We will continue our programs to improve price, productivity and cost so that we improve profitability and cash flow despite our muted sales outlook. This serves both the purpose of providing enhanced performance near-term, and more importantly, providing a better price and cost springboard for profitability as our volume reverts to trend. Simply put, we have the ability to deliver another $3 billion plus in sales with powerful incrementals and minimal cash investments. This represents such a significant opportunity for our shareholders that will maintain this powerful platform throughout this down cycle, all while we continue to improve our near-term profitability and cash flow. This is how we are steering our way through this period and I look forward to updating you on our progress. Now I will turn the call over to Ed so we can get into the details of our results and outlook.\nEd Schlesinger: Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our sales were $3.5 billion, gross margin was 37%, EPS was $0.45 and free cash flow was $466 million. This was in line with our expectations. However, I want to point out that volume in both Optical Communications and Display Technologies was below our expectations. This was offset by strong sales in Specialty Materials. Our gross margin was up 80 basis points sequentially on consistent -- on sales consistent with the prior quarter and 340 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was up $156 million sequentially and $211 million year-over-year. The increase in free cash flow was driven by improved profitability and inventory reductions. We also lowered capital expenditures in the quarter. Our improving profitability and cash, despite muted sales, demonstrates execution of our programmatic approach. Let me provide some details on our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales declined 14% sequentially to $918 million, reflecting lower order rates from carriers as they continue to draw down inventory. Net income was $91 million, down sequentially reflecting lower volumes. Looking ahead, we are not counting on improvements in our orders over the next six months. Longer term, we expect our growth to resume as customers complete the drawdown of their inventory. Additionally, we remain confident that the industry\u2019s underlying growth drivers are intact, specifically, broadband, 5G, cloud computing and advanced AI. There are also public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the U.S. population. In Display Technologies, third quarter sales were $972 million and net income was $242 million. Volume in the quarter was lower than our expectation. Net income grew 16% sequentially, reflecting the progress on our previously announced price increases. Here\u2019s an update on what we are seeing in the business. In line with what we told you last quarter, we are on track to achieve double-digit price increases at our customers in the second half. The impact of these complicated agreements flow through our financials in both the third and fourth quarters. These pricing actions resulted in net income margin of 25% in the third quarter, up 3 percentage points from 22% in the second quarter. On average, our customers are experiencing double-digit price increases with the majority of the impact in the third quarter. Year-over-year sales and net income were up 42% and 81%, respectively. Panel maker utilization declined as we exited the third quarter. And looking ahead to the fourth quarter, in line with industry reports, we expect panel makers to reduce utilization further from these levels and we expect the glass market and our volume to be down sequentially as much as low teens. Display industry analysts attribute the panel maker utilization decline to a wrestling match between panel makers and set makers over the significant panel price increases during 2023. This dynamic is expected to maintain a healthy supply chain exiting 2023, setting the stage for panel maker utilization to recover in the first half of 2024. However, despite lower sequential volume, we expect to maintain or improve our profitability levels in the fourth quarter as we continue to see the benefits of our pricing actions. For 2024, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable as we expect glass supply to be balanced to demand as multiple display glass makers have announced capacity reductions earlier this year. In Specialty Materials, sales in the third quarter were $563 million, up 33% sequentially. The improvement was driven by higher Gorilla Glass sales resulting from customer product launches in the quarter, which helped offset overall end market softness and continued solid demand for semiconductor optics drove another strong quarter for Advanced Optics. Net income was $72 million, up sequentially, primarily driven by higher volume and the adoption of premium cover materials. Moving to Environmental Technologies. Sales in the third quarter were $449 million, up 6% year-over-year, driven by ongoing growth of gasoline particulate filter adoption in China, which offset expected softness in heavy-duty markets in North America. Productivity improvement actions helped net income grow faster than sales to reach $99 million, up 14% year-over-year. In Life Sciences, sales in the third quarter were $230 million, consistent with the second quarter. Sales were down year-over-year, reflecting significantly lower demand for COVID-related products in China and the impact of customers drawing down inventory. Net income increased sequentially to $13 million, driven by productivity improvement actions. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses. Sales in the third quarter were $327 million, down 13% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, reflecting a decline in solar grade polysilicon prices and lower sales in pharmaceutical technologies as we completed the last of our volume commitments for COVID-related products in the second quarter. We are seeing continued strong demand for our solar grade polysilicon, which meets the need for a transparent, sustainable and traceable solar supply chain in the U.S. market. As a reminder, we have long-term take-or-pay contracts with our customers that have floor pricing mechanisms built in to help mitigate the impacts of spot market dynamics. Net income was a loss of $8 million, down sequentially driven by lower sales. Now let\u2019s turn to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $3.25 billion, driven by continued weak demand in Optical Communications, sequentially lower volume in our Display business, reflecting lower panel maker utilization, typical sales patterns in Specialty Materials following significant customer product launches in the third quarter and the possibility that the labor issues in the automotive industry could impact our Automotive business more in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter. We remain focused on our actions to improve profitability and cash flow during this low volume period. As a result of our continued execution we expect to deliver another quarter of strong free cash flow and a gross margin percentage similar to the third quarter despite lower sequential sales. We expect EPS of $0.37 to $0.42. Before I wrap up, I\u2019d like to reiterate our commitment to strong financial discipline. We are maintaining a strong and efficient balance sheet. For example, we have one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is approximately 25 years with only a little more than $1 billion in debt coming due in the next five years and we have no significant debt coming due in any given year. Let me leave you with a few final thoughts. In the near-term, we will continue our focus on improving profitability and cash flow despite the muted sales outlook for the quarter. At the same time, we will -- we remain well positioned to capture significant additional sales with minimal cash investment and longer term we remain confident in our ability to outperform our markets as they recover and to grow beyond prior peak sales run rates with strong incremental leverage. I look forward to updating you on our progress. Now I will turn things back over to Ann.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, Ed. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citi. Your line is now open.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you. If I could just dive a bit on Display and I apologize to jumped on the call later, I had another call at the same time. But if you can just talk to us a little bit about how you kind of see the Display environment improving in the -- as you guys look ahead, not just the fourth quarter, but due to 2024 as well and how we should think about the margin trajectory there? Thank you.\nEd Schlesinger: Yeah. Hi, Asiya. So a couple of things. So, first of all, as we talked about our price increases taking effect here in the back half of 2023. So that obviously improves our profitability in this space and we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable as we go into 2024. We talked about some glass makers taking capacity offline, which helps to keep supply and demand in balance. What we are seeing in the -- with respect to volume and panel maker utilization at the end of Q3 and in Q4, we view that as improving as we go into 2024. So we would say that the volume environment improves in 2024, the glass volume environment improves in 2024 as well. Does that answer your question?\nAsiya Merchant: Yeah. And if I may just...\nAnn Nicholson: On the fourth quarter, I know there\u2019s been some discussion on panel made utilization coming lower, but I am not -- I just wanted to reconcile that with your comments that the panel maker utilization will increase as you kind of look ahead.\nEd Schlesinger: Yeah. We think that what\u2019s happening in the fourth quarter is a temporary situation as panel makers and set makers work through their pricing environment. As you know, panel prices have increased throughout 2023. That said, we think the inventory levels, we exit the year with healthy inventory levels and retail doesn\u2019t really have to improve for panel maker utilization to go up at some point in 2024, we think that\u2019s relatively early in the year.\nAsiya Merchant: Got it. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Our next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nMartin Yang: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. On Display, do you feel that you have achieved what you set out to regarding pricing increase with your customers and do you expect additional benefits in 4Q from the price -- pricing change relative to 3Q?\nWendell Weeks: Yes. So we are -- these are super complicated agreements, okay? But fundamentally we are going to exit, we are going to have double-digit price increases as we flow through this back half. There will be further enhancement as we go into Q4. And all the dynamic that\u2019s going on in our guide is we are also expecting panel maker utilization, which started to lower as we exited quarter three, we are expecting that to be pretty low through the quarter as sort of panel makers and set makers wrestle around pricing themselves and so that\u2019s going to drive our volume down sequentially in quarter four. But we feel very good about the reset of the price and so we will continue to see those benefits in our profitability.\nMartin Yang: Thank you, Wendell. I have another question relating to Display and Automotive. I think the agreement you have, are new customers as AUO for ColdForm technology is an interesting one as AUO itself acquired a Tier 1 supplier recently in Automotive. Maybe can you talk about the cost and effect there is Corning having a bigger presence in Automotive triggered the AUO due the same or AUO\u2019s entry into Automotive led to a deeper collaboration between Corning and AUO Automotive Glass.\nWendell Weeks: Just because of the time cycles involved in materials development of our type of innovations, we start earlier, right? And then to have something novel like ColdForm just takes longer, right? What you are seeing is a lot of our long-term customers in Display are now looking to how do I apply those technology platforms to new areas. And what we have been able to do is help bridge them using our ColdForm technology and the strong access we have with Automotive players, right, to be able to bridge those long time customers to new market opportunities for them, all while they are sort of executing their move forward to add a lot more value to their Display Tech. I think it\u2019s a great example of AUO, like intellects is another [ph], right, where some of these Taiwanese based players as they face the growing competition from the new big Gen 10.5 plants that we facilitated in China, they are finding good ways to use their capacity and their capabilities to enter the Automotive stack.\nMartin Yang: Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe a question just on the Optical business and just whether there\u2019s any different trends between kind of your service provider customers and cloud customers, because kind of the 30% cutback in Q4 would be even more extreme, given the offsets of kind of cloud customers staying consistent. So I just want to get a sense of, is that trend line even more severe if you were just to take the service providers versus cloud customers? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: The simplest way to answer that is yes.\nMeta Marshall: And so maybe just any trends on the cloud customers would be helpful this quarter?\nWendell Weeks: 30% gap versus our long-term trend lines, that includes sort of what\u2019s going on in cloud and so does our run rate, right, and the other apps. So, yes, that is giving you -- you have a good understanding that the gap in that one area is even more dramatic than the 30% gap we are showing you in total.\nMeta Marshall: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Is that what you were asking?\nMeta Marshall: Yeah. I mean that is kind of the point, but I guess, I am just trying to get a sense that cloud customers are not pulling back as severely as well. There\u2019s nothing we should be noting on the cloud customers as well?\nWendell Weeks: Not that we are seeing. Now remember, cloud went through their own cycle sort of during the pandemic, right, and then adjusting to what they have to do with their value chains. And they are struggling now -- not struggling, but the reaming a lot of their CapEx is being aimed to do a large language model training and that basically adds a second network on the back end, adds even more fiber optic connections. So we have yet to start experiencing the rapid growth that, that represents in our run rate, right? But cloud has been pretty stable.\nMeta Marshall: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatt Niknam: Hey. Thank you for taking the question. Just one high level one and then one follow-up on Optical. First, from a high level, I mean, obviously, it sounds like you have got significant conviction in the longer term outlook. I mean, with that in mind, how do you think about the potential for accelerating share buybacks given where valuation sits today. And then just to go back to Optical, I am just wondering if you can talk to what sort of visibility you have into next year, particularly as we are sort of in a higher for longer interest rate environment. It would seem that although we have seen a 7% CAGR over the last decade, if we are, in fact, in a different rate dynamic, it may actually temper a lot of the enthusiasm relative to what we had seen a couple of years ago from some of your larger service providers. So just curious on any visibility into 2024 there? Thanks.\nEd Schlesinger: Hey, Matt. This is Ed. I will take a first question. So, first of all, the most important thing for us has been focused on improving our profitability and cash flow, obviously, if we improve our profit, that also improves our cash flow and I think we have done a nice job of that over the last several quarters. Our cash flow conversion was up nicely in Q2 and Q3 and we expect it to be up again here in Q4. So I think that\u2019s first things first. And then I think if you remember back earlier this year, we made the last payment to Samsung on the buyback we did back in 2021. So as we go forward, we will certainly have more firepower to do things like share buybacks. We haven\u2019t need any announcements. So we will come back and we will talk a little bit more about our plans next year, but I think you should feel good about where we are from a balance sheet and a cash flow perspective.\nWendell Weeks: I will take part two, I just want to add a little bit to Ed\u2019s answer to part one. We get that $3 billion plus revenue run rate back. Our shareholders are going to have a lot of fun. The incrementals on that are going to be really, really stunning, because they don\u2019t take much additional cash investment, it\u2019s really minimal, right? And because of our operating leverage, we are going to like that and we are going to have a ton of flexibility to do capital allocation that favors our shareholders. So does that make sense to you Matt before I jump to Opto visibility?\nMatt Niknam: It does. It does. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Okay. So Opto visibility, it\u2019s a great question. We are in the midst of our -- a detailed process with each and every one of our major carrier customers, just trying to figure out the answer to just that, right? What exactly are your deployments, what are your deployment plans, let\u2019s roll that forward sort of quarter-by-quarter detail-by-detail. Because of the privileged position that we have, they are willing to work with us at that level of detail. That is not complete yet. When it\u2019s complete, that will improve our visibility in that segment of our revenues. So more to come, I don\u2019t have the answer right now, but more to come. As you step back from that, which is really answering the question of when exactly does it return, right? Next year though. Will we return to trend? We are highly convicted. You saw what those trend lines are. We showed you over the last 10 years. I can go back 20 years. I can go back 30 years, right? We can keep going back, and you will see that trend line, right, because basically, that\u2019s what you see when you have an ascendant technology. We just keep entering markets with S-curves as fiber optics becomes the more economical way, as photons become more economical than electrons as bandwidth distance economics change and as more bandwidth goes up over shorter distances, basically more fiber goes in and that\u2019s why you see those type of long-term technology trend line. So will it return to trend? Absolutely, we are seeing Optics actually enter strongly markets that hasn\u2019t been before, right? And like wireless and we are seeing new applications like generative AI, which you need more fiber optic connections, right, for a given sort of compute power. So we feel good about the long-term trends. When? We are still working on it, Matt.\nMatt Niknam: Appreciate it. Thank you both.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Wendell, appreciate the charts and your comments on long-term trends in Optical, but you are calling out inventory digestion right now across cloud, and so clearly, that implies there was an inventory buildup. So your trend lines through 1Q 2023 embed some over shipment as well and I understand that\u2019s true even in historical cycles. But why do you think that the mean reversion wouldn\u2019t mean a lower steady state level, for instance, I think, in the PC market as an analogy, people thought $250 million was sustainably going to $300 million to $350 million and now we are back to $250 million and growing at low singles. So I am just kind of curious as to whether you think that there is a reset that happens to a lower level given, perhaps, overbuild over a longer period of time? And I have a follow-up.\nWendell Weeks: Okay. So first, where we are seeing the inventory draw down right now is primarily the carriers. I think you said cloud, but I think it\u2019s just misspoke. It\u2019s in carriers where we are seeing the drawdown occur, okay? Cloud is operating now more in balance. Does that make sense to you?\nWamsi Mohan: Yes.\nWendell Weeks: Okay. Good. So what drives those trend lines is, you are right, you would see that through the industry, it dipped above the line in 2022 and then you are seeing that adjustment below the line now, right? And you will see that throughout the entire time cycle and you are just looking at the fit against that, that gives you the CAGR. And what actually makes up that will always be sort of slightly different pieces of the network will be being built out at one point in time or another. We don\u2019t see anything that is reducing the application space for fiber. Everything we are seeing is increasing the application space for fiber, right? And that\u2019s just because rates, right, so I think line rates of how much bandwidth you need is going up. And that\u2019s across even short distances in places like hyperscale cloud, right? And because of that, you are seeing from a technology perspective, links which used to be copper or low fiber count, okay, become high fiber count all optical. And even going down to now our latest technology work, you see glass packaging, right, to be able to get right from the ASIC to optics as fast as possible, mainly because that\u2019s the most economical way to handle that communications to get to photon as quick as possible and we see this in market after market. So I don\u2019t see a collapsing market opportunity, I see a growing market opportunity and that\u2019s what drives those long-term CAGRs. So I would -- that\u2019s how we think about it. To your notebooks and PCs, I mean that\u2019s an interesting analogy. We could have done that market here because we track that. Our CAGRs, right, would have had that surge up, but we would have integrated the decades of experience we have in notebooks would have taken our forward projection rather than the -- what it did rather than the towards long-term at 300 basing [ph] 350. We would have been because of the way these trend lines work, we would have been well below because you don\u2019t have enough cumulative time at that 300 level, the 350 level to offset all that time that you have had well below that. Does that make sense to you?\nWamsi Mohan: Yeah. Yeah. It does, Wendell. I appreciate the color. I guess as a follow-up in the spirit of looking at the long-term here.\nWendell Weeks: Please do.\nWamsi Mohan: On the yen, if you look beyond 2024, can you give us some sense of how much exposure is hedged and at what level, given that we are back at sort of the 150 level again? And just curious if you could give out some color on sort of maybe just beyond 2024, looking at 2025, 2026, what percent and at what level you might be hedged at? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: So right now and I think did last quarter or maybe the quarter before, we are hedged through the end of next year, right? And beyond that, right, we have -- we don\u2019t have a significant amount of hedge in that time period. Ed, would you like to add?\nEd Schlesinger: Yeah. Two other things, Wamsi, that I would add. One, we recently raised price in Display. That\u2019s one way for us to address the yen. We are going to certainly readdress that or rethink about that as we go into 2024. And then, secondly, given the large differential in interest rates between Japan and the United States, there\u2019s a pretty steep forward curve yen. So if you go out a year, it\u2019s about \u00a56. So you go out another year, it\u2019s about \u00a512 and so on. So just as you think about the rate that\u2019s out there, it\u2019s not the 150, it\u2019s really the forward rate that matters to us because we could actually hedge at that rate right now. So the average over the next five years is below 130\u2026\nWendell Weeks: Yes.\nEd Schlesinger: \u2026 versus if you think about the rate yen in total being at 150. I just wanted to point that out.\nWamsi Mohan: Yeah. But it\u2019s going to lowest [ph]. Thanks, Ed.\nWendell Weeks: So that gives you an idea of the sort of ceiling on our exposure is what would be the average rate sort of post 2024 if we reestablish long-term hedging programs. And what we are trying to do is sort of balance to see we believe that there will be an opportunity, because of the way in which the currency markets work to be able to put in place more long-term hedges at rates we like. If that doesn\u2019t happen, we will institute an industrial fix, meaning price increase so that we maintain strong returns in this business for our shareholders and that\u2019s the way we tend to think of it. It will either solve relatively easily in the currency markets in the timeframe or will -- to an industrial solution, the first step of which you just saw this year.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisor. Your line is now open.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good morning. Wendell, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about some of the comments you made around the new revenue platforms and also some of the cyclicality in the business from two aspects. One, it seems like thinking about your comments that as you have instituted more technology, more value add into some of your served markets, you have created more cyclicality as well. I wonder if you would agree with that. And then, secondly, from my perspective, it seems like the $3 billion has somewhat disappointed over the last few years and especially as you think about how dynamics are changing maybe around demand for some of your COVID products, et cetera. Is it time to maybe look at that $3 billion and even though it has a lot of leverage, maybe pair back some of those products or see if they are better off in other places or with other companies? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Steve, I think that\u2019s a really good question. First, I want to make sure we are clear and we will follow up with you more. For us, the huge bulk of that $3 billion is not in new platforms, okay?\nSteven Fox: Okay.\nWendell Weeks: That\u2019s just in like fiber optics and some of the new products in it, regaining 40% growth to trend line, it\u2019s just like Display getting back to trend line. It\u2019s Automotive getting back to trend line. So it\u2019s the products you know and love, Steven, right, that you have been driving through your models for a long time, right? That is the stuff that is well below trend and that is the lion share of the $3 billion, right?\nSteven Fox: Okay.\nWendell Weeks: So the new platforms, which you speak, are a pretty small amount, right, of that gainer, right? And for those, I think, what we do is, as we have learned different things, we change our profile. So whether it\u2019s a pharmaceutical packaging, where we pivoted everything to serve COVID because we thought that was good for the world, right? Government funded a free plan for our shareholders, fine, right? Customers signed up to long-term take or pays, which we just completed sort of that take-or-pay process in quarter two for some of those things we signed up for to help deliver those lifesaving vaccines. And then we are saying, okay, so what do we pivot towards now and then we go to what\u2019s an asset-light strategy there and that\u2019s why we are opening up the technology stack and being able to enable other players in the industry, some of our competitors or some people like West, right, to sort of use our tech and then we return to our shareholders through a variety of mechanisms, everything from sort of licensing to go-to-market models that end up with us still capturing. So we will do that in each of these. We are always adjusting to what we see as the opportunity without doubt, as we go through this down cycle on revenues, it\u2019s significantly increases the skepticism, which we bring to new opportunities, right? So I think in that way, your concept is right and we will do that. But I think the thing where we are going to need to flush out for you more is it\u2019s not those areas, it\u2019s the $3 billion. It\u2019s just -- that\u2019s just getting back to run rate. We have demonstrated on products and people consume every day, okay? That makes sense to you, Steve?\nSteven Fox: Yeah. It does. You answered everything except for the one question on just sort of the cyclicality of the business now\u2026\nWendell Weeks: Oh! Got you.\nSteven Fox: \u2026your current stack?\nWendell Weeks: I started to think about that at the moment, you said it. It\u2019s super interesting, because like let\u2019s stay on fiber, given that we are adding so much more value now for fiber tip than we did, right? So therefore, when they go down, we -- when we lose a fiber tip now, it causes more revenue fall off than it used to when we were just a fiber maker.\nSteven Fox: Right.\nWendell Weeks: I think that\u2019s true. At the same time, the baseline is bigger, right? So I don\u2019t know if it increases cyclicality. Let me think about that mathematically myself or Jeff and you have got me curious. Let me do a little bit of quantitative work and we will get back to you, Steven.\nSteven Fox: Great. Appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: And one other quick thing to add on this, Steven, because one as you know, what we have done to try to fix volatility of technology substitution curves is, we take and spread across multiple markets our three core technologies and our four manufacturing engineering platforms. In that way, it sort of any given point in time, markets that don\u2019t move together, right, think like people don\u2019t consume smartphones related to their COVID-19 vaccination rates, right? They don\u2019t move together or cell and gene therapy doesn\u2019t move with buying large-size televisions, right? So even though they use some of those same core technologies we have. And one of the things, so we get a balancing effect to offset some of that cyclicality and volatility. What happened during COVID, so in general, if you were to look at over time, what we have built is, if you think about correlation as being like negative one be negatively correlated, zero would be not correlated at all and one being highly correlated, you move the same direction. We have gotten our correlation to be down to like, I don\u2019t know, 1.7 or so. So really relatively uncorrelated, which helps with that volatility. Then what happened in the pandemic as the pandemic sort of forced correlated a bunch of our markets that for different reasons, it don\u2019t have a lot to do with each other and our correlation levels started to get 0.7, right? So highly correlated. And so that is -- so we are seeing our markets which should be diversification effects before it\u2019s correlated by the pandemic and what\u2019s happened after. The good news here is we are starting to see them get non-correlated again. So we are starting to see that go back to historical patterns. Now if you ask me which one I would choose reverting to mean on the absolute level of revenues or reverting to mean on our level of diversification? I choose more revenue, but we are already seeing the progress on sort of what should be our long-term effects of dampening of volatility. That was more than\u2026\nSteven Fox: Okay.\nWendell Weeks: \u2026 you wanted to know, isn\u2019t it?\nSteven Fox: No. No. That\u2019s really interesting. That gave me a list of thought to\u2026\nWendell Weeks: Yeah.\nSteven Fox: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Steve. We will take one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJosh Spector: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. So just as you think about your, I guess, pent-up revenue potential here, that $3 billion, depending on when that comes back, maybe it\u2019s one year to three years depending on kind of how strong or weak the macro is, how do you think about your capital investment in light of that? You need to invest as much as you have over the last few years or is this a chance for you to step back on that and that markets tighten before you think about growth in that?\nWendell Weeks: I will start and then Ed can go after me, right? That\u2019s why we use the term minimal cash investment, right? We have got in place the capabilities and the capacity we need to support that $3 billion, right? So we do believe that you should see very muted CapEx and very high free cash flow conversion. But Ed, why don\u2019t you add?\nEd Schlesinger: Yeah. I would agree and I would say you are starting to see our capital spending coming down right now, you will continue to see that come down as we go through the fourth quarter and into next year as we finish up some of the things that we have been working on. So I agree with Wendell that we can support that and if there\u2019s something new that\u2019s not in that or something beyond that, we will talk about it with you all with respect to capital. But I think you can think of our conversion as being better than it has been over the last period of time, a couple of years.\nWendell Weeks: And what we are -- you are looking at here is, again, it\u2019s very unusual, which is sort of weird cycle with the pandemic and post-pandemic times is, I can\u2019t think of a time, right, where we had the opportunity to generate as much revenue with capability sets that we have got ready to go in such a fast time period. I mean it\u2019s -- so the incrementals here, they are a lot of set new records for us. That\u2019s what we are going to be seeking to do and that\u2019s the balance we are seeking to strike as we adjust to the run rate of today, we want to maintain that opportunity, because the power of that to create value for our shareholders is really, really powerful and interesting.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, Wendell. Thank you, Josh. I will wrap up for today. Thank you for joining us. Before we close, I wanted to let everyone know that we will be attending the UBS Technology Conference on November 28th. Thank you, Josh. Additionally, we will host management visits to investor offices in select cities. And finally, a web replay of today\u2019s call will be available on our site starting later this morning. Once again, thank you all for joining us. Operator, that concludes our call. You can disconnect all lines.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ed Schlesinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our sales were $3.5 billion, gross margin was 37%, EPS was $0.45 and free cash flow was $466 million. This was in line with our expectations. However, I want to point out that volume in both Optical Communications and Display Technologies was below our expectations. This was offset by strong sales in Specialty Materials. Our gross margin was up 80 basis points sequentially on consistent -- on sales consistent with the prior quarter and 340 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was up $156 million sequentially and $211 million year-over-year. The increase in free cash flow was driven by improved profitability and inventory reductions. We also lowered capital expenditures in the quarter. Our improving profitability and cash, despite muted sales, demonstrates execution of our programmatic approach. Let me provide some details on our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales declined 14% sequentially to $918 million, reflecting lower order rates from carriers as they continue to draw down inventory. Net income was $91 million, down sequentially reflecting lower volumes. Looking ahead, we are not counting on improvements in our orders over the next six months. Longer term, we expect our growth to resume as customers complete the drawdown of their inventory. Additionally, we remain confident that the industry's underlying growth drivers are intact, specifically, broadband, 5G, cloud computing and advanced AI. There are also public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the U.S. population. In Display Technologies, third quarter sales were $972 million and net income was $242 million. Volume in the quarter was lower than our expectation. Net income grew 16% sequentially, reflecting the progress on our previously announced price increases. Here's an update on what we are seeing in the business. In line with what we told you last quarter, we are on track to achieve double-digit price increases at our customers in the second half. The impact of these complicated agreements flow through our financials in both the third and fourth quarters. These pricing actions resulted in net income margin of 25% in the third quarter, up 3 percentage points from 22% in the second quarter. On average, our customers are experiencing double-digit price increases with the majority of the impact in the third quarter. Year-over-year sales and net income were up 42% and 81%, respectively. Panel maker utilization declined as we exited the third quarter. And looking ahead to the fourth quarter, in line with industry reports, we expect panel makers to reduce utilization further from these levels and we expect the glass market and our volume to be down sequentially as much as low teens. Display industry analysts attribute the panel maker utilization decline to a wrestling match between panel makers and set makers over the significant panel price increases during 2023. This dynamic is expected to maintain a healthy supply chain exiting 2023, setting the stage for panel maker utilization to recover in the first half of 2024. However, despite lower sequential volume, we expect to maintain or improve our profitability levels in the fourth quarter as we continue to see the benefits of our pricing actions. For 2024, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable as we expect glass supply to be balanced to demand as multiple display glass makers have announced capacity reductions earlier this year. In Specialty Materials, sales in the third quarter were $563 million, up 33% sequentially. The improvement was driven by higher Gorilla Glass sales resulting from customer product launches in the quarter, which helped offset overall end market softness and continued solid demand for semiconductor optics drove another strong quarter for Advanced Optics. Net income was $72 million, up sequentially, primarily driven by higher volume and the adoption of premium cover materials. Moving to Environmental Technologies. Sales in the third quarter were $449 million, up 6% year-over-year, driven by ongoing growth of gasoline particulate filter adoption in China, which offset expected softness in heavy-duty markets in North America. Productivity improvement actions helped net income grow faster than sales to reach $99 million, up 14% year-over-year. In Life Sciences, sales in the third quarter were $230 million, consistent with the second quarter. Sales were down year-over-year, reflecting significantly lower demand for COVID-related products in China and the impact of customers drawing down inventory. Net income increased sequentially to $13 million, driven by productivity improvement actions. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses. Sales in the third quarter were $327 million, down 13% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, reflecting a decline in solar grade polysilicon prices and lower sales in pharmaceutical technologies as we completed the last of our volume commitments for COVID-related products in the second quarter. We are seeing continued strong demand for our solar grade polysilicon, which meets the need for a transparent, sustainable and traceable solar supply chain in the U.S. market. As a reminder, we have long-term take-or-pay contracts with our customers that have floor pricing mechanisms built in to help mitigate the impacts of spot market dynamics. Net income was a loss of $8 million, down sequentially driven by lower sales. Now let's turn to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $3.25 billion, driven by continued weak demand in Optical Communications, sequentially lower volume in our Display business, reflecting lower panel maker utilization, typical sales patterns in Specialty Materials following significant customer product launches in the third quarter and the possibility that the labor issues in the automotive industry could impact our Automotive business more in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter. We remain focused on our actions to improve profitability and cash flow during this low volume period. As a result of our continued execution we expect to deliver another quarter of strong free cash flow and a gross margin percentage similar to the third quarter despite lower sequential sales. We expect EPS of $0.37 to $0.42. Before I wrap up, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to strong financial discipline. We are maintaining a strong and efficient balance sheet. For example, we have one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is approximately 25 years with only a little more than $1 billion in debt coming due in the next five years and we have no significant debt coming due in any given year. Let me leave you with a few final thoughts. In the near-term, we will continue our focus on improving profitability and cash flow despite the muted sales outlook for the quarter. At the same time, we will -- we remain well positioned to capture significant additional sales with minimal cash investment and longer term we remain confident in our ability to outperform our markets as they recover and to grow beyond prior peak sales run rates with strong incremental leverage. I look forward to updating you on our progress. Now I will turn things back over to Ann. Yeah. Hi, Asiya. So a couple of things. So, first of all, as we talked about our price increases taking effect here in the back half of 2023. So that obviously improves our profitability in this space and we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable as we go into 2024. We talked about some glass makers taking capacity offline, which helps to keep supply and demand in balance. What we are seeing in the -- with respect to volume and panel maker utilization at the end of Q3 and in Q4, we view that as improving as we go into 2024. So we would say that the volume environment improves in 2024, the glass volume environment improves in 2024 as well. Does that answer your question? Yeah. We think that what's happening in the fourth quarter is a temporary situation as panel makers and set makers work through their pricing environment. As you know, panel prices have increased throughout 2023. That said, we think the inventory levels, we exit the year with healthy inventory levels and retail doesn't really have to improve for panel maker utilization to go up at some point in 2024, we think that's relatively early in the year. Hey, Matt. This is Ed. I will take a first question. So, first of all, the most important thing for us has been focused on improving our profitability and cash flow, obviously, if we improve our profit, that also improves our cash flow and I think we have done a nice job of that over the last several quarters. Our cash flow conversion was up nicely in Q2 and Q3 and we expect it to be up again here in Q4. So I think that's first things first. And then I think if you remember back earlier this year, we made the last payment to Samsung on the buyback we did back in 2021. So as we go forward, we will certainly have more firepower to do things like share buybacks. We haven't need any announcements. So we will come back and we will talk a little bit more about our plans next year, but I think you should feel good about where we are from a balance sheet and a cash flow perspective. Yeah. Two other things, Wamsi, that I would add. One, we recently raised price in Display. That's one way for us to address the yen. We are going to certainly readdress that or rethink about that as we go into 2024. And then, secondly, given the large differential in interest rates between Japan and the United States, there's a pretty steep forward curve yen. So if you go out a year, it's about \u00a56. So you go out another year, it's about \u00a512 and so on. So just as you think about the rate that's out there, it's not the 150, it's really the forward rate that matters to us because we could actually hedge at that rate right now. So the average over the next five years is below 130... ... versus if you think about the rate yen in total being at 150. I just wanted to point that out. Yeah. I would agree and I would say you are starting to see our capital spending coming down right now, you will continue to see that come down as we go through the fourth quarter and into next year as we finish up some of the things that we have been working on. So I agree with Wendell that we can support that and if there's something new that's not in that or something beyond that, we will talk about it with you all with respect to capital. But I think you can think of our conversion as being better than it has been over the last period of time, a couple of years."

            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. Today we reported our third quarter results. As expected, sales were $3.5 billion and EPS was $0.45. Gross margin expanded sequentially to 37% and free cash flow improved to $466 million. Our results demonstrate solid progress on the programs that we have put in place to increase price and improve productivity while lowering inventory. These initiatives led to improved gross margin and cash flow in the quarter despite volume coming in at the low end of our expectations in Optical Communications as carriers continue to draw down inventory and in Display Technologies as panel makers lowered utilization at the end of the quarter. Now let me share a couple of highlights for the quarter. I will start with gross margin. We drove an 80-basis-point sequential expansion to 37% on consistent sales, driven primarily by our pricing actions in Display. Additionally, if you compare the third quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of last year, when we launched our comprehensive plan, sales are down almost $200 million, yet we have expanded gross margin percent by 340 basis points. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect gross margin to be similar even with sales down sequentially. Moving to cash generation, free cash flow of $466 million grew sequentially by $156 million and grew year-over-year by $211 million, up 83% on lower sales. Our gross margin improvements and our ability to run with lower inventory levels, as well as lower CapEx levels are driving these results. Now this all leads to significantly improved free cash flow conversion and we expect to convert profit to cash at a strong rate going forward. Overall, our results in the quarter illustrate that we continue to make solid progress to reset our price and cost levels to enable an even stronger profit and cash flow cycle as our market volumes revert to mean. We also continue to demonstrate progress on our More Corning technology efforts. We extended our market leadership by collaborating with Apple to deliver durable glass with infused color, a first for any smartphone for the back of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus devices. These devices also feature Ceramic Shield, which we collaborated on with Apple to deliver a cover material with unparalleled smartphone performance. We also recently announced Corning Viridian Vials. This new technology can improve filling line efficiency by up to 50%, while reducing vial manufacturing carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by up to 30%. And just yesterday, we announced an expanded collaboration with long-time customer AUO to accelerate the production of their industry-leading large format curved Automotive display modules using our patented ColdForm technology. Stepping back, we are on the right track, enhancing profits, improving cash generation and delivering new products that capture More Corning content opportunities, all while maintaining our leading market positions. The area that continues to be problematic is our customer demand, especially the weaker carrier sales in Optical. So although we have hit our guidance to you for 11 consecutive quarters, weak customer demand has put us consistently at the lower end of our sales expectations over the last year even as we are outperforming on price and productivity plans. More importantly, we are well below the trend line for our operations profile. We have the capacity and the capability to deliver $3 billion plus in additional sales with minimal additional cash investments. As a result, this revenue will have powerful incrementals as it returns as long as we keep our capacity and our capabilities vibrant and ready to go. So as we assess our operations profile, we ask ourselves two broad questions. Will our revenue return and when? The first question is relatively straightforward to address. We simply ask ourselves, what are the long-term trends in our markets and where are we now versus those long-term trends? And then, of course, we need to feel confident that we will win in those markets. Are we the clear market leaders with superior technology offerings, lowest cost platforms and are we advancing More Corning opportunities to increase our value capture for the same volume. So first, let's look at the trends in our markets. We build our capacity and capabilities around long-term trends. We then modulate our operations and staffing around current volume run rates. So we must understand where our volume run rates are versus trend at all times. We do this for each of our businesses. Let me give you just one example, optical fiber as a good illustration. Here, you see industry shipments measured in fiber kilometers since the beginning of 2004. The trend line shows a 6.6% compound annual growth rate over the last decade. As you can see, the industry has been operating below trend line in the first half of 2023. Because industry shipments are reported with at least a quarter or two delay, I am going to switch to our own shipment data so that we can bring you up to real time, what we saw over the last few quarters and what we are projecting for quarter four. First thing to notice is, the trend line for our shipments has a 7.3% CAGR over the same 10-year period. We have been growing faster than the market. Now this just makes sense with everything we have shared with you about our More Corning strategy. Quarter one of 2023 was basically on track and our shipments started dropping away from the 7.3% CAGR line in quarter two and even more so in quarters three and quarter four. Currently, our shipment run rate is at least 30% below trend line. You can think about the 30% plus gap is carrying through all of our Optical revenues. Remember that fiber accounts for only a portion of our sales, we have significant value to our fiber with our cabling and connectivity solutions. So this gap to trend ripples through our entire Optical product portfolio. We feel the demand drop in our fiber sales, cable sales and equipment sales. We are confident that we will return to the long-term trend line. We believe that as customers deplete their inventories, the industry and our sales will resume growth. Just returning to trend adds more than 40% to our revenue run rate for Optical Communications. So that's what we mean when we say we will revert to mean and fiber is just one example, we use a similar methodology for key product lines in each of our maps, Automotive, Display, Mobile Consumer Electronics and Life Sciences, all of them. are showing a gap versus long-term trend lines. Right now, because we are operating well below long-term trend lines, we see an enormous opportunity as our markets revert to mean. Now as I noted a moment ago, because we anticipate this recovery across our markets, we need to know we will win as they bounce back. Are we maintaining our leadership position in advancing opportunities to grow faster? In short, yes, are we have built a more advantaged position for 80% plus of our revenues over the last few years. We are the technology leader, as well as the lowest cost producer, and we have built more opportunities to capitalize on growth in our markets, increasing our value capture with our More Corning approach. Let's look at a few examples. In Optical Communications, fiber optics remains the ascendant technology with growing applications in wireless, cloud computing, including AI and government efforts to connect the unconnected. Within each of these applications, we have new product innovations that will increase our revenue per installed fiber as those applications grow. We are building on our undisputed global cost and technology leadership position, along with our market leadership in North America. In Automotive, new U.S. EPA regulations go into effect starting in 2027. These new regulations force adoption of gasoline particulate filters and we are the inventor and clear market leader in GPS. We expect to see sales as early as 2026. In terms of More Corning, this adds 2 times to 3 times the content opportunity for ICE vehicles in the U.S. This means significant growth in our environmental business even in the face of global BEV adoption. In fact, we will still grow environmental sales up until BEV adoption reaches 40% of all vehicles globally and that is not forecast to happen until the next decade. Keep in mind, we have also built new revenue platforms with the successful introduction of our auto glass for interiors, which is being widely adopted in BEVs and offers hundreds of millions of dollars of growth opportunity for us. In Display, we have been and continue to be the undisputed leader in technology, quality and cost. Our successful development and capability in Gen 10.5 technology aligns with the continued move to larger size TVs with the lowest cost platforms for large displays. We continue to improve productivity, which allows us to free up assets to serve Gorilla Glass, Glass Ceramics and our growing Automotive Glass business. Finally, we continue to build entirely new product platforms that allow us to enter new categories for growth, examples include pharmaceutical packaging, automotive exterior glass for high autonomy systems and the rapidly growing opportunity to reassure U.S. solar capacity. In total, this amounts to a $3 billion plus incremental sales opportunity with minimal cash investment. Taken together, that's why we believe our revenues will recover. The next question is when? The answer to this question is less clear. Conventional wisdom is that customer demand in telecom display, semiconductor, smartphones, tablets and notebooks, bounces back in the second half of 2024. That seems plausible to us, but rather than trying to predict the timing of the recovery, we will continue to guide one quarter at a time based on our order entry models until visibility improves. We will continue our programs to improve price, productivity and cost so that we improve profitability and cash flow despite our muted sales outlook. This serves both the purpose of providing enhanced performance near-term, and more importantly, providing a better price and cost springboard for profitability as our volume reverts to trend. Simply put, we have the ability to deliver another $3 billion plus in sales with powerful incrementals and minimal cash investments. This represents such a significant opportunity for our shareholders that will maintain this powerful platform throughout this down cycle, all while we continue to improve our near-term profitability and cash flow. This is how we are steering our way through this period and I look forward to updating you on our progress. Now I will turn the call over to Ed so we can get into the details of our results and outlook. Yes. So we are -- these are super complicated agreements, okay? But fundamentally we are going to exit, we are going to have double-digit price increases as we flow through this back half. There will be further enhancement as we go into Q4. And all the dynamic that's going on in our guide is we are also expecting panel maker utilization, which started to lower as we exited quarter three, we are expecting that to be pretty low through the quarter as sort of panel makers and set makers wrestle around pricing themselves and so that's going to drive our volume down sequentially in quarter four. But we feel very good about the reset of the price and so we will continue to see those benefits in our profitability. Just because of the time cycles involved in materials development of our type of innovations, we start earlier, right? And then to have something novel like ColdForm just takes longer, right? What you are seeing is a lot of our long-term customers in Display are now looking to how do I apply those technology platforms to new areas. And what we have been able to do is help bridge them using our ColdForm technology and the strong access we have with Automotive players, right, to be able to bridge those long time customers to new market opportunities for them, all while they are sort of executing their move forward to add a lot more value to their Display Tech. I think it's a great example of AUO, like intellects is another [ph], right, where some of these Taiwanese based players as they face the growing competition from the new big Gen 10.5 plants that we facilitated in China, they are finding good ways to use their capacity and their capabilities to enter the Automotive stack. The simplest way to answer that is yes. 30% gap versus our long-term trend lines, that includes sort of what's going on in cloud and so does our run rate, right, and the other apps. So, yes, that is giving you -- you have a good understanding that the gap in that one area is even more dramatic than the 30% gap we are showing you in total. Is that what you were asking? Not that we are seeing. Now remember, cloud went through their own cycle sort of during the pandemic, right, and then adjusting to what they have to do with their value chains. And they are struggling now -- not struggling, but the reaming a lot of their CapEx is being aimed to do a large language model training and that basically adds a second network on the back end, adds even more fiber optic connections. So we have yet to start experiencing the rapid growth that, that represents in our run rate, right? But cloud has been pretty stable. I will take part two, I just want to add a little bit to Ed's answer to part one. We get that $3 billion plus revenue run rate back. Our shareholders are going to have a lot of fun. The incrementals on that are going to be really, really stunning, because they don't take much additional cash investment, it's really minimal, right? And because of our operating leverage, we are going to like that and we are going to have a ton of flexibility to do capital allocation that favors our shareholders. So does that make sense to you Matt before I jump to Opto visibility? Okay. So Opto visibility, it's a great question. We are in the midst of our -- a detailed process with each and every one of our major carrier customers, just trying to figure out the answer to just that, right? What exactly are your deployments, what are your deployment plans, let's roll that forward sort of quarter-by-quarter detail-by-detail. Because of the privileged position that we have, they are willing to work with us at that level of detail. That is not complete yet. When it's complete, that will improve our visibility in that segment of our revenues. So more to come, I don't have the answer right now, but more to come. As you step back from that, which is really answering the question of when exactly does it return, right? Next year though. Will we return to trend? We are highly convicted. You saw what those trend lines are. We showed you over the last 10 years. I can go back 20 years. I can go back 30 years, right? We can keep going back, and you will see that trend line, right, because basically, that's what you see when you have an ascendant technology. We just keep entering markets with S-curves as fiber optics becomes the more economical way, as photons become more economical than electrons as bandwidth distance economics change and as more bandwidth goes up over shorter distances, basically more fiber goes in and that's why you see those type of long-term technology trend line. So will it return to trend? Absolutely, we are seeing Optics actually enter strongly markets that hasn't been before, right? And like wireless and we are seeing new applications like generative AI, which you need more fiber optic connections, right, for a given sort of compute power. So we feel good about the long-term trends. When? We are still working on it, Matt. Thanks. Okay. So first, where we are seeing the inventory draw down right now is primarily the carriers. I think you said cloud, but I think it's just misspoke. It's in carriers where we are seeing the drawdown occur, okay? Cloud is operating now more in balance. Does that make sense to you? Okay. Good. So what drives those trend lines is, you are right, you would see that through the industry, it dipped above the line in 2022 and then you are seeing that adjustment below the line now, right? And you will see that throughout the entire time cycle and you are just looking at the fit against that, that gives you the CAGR. And what actually makes up that will always be sort of slightly different pieces of the network will be being built out at one point in time or another. We don't see anything that is reducing the application space for fiber. Everything we are seeing is increasing the application space for fiber, right? And that's just because rates, right, so I think line rates of how much bandwidth you need is going up. And that's across even short distances in places like hyperscale cloud, right? And because of that, you are seeing from a technology perspective, links which used to be copper or low fiber count, okay, become high fiber count all optical. And even going down to now our latest technology work, you see glass packaging, right, to be able to get right from the ASIC to optics as fast as possible, mainly because that's the most economical way to handle that communications to get to photon as quick as possible and we see this in market after market. So I don't see a collapsing market opportunity, I see a growing market opportunity and that's what drives those long-term CAGRs. So I would -- that's how we think about it. To your notebooks and PCs, I mean that's an interesting analogy. We could have done that market here because we track that. Our CAGRs, right, would have had that surge up, but we would have integrated the decades of experience we have in notebooks would have taken our forward projection rather than the -- what it did rather than the towards long-term at 300 basing [ph] 350. We would have been because of the way these trend lines work, we would have been well below because you don't have enough cumulative time at that 300 level, the 350 level to offset all that time that you have had well below that. Does that make sense to you? Please do. So right now and I think did last quarter or maybe the quarter before, we are hedged through the end of next year, right? And beyond that, right, we have -- we don't have a significant amount of hedge in that time period. Ed, would you like to add? Yes. So that gives you an idea of the sort of ceiling on our exposure is what would be the average rate sort of post 2024 if we reestablish long-term hedging programs. And what we are trying to do is sort of balance to see we believe that there will be an opportunity, because of the way in which the currency markets work to be able to put in place more long-term hedges at rates we like. If that doesn't happen, we will institute an industrial fix, meaning price increase so that we maintain strong returns in this business for our shareholders and that's the way we tend to think of it. It will either solve relatively easily in the currency markets in the timeframe or will -- to an industrial solution, the first step of which you just saw this year. Steve, I think that's a really good question. First, I want to make sure we are clear and we will follow up with you more. For us, the huge bulk of that $3 billion is not in new platforms, okay? That's just in like fiber optics and some of the new products in it, regaining 40% growth to trend line, it's just like Display getting back to trend line. It's Automotive getting back to trend line. So it's the products you know and love, Steven, right, that you have been driving through your models for a long time, right? That is the stuff that is well below trend and that is the lion share of the $3 billion, right? So the new platforms, which you speak, are a pretty small amount, right, of that gainer, right? And for those, I think, what we do is, as we have learned different things, we change our profile. So whether it's a pharmaceutical packaging, where we pivoted everything to serve COVID because we thought that was good for the world, right? Government funded a free plan for our shareholders, fine, right? Customers signed up to long-term take or pays, which we just completed sort of that take-or-pay process in quarter two for some of those things we signed up for to help deliver those lifesaving vaccines. And then we are saying, okay, so what do we pivot towards now and then we go to what's an asset-light strategy there and that's why we are opening up the technology stack and being able to enable other players in the industry, some of our competitors or some people like West, right, to sort of use our tech and then we return to our shareholders through a variety of mechanisms, everything from sort of licensing to go-to-market models that end up with us still capturing. So we will do that in each of these. We are always adjusting to what we see as the opportunity without doubt, as we go through this down cycle on revenues, it's significantly increases the skepticism, which we bring to new opportunities, right? So I think in that way, your concept is right and we will do that. But I think the thing where we are going to need to flush out for you more is it's not those areas, it's the $3 billion. It's just -- that's just getting back to run rate. We have demonstrated on products and people consume every day, okay? That makes sense to you, Steve? Oh! Got you. I started to think about that at the moment, you said it. It's super interesting, because like let's stay on fiber, given that we are adding so much more value now for fiber tip than we did, right? So therefore, when they go down, we -- when we lose a fiber tip now, it causes more revenue fall off than it used to when we were just a fiber maker. I think that's true. At the same time, the baseline is bigger, right? So I don't know if it increases cyclicality. Let me think about that mathematically myself or Jeff and you have got me curious. Let me do a little bit of quantitative work and we will get back to you, Steven. And one other quick thing to add on this, Steven, because one as you know, what we have done to try to fix volatility of technology substitution curves is, we take and spread across multiple markets our three core technologies and our four manufacturing engineering platforms. In that way, it sort of any given point in time, markets that don't move together, right, think like people don't consume smartphones related to their COVID-19 vaccination rates, right? They don't move together or cell and gene therapy doesn't move with buying large-size televisions, right? So even though they use some of those same core technologies we have. And one of the things, so we get a balancing effect to offset some of that cyclicality and volatility. What happened during COVID, so in general, if you were to look at over time, what we have built is, if you think about correlation as being like negative one be negatively correlated, zero would be not correlated at all and one being highly correlated, you move the same direction. We have gotten our correlation to be down to like, I don't know, 1.7 or so. So really relatively uncorrelated, which helps with that volatility. Then what happened in the pandemic as the pandemic sort of forced correlated a bunch of our markets that for different reasons, it don't have a lot to do with each other and our correlation levels started to get 0.7, right? So highly correlated. And so that is -- so we are seeing our markets which should be diversification effects before it's correlated by the pandemic and what's happened after. The good news here is we are starting to see them get non-correlated again. So we are starting to see that go back to historical patterns. Now if you ask me which one I would choose reverting to mean on the absolute level of revenues or reverting to mean on our level of diversification? I choose more revenue, but we are already seeing the progress on sort of what should be our long-term effects of dampening of volatility. That was more than... ... you wanted to know, isn't it? Yeah. I will start and then Ed can go after me, right? That's why we use the term minimal cash investment, right? We have got in place the capabilities and the capacity we need to support that $3 billion, right? So we do believe that you should see very muted CapEx and very high free cash flow conversion. But Ed, why don't you add? And what we are -- you are looking at here is, again, it's very unusual, which is sort of weird cycle with the pandemic and post-pandemic times is, I can't think of a time, right, where we had the opportunity to generate as much revenue with capability sets that we have got ready to go in such a fast time period. I mean it's -- so the incrementals here, they are a lot of set new records for us. That's what we are going to be seeking to do and that's the balance we are seeking to strike as we adjust to the run rate of today, we want to maintain that opportunity, because the power of that to create value for our shareholders is really, really powerful and interesting."

[Operator Instructions] It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning's second quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the second quarter, the difference between GAAP and core EPS stemmed primarily from restructuring charges and from non-cash mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's currency hedging contracts and Japanese-yen-denominated debt. In total, these increased core earnings in the second quarter by $19 million. As a reminder, the mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. Today, we reported second quarter results to demonstrate strong progress on the priorities we've outlined to improve profitability and cash flow in the current weak end market environment. Sales were $3.5 billion. EPS was $0.45. Gross margin and operating margin increased sequentially to 36.2% and 17.5%, respectively; and free cash flow improved to $310 million. Ed will give you the details on each of these in just a few minutes. Our results reflect solid execution on our plan to deliver financial and operational improvements in response to the significant after effects of the pandemic still rippling across the global economy. Now we've been discussing this plan with you for several quarters. So, let me just briefly recap the primary factors we've been addressing. For one, supply chain disruptions caused higher logistics, freight and input costs. Additionally, inflation led to interest rate hikes than a spike in the U.S. dollar. And consumers shifted spending from goods to services as the pandemic abated. Against this backdrop, demand grew below historic trends in end markets that constitute the vast majority of our sales. Further, as supply chains started to normalize again over the last year, our customers began to drawdown inventory facilitate their transition from just in case, back to their typical just-in-time approach. Consequently, we're seeing a synchronization of lower sales across our portfolio that is highly unusual. Now this is because while our three core technologies and four manufacturing platforms do apply to all of our markets, the demand drivers in the different markets we serve are fundamentally uncorrelated. TV sales don't move with Automotive production. The Life Sciences market isn't correlated with fiber optic deployments and so on. Over the past several quarters, I've noted how all the factors I just outlined have taken a toll on profits and cash. And that's why we introduced a comprehensive plan to improve both profitability and cash flow at our current sales run rate, while also innovating to generate additional near and longer term revenue streams. I would like to now walk you through the elements of our plan and the strong results we're delivering. We're taking pricing actions. Most recently in Display, we expect these actions will contribute to overall profitability improvement in the third quarter. We've reduced our staffing levels to align with demand, and we are returning our productivity ratios to historic levels. And we're bringing inventory down across the company, because we no longer require buffer inventory and supply chains are improving. These sets of actions are delivering the intended results. In the first quarter, we improved gross margin by 160 basis points. And in the second quarter, we improved by another 100 basis points. Collectively, we've improved gross margin by 260 basis points to 36.2% versus where we ended 2022. As I said earlier, we also improved our free cash flow to $310 million in the quarter. As we move into the second half, we're not counting on a strong recovery in our end markets or a significant increase in our sales, but we do expect our profitability and cash generation to continue going up. Importantly, our actions will further improve profitability and cash generation when our markets recover. Our volume returns, and our sales increase. The products and services we enable smartphones, cars, TVs, broadband. These are central to many facets of daily life. So, we're confident that volume in our markets will recover to historical trend lines. In Display, for example, we believe the volume recovery has already begun. When we last spoke, panel makers had started to increase utilization at the end of the first quarter. Improvement continued in the second quarter, and we grew sales more than 20% sequentially, driven by higher volume. When we couple this volume return with the Display pricing actions I mentioned earlier, we expect to show additional profitability improvement in the third quarter. Now our goal is to return Display pre-pandemic profitability levels as we exit the third quarter. Let me now turn to how we intend to increase our profitability and grow our sales beyond our pre-pandemic run rates. Across our markets, we expect demand to normalize and our volume to return. As we drive more Corning content into those markets, we will further increase our profit as we create additional revenue streams. Now here are just a few exciting examples of More Corning innovations that are arriving in the near-term.  In Optical Communications, leaders in large language models are building data centers with what is essentially a second optical network, which is increasing connectivity by up to five times within individual data centers. So, we're commercializing a Gen 2, high-density, high-value optical interconnect system designed to enable the requirements and capture growth driven by AI. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we're launching two products this fall and next year, featuring innovations that significantly increase our value per device. In Automotive, we continue to increase the amount of Corning content in vehicles across the industry, as we pursue our $100 per car content opportunity. We recently commercialized a solution in our auto glass exterior business that takes a significant step to achieving this goal in electric vehicles. And for ICE vehicles, adoption of our gasoline particulate filter technology is now expanding to India. And the U.S. EPA has proposed regulations that would boost our content in the very large domestic market. In Life Sciences, we just launched Viridian Vials to address the growing need for sustainable products in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Viridian cuts the CO2 emissions from vial manufacturing by about a third and reduces glass by 20%, all while improving filling line efficiency by 50%. We're expanding our collaboration with West Pharmaceuticals, a leader in drug packaging to accelerate adoption. Now these are just a few examples of innovations and new product sets that you can expect to see in the near-term. Additionally, we're scaling our Solar business, which we expect to add hundreds of millions of dollars in annual profits and cash flow beginning in a couple of years. We expect all of these opportunities to further increase our profits as we create additional revenue streams across our markets. Whether it's in automotive, cloud computing, broadband, 5G, solar, pharmaceutical packaging, next-generation displays and cover materials, augmented reality or semiconductors, our role in key secular trends is material and compelling. We've built a robust opportunity set that will drive durable long-term growth. So, before I turn things over to Ed, here's what I'd like to leave you with today. The world is working through some significant after effects of the pandemic, and they're not trivial for our company. Our approach in this environment is not the count on conditions in our end markets or our sales improving significantly from the second quarter. And that's why we're guiding based on our current order rates. When we see our orders increase, will reflect these developments in operating plans and, of course, our guidance. For now, Corning is executing well on a comprehensive plan to improve profitability and cash flow throughout this low-volume period and to emerge stronger. Our efforts are already demonstrating significant results. In the first half of the year, we improved profitability and cash flow despite lower sales. Even in a muted sales environment, our pricing and productivity actions will continue to drive improvement in the second half. At the same time, our More Corning approach is driving new product launches that will create additional revenue streams. Altogether, as our end markets recover and our volume returns to historic levels, we're positioned to deliver improved profitability and cash flow with significant operating leverage on sales that will grow faster than our markets. In total, we feel good about execution. We're taking the right steps to improve our performance today and further improve our results when volume returns. And I look forward to updating you on our progress. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed, so he can get into the details of our results and outlook. Ed?\nEdward Schlesinger: All right. Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. As expected, in the second quarter, we improved profitability and cash flow in an overall weak demand environment. Second quarter sales were $3.5 billion, up 3% sequentially. EPS was $0.45, increasing $0.04 from the prior quarter. Gross margin and operating margin increased sequentially by 100 basis points to 36.2% and 200 basis points to 17.5%, respectively, reflecting progress on our pricing and productivity improvement actions. These results demonstrate the progress on and benefits from our comprehensive approach to improve profitability and cash flow, including continued actions to offset inflationary costs, return productivity levels to -- return productivity ratios to historical levels and reduce inventory. Now, let's turn to our segment results. Let me start with Optical Communications. I shared with you back in May that we were not seeing the typical seasonal uptick in our orders. Near-term demand for passive optical network products remains weak. And as the quarter progressed, orders came in at the low-end of our expectations. As a result, sales in the second quarter were $1.66 billion, down 5% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. As I'm sure you're hearing across the industry, carriers and enterprise operators are pushing projects into 2024 due to high inflation and rising interest rates. For now, we are sizing our operational plans based on the orders in our books. Net income was $140 million, down 12% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. The decline on lower volume was moderated by productivity improvements, as I shared in the first quarter. We raised price in this segment to more appropriately share inflationary costs with customers. While the demand for passive optical network products remains weak, longer term, we remain confident that the industry's underlying growth drivers are intact. We're pursuing four significant secular trends: broadband, 5G, the cloud, and the paradigm shift in computation necessary to train large language models and other advanced AI. We've got major innovation programs underway for each category. And our connectivity solutions offer economic advantages for a broader range of customers than ever before. And demand for optical networks is strongly supported by trends in computation as well by private and public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the population. Turning to Display Technologies. Sales in second quarter were $928 million, up 22% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Net income was $208 million, up 30% sequentially, primarily driven by higher volume. Second quarter panel maker utilization played out in line with the expectations I described three months ago. After reaching historic lows in 2022 and as recently as January, panel maker utilization has increased consistently, driving significant sequential volume increases. We believe that the display industry recovery is underway. Now let me update you on what has happened since our display price increase announcement in May. Since then, we've engaged with our customers and they understand our need to offset elevated costs. We expect to finalize agreements for double-digit price increases that will begin to go into effect in the third quarter. We expect our profitability to improve and to return pre-pandemic levels as we exit the quarter. Moving to Specialty Materials. Second quarter sales were down 13% year-over-year. This reflects continued end market softness. Sales increased 4% sequentially on higher Gorilla Glass sales. Net income was $33 million, down 15% sequentially, impacted by continued development costs for new product launches. Looking ahead, we believe that there are new innovation opportunities for us in emerging trends like augmented reality, vendable devices and AI that will extend our More Corning opportunities far into the future. For example, our world-leading optical materials and systems in our advanced optics business power EUV lithography technology. We enable the manufacturing of smaller, faster, more powerful chips, including GPUs. Global AI initiatives are accelerating demand for GPUs and for our EUV related products. In Environmental Technologies, second quarter sales were $457 million, up 6% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. Net income increased to $107 million on stronger sales and improved productivity. In Automotive, our sales were up 8% sequentially driven by the ramp of GPF sales in China based on regulations that are now in effect. We do not expect to see this level of GPF sales in in China the third quarter. Auto production levels remained steady quarter-over-quarter in North America and Europe. Year-over-year, our Automotive sales were up 40%, driven by the GPF ramp in China that I just mentioned and versus low auto sales in China during the 2022 COVID shutdowns and 2022 supply chain issues for automakers globally. In diesel, our sales were up 13% year-over-year, driven by heavy-duty demand in North America and Europe, which more than offset languishing demand in China. Turning to Life Sciences. Second quarter sales were $231 million, down 10% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Both the sequential and year-over-year sales declines resulted from lower demand for COVID-related products in China and by customers continuing to drawdown inventory. Net income increased sequentially to $11 million with productivity improvements more than offsetting lower sales. We expect our sales and profitability to improve as the industry corrects and as we continue to restore productivity ratios back to pre-pandemic levels. Finally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses, sales in the second quarter were $377 million consistent with the first quarter. Sales were down 10% year-over-year partly associated with a decline in solar-grade polysilicon spot prices. We are seeing continued strong demand for solar-grade polysilicon required to meet the need for a transparent, sustainable and traceable solar supply chain in the U.S. market. And we have long-term take-or-pay contracts with our customers that have floor price mechanisms built in to help mitigate the impacts of spot market dynamics. Net income increased sequentially to $26 million, up 4% year-over-year, driven by productivity improvements. Now let me spend a minute on our outlook for the third quarter. As we've been sharing with you, we are planning our operations based on our current order run rate. And we're continuing to take pricing and productivity actions to improve profitability and cash flow. We're adopting the same philosophy for our guidance. Based on our current order run rate, we expect our sales to come in roughly in line with quarter 2, approximately $3.5 billion. Orders begin to increase, we'll let you know. On roughly flat total company sales, we expect improved profitability and cash flow. We expect EPS to come in about the same or slightly better than the second quarter, and this factors in sequentially higher interest expense and a slightly higher tax rate. Of course, there are differing dynamics in each of our businesses. At a high level, we expect improvements in Display and Specialty Materials to be offset by declines in Optical Communications, driven by the dynamics I previously mentioned as well as declines in Environmental where we expect lower sales for GPF in China as the ramp is largely complete, and we expect lower demand for heavy duty. We continue to expect 2023 full year capital expenditures to be slightly lower than 2022. Now, I'd like wrap up with a few key takeaways. As CFO, I am pleased with our execution on many dimensions. Our second quarter results demonstrate the benefits of our comprehensive approach to address after effects of the pandemic. We're sharing inflationary costs with our customers. We're returning our productivity ratios to pre-pandemic levels, and we are on track to normalize inventory. Additionally, we're undertaking initiatives to capture our next wave of growth opportunities. In the near-term, to enhance shareholder value we remain focused on improving cash flow and profitability in the second half even at our current sales run rate, and advancing innovations to outperform our end markets. We're seeing the recovery play out in Display, and we expect to see it play out across our other markets, because the underlying fundamental drivers remain intact. Longer term, we are well-positioned to continue capturing growth tied to key secular trends and expect grow faster than our markets driven by our More Corning approach. So, I look forward to updating you on our progress. Now, I'll turn things back over to Ann.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks Ed. Operator, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe if I can get your insights and what you're seeing in the market rate to optical, which you're guiding down sequentially into the third quarter. Have you seen more incremental weakness given we've seen certainly telcos pulled back on spending a bit more? Or as you sort of look think of -- look at your 3Q guidance is being driven by both telcos and enterprise? And just a quick second part there. I mean, any discovery discussions in terms of what this lead cable replacement opportunity or whether it's an opportunity as well for Corning in the long run? Thank you.\nEdward Schlesinger: Hi, Samik. I appreciate the question. So, I think we're going to go back to what we said a little bit as we shared our perspective on the second quarter. When we were together in May, I talked mostly about us not seeing an inflection in our order rates and that was driving how we saw the second quarter playing out. Normally, we would have a pretty big seasonal uptick in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. As it turned out, our orders were actually even lower than we thought at that time, and therefore, the second quarter came in down from the first quarter and we're guiding the third quarter to be down sequentially again, and that's primarily driven by what we're seeing in our order book. I think that's the best way for us to describe the way we see the optical market playing out versus what might happen in the future. For sure, as you hear and see in the industry, we're seeing it in both the carrier and the enterprise space, customers are pushing projects out into 2024.\nSamik Chatterjee: Any thoughts on the lead cable replacement opportunity, whether you see that as an opportunity?\nWendell Weeks: Well, I'll do both. I'll add a little to Ed's and then talk briefly about the lead cables. So, I think the way we think -- the right way to think about how we're approaching demand in our optical market is our historic models that we would normally use to predict future revenue streams from what we're experiencing in one quarter to be able to build out a year plan. And our direct customer inputs on their plans for the year haven't have proven to not be as reliable as we like. And so, what you're really seeing in our guide is really a shift in our operating philosophy, which is we're going to plan our operations based on what we see in our order book, and we're going to improve our productivity to historic rates based on that broad load and we're going to increase our prices and carry the appropriate inventory so that our profitability and cash flow is going to increase in a very reliable manner despite the lower sales volume. And so that's all you're really seeing in our guide. We're just carrying our operating philosophy forward to our guide. As to lead cables, make a complicated issue. The good news is, is the glass is entirely inert to the environment and is better, lower cost, all the things that make it the right side of the secular trend would mean that this is why it's an ascendant technology on really every metric you can name. But I have no further insight to offer on the lead cable problem or opportunity.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. You noted that the pricing negotiations you're already starting to see traction on those. I just wanted to kind of get more detail there. Is this being accompanied by long-term supply agreements? Just how should we think about share in terms of kind of how these pricing increases impact revenue? Just -- I realize they're probably all not done, but any additional commentary there would be helpful. Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Thanks for the question, Meta. I think you're right on all the dimensions, right? This price increase is a very significant and complicated strategy move that is done in a backdrop, as most of our businesses are on well-established long-term agreements. Yet, we are redoing the value proposition between ourselves and our customers. So, it's complicated. So, the good news is it's progressing well. Our customers understand our need to offset elevated cost. We expect to successfully execute a double-digit price increase in the third quarter and do so in a manner that does not negatively impact our market share. So\u2026\nMeta Marshall: Great.\nWendell Weeks: hat's very significant and compelling. Now this also leaves -- I also understand the challenge in modeling, like specialized strategic move, especially in the backdrop of what's going on in the end markets. So, let me just share for a moment the way we way we think about it. The think about the financials is that what we're seeking to do is to return Display profitability, sort of think NPAT percent of sales, right, how much net income -- was the percent of net income on top of our sales revenue back to the historic levels in mid to high 20s. And we've been operating the past year closer to 20%. Now we expect to hit that level of profitability as we exit the third quarter. So that's the way we tend to think about the financial modeling. Is that helpful Meta?\nMeta Marshall: Yes. That's helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citi. Your line is now open.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you. Thanks for the incremental color, Wendell and Ed. In terms of returning the business back to sort of pre-pandemic levels, how much confidence that you have that this is something that could possibly maybe happen during 2024? Or is it the first part 2024? Is it the end of 2023? Do you guys have any more visibility into how we should think about as we exit this year into 2023 and into 2024 based on discussions with your customers right now? And if you could provide some color by segment, that would be even more helpful. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Can I ask a clarifying question? Are you speaking about Display or the broader company? Just so I can make sure I answer your questions specifically.\nAsiya Merchant: We could start with Display because it seems like optical -- there is some weakness and then Specialty if you guys can talk about what you see in the back half, but it was more a broader commentary as well about confidence in getting to kind of pre-pandemic levels of profitability as we exit as we exit 2023 and into 2024.\nWendell Weeks: Okay. Great. So, let me start with Display and then I'll have Ed add some color on the total company. So, in Display, we expect to return to pre-pandemic levels this year as we exit Q3. And then, we would expect that level of profitability, what our plan is, is that we'll continue to carry forward into next year. Is that -- does that address your question on Display?\nAsiya Merchant: That\u2019s very clear.\nWendell Weeks: Okay.\nAsiya Merchant: Yeah.\nWendell Weeks: Good. Ed, do you want to speak the\u2026\nEdward Schlesinger: Yeah. Sure. I'll build on Wendell's comments. Thanks Asiya. So, first, I want to sort of start with where we are in Q2. If you think about where our gross margin and operating margin in Q2 are, we've made a significant move up from where we were at the end of the year. Gross margin at 36%, operating margin at about 17.5%. So, 260 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter and 300 basis point improvement I think on operating margin from the fourth quarter. So, as we've sort of talked about, our goal is to continue to marching up march up profitability wise. Now our sales are muted, so they're at a lower level and that obviously impacts overall profitability. Now as we go forward, Display, we shared our view, we expect to continue improving overall profitability for Corning, yes, led by Display, but also across all of our segments. And then when sales return, I think it is possible for us to get back to real pre-pandemic historical levels at some point in the future. So that's kind of the way you think about it. I think of it as a continued march upward Display very specific given where we are, and we've seen this volume recovery and then our pricing and productivity actions will continue to take effect in the third and fourth quarter.  Does that help?\nAsiya Merchant: Yeah. And then just in terms of share buyback, at what point -- now that preferred shares, the payments that you had for the purchase from Samsung, I mean those have hopefully come to an end now. When would you expect to turn on share repurchase?\nWendell Weeks: When we start piling up more and more cash flow every quarter as we are aiming at. So that's improving in our profitability and cash flow even at this muted sales level, we want to see that first before we think deeply about our capital allocation model. As always, you can expect us to hold our shareholders near and dear in our heart. But the first step is we've got to restore that profitability and cash flow to our pre-pandemic levels even at these muted sales levels.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, I have one clarification. Wendell, you talked about the pre-pandemic margin profile for Display business. I'm a little bit confused. You exited 2019 with a 24% net income margin for Display. And in the prior year, it was like 26% to 27%. When you reference pre-pandemic, how far back should we go, given the margin difference in 2018 and 2019?\nEdward Schlesinger: Yeah. He, Mehdi, this is Ed. So, I think the way to think about it is we've been running closer to 20%, and we think of pre-pandemic closer to 30%, right? So, I think it's a big delta that seek to achieve. So not the end of 2019 levels, but more like the back half of 2018, maybe the front half of 2019 and maybe even earlier than that depending on how successful we are.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Very helpful. And then, you highlighted opportunities with polysilicon. I'm trying to understand how the Hemlock and Other Emerging growth revenue scale without significant or material increase in CapEx. You did 377 in Q2 and 386 at the prior quarter. And then in the latter part of last year, you were doing higher revenue. Should I assume that you can actually do like closer to $500 million without significant CapEx.\nEdward Schlesinger: Yeah. Hey, Mehdi. So, I'll take that one also. So, a couple of things. Just a reminder, in that segment, you have you have Hemlock, our auto glass business and you have our Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies business, think Valor or Velocity. I think all of those businesses will grow their sales. So, I definitely think the level you're thinking about is very achievable for us. In Hemlock, we're currently working through additional capacity so that we can expand that business. There will be some capital spending, but I don't think you need to think of it as significant at this point.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: I think we're not quite ready yet to discuss sort of the precise way in which we expect to expand our profit streams in Solar. So, what we're trying to do is to provide you some insight as to how much more income we expect in that segment and a rough idea of the timing of that without yet fully disclosing the details of our plan, to be able realize that expanded value footprint.\nMehdi Hosseini: Sure.\nWendell Weeks: So, we will be more forthcoming as -- this finalizes and it is in our benefit to come out of the more stealthy mode that we are in. But at the same time, it is significant enough. Do we wanted to make sure that we had provided for you a rough idea on how to think about it financially? So, that's what I think you have a good question here. But -- so, we're trying to -- we've given you the answer without all the inputs. Does that make sense?\nMehdi Hosseini: Absolutely. And the reason I ask is your margin -- net margin profile for this business unit has continued to improve. And I attribute that to poly. So, would it be fair to say that poly is a much better margin profile than other sub-segments within that business unit?\nWendell Weeks: I think that there's a lot going on in that segment. And you are right to think that a significant amount of the growth which we have outlined here and we've given in our sort of longer term what happens in a couple of years, is rolling out of our fundamental capabilities in Solar, because I think you're right to think about it that way.  I think concluding much more than that from the statement sort of runs the risk of -- you're not being exactly in line with what our strategic plan is. So, I'd ask for a little bit of patience, and it will be forthcoming in the not too distant future.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Good morning. When I look at Display revenue in the quarter was up 6% year-on-year, but profitability is down 9% year-on-year. You're obviously calling for an inflection in Display and expecting significant profit improvement, as you just answered in prior questions. So, I was wondering how much of your cost actions benefit did you already realized in the second quarter? And as you think about margin improvement, how much of that would you say is going to come from pricing actions versus continued benefit from productivity initiatives that you're undertaking. That's the first part of the question. And the second part of it is as you think about the improvement in Display, would you say that this pricing sort of supersedes any of the prior market based pricing agreements that you had with some of your customers? Is this a new paradigm? Or is that like old paradigm still impact? Thank you.\nEdward Schlesinger: Yeah. I'll take the first part of your question first, Wamsi. So, the main reason we are taking a price action is the point you're making. We are absorbing higher costs. We have elevated costs in this business and we expect the price to offset those costs. And I think about that as being the most significant driver of our profitability improvement as we go forward.\nWendell Weeks: I agree with that. I mean, the right way to think about it, Wamsi, is if you take a look at our quarter 2 results and it's a great example of why we need to increase our prices, right? So, then, there is -- this is a paradigm, new paradigm move. This is a significant enough, Wamsi, that. It's going to take a little time to settle into what this does to the overall dynamic in the industry. So, this type of significant move does represent a new paradigm for us. It is still going to be based on our same fundamental principles that unlike many of the other players of our competitors in this industry, we are the most reliable supplier. We are going to be able to continue to maintain our position in this business and be the technology leader. If you follow the space closely, you'll see significant announcements in the glass industry here actually capacity being taken out of the system because of the profitability challenges in glass. So, the core reason that we are the leader in this business is our reliability, the advantages inherent in our technology to play itself out in both cost advantage and product leadership. And those will still underpin the new paradigm, but it is a new pricing paradigm so.\nWamsi Mohan: So, whether if I could just follow up on that. In the past, you guys obviously went through a period where price decline was in the mid-teens and that stabilized down to low single digits given that you guys did something really interesting with locking in market share or volume at some of your largest customers which created an incentive to not take price down. I understand that we're in a recovery phase in the display market at the moment. But if you think over the next two, three years, why should we not think that the competitive response would go back to the historical ways of maybe trying to gain incremental share through pricing?\nWendell Weeks: Well, let me get through this quarter in a reset of double-digit increase in our prices, while we maintain our share and keep in place our long-term agreements, right? And after we get done executing this, I'd love to sit down with you and let's talk it through and maybe bring in some of our Display leaders and we'll talk it through. But right now, what we're focused on is getting this strategic move completed. Does that make sense, Wamsi?\nWamsi Mohan: Yeah. It does. I appreciate the response, Wendell. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: All right.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks Wamsi. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two. The first, just sort of a follow-up on pricing, but looking at optical. I'm just wondering what the carriers are seeing given weakness in demand in relation to some of the pricing that you were putting in place earlier? Is it holding in? Or is there any softness there? And then, Wendell, can you just give us an update on how you're thinking about the timing and rollout of government stimulus, both some of the broadband as well as benefit on the poly side from the IRA? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Our pricing continues to hold an optical. As far as the timing RIA and that is happening, right, we speak. And I think it's a little early, though there's plenty of news and there's been awards out to the states. And you're beginning to see the first of the tech place on B. I think it's a little early for us to be able to call here's when it's happening, are you expect to start to see that in our demand next year?\nShannon Cross: Do you think it's -- I mean, do you see it delayed, or just progressing along what you had expected?\nWendell Weeks: We started with a pretty cynical view, right, of how long it would take. So, we may not be the right people to ask. But we expected really not to start feeling it until next year, and that really hasn't changed. Once again, it's a -- this is a very large program. It's got a flow from the federal government out to the states, and they have to do awards that our various customers are competing for, right? And then those customers have to put orders in. And so, we've always thought that it wouldn't start to make a big impact until we got into next year. I believe that is still our belief -- I will double check, Shannon, and then Ed will get back to you if I'm wrong, okay?\nShannon Cross: Yeah. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just one follow-up on optical, and I have one on cash flow as well. On the optical side, are we at a point now where higher rates and macro dynamics are driving more of a sustained lull in spend relative to the sort of inventory digestion that was being messaged a couple quarters back? And then just on cash flow, so I think you're slightly negative for the first half of the year. Obviously, there's some gross margin tailwind from the display price hikes. So, maybe, Ed, if you can help us frame expectations for the second half of the year and how meaningful the quarterly improvements can be relative to the $300 million you posted this quarter. Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: So, I'll take the first one, maybe Ed you take the second. So, yes, that was really broadly reported throughout all the different people who serve into the telecom space that there was inventory buildup at the various customers. As you'll recall, sort of our feedback for that is, yes, we're seeing that too. But I think it's a more complicated question than just working our way through what sort of just in case inventory build is at our telecom customers and that moved to just in time like normal. It's certainly part of it, but we don't feel at this point in time confident enough in our forecasting models for telecom to say, yeah, we see that consumption of the inventory, it's behind us, and then we're going to start to see that recovery and a return to sort of our normal seasonality and a recovery in the back half. So, we just think it's -- there's more going on here. The fundamental drivers are in place in OpCo [ph], but the exact timing on when it pops back, I think it's difficult to call that. And that's why we're not planning on it and why we're just taking a look at what's in our order book right now and why you heard Ed guide you sequentially down in OpCo despite the fact this would normally be an up quarter, if everything was sort of operating in a normal cycle. So that's the way we tend to think about that part, Matt. Want to turn to cash flow, Ed?\nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. Sure. Thanks Matt. So, I would say on cash flow, a couple of things. Our goal is to improve our operating cash flow with the actions we're taking. We made a significant move from Q1 to Q2, as you articulated. And I think we have room to continue increase operating cash flow in the back half relative to what we did in the second quarter. And on capital, we've spent a good bit in the first half. We expect our full year to be slightly down from last year. So, I think you should also see a slight decline half-over-half on capital spending. So, I think the combination of improving operating cash flow and slightly less capital spending should mean the back half is stronger than what you saw in the second quarter. So, I definitely think there's room -- a meaningful room for improvement in the back half.\nMatthew Niknam: Just anything to note on working cap in the second half of the year at all?\nEdward Schlesinger: No. I mean, the thing I think that's most notable for us and we've talked about it over the last several quarters is we built a significant amount of inventory during the supply chain disruption period, and our goal is to work that down. I think the good news is we've made a little bit of progress in the first half on lower sales, which is hard to do. So, I think that's good. And we're going to continue to keep chipping away at that. So that should help us as well.\nMatthew Niknam: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors, LLC. Your line is now open.\nSteven Fox: Hey, good morning. Sorry, another question on just the display price increases. So, you're seeing volume increases into the second half of the year. So, can you isolate the margin accretion just from increasing display prices for 2023 and 2024? And how successful were you said original bogey you put out in the press release of 20%. And then just one last housekeeping thing, can you just describe what prices did in Q2? Thanks.\nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. So, Steve, I just want to make sure I understand. Can you repeat the first part of your question again? I wasn't 100% sure I followed it.\nSteven Fox: Yeah. So, you're saying display margins are going to go up, but volumes are also going up into the second half of the year. I assume it seems like that's what you're also signaling. So, if we just think about the price increases, what is that impact on the margin improvement?\nEdward Schlesinger: Got it. Yeah. I think I'm not sure we're necessarily signaling volume increase from the second quarter relative for the back half. Certainly, the first quarter was lower given panel maker utilization levels at really low levels in January. But when I think about the margin, net income margin improvement in the second half relative to say, second quarter, pricing is really the predominant driver that we see taking us there. And remember, it's offsetting costs that we're absorbing in our income statement.\nSteven Fox: And in terms of how successful pricing was and versus what Q2 pricing was?\nWendell Weeks: Well, what we've said here is that we expect, say, versus Q2 -- I'm sorry, Steve, do that again, how successful pricing is.\nSteven Fox: Yeah. So, originally\u2026\nWendell Weeks: So, we expect double-digit -- to close on a double-digit price increase.\nSteven Fox: Right. But originally, you said 20% price increases. So, I'm just trying to gauge whether you got the full 20 part of it, I mean you could have gotten 10.\nWendell Weeks: So, our guide today is our guide today, Steve, it's a double-digit price increase. And when we get to the end of third quarter, I think it will be a little more evident where in double-digit that ended up being.\nSteven Fox: Okay. And sorry to drag this out, but what was Q2 pricing like -- what was Q2 pricing like?\nWendell Weeks: Relatively consistent with Q1.\nSteven Fox: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJoshua Spector: Yeah. Thanks for squeezing in my question here. I was just wondering if you could expand at some of your comments around data centers and AI, and kind of what that means for Corning. And if possible, kind of quantify where things are today. So, you've talked about more efficiency in some products. You talked about more data transfer within AI versus other data centers. So, is there a content opportunity you could scale? And again, what's the base that we should be thinking of that on today? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: The easiest way to think about this is that we'd expect our hyperscale revenue opportunity fundamentally to more than double for the same number of hyperscale data centers. And that is because of a combination the amount of interconnects required to do the AI/ML compute. It needs more glass within that data center. A lot more of it is happening within the data center, a lot of connections within the data center that are going out just because of the way those large language models are trained and then you do influence beyond with our new set of innovations adding to our content. And so that's the way we tend to think about it. How much more than doubling, remains to be seen on how successful. Our innovations continue to be and what ends up being sort of the final architectures as we work through a variety of different wiring diagrams here to be able deliver this new compute package.\nJoshua Spector: Is there a way to think about your hyperscale revenues, what you're recognizing today?\nWendell Weeks: So, what we'll do is that's in our Enterprise segment, right, let us reflect a little given the size and scale of these changes and think through what is the right way to be helpful you to think about how that embeds in that piece of optical and how sizable is it. That's a good question, Josh. Let us reflect on that, and Ann will get back to you.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you. We'll take one more question. Operator, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks very much, and thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, I had another question on the optical business. I'm just curious if you guys are enforcing delivery dates with customers or allowing folks to reschedule further out into the future. And then also, I'm just curious if you're seeing any incremental competition in fiber. And I'm thinking more specifically about gray market fiber, people looking at selling excess inventory in the open market that would now compete with you? Any sense for that? Thanks a lot.\nEdward Schlesinger: Yeah. So, George, I just want to repeat back your question. You're asking if we're seeing customers ask to push their delivery dates out into the future, is that the question?\nGeorge Notter: Correct.\nWendell Weeks: Well, that happens daily. One way or the other. Pull aheads to -- I don't really need it then, I need it now, because they're executing pretty complicated civil works projects. We're not seeing beyond what we've already guided in our sort of order rates, sort of a new risk. The way maybe which you're getting at is that normally, we're working with our customers on what they're going to take like the entire next year, because it's such an important part of what they do, and we have to plan it. And that certainly has been strong variation between what they told us last year, right, and what they're taking this year. So, I think that's more of a play than to look through what is the fundamental heartbeat here rather than shifting delivery dates within any given quarter. It does happen, and it is what is behind sort of our operating shift to just plan based on what we're seeing in our order book as opposed to what our customers are telling us for the year or as what our own stochastic models are telling us. As to gray fiber optic cable, we're not seeing that be any sort of significant play here. It'd be unusual -- are you hearing some because if you're hearing something, I will check back with the optical folks, but it would be the first I've been hearing about that if it's any sort of significant number.\nGeorge Notter: Got it. Great. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it, guys.\nWendell Weeks: Yeah.\nEnd of Q&A:\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks George, and thank you, everybody for joining us today. Before we close, I want to let you know that we will attend Citi's 2023 Global Technology Conference on September 7, and we'll be hosting management visits to investor offices in select cities. Finally, a web replay of today's call will be available on our site starting later this morning. Once again, thank you all for joining us. And operator, you can disconnect all lines.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Edward Schlesinger",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. As expected, in the second quarter, we improved profitability and cash flow in an overall weak demand environment. Second quarter sales were $3.5 billion, up 3% sequentially. EPS was $0.45, increasing $0.04 from the prior quarter. Gross margin and operating margin increased sequentially by 100 basis points to 36.2% and 200 basis points to 17.5%, respectively, reflecting progress on our pricing and productivity improvement actions. These results demonstrate the progress on and benefits from our comprehensive approach to improve profitability and cash flow, including continued actions to offset inflationary costs, return productivity levels to -- return productivity ratios to historical levels and reduce inventory. Now, let's turn to our segment results. Let me start with Optical Communications. I shared with you back in May that we were not seeing the typical seasonal uptick in our orders. Near-term demand for passive optical network products remains weak. And as the quarter progressed, orders came in at the low-end of our expectations. As a result, sales in the second quarter were $1.66 billion, down 5% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. As I'm sure you're hearing across the industry, carriers and enterprise operators are pushing projects into 2024 due to high inflation and rising interest rates. For now, we are sizing our operational plans based on the orders in our books. Net income was $140 million, down 12% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. The decline on lower volume was moderated by productivity improvements, as I shared in the first quarter. We raised price in this segment to more appropriately share inflationary costs with customers. While the demand for passive optical network products remains weak, longer term, we remain confident that the industry's underlying growth drivers are intact. We're pursuing four significant secular trends: broadband, 5G, the cloud, and the paradigm shift in computation necessary to train large language models and other advanced AI. We've got major innovation programs underway for each category. And our connectivity solutions offer economic advantages for a broader range of customers than ever before. And demand for optical networks is strongly supported by trends in computation as well by private and public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the population. Turning to Display Technologies. Sales in second quarter were $928 million, up 22% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Net income was $208 million, up 30% sequentially, primarily driven by higher volume. Second quarter panel maker utilization played out in line with the expectations I described three months ago. After reaching historic lows in 2022 and as recently as January, panel maker utilization has increased consistently, driving significant sequential volume increases. We believe that the display industry recovery is underway. Now let me update you on what has happened since our display price increase announcement in May. Since then, we've engaged with our customers and they understand our need to offset elevated costs. We expect to finalize agreements for double-digit price increases that will begin to go into effect in the third quarter. We expect our profitability to improve and to return pre-pandemic levels as we exit the quarter. Moving to Specialty Materials. Second quarter sales were down 13% year-over-year. This reflects continued end market softness. Sales increased 4% sequentially on higher Gorilla Glass sales. Net income was $33 million, down 15% sequentially, impacted by continued development costs for new product launches. Looking ahead, we believe that there are new innovation opportunities for us in emerging trends like augmented reality, vendable devices and AI that will extend our More Corning opportunities far into the future. For example, our world-leading optical materials and systems in our advanced optics business power EUV lithography technology. We enable the manufacturing of smaller, faster, more powerful chips, including GPUs. Global AI initiatives are accelerating demand for GPUs and for our EUV related products. In Environmental Technologies, second quarter sales were $457 million, up 6% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. Net income increased to $107 million on stronger sales and improved productivity. In Automotive, our sales were up 8% sequentially driven by the ramp of GPF sales in China based on regulations that are now in effect. We do not expect to see this level of GPF sales in in China the third quarter. Auto production levels remained steady quarter-over-quarter in North America and Europe. Year-over-year, our Automotive sales were up 40%, driven by the GPF ramp in China that I just mentioned and versus low auto sales in China during the 2022 COVID shutdowns and 2022 supply chain issues for automakers globally. In diesel, our sales were up 13% year-over-year, driven by heavy-duty demand in North America and Europe, which more than offset languishing demand in China. Turning to Life Sciences. Second quarter sales were $231 million, down 10% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Both the sequential and year-over-year sales declines resulted from lower demand for COVID-related products in China and by customers continuing to drawdown inventory. Net income increased sequentially to $11 million with productivity improvements more than offsetting lower sales. We expect our sales and profitability to improve as the industry corrects and as we continue to restore productivity ratios back to pre-pandemic levels. Finally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses, sales in the second quarter were $377 million consistent with the first quarter. Sales were down 10% year-over-year partly associated with a decline in solar-grade polysilicon spot prices. We are seeing continued strong demand for solar-grade polysilicon required to meet the need for a transparent, sustainable and traceable solar supply chain in the U.S. market. And we have long-term take-or-pay contracts with our customers that have floor price mechanisms built in to help mitigate the impacts of spot market dynamics. Net income increased sequentially to $26 million, up 4% year-over-year, driven by productivity improvements. Now let me spend a minute on our outlook for the third quarter. As we've been sharing with you, we are planning our operations based on our current order run rate. And we're continuing to take pricing and productivity actions to improve profitability and cash flow. We're adopting the same philosophy for our guidance. Based on our current order run rate, we expect our sales to come in roughly in line with quarter 2, approximately $3.5 billion. Orders begin to increase, we'll let you know. On roughly flat total company sales, we expect improved profitability and cash flow. We expect EPS to come in about the same or slightly better than the second quarter, and this factors in sequentially higher interest expense and a slightly higher tax rate. Of course, there are differing dynamics in each of our businesses. At a high level, we expect improvements in Display and Specialty Materials to be offset by declines in Optical Communications, driven by the dynamics I previously mentioned as well as declines in Environmental where we expect lower sales for GPF in China as the ramp is largely complete, and we expect lower demand for heavy duty. We continue to expect 2023 full year capital expenditures to be slightly lower than 2022. Now, I'd like wrap up with a few key takeaways. As CFO, I am pleased with our execution on many dimensions. Our second quarter results demonstrate the benefits of our comprehensive approach to address after effects of the pandemic. We're sharing inflationary costs with our customers. We're returning our productivity ratios to pre-pandemic levels, and we are on track to normalize inventory. Additionally, we're undertaking initiatives to capture our next wave of growth opportunities. In the near-term, to enhance shareholder value we remain focused on improving cash flow and profitability in the second half even at our current sales run rate, and advancing innovations to outperform our end markets. We're seeing the recovery play out in Display, and we expect to see it play out across our other markets, because the underlying fundamental drivers remain intact. Longer term, we are well-positioned to continue capturing growth tied to key secular trends and expect grow faster than our markets driven by our More Corning approach. So, I look forward to updating you on our progress. Now, I'll turn things back over to Ann. Hi, Samik. I appreciate the question. So, I think we're going to go back to what we said a little bit as we shared our perspective on the second quarter. When we were together in May, I talked mostly about us not seeing an inflection in our order rates and that was driving how we saw the second quarter playing out. Normally, we would have a pretty big seasonal uptick in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. As it turned out, our orders were actually even lower than we thought at that time, and therefore, the second quarter came in down from the first quarter and we're guiding the third quarter to be down sequentially again, and that's primarily driven by what we're seeing in our order book. I think that's the best way for us to describe the way we see the optical market playing out versus what might happen in the future. For sure, as you hear and see in the industry, we're seeing it in both the carrier and the enterprise space, customers are pushing projects out into 2024. Yeah. Sure. I'll build on Wendell's comments. Thanks Asiya. So, first, I want to sort of start with where we are in Q2. If you think about where our gross margin and operating margin in Q2 are, we've made a significant move up from where we were at the end of the year. Gross margin at 36%, operating margin at about 17.5%. So, 260 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter and 300 basis point improvement I think on operating margin from the fourth quarter. So, as we've sort of talked about, our goal is to continue to marching up march up profitability wise. Now our sales are muted, so they're at a lower level and that obviously impacts overall profitability. Now as we go forward, Display, we shared our view, we expect to continue improving overall profitability for Corning, yes, led by Display, but also across all of our segments. And then when sales return, I think it is possible for us to get back to real pre-pandemic historical levels at some point in the future. So that's kind of the way you think about it. I think of it as a continued march upward Display very specific given where we are, and we've seen this volume recovery and then our pricing and productivity actions will continue to take effect in the third and fourth quarter.  Does that help? Yeah. He, Mehdi, this is Ed. So, I think the way to think about it is we've been running closer to 20%, and we think of pre-pandemic closer to 30%, right? So, I think it's a big delta that seek to achieve. So not the end of 2019 levels, but more like the back half of 2018, maybe the front half of 2019 and maybe even earlier than that depending on how successful we are. Yeah. Hey, Mehdi. So, I'll take that one also. So, a couple of things. Just a reminder, in that segment, you have you have Hemlock, our auto glass business and you have our Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies business, think Valor or Velocity. I think all of those businesses will grow their sales. So, I definitely think the level you're thinking about is very achievable for us. In Hemlock, we're currently working through additional capacity so that we can expand that business. There will be some capital spending, but I don't think you need to think of it as significant at this point. Yeah. I'll take the first part of your question first, Wamsi. So, the main reason we are taking a price action is the point you're making. We are absorbing higher costs. We have elevated costs in this business and we expect the price to offset those costs. And I think about that as being the most significant driver of our profitability improvement as we go forward. Yes. Sure. Thanks Matt. So, I would say on cash flow, a couple of things. Our goal is to improve our operating cash flow with the actions we're taking. We made a significant move from Q1 to Q2, as you articulated. And I think we have room to continue increase operating cash flow in the back half relative to what we did in the second quarter. And on capital, we've spent a good bit in the first half. We expect our full year to be slightly down from last year. So, I think you should also see a slight decline half-over-half on capital spending. So, I think the combination of improving operating cash flow and slightly less capital spending should mean the back half is stronger than what you saw in the second quarter. So, I definitely think there's room -- a meaningful room for improvement in the back half. No. I mean, the thing I think that's most notable for us and we've talked about it over the last several quarters is we built a significant amount of inventory during the supply chain disruption period, and our goal is to work that down. I think the good news is we've made a little bit of progress in the first half on lower sales, which is hard to do. So, I think that's good. And we're going to continue to keep chipping away at that. So that should help us as well. Yes. So, Steve, I just want to make sure I understand. Can you repeat the first part of your question again? I wasn't 100% sure I followed it. Got it. Yeah. I think I'm not sure we're necessarily signaling volume increase from the second quarter relative for the back half. Certainly, the first quarter was lower given panel maker utilization levels at really low levels in January. But when I think about the margin, net income margin improvement in the second half relative to say, second quarter, pricing is really the predominant driver that we see taking us there. And remember, it's offsetting costs that we're absorbing in our income statement. Yeah. So, George, I just want to repeat back your question. You're asking if we're seeing customers ask to push their delivery dates out into the future, is that the question?"

            "content": "Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. Today, we reported second quarter results to demonstrate strong progress on the priorities we've outlined to improve profitability and cash flow in the current weak end market environment. Sales were $3.5 billion. EPS was $0.45. Gross margin and operating margin increased sequentially to 36.2% and 17.5%, respectively; and free cash flow improved to $310 million. Ed will give you the details on each of these in just a few minutes. Our results reflect solid execution on our plan to deliver financial and operational improvements in response to the significant after effects of the pandemic still rippling across the global economy. Now we've been discussing this plan with you for several quarters. So, let me just briefly recap the primary factors we've been addressing. For one, supply chain disruptions caused higher logistics, freight and input costs. Additionally, inflation led to interest rate hikes than a spike in the U.S. dollar. And consumers shifted spending from goods to services as the pandemic abated. Against this backdrop, demand grew below historic trends in end markets that constitute the vast majority of our sales. Further, as supply chains started to normalize again over the last year, our customers began to drawdown inventory facilitate their transition from just in case, back to their typical just-in-time approach. Consequently, we're seeing a synchronization of lower sales across our portfolio that is highly unusual. Now this is because while our three core technologies and four manufacturing platforms do apply to all of our markets, the demand drivers in the different markets we serve are fundamentally uncorrelated. TV sales don't move with Automotive production. The Life Sciences market isn't correlated with fiber optic deployments and so on. Over the past several quarters, I've noted how all the factors I just outlined have taken a toll on profits and cash. And that's why we introduced a comprehensive plan to improve both profitability and cash flow at our current sales run rate, while also innovating to generate additional near and longer term revenue streams. I would like to now walk you through the elements of our plan and the strong results we're delivering. We're taking pricing actions. Most recently in Display, we expect these actions will contribute to overall profitability improvement in the third quarter. We've reduced our staffing levels to align with demand, and we are returning our productivity ratios to historic levels. And we're bringing inventory down across the company, because we no longer require buffer inventory and supply chains are improving. These sets of actions are delivering the intended results. In the first quarter, we improved gross margin by 160 basis points. And in the second quarter, we improved by another 100 basis points. Collectively, we've improved gross margin by 260 basis points to 36.2% versus where we ended 2022. As I said earlier, we also improved our free cash flow to $310 million in the quarter. As we move into the second half, we're not counting on a strong recovery in our end markets or a significant increase in our sales, but we do expect our profitability and cash generation to continue going up. Importantly, our actions will further improve profitability and cash generation when our markets recover. Our volume returns, and our sales increase. The products and services we enable smartphones, cars, TVs, broadband. These are central to many facets of daily life. So, we're confident that volume in our markets will recover to historical trend lines. In Display, for example, we believe the volume recovery has already begun. When we last spoke, panel makers had started to increase utilization at the end of the first quarter. Improvement continued in the second quarter, and we grew sales more than 20% sequentially, driven by higher volume. When we couple this volume return with the Display pricing actions I mentioned earlier, we expect to show additional profitability improvement in the third quarter. Now our goal is to return Display pre-pandemic profitability levels as we exit the third quarter. Let me now turn to how we intend to increase our profitability and grow our sales beyond our pre-pandemic run rates. Across our markets, we expect demand to normalize and our volume to return. As we drive more Corning content into those markets, we will further increase our profit as we create additional revenue streams. Now here are just a few exciting examples of More Corning innovations that are arriving in the near-term.  In Optical Communications, leaders in large language models are building data centers with what is essentially a second optical network, which is increasing connectivity by up to five times within individual data centers. So, we're commercializing a Gen 2, high-density, high-value optical interconnect system designed to enable the requirements and capture growth driven by AI. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we're launching two products this fall and next year, featuring innovations that significantly increase our value per device. In Automotive, we continue to increase the amount of Corning content in vehicles across the industry, as we pursue our $100 per car content opportunity. We recently commercialized a solution in our auto glass exterior business that takes a significant step to achieving this goal in electric vehicles. And for ICE vehicles, adoption of our gasoline particulate filter technology is now expanding to India. And the U.S. EPA has proposed regulations that would boost our content in the very large domestic market. In Life Sciences, we just launched Viridian Vials to address the growing need for sustainable products in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Viridian cuts the CO2 emissions from vial manufacturing by about a third and reduces glass by 20%, all while improving filling line efficiency by 50%. We're expanding our collaboration with West Pharmaceuticals, a leader in drug packaging to accelerate adoption. Now these are just a few examples of innovations and new product sets that you can expect to see in the near-term. Additionally, we're scaling our Solar business, which we expect to add hundreds of millions of dollars in annual profits and cash flow beginning in a couple of years. We expect all of these opportunities to further increase our profits as we create additional revenue streams across our markets. Whether it's in automotive, cloud computing, broadband, 5G, solar, pharmaceutical packaging, next-generation displays and cover materials, augmented reality or semiconductors, our role in key secular trends is material and compelling. We've built a robust opportunity set that will drive durable long-term growth. So, before I turn things over to Ed, here's what I'd like to leave you with today. The world is working through some significant after effects of the pandemic, and they're not trivial for our company. Our approach in this environment is not the count on conditions in our end markets or our sales improving significantly from the second quarter. And that's why we're guiding based on our current order rates. When we see our orders increase, will reflect these developments in operating plans and, of course, our guidance. For now, Corning is executing well on a comprehensive plan to improve profitability and cash flow throughout this low-volume period and to emerge stronger. Our efforts are already demonstrating significant results. In the first half of the year, we improved profitability and cash flow despite lower sales. Even in a muted sales environment, our pricing and productivity actions will continue to drive improvement in the second half. At the same time, our More Corning approach is driving new product launches that will create additional revenue streams. Altogether, as our end markets recover and our volume returns to historic levels, we're positioned to deliver improved profitability and cash flow with significant operating leverage on sales that will grow faster than our markets. In total, we feel good about execution. We're taking the right steps to improve our performance today and further improve our results when volume returns. And I look forward to updating you on our progress. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed, so he can get into the details of our results and outlook. Ed? Well, I'll do both. I'll add a little to Ed's and then talk briefly about the lead cables. So, I think the way we think -- the right way to think about how we're approaching demand in our optical market is our historic models that we would normally use to predict future revenue streams from what we're experiencing in one quarter to be able to build out a year plan. And our direct customer inputs on their plans for the year haven't have proven to not be as reliable as we like. And so, what you're really seeing in our guide is really a shift in our operating philosophy, which is we're going to plan our operations based on what we see in our order book, and we're going to improve our productivity to historic rates based on that broad load and we're going to increase our prices and carry the appropriate inventory so that our profitability and cash flow is going to increase in a very reliable manner despite the lower sales volume. And so that's all you're really seeing in our guide. We're just carrying our operating philosophy forward to our guide. As to lead cables, make a complicated issue. The good news is, is the glass is entirely inert to the environment and is better, lower cost, all the things that make it the right side of the secular trend would mean that this is why it's an ascendant technology on really every metric you can name. But I have no further insight to offer on the lead cable problem or opportunity. Thanks for the question, Meta. I think you're right on all the dimensions, right? This price increase is a very significant and complicated strategy move that is done in a backdrop, as most of our businesses are on well-established long-term agreements. Yet, we are redoing the value proposition between ourselves and our customers. So, it's complicated. So, the good news is it's progressing well. Our customers understand our need to offset elevated cost. We expect to successfully execute a double-digit price increase in the third quarter and do so in a manner that does not negatively impact our market share. So... hat's very significant and compelling. Now this also leaves -- I also understand the challenge in modeling, like specialized strategic move, especially in the backdrop of what's going on in the end markets. So, let me just share for a moment the way we way we think about it. The think about the financials is that what we're seeking to do is to return Display profitability, sort of think NPAT percent of sales, right, how much net income -- was the percent of net income on top of our sales revenue back to the historic levels in mid to high 20s. And we've been operating the past year closer to 20%. Now we expect to hit that level of profitability as we exit the third quarter. So that's the way we tend to think about the financial modeling. Is that helpful Meta? Can I ask a clarifying question? Are you speaking about Display or the broader company? Just so I can make sure I answer your questions specifically. Okay. Great. So, let me start with Display and then I'll have Ed add some color on the total company. So, in Display, we expect to return to pre-pandemic levels this year as we exit Q3. And then, we would expect that level of profitability, what our plan is, is that we'll continue to carry forward into next year. Is that -- does that address your question on Display? Okay. Good. Ed, do you want to speak the... When we start piling up more and more cash flow every quarter as we are aiming at. So that's improving in our profitability and cash flow even at this muted sales level, we want to see that first before we think deeply about our capital allocation model. As always, you can expect us to hold our shareholders near and dear in our heart. But the first step is we've got to restore that profitability and cash flow to our pre-pandemic levels even at these muted sales levels. I think we're not quite ready yet to discuss sort of the precise way in which we expect to expand our profit streams in Solar. So, what we're trying to do is to provide you some insight as to how much more income we expect in that segment and a rough idea of the timing of that without yet fully disclosing the details of our plan, to be able realize that expanded value footprint. So, we will be more forthcoming as -- this finalizes and it is in our benefit to come out of the more stealthy mode that we are in. But at the same time, it is significant enough. Do we wanted to make sure that we had provided for you a rough idea on how to think about it financially? So, that's what I think you have a good question here. But -- so, we're trying to -- we've given you the answer without all the inputs. Does that make sense? I think that there's a lot going on in that segment. And you are right to think that a significant amount of the growth which we have outlined here and we've given in our sort of longer term what happens in a couple of years, is rolling out of our fundamental capabilities in Solar, because I think you're right to think about it that way.  I think concluding much more than that from the statement sort of runs the risk of -- you're not being exactly in line with what our strategic plan is. So, I'd ask for a little bit of patience, and it will be forthcoming in the not too distant future. I agree with that. I mean, the right way to think about it, Wamsi, is if you take a look at our quarter 2 results and it's a great example of why we need to increase our prices, right? So, then, there is -- this is a paradigm, new paradigm move. This is a significant enough, Wamsi, that. It's going to take a little time to settle into what this does to the overall dynamic in the industry. So, this type of significant move does represent a new paradigm for us. It is still going to be based on our same fundamental principles that unlike many of the other players of our competitors in this industry, we are the most reliable supplier. We are going to be able to continue to maintain our position in this business and be the technology leader. If you follow the space closely, you'll see significant announcements in the glass industry here actually capacity being taken out of the system because of the profitability challenges in glass. So, the core reason that we are the leader in this business is our reliability, the advantages inherent in our technology to play itself out in both cost advantage and product leadership. And those will still underpin the new paradigm, but it is a new pricing paradigm so. Well, let me get through this quarter in a reset of double-digit increase in our prices, while we maintain our share and keep in place our long-term agreements, right? And after we get done executing this, I'd love to sit down with you and let's talk it through and maybe bring in some of our Display leaders and we'll talk it through. But right now, what we're focused on is getting this strategic move completed. Does that make sense, Wamsi? All right. Our pricing continues to hold an optical. As far as the timing RIA and that is happening, right, we speak. And I think it's a little early, though there's plenty of news and there's been awards out to the states. And you're beginning to see the first of the tech place on B. I think it's a little early for us to be able to call here's when it's happening, are you expect to start to see that in our demand next year? We started with a pretty cynical view, right, of how long it would take. So, we may not be the right people to ask. But we expected really not to start feeling it until next year, and that really hasn't changed. Once again, it's a -- this is a very large program. It's got a flow from the federal government out to the states, and they have to do awards that our various customers are competing for, right? And then those customers have to put orders in. And so, we've always thought that it wouldn't start to make a big impact until we got into next year. I believe that is still our belief -- I will double check, Shannon, and then Ed will get back to you if I'm wrong, okay? So, I'll take the first one, maybe Ed you take the second. So, yes, that was really broadly reported throughout all the different people who serve into the telecom space that there was inventory buildup at the various customers. As you'll recall, sort of our feedback for that is, yes, we're seeing that too. But I think it's a more complicated question than just working our way through what sort of just in case inventory build is at our telecom customers and that moved to just in time like normal. It's certainly part of it, but we don't feel at this point in time confident enough in our forecasting models for telecom to say, yeah, we see that consumption of the inventory, it's behind us, and then we're going to start to see that recovery and a return to sort of our normal seasonality and a recovery in the back half. So, we just think it's -- there's more going on here. The fundamental drivers are in place in OpCo [ph], but the exact timing on when it pops back, I think it's difficult to call that. And that's why we're not planning on it and why we're just taking a look at what's in our order book right now and why you heard Ed guide you sequentially down in OpCo despite the fact this would normally be an up quarter, if everything was sort of operating in a normal cycle. So that's the way we tend to think about that part, Matt. Want to turn to cash flow, Ed? Well, what we've said here is that we expect, say, versus Q2 -- I'm sorry, Steve, do that again, how successful pricing is. So, we expect double-digit -- to close on a double-digit price increase. So, our guide today is our guide today, Steve, it's a double-digit price increase. And when we get to the end of third quarter, I think it will be a little more evident where in double-digit that ended up being. Relatively consistent with Q1. The easiest way to think about this is that we'd expect our hyperscale revenue opportunity fundamentally to more than double for the same number of hyperscale data centers. And that is because of a combination the amount of interconnects required to do the AI/ML compute. It needs more glass within that data center. A lot more of it is happening within the data center, a lot of connections within the data center that are going out just because of the way those large language models are trained and then you do influence beyond with our new set of innovations adding to our content. And so that's the way we tend to think about it. How much more than doubling, remains to be seen on how successful. Our innovations continue to be and what ends up being sort of the final architectures as we work through a variety of different wiring diagrams here to be able deliver this new compute package. So, what we'll do is that's in our Enterprise segment, right, let us reflect a little given the size and scale of these changes and think through what is the right way to be helpful you to think about how that embeds in that piece of optical and how sizable is it. That's a good question, Josh. Let us reflect on that, and Ann will get back to you. Well, that happens daily. One way or the other. Pull aheads to -- I don't really need it then, I need it now, because they're executing pretty complicated civil works projects. We're not seeing beyond what we've already guided in our sort of order rates, sort of a new risk. The way maybe which you're getting at is that normally, we're working with our customers on what they're going to take like the entire next year, because it's such an important part of what they do, and we have to plan it. And that certainly has been strong variation between what they told us last year, right, and what they're taking this year. So, I think that's more of a play than to look through what is the fundamental heartbeat here rather than shifting delivery dates within any given quarter. It does happen, and it is what is behind sort of our operating shift to just plan based on what we're seeing in our order book as opposed to what our customers are telling us for the year or as what our own stochastic models are telling us. As to gray fiber optic cable, we're not seeing that be any sort of significant play here. It'd be unusual -- are you hearing some because if you're hearing something, I will check back with the optical folks, but it would be the first I've been hearing about that if it's any sort of significant number. Yeah."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Corning Inc. Quarter 1 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.  I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.  You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the first quarter, the primary differences between GAAP and core EPS stemmed from restructuring charges and from non-cash mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's currency hedging contracts and Japanese-yen-denominated debt. In total, these increased core earnings in Q1 by $97 million. As a reminder, the mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, we told you that markets constituting about 1/2 of our sales were experiencing recession-level demand; that our first quarter sales would decline by greater-than-normal seasonality due to the pandemic-related disruptions in China; that we would raise prices again to offset additional inflation; and also begin to restore our productivity ratios to pre-pandemic levels; and as a result, our margins would increase 1 to 2 percentage points sequentially, despite lower sales. And that is exactly how the first quarter played out. First quarter sales were $3.4 billion, and EPS was $0.41. Our actions to raise prices and restore productivity ratios began delivering notable results. Despite a 7% sequential sales decline, gross margin expanded 160 basis points sequentially to 35.2%. And operating margin expanded 150 basis points from the prior quarter to 15.5%.  Although conditions remain weak in multiple markets, we expect our results to improve in the second quarter. We remain focused on profitability and cash flow, and we will continue to align our cost structure to demand.  Now I wanted to provide some context on the dynamics we're experienced in our key markets. And then I'll discuss how we're continuing to build our long-term growth opportunities across our businesses. So let's dive in.  In Display Technologies, sales declined 3% sequentially as both volume and glass price declined slightly. In March, panel maker utilization increased, and we expect our volume in the second quarter to increase significantly from the first quarter. As conditions continue to improve, we're optimistic the panel maker utilization is beginning to move beyond correction levels and will return to more normal levels in the coming quarters.  In Optical Communications, sales declined 6% sequentially. Our pricing actions partially offset a greater-than-normal seasonal volume decline in connectivity solutions, which is associated with the pacing of several large customer projects. Our pricing and productivity actions resulted in net income improving 22% sequentially despite the lower sales. Government commitments to connect the unconnected are contributing to robust cable and fiber demand, and we continue to advance our leadership. Last month, we officially opened an optical cable manufacturing campus in North Carolina to help provide U.S. network operators with the cable they need to bring high-speed optical connectivity to underserved communities, particularly in rural America. Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo said, \"It is past time that every American be connected with affordable Internet no matter where they live. We could not do it without the folks at Corning. We wouldn't have the fiber, the innovation or the cable.\"  Finally, in Environmental Technologies, we saw increased adoption of gasoline particulate filters in the quarter, which helped drive a 9% sequential improvement in sales despite the languishing car market. Net income grew 19% in the segment based on our productivity actions and growing sales.  To sum up the short term, we're seeing improvement in some of our markets, but a series of challenges continues to ripple across the global economy. Nevertheless, we expect to grow sequentially in the second quarter and to improve our key financial metrics. For the back half of the year, I'd be disappointed if we didn't grow from second quarter levels.  Longer term, we will continue to innovate and capture growth opportunities as they materialize. We're energized about Corning's future. And I'd like to review some of the reasons why.  It all starts with our focused and cohesive portfolio. We maintain clear leadership in three core technologies, and four proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms that are viable to solving a broad range of significant challenges in shaping through industries. We apply new combinations of our assets and capabilities to advance important secular trends in tandem with our customers. And by reapplying and repurposing our insights and assets across multiple opportunities in markets, we increase our profitability.  In Optical Communications, we've been leading in the industry for more than 50 years. This business is the most fully evolved example of Corning's focused portfolio using all 3 of our core technologies and 4 of our manufacturing and engineering platforms. And we will continue to apply these capabilities to help build a more connected world over the next 50 years. In Display, by leveraging all 3 of our core technologies and evolving our fusion platform, we have achieved large scale and broad capabilities that have advanced our leadership position. As our customers evolve, we're helping them create a world with richer and more lifelike and ubiquitous displays.  In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we invented the cover glass category and redefined it by integrating glass with ceramics and by combining fusion with vapor deposition. We continue to advance the state-of-the-art with our leading cover materials, which have been deployed on more than 8 billion devices to date. And we've recently entered new product categories that provide opportunities for more of our content. For example, the camera lens covers on devices like the Samsung Galaxy S22 and S23 series.  These advancements are excellent examples of our More Corning approach. We're also innovating in emerging technologies like augmented reality and bendable devices, which we expect to contribute to long-term growth.  In Automotive, we're helping build a world where vehicles are increasingly green and where software and displays are enabling new in-vehicle experiences.  Our inventions are enabling industry leaders to meet stringent upcoming EU7 emissions regulations and achieve near 0 emissions levels. And we're collaborating with LG Electronics, a global technology and vehicle component solutions innovator, to advance in-car connectivity. Overall, we're helping to solve more and more of our customers' challenges in design, connectivity and autonomy. And at CES, we continue to generate strong industry excitement about how our technical glass and optics capabilities can expand the boundaries of what's possible.  Finally, in Life Sciences, we're using Corning's core glass and optical physics technologies along with our expertise in vapor deposition, precision forming and extrusion, to help support the discovery and delivery of new medicines, including biological treatments, that are personalized, effective and safe. So as you can see, our investments and distinctive capabilities have placed us at the center of secular trends touching many facets of basic life. And we believe we will continue to develop category defining products to transform industries and enhance lives.  I'm also excited by our growth opportunities in the renewable energy industry, where I believe we can make significant additional contributions to a sustainable U.S.-based solar supply chain.  We're proud to make the world just a little bit better wherever we can, and that extends to all of our stakeholders, especially in these uncertain times.  We recently released our DE&I and sustainability reports, which capture the great progress we've made and underscore our commitment to helping move the world forward. So as I wrap up my remarks, here's what I'd like to leave you with today. Moving forward throughout 2023, we'll continue to focus on operating each of our businesses well and adjusting to meet the needs of the moment, including aligning our cost structure to the demand environment. At the same time, we're advancing growth initiatives and capabilities that will drive long-term success.  We remain well positioned to continue capturing some very rich set of long-term opportunities that we've built across our Market-Access Platforms. I look forward to updating you on our progress.  Now I'll turn the call over to Ed, so he can get into the details of our financial priorities, along with our results and outlook. Ed?\nEdward Schlesinger: Thank you, Wendell. Morning, everyone. For the first quarter, we delivered results at the higher end of our expectations. Sales were $3.4 billion and EPS was $0.41. Gross margin was 35.2% and operating margin was 15.5%, both meaningful improvements from the fourth quarter.  Our free cash flow for the quarter was negative $383 million. The first quarter is typically negative due to cash flow cyclicality. This quarter, free cash flow was also impacted by lower sales, reflecting the recession-level demand we saw in several of our markets and overall weakness in China.  Looking forward, we expect positive free cash flow starting in the second quarter and for the remainder of 2023. Overall, our team demonstrated operational rigor during the quarter. We continue to make progress on improving our profitability by raising prices to help offset inflation and by adjusting our productivity ratios closer to historical levels, and we will continue to align our cost structure to successfully weather the demand environment.  We remain confident in our relevance to long-term secular trends and our More Corning approach, and we are well positioned to capture durable profitable growth as the global economy improves.  Now let's turn to our first quarter segment results. In Optical Communications, sales were $1.1 billion, down 6% sequentially as price increases partially offset a greater-than-normal seasonal volume decline associated with the pacing of customer projects.  Despite the decline in sales, net income grew 22% sequentially to $159 million, primarily driven by pricing and productivity actions taken in late 2022. We continue to believe the industry's underlying growth drivers are intact. Long-term demand for optical networks is strongly supported by trends in computation and by private and public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the population.  We're pursuing three significant secular trends: broadband; 5G; and the cloud. We've got major innovation programs underway for each category, and our connectivity solutions offer economic advantages for a broader range of customers than ever before. Display Technology sales in the first quarter were $763 million, down 3% sequentially, as both volume and glass price declined slightly. Net income was $160 million, down 6% sequentially on lower sales.  On our last call, I updated you on panel maker utilization dynamics. At the beginning of Q4, utilization began to increase from its low point, but it leveled off in December due to pandemic-related disruptions in China. And in January, the disruptions persisted, driving utilization back down and below retail demand. Subsequently, conditions in China improved.  In March, panel makers increased their utilization. And as a result, our volume increased from January and February levels.  We're expecting panel makers to run at higher utilization levels in the second quarter than they did in the first quarter. And therefore, we anticipate our sequential glass volume to increase significantly.  Favorable pricing is primarily driven by 2 factors. The first factor is the improving glass supply-and-demand balance. Glassmakers have been taking additional tanks offline for maintenance and repairs. As we've noted previously, we are taking this opportunity to upgrade our fleet with our latest technology, and we're actively managing the timing of tank restarts to align our supply to demand.  The second factor is glassmakers' profitability. In Q4, our 2 major competitors reported net losses, reinforcing our view that it is challenging for glassmakers who have high costs to remain profitable at current pricing levels. Moving to Specialty Materials. Demand for our long lead time semiconductor equipment products remains strong. However, smartphone and IT end-market demand remains weak. First quarter sales were $406 million, down 20% sequentially, consistent with typical seasonality. Net income was $39 million, down sequentially due to the lower sales.  We expect the continued adoption of our latest glass innovations, such as Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and the introduction of new glass formulations in the second half of 2023, to help offset continued softness in the smartphone and IT markets. Additionally, we believe that new innovation opportunities and emerging technologies like augmented reality and bendable devices will contribute to long-term growth.  Environmental Technologies' first quarter sales were $431 million. We saw increased GPF adoption in the quarter, which helped drive a 9% sequential improvement in sales. Net income increased 19% sequentially, driven by higher sales and improved productivity. We are not projecting a recovery in the automotive market in the second quarter and our current view of the full year is that auto sales remain below pre-pandemic levels, but our content-driven growth strategy continues to help us outperform the market. Turning to Life Sciences. First quarter sales were $256 million, down 13% sequentially, driven by lower demand for COVID-related products and the impact of customers drawing down their inventory. Net income was $9 million, driven by lower sales and our actions to reduce production levels in the quarter.  Let me take a minute to describe the market dynamics impacting this business and what we expect for the year. In 2021 and the first half of 2022, growth was largely driven by pandemic-related demand and customers over ordered due to supply chain challenges. Pandemic-related demand began tapering in the second half of 2022 and the industry was left with elevated inventory levels.  We expect our sales and profitability to improve as the industry corrects, and we restore productivity ratios back to pre-pandemic models.  Finally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses, sales in the first quarter were $386 million, up year-over-year and down sequentially, driven primarily by seasonally lower volumes in semiconductor polysilicon. Net income increased sequentially. We are seeing continued strong demand for solar-grade polysilicon to meet the need for a transparent, sustainable and traceable solar supply chain in the U.S. market. And we continue to see strong growth in automotive glass solutions and additional opportunities in pharmaceutical technologies.  Now let's turn to our outlook. For the second quarter, we expect total company sales to grow sequentially, led by Display as the industry continues to recover. We're not planning on strong second quarter sales sequential sales improvements in Optical Communications, Life Sciences or Specialty Materials. Turning to profitability, we expect to build on our progress from the first quarter and further improve profitability driven by our efforts to offset inflation and return productivity ratios to historical levels.  We expect sales in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion and EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.49. And free cash flow will improve strongly due to normal cyclicality and higher sales. And as I said earlier, we expect positive free cash flow in the second quarter. The most likely case for the second half is that sales and earnings increase versus the second quarter, although it's too early to be definitive, given continued global economic uncertainty, and its impact on consumer demand and infrastructure spending. I'd also like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. We prioritize organic growth through research and development and capital expenditures. The investment opportunities we target generate a 20% ROIC or greater. We expect 2023 full year capital expenditures to be slightly lower than 2022.  We are also prioritizing rewarding shareholders with our excess cash in 2 ways: first is dividends, which we've raised for 13 years in a row; second is share buybacks. We bought back about 5% of our outstanding shares in 2021, and we'll continue to be opportunistic.  Preserving the financial strength of the company is always a top priority. We maintain a strong balance sheet that provides appropriate durability and flexibility. And I'm proud to say Corning maintains one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our average maturity is about 25 years with no significant debt coming due in any given year. In sum, the actions we are taking position us to come out of this period of uncertainty, financially strong and well positioned for a return to growth.  Now I'd like to wrap up with a few key takeaways. In the second quarter, we expect sales, profitability and cash generation to improve, driven by our profit improvement actions, cost controls and continued recovery in Display Technologies.  We're executing a highly disciplined approach to our investment decisions while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're particularly focused on aligning our cost structure to the demand environment while maintaining the flexibility to address changing market conditions and capture upside as it occurs. Our long-term growth drivers all remain intact, and we're well positioned to continue capturing growth tied to key secular trends such as those playing out in the optical communications and solar markets.  And with that, I'll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Ed. Hey, operator, we are ready for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam: Congrats on the quarter. Just 2 if I could on optical. If you can just talk about the latest you're hearing from your customers and maybe speak a little bit more in terms of expectations of what's embedded for the second quarter.  And then secondly, on optical, I'm just trying to figure out in terms of where you're seeing some of the pause or more near-term softness. Is it broadly distributed? Or is it maybe more in the sort of subscale or smaller carriers, which may be facing tougher maybe financial conditions, which are impacting some of the longer-term investment plans?\nWendell Weeks: Thanks for the questions and the congratulations. Appreciate it. Optical, so here's the dynamics we're seeing over here with the customers and how we're reacting. So first, fiber and cable demand remains quite tight. And that's really -- you can see that with -- exhibited by the success of our recent price increase actions in that space. So for us, it's really the connectivity sales. So think hardware, connectors and the engineered systems for fiber-to-the-home and large-scale hyper-scale data centers are running below last year's levels, largely due to customer project timing.  Now what we hear from customers is the underlying drivers remains very robust: cloud, AI/ML, 5G broadband connectivity. So we're sort of facing this interesting economy, which is all the long-term drivers remain in place and they're all speaking about very robust deployment plans.  At the same time, we're just not seeing it in our order book, nor are we seeing it in earth being moved in these large civil works projects. So we're taking these words with a little grain of salt. And we're just not reflecting in our forecast and our guide any real robust recovery yet until we see it.  And it's not -- we're seeing this in large players, not just small folks. Some, I think, are seeking to conserve financial resources as they deal with their own uncertainty. But at the same time, haven't given up on their launch of strategic plans. It doesn't mean that we won't see a strong bounce back to the run rate that you'd expect to match with their words on deployment plans in the back half. We could see it. We're just not going to guide it until we have it in our hands. Does that make sense, Matt?\nMatthew Niknam: That's great. Yes. Very much appreciated. And I'll hand it over just others can get in the Q&A.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse.\nShannon Cross: Wendell, can you talk a bit more on the display rebound that you're seeing, particularly what you saw in March? And how you expect that to trend through the year? What key points are you tracking to make sure that we are seeing a bit of a rebound there?\nWendell Weeks: So as you heard in Ed's comments, what's good is that we originally started to see the recovery in quarter four. The pandemic shock sits in and sets in, in China, sort of we go backwards and that we expected that we would work our way through it and then start to see the recovery start again in quarter one. And that's what we saw in March. So we saw utilization start to climb.  We're seeing it continue to climb through this month. So as we're -- what we watch our -- what's actually happening with panel maker utilization, how are we seeing the dynamics play out between set makers and panel makers, it's looking to us like we're going to move beyond the recovery time, the correction time in this market and recovery is underway, and we'd expect to see that build in the coming quarters. That's the way it looks to us. That's the way it feels to us. That's what the data is telling us. But it's still early, right? So we're not coming out hard core and saying, yes, we're back to normal. We're not there yet. But we're seeing the trends all move in the right direction, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors, LLC.\nSteven Fox: A bit of a difficult question since it involves not guiding to the second half. But Wendell, you mentioned in your opening remarks that you thought you could grow in the second half. Where would you say that -- based on what you're seeing today, that there's opportunities for typical seasonality, where maybe we should capture expectations for seasonal improvements because the company is typically very back-end loaded in terms of their earnings growth half-over-half and The Street is looking for about 25% quarter-over-quarter improvement in earnings in Q3?\nEdward Schlesinger: Steve, this is Ed. I'll take that one. So maybe I'll start with the second quarter, and then I'll go to the second half. So as we think about the second quarter, in our guide, we're thinking about a significant improvement in Display. I think that's the primary driver. We're not expecting significant sales growth in other businesses. We specifically called out Optical, Life Sciences and Specialty Materials.  When you think about the second half, I think the first thing I'd start with is in Specialty Materials, we typically see customer product launches happen in the second half into business where usually our second half is higher than our first half. I think that's a dynamic that could play out.  And in our thoughts about the most likely case being the second half greater than the first half or greater than the second quarter, that's a place that I would expect to see growth.  I think additionally, Wendell described the Optical Communications situation very well, and we could certainly grow from first to second quarter levels in Optical Communications. Life Sciences, you could see a small increase. And then depending on how Display could play out, you could see growth there as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Just a follow-up on Steve's question. Wendell, when you said you would be disappointed if you did not see growth in second half from second quarter levels, historically, you have, on average, seen second half up 7% over first half. So it would be fairly dramatic for you to see not sequential growth. Would you say 2023, though, is shaping up in line with that kind of an expectation of second versus first half? Or is it more like recessionary years where maybe the dynamic track worse?  And if I could, I know you mentioned sequential, very strong sequential volume growth in 2Q in Display. Could you comment on how that looks on a year-on-year basis as well and where inventory levels are in Display?\nWendell Weeks: Let's take the second one. On the first one, Wamsi, it's an excellent question. So here's the way the dynamics were playing out within even our own company is our operating groups, our operating leaders sound very much like you. And they sound very much like our customers, all sort of pointing towards what you'd see normally and the behavior you would expect in our industries.  And what's happening is that's running in the tension with us sort of in the center of the company who are looking at this and saying, I think this is a pretty unusual time we find ourselves in and it's unclear to us that following the historical cycles, or following what our customers are telling us is going to necessarily lead us to the right answer in the short term.  So you're on top of the tension, which is why sort of we're wording it the way we are, which is we do expect growth. How much growth is under much debate within us, but it's not, I think, what we know, Wamsi, that's making us have that debate; it's the things that we don't know.  And that's sort of the way it's playing out and sort of each passing month brings us a little more clarity. So that's where we are, Wamsi. Does that answer make sense to you?\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Yes, it does, Wendell. Maybe just to step back for a second, if I could. Like do you feel that the macro environment, relative to 90 days ago, for your end markets is getting better or worse?\nWendell Weeks: I think that the integration of the macro environment into our customers' business plans, continues at different rates in different industries. So I'd say by and large, people are speaking less robustly than they were 90 days ago. Has it changed our point of view much? Well, at the center, probably not so much. In our operating units, probably more.  I think the more -- the really interesting question is -- isn't so much when does sort of realization of what the broad economic outlook sets in, in all the different inventories, it's when does the reverse happen? Like when do we start to see those more robust signals that show us we're really moving beyond it. And I just haven't seen those yet. That's what I'm looking for. And as soon as we see them, we'll tell you, Wamsi.\nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. And, Wamsi, you had asked about Display second quarter, what we've incorporated in our second quarter guide versus the prior year. So just a couple of thoughts. One, remember last year, the way Display played out is the first half was really strong. We started to see panel makers drop their utilization at the end of the second quarter, right? So Q3 and Q4, they ran at much lower rates. Q1 and Q2, they ran at much higher rates, right? And if you think about the way we typically do our guide, we always have a range of outcomes, right? So if I think about the second quarter this year for display, we think will run -- so now I'm going to go back to sequential for a second. We think panel makers will run sequentially higher in the second quarter than they did in the first quarter. And so it's possible they get to the same place as they did last year. That's certainly in the range of outcomes. I don't know that that's necessarily the most likely outcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Spector with UBS.\nJames Cannon: This is James Cannon on for Josh. I just wanted to touch on some of the dynamics with Display pricing. As you talked about some supportive dynamics, but if I think about what played out in the first quarter, it seemed like you had demand trending sort of in line with weak January, improving in March. And I was just wondering if you'd give some color on what happened with pricing that you had guided to being flat and came in down? And how that plays into what we should expect for the second quarter?\nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. I think, James, price was slightly down in the quarter, and I think the way we think about favorable pricing in any given quarter can be slightly up, it could be flat, it could be slightly down. So I think it's generally in line with the way we were thinking about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citi.\nAsiya Merchant: I was just going to talk looking into your free cash flow guidance. I know you guys have kind of talked about CapEx being slightly lower than '22 levels at $1.6 billion and strong sequential improvement in free cash flow. Should we expect free cash flow -- given that earnings should improve from here on, can we expect free cash flow to be higher than what you guys had in '22? Is that reasonable just given CapEx coming lower and hopefully operating on the earnings level as well doing better than '22?\nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. Asiya, I'm going to build a little bit on the way Wendell described the way we're thinking about sales and what could happen in the second quarter and the second half, right? I think there's certainly in a high-end case, yes, cash flow should follow our growth through the year. And if we grow at the higher end of the second quarter, and we continue to grow from there, yes, there's certainly a case to be made that, that would happen.  I think we're taking a little bit more moderate view of what might happen. So again, capital slightly down and free cash flow improving as sales improves, and just our normal cycling of cash flow, it's stronger in the second quarter and in the second half.\nAsiya Merchant: Correct. I think you guided last time to seeing significant working capital improvement that should buoy free cash flow generation year. So I guess I was just kind of circling back to those comments. And then any update on stock repurchases? Are you expecting to resume that at a level that was maybe consistent with if we dial it back a couple of years?\nEdward Schlesinger: No update on stock repurchases. We'll just continue to remain opportunistic there. And maybe I'll make one other comment on your cash flow statement. As I think about inventory, we talked about a lot of the dynamics that have driven it up through 2022 with respect to a very challenging supply chain environment and inflation. And our goal is to continue to drive it down. And I think in Q1, it stayed relatively flat, down a little bit. But remember, sales were really low. So we actually feel really good about that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: Ed, if I can just follow up on your comment about growth in Specialty Materials in the second half. When I go back and look at it historically, it's been a wide range of as low as 5%, I think, last year to as high as 45%. So just trying to sort of get a better color there in terms of what should we think about in terms of content growth with some of your customers into the second half? What's that magnitude? And what's also sort of from a macro perspective? Are you expecting to sort of from the first half versus second half variance there, just to be able to rightsize sort of what that magnitude looks like?  And, Wendell, one for you, in terms of have you been able to digest Biden's recent plans about pushing electric vehicle adoption to 50% by 2030? How does that impact overall sort of growth outlook for Environmental?\nEdward Schlesinger: Hi, Samik. Yes, I think you're certainly hitting on one of the areas that gives us a range of outcomes in the way we're thinking about the back half that is in specialty. Obviously, smartphone and PC IT demand remains relatively weak. I think it's possible that it's above the low end of the range. You articulated the sequential growth first -- second half over first half, but I don't know that I would say it's going to be at the high end of that range. We're not planning on growth levels at that -- growth at those levels.\nSamik Chatterjee: Wendell, any thoughts on the electrification plans of Biden from the current comment?\nWendell Weeks: Yes. And if -- by that, I assume you mean sort of the recent administration announcement from the EPA on what -- along with some of the industrial policy that goes with it, but at that EPA regulation that they've just released for comment.  And in that, the piece of it that we're most excited about is that they've now adopted the way to measure and the approach that the Europeans have, Chinese have, which will mean gas particulate filters will be required on all ICE vehicles in the U.S.  So that adds tremendously to our content at 2 to 3x to our content level for U.S. vehicles and U.S. markets, not a small market. So what this enables us to do is sort of keep our overall content that's in our environmental piece of our business, our emissions control piece of our business, sort of more Corning plays out as the number of ICE vehicles shrink. So we are quite excited by that.  Our core long-term answer to BEV is that's where we have focused on the bulk of our glass and optics and autonomy efforts. At this point in time, really our highest value-add vehicles on electric vehicles that has the most content on it, despite not using our emissions control because that tends to be where we're the most successful on both our interiors and our exteriors and now our autonomy products. Did I get to your question?\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes. No, that's interesting.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Maybe a question on the gross margin improvement that you saw in Q1 over Q4, clearly on down volumes. Just how much more fuel is there some of these activities to improve gross margin throughout the year, maybe kind of with or without volume improvement? I guess I'm just trying to see how some of the pricing actions or efficiency actions kind of fully reflected in what we see in Q1? Or just how much of that can carry throughout the year and improve margins even if we don't see kind of meaningful improvements in volumes?\nEdward Schlesinger: Hi, Meta. Yes. So first, thanks for the question. And maybe I'll just sort of reiterate how we described our margin improvement and what sort of played out in Q1. And then I'll get to sort of what happens from here. So yes, we increased price. That's definitely a big driver of why margins went up.  We're also looking to improve our productivity ratios back to the Wave brand prior to the pandemic. We've made progress there that takes cost out, and we're certainly taking fixed cost out as well. So those drove our margins up sequentially on lower sales, which is very unnatural.  I think there is definitely an opportunity for us to continue to do that. We do expect sales to go up in the second quarter, but we do expect profitability to go up as well from there. So I think there's more room to run from where we are now. And we're going to continue to work on it. It's clearly a priority for us.\nMeta Marshall: Great. And just does the opening of the North Carolina facility kind of impact optical profitability in the near term? Or can you guys still get efficiencies? Or does that plant even add more efficiencies that can help margins there?\nWendell Weeks: As always, as we fire these plants up, get a little bit of a drag as we fill them, but we've been able, because of the way -- because we prioritize protecting our people and our customers pre-pandemic, we ran at very high staffing levels and pretty high inventory levels. So we've been able, with our improvements in those things, to more than offset sort of the drag we've seen from opening up some of our new capacity. But very astute question. Yes, we do always get a drag before we get these things all the way filled up and all of our technology deployment. Very good [indiscernible] of getting productivity moving.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies.\nGeorge Notter: I had a question about the optical business. You were talking about fiber connectivity impacts. I think you talked about customer pacing of projects as being the issue there. But as I look around the industry, it does seem like there's been some inventory correction out there. I know lead times for fiber connectivity products at one point were quite long and now they're, to a significant degree, a lot shorter.  Is the issue there really customer pacing? Or is it more about excess inventory and you're going through an inventory correction? Any thoughts would be great.\nWendell Weeks: George, what an outstanding question and what an interesting debate, right? So you've seen the amount of inventory is how much they put in the ground determines how fast they burn through their inventory and of course, supply chain folks really across the globe. since they couldn't get everything they needed for sure, over ordered and did all sorts of things, right? And as supply chain times start, that is certainly part of it. George, there's no question. And I could even -- if I was less cynical, right, I could even explain most of the change as being that.  But then I look on the other side, and I'm looking at the pace of the actual ground getting moved via actual data centers getting built, right? And in that, there's a little bit of a disconnect there for me too in that if I took my customer statements of their deployment goals and integrated that with inventory, then I'd say, yes, we have a very strong bounce back starting to feel it pretty soon. But we're still going to take a little bit more of a conservative view. So I don't know if any of that was helpful, George. You made an excellent point. You could be absolutely right. We're just going to play out a little bit more conservatively and not plan on sort of a big jump up in the back half, driven by the fact that inventory came in line with deployments.\nGeorge Notter: Got it. And just as a follow-up on that. When you think about that fiber connectivity business, is more of the issue then around data center build? Or is it more about fiber-to-the-prem type builds or other types of optical networks? What would you kind of pin it on?\nWendell Weeks: It's probably more fiber to the plan prem, okay? Though hyperscale's definitely slower, right? But it's more fiber to the prem as it's those great big civil works builds that just aren't moving fast enough yet for us to feel comfortable to call it a strong recovery in that business.  Now that being said, that can happen quick, right? That can happen quickly because they haven't come off their stated goals yet, but we're just not seeing it yet, George.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays.\nTimothy Long: Just wanted to go back to Display for 2, if I could. First, Ed, could you talk a little bit about, obviously, a good recovery coming in the second quarter. I know you guys, you said, took a lot of tanks offline and did some retrofitting. So can you talk about kind of how much margin lift we're going to see not just from the volume, but from some of the changes? And then just, Wendell, I mean I just want to go back to kind of visibility in this business. Obviously, there was some head takes last quarter on utilization going up and then going down. So what level of visibility do you have into those utilization? I'm assuming you see well into this month, but how far out can you go with that?\nEdward Schlesinger: Thanks, Tim. So just to start with your first question. You're right. I think one of the key dynamics that we talk about all the time is glass supply-demand balance being key for pricing. So yes, we do manage our tank fleet in that respect. We will continue to do that and make sure that we manage our supply through that process.  That does impact profitability. That helps us going forward. I think a lot will have to do with how high the volume is in the quarter and how sort of all the dynamics play out.\nWendell Weeks: And I think our visibility will help us improve as we get to the end of this month, beginning of next. We have pretty good visibility, but our negotiations really are still going on given the pretty sharp upward inflection we're seeing in customers' volume requests. So that dynamic is still sort of playing out, but should get pretty clear over the next week or two.\nAnn Nicholson: I think we'll take one last question.\nOperator: Our last question is from the line of Martin Yang with Oppenheimer.\nMartin Yang: There's a reference on the call on new formulations for Gorilla Glass. Can you maybe comment on that? Is it in line with the annual upgrade cycle we have observed in the past? Or is that something a bit more significant similar to Ceramic Shield?\nWendell Weeks: Martin, could you repeat the question? I lost you a little bit in the middle of that.\nMartin Yang: Sure. So the question's about the reference to Gorilla Glass this year. You -- there's a comment on new formulation for Gorilla Glass. So is that new formulation a similar upgrade in the past on an annual cycle? Or is that new formulation something a little bit more significant similar to the Ceramic Shield product?\nWendell Weeks: I got it now. So it's not a jump up to glass ceramic. It's a pretty significant improvement at the glass level, and we're seeing really wide adoption but you're not seeing that fundamental very big jump in our value-add per device that you see from switching to a fundamentally new material set with very different manufacturing dynamics as well as drop dynamics.  So pretty significant improvement, but in the same glass material set doesn't have as much of a pop in terms of how much our sales revenue is profound as something like the Ceramic Shield.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Wendell. Thanks, Martin. I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. Before we close, inform you that we will host our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on April 27.  On May 23, we're going to attend the JPMorgan 51st Annual Global Technology and Communications Conference.  May 31 and June 1, we will be attending the Bernstein 39th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference.  And on June 22, we'll be attending the Fox Advisors Virtual Transportation Technology Conference.  Finally, a web replay of today's call will be available on our site starting later this morning. Thanks for joining us.  Operator, you may disconnect all lines.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Edward Schlesinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Morning, everyone. For the first quarter, we delivered results at the higher end of our expectations. Sales were $3.4 billion and EPS was $0.41. Gross margin was 35.2% and operating margin was 15.5%, both meaningful improvements from the fourth quarter.  Our free cash flow for the quarter was negative $383 million. The first quarter is typically negative due to cash flow cyclicality. This quarter, free cash flow was also impacted by lower sales, reflecting the recession-level demand we saw in several of our markets and overall weakness in China.  Looking forward, we expect positive free cash flow starting in the second quarter and for the remainder of 2023. Overall, our team demonstrated operational rigor during the quarter. We continue to make progress on improving our profitability by raising prices to help offset inflation and by adjusting our productivity ratios closer to historical levels, and we will continue to align our cost structure to successfully weather the demand environment.  We remain confident in our relevance to long-term secular trends and our More Corning approach, and we are well positioned to capture durable profitable growth as the global economy improves.  Now let's turn to our first quarter segment results. In Optical Communications, sales were $1.1 billion, down 6% sequentially as price increases partially offset a greater-than-normal seasonal volume decline associated with the pacing of customer projects.  Despite the decline in sales, net income grew 22% sequentially to $159 million, primarily driven by pricing and productivity actions taken in late 2022. We continue to believe the industry's underlying growth drivers are intact. Long-term demand for optical networks is strongly supported by trends in computation and by private and public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the population.  We're pursuing three significant secular trends: broadband; 5G; and the cloud. We've got major innovation programs underway for each category, and our connectivity solutions offer economic advantages for a broader range of customers than ever before. Display Technology sales in the first quarter were $763 million, down 3% sequentially, as both volume and glass price declined slightly. Net income was $160 million, down 6% sequentially on lower sales.  On our last call, I updated you on panel maker utilization dynamics. At the beginning of Q4, utilization began to increase from its low point, but it leveled off in December due to pandemic-related disruptions in China. And in January, the disruptions persisted, driving utilization back down and below retail demand. Subsequently, conditions in China improved.  In March, panel makers increased their utilization. And as a result, our volume increased from January and February levels.  We're expecting panel makers to run at higher utilization levels in the second quarter than they did in the first quarter. And therefore, we anticipate our sequential glass volume to increase significantly.  Favorable pricing is primarily driven by 2 factors. The first factor is the improving glass supply-and-demand balance. Glassmakers have been taking additional tanks offline for maintenance and repairs. As we've noted previously, we are taking this opportunity to upgrade our fleet with our latest technology, and we're actively managing the timing of tank restarts to align our supply to demand.  The second factor is glassmakers' profitability. In Q4, our 2 major competitors reported net losses, reinforcing our view that it is challenging for glassmakers who have high costs to remain profitable at current pricing levels. Moving to Specialty Materials. Demand for our long lead time semiconductor equipment products remains strong. However, smartphone and IT end-market demand remains weak. First quarter sales were $406 million, down 20% sequentially, consistent with typical seasonality. Net income was $39 million, down sequentially due to the lower sales.  We expect the continued adoption of our latest glass innovations, such as Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and the introduction of new glass formulations in the second half of 2023, to help offset continued softness in the smartphone and IT markets. Additionally, we believe that new innovation opportunities and emerging technologies like augmented reality and bendable devices will contribute to long-term growth.  Environmental Technologies' first quarter sales were $431 million. We saw increased GPF adoption in the quarter, which helped drive a 9% sequential improvement in sales. Net income increased 19% sequentially, driven by higher sales and improved productivity. We are not projecting a recovery in the automotive market in the second quarter and our current view of the full year is that auto sales remain below pre-pandemic levels, but our content-driven growth strategy continues to help us outperform the market. Turning to Life Sciences. First quarter sales were $256 million, down 13% sequentially, driven by lower demand for COVID-related products and the impact of customers drawing down their inventory. Net income was $9 million, driven by lower sales and our actions to reduce production levels in the quarter.  Let me take a minute to describe the market dynamics impacting this business and what we expect for the year. In 2021 and the first half of 2022, growth was largely driven by pandemic-related demand and customers over ordered due to supply chain challenges. Pandemic-related demand began tapering in the second half of 2022 and the industry was left with elevated inventory levels.  We expect our sales and profitability to improve as the industry corrects, and we restore productivity ratios back to pre-pandemic models.  Finally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses, sales in the first quarter were $386 million, up year-over-year and down sequentially, driven primarily by seasonally lower volumes in semiconductor polysilicon. Net income increased sequentially. We are seeing continued strong demand for solar-grade polysilicon to meet the need for a transparent, sustainable and traceable solar supply chain in the U.S. market. And we continue to see strong growth in automotive glass solutions and additional opportunities in pharmaceutical technologies.  Now let's turn to our outlook. For the second quarter, we expect total company sales to grow sequentially, led by Display as the industry continues to recover. We're not planning on strong second quarter sales sequential sales improvements in Optical Communications, Life Sciences or Specialty Materials. Turning to profitability, we expect to build on our progress from the first quarter and further improve profitability driven by our efforts to offset inflation and return productivity ratios to historical levels.  We expect sales in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion and EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.49. And free cash flow will improve strongly due to normal cyclicality and higher sales. And as I said earlier, we expect positive free cash flow in the second quarter. The most likely case for the second half is that sales and earnings increase versus the second quarter, although it's too early to be definitive, given continued global economic uncertainty, and its impact on consumer demand and infrastructure spending. I'd also like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. We prioritize organic growth through research and development and capital expenditures. The investment opportunities we target generate a 20% ROIC or greater. We expect 2023 full year capital expenditures to be slightly lower than 2022.  We are also prioritizing rewarding shareholders with our excess cash in 2 ways: first is dividends, which we've raised for 13 years in a row; second is share buybacks. We bought back about 5% of our outstanding shares in 2021, and we'll continue to be opportunistic.  Preserving the financial strength of the company is always a top priority. We maintain a strong balance sheet that provides appropriate durability and flexibility. And I'm proud to say Corning maintains one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our average maturity is about 25 years with no significant debt coming due in any given year. In sum, the actions we are taking position us to come out of this period of uncertainty, financially strong and well positioned for a return to growth.  Now I'd like to wrap up with a few key takeaways. In the second quarter, we expect sales, profitability and cash generation to improve, driven by our profit improvement actions, cost controls and continued recovery in Display Technologies.  We're executing a highly disciplined approach to our investment decisions while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're particularly focused on aligning our cost structure to the demand environment while maintaining the flexibility to address changing market conditions and capture upside as it occurs. Our long-term growth drivers all remain intact, and we're well positioned to continue capturing growth tied to key secular trends such as those playing out in the optical communications and solar markets.  And with that, I'll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A. Steve, this is Ed. I'll take that one. So maybe I'll start with the second quarter, and then I'll go to the second half. So as we think about the second quarter, in our guide, we're thinking about a significant improvement in Display. I think that's the primary driver. We're not expecting significant sales growth in other businesses. We specifically called out Optical, Life Sciences and Specialty Materials.  When you think about the second half, I think the first thing I'd start with is in Specialty Materials, we typically see customer product launches happen in the second half into business where usually our second half is higher than our first half. I think that's a dynamic that could play out.  And in our thoughts about the most likely case being the second half greater than the first half or greater than the second quarter, that's a place that I would expect to see growth.  I think additionally, Wendell described the Optical Communications situation very well, and we could certainly grow from first to second quarter levels in Optical Communications. Life Sciences, you could see a small increase. And then depending on how Display could play out, you could see growth there as well. Yes. And, Wamsi, you had asked about Display second quarter, what we've incorporated in our second quarter guide versus the prior year. So just a couple of thoughts. One, remember last year, the way Display played out is the first half was really strong. We started to see panel makers drop their utilization at the end of the second quarter, right? So Q3 and Q4, they ran at much lower rates. Q1 and Q2, they ran at much higher rates, right? And if you think about the way we typically do our guide, we always have a range of outcomes, right? So if I think about the second quarter this year for display, we think will run -- so now I'm going to go back to sequential for a second. We think panel makers will run sequentially higher in the second quarter than they did in the first quarter. And so it's possible they get to the same place as they did last year. That's certainly in the range of outcomes. I don't know that that's necessarily the most likely outcome. Yes. I think, James, price was slightly down in the quarter, and I think the way we think about favorable pricing in any given quarter can be slightly up, it could be flat, it could be slightly down. So I think it's generally in line with the way we were thinking about it. Yes. Asiya, I'm going to build a little bit on the way Wendell described the way we're thinking about sales and what could happen in the second quarter and the second half, right? I think there's certainly in a high-end case, yes, cash flow should follow our growth through the year. And if we grow at the higher end of the second quarter, and we continue to grow from there, yes, there's certainly a case to be made that, that would happen.  I think we're taking a little bit more moderate view of what might happen. So again, capital slightly down and free cash flow improving as sales improves, and just our normal cycling of cash flow, it's stronger in the second quarter and in the second half. No update on stock repurchases. We'll just continue to remain opportunistic there. And maybe I'll make one other comment on your cash flow statement. As I think about inventory, we talked about a lot of the dynamics that have driven it up through 2022 with respect to a very challenging supply chain environment and inflation. And our goal is to continue to drive it down. And I think in Q1, it stayed relatively flat, down a little bit. But remember, sales were really low. So we actually feel really good about that. Hi, Samik. Yes, I think you're certainly hitting on one of the areas that gives us a range of outcomes in the way we're thinking about the back half that is in specialty. Obviously, smartphone and PC IT demand remains relatively weak. I think it's possible that it's above the low end of the range. You articulated the sequential growth first -- second half over first half, but I don't know that I would say it's going to be at the high end of that range. We're not planning on growth levels at that -- growth at those levels. Hi, Meta. Yes. So first, thanks for the question. And maybe I'll just sort of reiterate how we described our margin improvement and what sort of played out in Q1. And then I'll get to sort of what happens from here. So yes, we increased price. That's definitely a big driver of why margins went up.  We're also looking to improve our productivity ratios back to the Wave brand prior to the pandemic. We've made progress there that takes cost out, and we're certainly taking fixed cost out as well. So those drove our margins up sequentially on lower sales, which is very unnatural.  I think there is definitely an opportunity for us to continue to do that. We do expect sales to go up in the second quarter, but we do expect profitability to go up as well from there. So I think there's more room to run from where we are now. And we're going to continue to work on it. It's clearly a priority for us. Thanks, Tim. So just to start with your first question. You're right. I think one of the key dynamics that we talk about all the time is glass supply-demand balance being key for pricing. So yes, we do manage our tank fleet in that respect. We will continue to do that and make sure that we manage our supply through that process.  That does impact profitability. That helps us going forward. I think a lot will have to do with how high the volume is in the quarter and how sort of all the dynamics play out."

            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, we told you that markets constituting about 1/2 of our sales were experiencing recession-level demand; that our first quarter sales would decline by greater-than-normal seasonality due to the pandemic-related disruptions in China; that we would raise prices again to offset additional inflation; and also begin to restore our productivity ratios to pre-pandemic levels; and as a result, our margins would increase 1 to 2 percentage points sequentially, despite lower sales. And that is exactly how the first quarter played out. First quarter sales were $3.4 billion, and EPS was $0.41. Our actions to raise prices and restore productivity ratios began delivering notable results. Despite a 7% sequential sales decline, gross margin expanded 160 basis points sequentially to 35.2%. And operating margin expanded 150 basis points from the prior quarter to 15.5%.  Although conditions remain weak in multiple markets, we expect our results to improve in the second quarter. We remain focused on profitability and cash flow, and we will continue to align our cost structure to demand.  Now I wanted to provide some context on the dynamics we're experienced in our key markets. And then I'll discuss how we're continuing to build our long-term growth opportunities across our businesses. So let's dive in.  In Display Technologies, sales declined 3% sequentially as both volume and glass price declined slightly. In March, panel maker utilization increased, and we expect our volume in the second quarter to increase significantly from the first quarter. As conditions continue to improve, we're optimistic the panel maker utilization is beginning to move beyond correction levels and will return to more normal levels in the coming quarters.  In Optical Communications, sales declined 6% sequentially. Our pricing actions partially offset a greater-than-normal seasonal volume decline in connectivity solutions, which is associated with the pacing of several large customer projects. Our pricing and productivity actions resulted in net income improving 22% sequentially despite the lower sales. Government commitments to connect the unconnected are contributing to robust cable and fiber demand, and we continue to advance our leadership. Last month, we officially opened an optical cable manufacturing campus in North Carolina to help provide U.S. network operators with the cable they need to bring high-speed optical connectivity to underserved communities, particularly in rural America. Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo said, \"It is past time that every American be connected with affordable Internet no matter where they live. We could not do it without the folks at Corning. We wouldn't have the fiber, the innovation or the cable.\"  Finally, in Environmental Technologies, we saw increased adoption of gasoline particulate filters in the quarter, which helped drive a 9% sequential improvement in sales despite the languishing car market. Net income grew 19% in the segment based on our productivity actions and growing sales.  To sum up the short term, we're seeing improvement in some of our markets, but a series of challenges continues to ripple across the global economy. Nevertheless, we expect to grow sequentially in the second quarter and to improve our key financial metrics. For the back half of the year, I'd be disappointed if we didn't grow from second quarter levels.  Longer term, we will continue to innovate and capture growth opportunities as they materialize. We're energized about Corning's future. And I'd like to review some of the reasons why.  It all starts with our focused and cohesive portfolio. We maintain clear leadership in three core technologies, and four proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms that are viable to solving a broad range of significant challenges in shaping through industries. We apply new combinations of our assets and capabilities to advance important secular trends in tandem with our customers. And by reapplying and repurposing our insights and assets across multiple opportunities in markets, we increase our profitability.  In Optical Communications, we've been leading in the industry for more than 50 years. This business is the most fully evolved example of Corning's focused portfolio using all 3 of our core technologies and 4 of our manufacturing and engineering platforms. And we will continue to apply these capabilities to help build a more connected world over the next 50 years. In Display, by leveraging all 3 of our core technologies and evolving our fusion platform, we have achieved large scale and broad capabilities that have advanced our leadership position. As our customers evolve, we're helping them create a world with richer and more lifelike and ubiquitous displays.  In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we invented the cover glass category and redefined it by integrating glass with ceramics and by combining fusion with vapor deposition. We continue to advance the state-of-the-art with our leading cover materials, which have been deployed on more than 8 billion devices to date. And we've recently entered new product categories that provide opportunities for more of our content. For example, the camera lens covers on devices like the Samsung Galaxy S22 and S23 series.  These advancements are excellent examples of our More Corning approach. We're also innovating in emerging technologies like augmented reality and bendable devices, which we expect to contribute to long-term growth.  In Automotive, we're helping build a world where vehicles are increasingly green and where software and displays are enabling new in-vehicle experiences.  Our inventions are enabling industry leaders to meet stringent upcoming EU7 emissions regulations and achieve near 0 emissions levels. And we're collaborating with LG Electronics, a global technology and vehicle component solutions innovator, to advance in-car connectivity. Overall, we're helping to solve more and more of our customers' challenges in design, connectivity and autonomy. And at CES, we continue to generate strong industry excitement about how our technical glass and optics capabilities can expand the boundaries of what's possible.  Finally, in Life Sciences, we're using Corning's core glass and optical physics technologies along with our expertise in vapor deposition, precision forming and extrusion, to help support the discovery and delivery of new medicines, including biological treatments, that are personalized, effective and safe. So as you can see, our investments and distinctive capabilities have placed us at the center of secular trends touching many facets of basic life. And we believe we will continue to develop category defining products to transform industries and enhance lives.  I'm also excited by our growth opportunities in the renewable energy industry, where I believe we can make significant additional contributions to a sustainable U.S.-based solar supply chain.  We're proud to make the world just a little bit better wherever we can, and that extends to all of our stakeholders, especially in these uncertain times.  We recently released our DE&I and sustainability reports, which capture the great progress we've made and underscore our commitment to helping move the world forward. So as I wrap up my remarks, here's what I'd like to leave you with today. Moving forward throughout 2023, we'll continue to focus on operating each of our businesses well and adjusting to meet the needs of the moment, including aligning our cost structure to the demand environment. At the same time, we're advancing growth initiatives and capabilities that will drive long-term success.  We remain well positioned to continue capturing some very rich set of long-term opportunities that we've built across our Market-Access Platforms. I look forward to updating you on our progress.  Now I'll turn the call over to Ed, so he can get into the details of our financial priorities, along with our results and outlook. Ed? Thanks for the questions and the congratulations. Appreciate it. Optical, so here's the dynamics we're seeing over here with the customers and how we're reacting. So first, fiber and cable demand remains quite tight. And that's really -- you can see that with -- exhibited by the success of our recent price increase actions in that space. So for us, it's really the connectivity sales. So think hardware, connectors and the engineered systems for fiber-to-the-home and large-scale hyper-scale data centers are running below last year's levels, largely due to customer project timing.  Now what we hear from customers is the underlying drivers remains very robust: cloud, AI/ML, 5G broadband connectivity. So we're sort of facing this interesting economy, which is all the long-term drivers remain in place and they're all speaking about very robust deployment plans.  At the same time, we're just not seeing it in our order book, nor are we seeing it in earth being moved in these large civil works projects. So we're taking these words with a little grain of salt. And we're just not reflecting in our forecast and our guide any real robust recovery yet until we see it.  And it's not -- we're seeing this in large players, not just small folks. Some, I think, are seeking to conserve financial resources as they deal with their own uncertainty. But at the same time, haven't given up on their launch of strategic plans. It doesn't mean that we won't see a strong bounce back to the run rate that you'd expect to match with their words on deployment plans in the back half. We could see it. We're just not going to guide it until we have it in our hands. Does that make sense, Matt? So as you heard in Ed's comments, what's good is that we originally started to see the recovery in quarter four. The pandemic shock sits in and sets in, in China, sort of we go backwards and that we expected that we would work our way through it and then start to see the recovery start again in quarter one. And that's what we saw in March. So we saw utilization start to climb.  We're seeing it continue to climb through this month. So as we're -- what we watch our -- what's actually happening with panel maker utilization, how are we seeing the dynamics play out between set makers and panel makers, it's looking to us like we're going to move beyond the recovery time, the correction time in this market and recovery is underway, and we'd expect to see that build in the coming quarters. That's the way it looks to us. That's the way it feels to us. That's what the data is telling us. But it's still early, right? So we're not coming out hard core and saying, yes, we're back to normal. We're not there yet. But we're seeing the trends all move in the right direction, Shannon. Let's take the second one. On the first one, Wamsi, it's an excellent question. So here's the way the dynamics were playing out within even our own company is our operating groups, our operating leaders sound very much like you. And they sound very much like our customers, all sort of pointing towards what you'd see normally and the behavior you would expect in our industries.  And what's happening is that's running in the tension with us sort of in the center of the company who are looking at this and saying, I think this is a pretty unusual time we find ourselves in and it's unclear to us that following the historical cycles, or following what our customers are telling us is going to necessarily lead us to the right answer in the short term.  So you're on top of the tension, which is why sort of we're wording it the way we are, which is we do expect growth. How much growth is under much debate within us, but it's not, I think, what we know, Wamsi, that's making us have that debate; it's the things that we don't know.  And that's sort of the way it's playing out and sort of each passing month brings us a little more clarity. So that's where we are, Wamsi. Does that answer make sense to you? I think that the integration of the macro environment into our customers' business plans, continues at different rates in different industries. So I'd say by and large, people are speaking less robustly than they were 90 days ago. Has it changed our point of view much? Well, at the center, probably not so much. In our operating units, probably more.  I think the more -- the really interesting question is -- isn't so much when does sort of realization of what the broad economic outlook sets in, in all the different inventories, it's when does the reverse happen? Like when do we start to see those more robust signals that show us we're really moving beyond it. And I just haven't seen those yet. That's what I'm looking for. And as soon as we see them, we'll tell you, Wamsi. Yes. And if -- by that, I assume you mean sort of the recent administration announcement from the EPA on what -- along with some of the industrial policy that goes with it, but at that EPA regulation that they've just released for comment.  And in that, the piece of it that we're most excited about is that they've now adopted the way to measure and the approach that the Europeans have, Chinese have, which will mean gas particulate filters will be required on all ICE vehicles in the U.S.  So that adds tremendously to our content at 2 to 3x to our content level for U.S. vehicles and U.S. markets, not a small market. So what this enables us to do is sort of keep our overall content that's in our environmental piece of our business, our emissions control piece of our business, sort of more Corning plays out as the number of ICE vehicles shrink. So we are quite excited by that.  Our core long-term answer to BEV is that's where we have focused on the bulk of our glass and optics and autonomy efforts. At this point in time, really our highest value-add vehicles on electric vehicles that has the most content on it, despite not using our emissions control because that tends to be where we're the most successful on both our interiors and our exteriors and now our autonomy products. Did I get to your question? As always, as we fire these plants up, get a little bit of a drag as we fill them, but we've been able, because of the way -- because we prioritize protecting our people and our customers pre-pandemic, we ran at very high staffing levels and pretty high inventory levels. So we've been able, with our improvements in those things, to more than offset sort of the drag we've seen from opening up some of our new capacity. But very astute question. Yes, we do always get a drag before we get these things all the way filled up and all of our technology deployment. Very good [indiscernible] of getting productivity moving. George, what an outstanding question and what an interesting debate, right? So you've seen the amount of inventory is how much they put in the ground determines how fast they burn through their inventory and of course, supply chain folks really across the globe. since they couldn't get everything they needed for sure, over ordered and did all sorts of things, right? And as supply chain times start, that is certainly part of it. George, there's no question. And I could even -- if I was less cynical, right, I could even explain most of the change as being that.  But then I look on the other side, and I'm looking at the pace of the actual ground getting moved via actual data centers getting built, right? And in that, there's a little bit of a disconnect there for me too in that if I took my customer statements of their deployment goals and integrated that with inventory, then I'd say, yes, we have a very strong bounce back starting to feel it pretty soon. But we're still going to take a little bit more of a conservative view. So I don't know if any of that was helpful, George. You made an excellent point. You could be absolutely right. We're just going to play out a little bit more conservatively and not plan on sort of a big jump up in the back half, driven by the fact that inventory came in line with deployments. It's probably more fiber to the plan prem, okay? Though hyperscale's definitely slower, right? But it's more fiber to the prem as it's those great big civil works builds that just aren't moving fast enough yet for us to feel comfortable to call it a strong recovery in that business.  Now that being said, that can happen quick, right? That can happen quickly because they haven't come off their stated goals yet, but we're just not seeing it yet, George. And I think our visibility will help us improve as we get to the end of this month, beginning of next. We have pretty good visibility, but our negotiations really are still going on given the pretty sharp upward inflection we're seeing in customers' volume requests. So that dynamic is still sort of playing out, but should get pretty clear over the next week or two. Martin, could you repeat the question? I lost you a little bit in the middle of that. I got it now. So it's not a jump up to glass ceramic. It's a pretty significant improvement at the glass level, and we're seeing really wide adoption but you're not seeing that fundamental very big jump in our value-add per device that you see from switching to a fundamentally new material set with very different manufacturing dynamics as well as drop dynamics.  So pretty significant improvement, but in the same glass material set doesn't have as much of a pop in terms of how much our sales revenue is profound as something like the Ceramic Shield."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. It is my pleasure to introduce you to Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, Dilem, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the third quarter, the difference between GAAP and core EPS primarily reflected noncash mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's translated earnings contracts and Japanese yen-denominated debt, constant currency adjustments and noncash asset write-offs and charges. As a reminder, the mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the interactive analyst center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast and we encourage you to follow along. Now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced strong third quarter 2024 results. Year-over-year, sales grew 8% to $3.73 billion, and EPS grew 20% to $0.54. Our quarter three outperformance was led by Optical Communications, where continued strong adoption of our new optical connectivity products for generative AI drove 55% year-over-year growth in the Enterprise portion of the segment. Our momentum continues as we close out the year. In the fourth quarter, we expect year-over-year sales growth to accelerate and EPS to continue growing faster than sales. And Ed will elaborate more on that in a moment. Overall, our results and outlook show we're making strong progress on our Springboard plan to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales with powerful incremental profit and cash flow and to achieve an operating margin of 20% by the end of 2026. So before Ed and I get into the details, let me just briefly recap the primary elements of Springboard. First, this chart reflects our internal non-risk adjusted Springboard plan. This is what our business operators are focused on delivering. There's a lot to take away from this slide. We have a significant sales opportunity. We're looking at potential growth of $8 billion in annualized sales run rate by the end of 2028 with $5 billion by the end of 2026. Now remember, this is our internal plan. When we say it's not risk adjusted, what we mean is the projections are based on a number of assumptions including markets recovering to historical trend lines with continued growth thereafter, successful adoption of new innovations across a number of markets and platforms and successful execution of all our operational milestones for productivity and for price. But what we wanted to do was take our $8 billion opportunity and translate it into a high confidence plan for our shareholders. To do that, first, we focused on a three-year time period. Second, we probabilistically adjusted for different potential outcomes in each of our market access platforms including market dynamics, timing of secular trends, successful adoption of our innovations, as well as volume, pricing and market share across all our businesses as well as the potential that some of our markets may go through down cycles. And this is how we come to the high confidence Springboard plan, to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales and achieved operating margin of 20% by the end of 2026. It's also important to know that we purposely drew this as a wedge. We weren't trying to guide every quarter for the next 12 quarters. It obviously will not be a straight line, but we're also not dealing with a hockey stick. When we built the plan, we expected to see strong growth this year. And that's exactly what you're seeing in our results. So I'd like to take a moment to share two important observations about our performance. First, we're significantly improving our return profile. In the third quarter, we again drove sales growth while demonstrating our ability to deliver the powerful incrementals embedded in Springboard. In the third quarter, sales grew 8% year-over-year. EPS grew more than twice as fast as sales. Operating margin expanded 160 basis points year-over-year to 18.3% and gross margin expanded 220 basis points to 39.2%. We also generated strong free cash flow of $553 million and we continued buying back shares in the third quarter. Second, we're reaching key strategic milestones that underscore the significant progress we've made against our high confidence plan. Let me just briefly summarize the recent milestones in Display and in Optical. In Display, our Springboard plan is centered on maintaining stable US dollar net income. To achieve this, we are raising glass prices. Our price actions, in combination with the hedges we have in place through 2026 will deliver consistent profitability in the segment. We expect to deliver net income of $900 million to $950 million next year and to deliver net income margin of 25%, consistent with the last five years. Simply put, our price increases offset the weaker yen in our hedges and we expect to maintain the same profitability. Most importantly, we will continue to be the low-cost technology and market leader in Display. Overall, we're providing a strong base in Display for our Springboard growth. In Optical Communications, our Springboard plan is about revenue growth as cyclical and secular trends converge to drive demand for our unique capabilities. When we introduced our Gen AI products in June, we said we expected to grow our Enterprise business at a 25% compound annual growth rate over the next four years. Looking back to the second quarter, strong demand for our new Gen AI products drove outperformance and our Enterprise business grew by 42% year-over-year. As I noted, our performance continues. Enterprise grew by 55% in the third quarter versus last year. That growth reflects the Gen AI opportunity inside the data center. We've also introduced a set of innovations to help our customers build a new network to interconnect AI-enabled data centers. As part of an agreement with Lumen Technologies, which reserves 10% of our global fiber capacity for each of the next two years. We recently launched the first outside plant deployment of Corning's new Gen AI fiber and cable system that enables Lumen to fit anywhere from two to four times the amount of fiber into their existing conduit. This is an exciting new space and we expect to capture other large opportunities. Optical is also marking important developments with other important carrier customers, Verizon and AT&T. At the Broadband Strategy Event last week, Verizon highlighted their partnership with Corning and said we're delivering technologies to make it easier for them to reach their deployment goals. They plan to significantly expand their fiber footprint from 25 million fiber passings to more than 30 million fiber passings by 2028. We also just announced a multiyear purchase agreement with AT&T to provide next-generation fiber, cable and connectivity solutions to support the expansion of AT&T's fiber network and help bring high-speed Internet to more Americans. The agreement valued at more than $1 billion builds on a decades-long collaboration between our companies. AT&T is expanding its network to bring world-class fiber to more people and places across the country. By using Corning's newest preconnectorized solutions, AT&T can accelerate its network expansion and enhance network performance while minimizing deployment cost. They'll leverage our latest additions to our portfolio of connectivity solutions, which are fully compliant with the Build America Buy America provisions of the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment program. The program known as BEAD is part of the government's efforts to bring high-speed Internet to rural communities. Stepping back. As you can see, we're three quarters into our three-year Springboard plan and we're making significant progress. Our third quarter results demonstrate the sales growth and the powerful incremental profit and cash flow we expect to deliver as we improve our return profile and march steadily toward our 20% operating margin target by the end of 2026. And we're marking significant milestones along our Springboard journey. And we have plenty of milestones ahead. In Optical Communications, we expect carriers to return to buying at deployment rates and for their deployment rates to increase and drive growth in 2025. And we expect the BEAD program to gather momentum starting in the second half of 2025. We have a triple-digit automotive glass business today and we expect sales in that business to almost triple by 2026. We expect recently announced US EPA regulations to force gas particulate filter adoption and drive hundreds of millions of dollars of growth for us in the US alone with sales starting in 2026. Finally, we plan to launch a new solar market access platform. Overall, we positioned our businesses to benefit from a convergence of cyclical and secular trends to drive growth across the company through 2026 and beyond. We'll continue to update you as we hit significant milestones. Now let me turn it over to Ed for some more detail and perspective on the quarter as well as Springboard.\nEdward Schlesinger: Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. As you just heard, we had an outstanding quarter. Year-over-year, Q3 sales grew 8% to $3.73 billion, and EPS grew 20%, more than twice the rate of sales to $0.54 with operating margin expanding 160 basis points to 18.3%. We also generated free cash flow of $553 million. Our outperformance was led by Optical Communications. Sales grew 36% year-over-year and sales in the Enterprise business grew 55%, driven by continued strong adoption of our new optical connectivity products for Generative AI. We expect our momentum to continue. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate year-over-year sales growth to accelerate and EPS to again grow faster than sales, with sales up about 15% to approximately $3.75 billion and EPS up approximately 40% in the range of $0.53 to $0.57. Today, I'll provide more detail on our Q3 results and Q4 outlook as well as put them into the context of our overall Springboard plan. As a reminder, a key component of our plan is to deliver powerful incrementals. We have the capacity and technical capabilities in place to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales by the end of 2026 with minimal cash investment and the cost and capital are already reflected in our financials. This means that we expect to grow profit significantly faster than sales, and that's exactly what we're seeing in our third quarter results. So let's dive in. In Optical Communications, Sales for the third quarter were $1.2 billion, up 36% year-over-year and net income for the quarter was $175 million, up 92% year-over-year as we delivered strong incremental profit on the higher volume. In our Enterprise business, sales were up 55% year-over-year driven by continued strong adoption of AI-related connectivity solutions. This marks another record quarter in this business and adds to our confidence in our plan to grow Enterprise at a 25% compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2027. We also grew year-over-year in our carrier business in the third quarter. We're encouraged by new customer agreements, including our recent announcements with AT&T and Lumen. Overall, we expect both cyclical and secular drivers in Optical Communications to sustain growth in 2025 and beyond. Moving to Display Technologies. Third quarter sales were $1 billion, consistent with the second quarter. Net income was $285 million, up 10% sequentially. Our third quarter volume was down sequentially as panel makers began to lower their utilization rates in the quarter. We expect panel makers to continue managing their operations to maintain healthy inventory levels. As a result, we expect the glass market and our volume to decline sequentially in the fourth quarter. Longer term, we expect the display glass market to grow at a low single-digit rate, supported by stable TV unit sales and average screen size growing about one inch per year. As we shared with you at our September investor event, we are raising glass prices to ensure we can maintain stable US dollar net income. Specifically, we implemented currency-based price increases in Q3. Overall, our customers are experiencing a double-digit price increase in the second half of 2024. In total, our price increases offset the weaker yen in our hedges, and therefore, we expect to maintain the same profitability. As a result, when we move to our new yen core rate in 2025, we do not plan to recast our 2024 financials. As a reminder, we have the majority of our yen exposure hedged for 2025 and 2026 and we also have hedges in place beyond 2026. Our hedges are not at the 2024 core rate of 107, but they're much better than the current spot rate. We expect to deliver net income of $900 million to $950 million next year and net income margin of 25%, consistent with the last five years. Turning to Specialty Materials. Sales in the third quarter were $548 million, up 9% sequentially, primarily driven by premium glass for mobile devices. Net income was $72 million, up 14% sequentially, reflecting higher volume. In Environmental Technologies, third quarter sales were $382 million, down 11% sequentially reflecting the continued impact of the Class 8 truck down cycle in North America, as anticipated. Net income of $75 million was down sequentially, reflecting lower volume. We expect the heavy-duty market weakness to continue and sales and environmental to remain muted in the fourth quarter. In Life Sciences, sales in the quarter were $244 million, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was $15 million, up 15% year-over-year. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. Sales in the third quarter were $298 million, consistent sequentially. Finally, I'd like to touch on operating expenses. As we've told you in the past, our pay is tied directly to our financial performance. As our performance has accelerated this year, we have increased our variable compensation accruals accordingly. This leads to temporarily higher operating expenses in the back half of 2024. With that, I'd like to shift gears and put our third quarter results and Q4 guidance in context of Springboard and update you on how we are tracking against the plan. This chart shows both our non-risk adjusted $5 billion sales plan and our $3 billion high confidence sales plan. So how are we doing? Let me first explain the $1.84 billion dot point you see on the chart. Our Q3 2024 sales were $3.73 billion. Our Q4 2023 sales, which is our Springboard starting point were $3.27 billion. So our sales were $460 million higher in Q3 2024 than in Q4 of 2023. And when you annualize that, you get to $1.84 billion. Therefore, we're currently tracking at a $1.84 billion incremental annual sales run rate against our $3 billion plus target. And that trend continues into quarter four. The additional sequential growth implied in our Q4 guidance increases our run rate in the fourth quarter to $1.9 billion. As we shared in September, our Springboard plan includes an operating margin target of 20% by the end of 2026. This target leads to an improving return profile with profitability growing significantly faster than sales. You can see this in our third quarter results, where EPS grew 20% year-over-year, more than twice as fast as the sales growth rate. Additionally, our operating margin was 18.3%. This represents a 200 basis point improvement from our starting point of 16.3% in Q4 2023. Stepping back, we've made great progress against our sales and operating margin targets to date. But please remember, we're only three quarters into a 12-quarter plan. Springboard is a milestone-based plan evolving through 2026. And finally, we expect to generate significant cash flow over the Springboard time frame because we already have the capacity and technical capabilities in place to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales by the end of 2026. For the year, we've reduced our capital expenditures to approximately $1.1 billion. So let me spend a minute on capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same. We prioritize investing for organic growth opportunities. We believe this creates the most value for our shareholders over the long-term. We also seek to maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet. And we're in great shape here. We have one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is about 23 years with only $1 billion in debt coming due over the next five years and we have no significant debt coming due in any given year. Finally, we expect to continue our strong track record of returning excess cash to shareholders. And because of our growing confidence in Springboard, we started to buy back shares in the second quarter and we continue to do so in the third quarter. So as I wrap up today, I'd like to reiterate that we had an outstanding third quarter. We're tracking ahead of our Springboard plan. We expect continued strong performance in Q4 with year-over-year sales growth accelerating and EPS again growing faster than sales and we expect to sustain our momentum in 2025 and beyond. We look forward to updating you as we continue to make progress. With that, I'll turn it back to Ann.\nAnn Nicholson: Great. Thank you, Ed. We're ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I show the first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. And I guess for the first one, if I can start with the agreement that you signed with AT&T. And Wendell, you spoke about the opportunity there, but if you can just more sort of dive into the details in relation to how much of that is sort of an incremental opportunity that you're seeing relative to some of the existing business that you do with AT&T on an ongoing basis. And sort of a broader question to the fiber opportunity is, is there something that's fundamentally changed? The question we're getting a lot from investors is in terms of fiber utilization. Is there something that's fundamentally changed that is going to drive a significant cycle on the fiber side just because fiber utilization has changed over the last few years? Can you help us think about that more on a longer-term basis as well? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: And Samik, a question for you on clarification. When you say fiber utilization, you mean?\nSamik Chatterjee: In the more telecom networks, but in relation to the investment in fiber over the years. Has something changed in relation to being a lot more congested on fiber or very high fiber utilization already and seeing that drive a significant cycle or are we sort of extrapolating just the amount of announcements, not really looking at the utilization, which is still probably low.\nWendell Weeks: Totally understand. Thank you, Samik. I would divide this really into two major sections. The first, let's address the AT&T announcement. That's really our carrier segment and it's part of the cyclical upward trend that we identified as part of our Springboard plan and we're viewing this to be very much in line with Springboard and an encouraging sign for us that we can expect the carrier spring to activate sometime here in the near future. We're not calling that yet because we'd like to see a couple more quarters of the actual order rate and the actual deployment rates. But it's certainly encouraging. And this is what we mean by one of the cyclical trends in our Springboard plan for Optical. So encouraging, but we're not yet calling the spring activated. To your next question, one of the things you've seen with a lot of the announcements sort of has to do with Gen AI and interconnecting Gen AI-enabled data centers. Of that, we are seeing really a different link has to get activated and therefore using your terminology of fiber utilization on those links between Gen AI data centers are relatively full. And that's what you saw with the Lumen announcement. We'll have to see how Gen AI develops and how they end up splitting the very large clusters, but that could develop into a very significant growth driver for us going forward, Samik.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Thanks for taking my questions.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, first, on the 4Q revenue guide, if there's any additional color or context you can share in terms of unpacking expectations across the different segments. And then one follow-up on optical. Can you clarify whether there was any contribution from the Lumen deal in the third quarter, whether that is expected to kick-in, in the fourth quarter? Just trying to get a sense of that ramp-up to the run rate. Thanks.\nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. Hey, Matt, it's Ed. Thanks for the question. So first, on Lumen. No impact in the third quarter and I would say minimal to no impact in the fourth quarter expected. We see that as a 2025, 2026 opportunity. And with respect to our guide, as we always do, we factor in a number of potential outcomes across all of our different segments. I think the one thing that's maybe a little noteworthy about the fourth quarter guide is typically, we're not seasonally up Q4 versus Q3. We're typically flat to slightly down. So we're seeing a lot of positive momentum in general, in particular, in Optical Communications. But in general, I think that's what's driving us to guide ourselves a little bit above normal seasonality.\nMatthew Niknam: Great. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Fox Advisors LLC. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good morning guys. Two questions from me, if I could. Real quick on the cash flows. Ed, can you put a little bit of context around the free cash flow you generated in the quarter? I think it was the best I've seen from you guys since 2018 in the third quarter. How do we put that in perspective with future free cash flows or was there any onetime things we should think about? And then from an optical standpoint, just on the cloud side of the business. Can you give us a little more perspective on the relative momentum versus Enterprise and how you think about that momentum into next year? Thanks.\nEdward Schlesinger: Hey, Steve, let me do the free cash flow one first. So yes, we agree, Q3 was a great free cash flow quarter, very strong. Nice call out on the last time we were at that level. I think if you think about Springboard and the way we've positioned ourselves, we're not adding capacity. So we're not spending capital at a level where you would have seen us potentially do that in the past. And we're converting our income, which is growing into cash. So I don't know that every quarter is going to be at this level of conversion, but I do expect us to continue to generate strong free cash flow as we go forward.\nWendell Weeks: And on the cloud, Steve, as you'll recall, when we looked at the Gen AI driver, what we said is we would expect that to drive a 25% compound annual growth rate through '27 on that Enterprise portion of our optical segment. Obviously, we are growing a lot faster than that at this time and our momentum is very strong. We'll be reflecting more on that. And when we get together at the investor event in quarter one of next year, we'll update with our latest architectural thoughts and our various modeling to see how we feel about that long-term guidance.\nSteven Fox: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Similar to cash flows, gross margins also were very impressive in the quarter, north of 39%. I'm wondering if you can unpack that a little bit in terms of the drivers there. How much of that was mix versus leverage given the strength in optical relative to display. You think that, that would put some mix pressure. But would be helpful to get some context around that and how we should think about that going into fourth quarter. Are we now renormalizing at a higher rate in general for gross margin? Thank you so much.\nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. So I think what's really driving it is operating leverage consistent with how we've been sharing our view on Springboard. We have the cost and the capacity in place, technical capabilities to deliver the higher sales. So as our sales go up, we're experiencing a higher gross margin. 39% plus is a great place. I would say my only caution on thinking about it going forward is that not every quarter is necessarily going to be up, but we do think we can go higher from where we are at these levels.\nWendell Weeks: And all I would add to that, Wamsi, is this we do expect to see a return profile to continue to improve and that's how we hit our operating margin target of 20% by the end of 2026.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Hemlock received a CHIPS Act award during the quarter here. How are you thinking of it was all in the semiconductor side I think. So how are you thinking about semiconductor versus solar in terms of the outlook for Hemlock?\nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. Thanks, John. So, yes, we did receive a CHIPS grant award and we are looking at what it would take to build out additional semiconductor capacity. I think it's a great opportunity for us to do that. We will figure out sort of the timing. I don't think you should think about it as necessarily having an impact in the Springboard window of time here that we've been talking about through 2026. We've sort of factored in the cost and capacity that we need to support the sales in that window of time. But it's certainly an upside opportunity to that as we go forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAsiya Merchant: Hi. Thank you. Two, if I may. Just on Display, you've put in some pricing actions here. Just if you could help us understand how your customers are responding to that and expectations for further price increases in calendar '25. And if I may just on OpEx. I know you talked a little bit about elevated levels here, variable compensation. How should we think about these OpEx levels to moderate in the fourth quarter? I think the assumption implies or the guide implies some moderation here. Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: We remain confident that our customers will experience a double-digit price increase in the second half of this year. Our goal, as we have shared, is for us to deliver consistent profitability in Display, a 25% net income margin next year and generate net income of between $900 million and $950 million. As time goes forward, we continue to be quite confident in being able to deliver that.\nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. And, Asiya, on OpEx, I think the only thing that I would note other than what I shared is that when we book our accrual in the third quarter, we did have a catch-up for the first nine months of the year. So as our performance has accelerated and we've increased our accrual, we've done that in a catch-up. We don't have to book that catch-up in the fourth quarter, but I would expect our OpEx to be temporarily elevated as well in the fourth quarter.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe kind of expanding upon on the gross margins. In the past, you guys have talked about 40% being a bogey, but then also said that 39% just given some of the price increases is kind of a more appropriate new bogey. I know you guys have talked more in terms of operating margin targets and kind of this 20% operating margin target. But just how do you think about kind of gross margin leverage into the next year? Maybe as a first question.\nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. So I would say 39% is a great place. We're happy. We delivered that in the third quarter. But I think there's opportunity for us to go up from that level. I just would be cautious that it may not be up every single quarter as we go forward. And I think as Wendell pointed out, the 20% operating margin target as we exit the Springboard plan is where we have high confidence, which implies we can do better on gross margin.\nMeta Marshall: Got it. And then at the event earlier this quarter, you guys had mentioned a lot of key milestones that may be coming on the Hemlock business or just how to think about incrementals on the project Springboard. I noted that you guys got the CHIPS Act funding kind of earlier this week. But just anything else or any updates that we should be thinking of in terms of timing there or kind of TBD?\nWendell Weeks: We continue to make progress on hitting the milestones we need to, to launch a new solar map for us and that will add significantly -- to a significant part of our Springboard plan especially the non-risk adjusted portion of it. We would expect to be able to provide you with a relatively detailed explanation of the various pieces. And we would expect to have the major milestones in place by the around the timing of our IR event, our investor event in the first quarter next year.\nAnn Nicholson: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Martin Yang from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nMartin Yang: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. One question on CapEx. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes and what led to the slight reduction in CapEx guidance for the year?\nEdward Schlesinger: I would say we're not necessarily adding much capacity. We have some small capital projects that we're finishing up. I don't think there was anything specific to note in the guidance reduction, mostly just where we're running. So we wanted to make sure people understood that. And we continue to believe we have the capacity in place to support at least the $3 billion in sales. If that changes or we have any other plans, we'll certainly share that.\nMartin Yang: Thanks, Ed.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And I show next question comes from the line of Josh Spector from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJames Cannon: Hey, guys. This is James Cannon on for Josh. I just wanted to say congrats as you guys are still tracking well ahead of that $3 billion plan. But I just wanted to ask on kind of going along with the CapEx thing. At what point in terms of sales growth would you need to start ramping CapEx back up like if you guys continue on this trajectory, should we be assuming that you'll have to start ramping up sooner than kind of 2026?\nWendell Weeks: So to deliver the Springboard plan, we don't anticipate a significant sort of increase in our capital investments. If, of course, the $8 billion begins to look more and more probable, that could generate some more investment on our part in terms of capacity. What you see in our capital today is much more aimed at continued productivity improvement as well as reconfiguring some of our factories to produce some of our new Gen AI product set. So it's cost a lot less for us to tailor our equipment and to upgrade than it does to put in place significant new plant and equipment. So unless we start really moving towards that $8 billion non-risk adjusted revenue run rate, but I would say we have an appropriate amount of property, plant and equipment in place and that our capital plans will continue to be relatively modest.\nJames Cannon: Got it. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Notter from Jefferies LLC. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I just wanted to ask about the display price increases. I think as you guys were hedging the business at 107 on the yen, those hedges were in place through the end of this year. Yet you're able to institute price increases here in Q3. I thought that was quite impressive. Could you give us a sense for how that conversation went with customers, what kind of leverage you have in the relationship? Anything you can tell us about your ability to institute price increases even ahead of the hedges running off? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Our price increase is aimed at maintaining a stable US dollar net income. And that's exactly what we're doing, and that's what you see with the -- our customers experiencing a double-digit price increase in the back half of this year. And what that is meant to do is that price increase will offset the weaker yen in our hedges for 2025 and 2026 delivering after that move a stable display net income percent of around 25% and the $900 million to $950 million expectation we have for the net income. Remember, all we're doing here so is more appropriately sharing the benefits that our customers get from buying at that yen rate. So of course any time you increase prices with customers, it is always challenging. But we've been able to do it successfully and that's what you see in our guide.\nGeorge Notter: Got it. And then any sense for where the new hedge rate will wind up as we roll into next year? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Yes. But we will plan to share that as we turn the year. We just want to make sure everything is in place and all of our commercial agreements before we are too forthcoming on where our hedges are at.\nGeorge Notter: Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And I share our last question in the queue, comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Two-parter, if I could, on optical. First, it looks like obviously a good recovery going on here. On the carrier side, still meaningfully below the levels we saw a few years ago. Could you talk about that piece with these new agreements, do you think, gets you back to those 2021-2022 levels for the carrier piece over the next year or two? And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit about the op margin despite being a little overall base than what we saw in those peak years. Margins are pretty comparable. So is this all mix and does that mean if we move higher from here, that we could see above historic margins for that optical business going forward as the business scales further from here? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Okay. Tim, let me start with carrier. I think it's too early. First, your observation is correct. We are seeing carriers still at a relative cyclical level as we have talked about before. I think it's still a little too early for us to be able to confidently call the turn. But you are quite right in observing that all of these customer announcements show carriers leaning into, we have to increase deployments, and they're establishing with their lead technology partner, who is us, the necessary capacity reservations to facilitate those builds. So you're right. It's very encouraging. But we just don't have enough evidence yet, Tim, to reach a conclusion on that spring is activated. And we'll keep you posted as we go forward.\nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. And Tim on your margin question I just want to clarify. You're specifically talking about optical?\nTim Long: Yes, just in the optical business, correct.\nEdward Schlesinger: So I think the thing to think about is it ties a little bit with what you asked in terms of your first question, right? So our sales are starting to get back close to the peak level, but we haven't yet filled all of our capacity, right? We have capacity in place to support a higher level. So I actually think we can improve our margins in optical as we fill that capacity and grow from here, which we expect to do. So I do think our margins accrete up in optical.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Dilem, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Before we close, I wanted to let you know that we are going to attend the UBS Global Technology Conference on December 3rd and we'll be scheduling management visits to investor offices in select cities. Finally, a web replay of today's call will be available on our site starting later this morning. Once again thank you all for joining us. Dilem, that concludes our call, please disconnect all lines.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Edward Schlesinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. As you just heard, we had an outstanding quarter. Year-over-year, Q3 sales grew 8% to $3.73 billion, and EPS grew 20%, more than twice the rate of sales to $0.54 with operating margin expanding 160 basis points to 18.3%. We also generated free cash flow of $553 million. Our outperformance was led by Optical Communications. Sales grew 36% year-over-year and sales in the Enterprise business grew 55%, driven by continued strong adoption of our new optical connectivity products for Generative AI. We expect our momentum to continue. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate year-over-year sales growth to accelerate and EPS to again grow faster than sales, with sales up about 15% to approximately $3.75 billion and EPS up approximately 40% in the range of $0.53 to $0.57. Today, I'll provide more detail on our Q3 results and Q4 outlook as well as put them into the context of our overall Springboard plan. As a reminder, a key component of our plan is to deliver powerful incrementals. We have the capacity and technical capabilities in place to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales by the end of 2026 with minimal cash investment and the cost and capital are already reflected in our financials. This means that we expect to grow profit significantly faster than sales, and that's exactly what we're seeing in our third quarter results. So let's dive in. In Optical Communications, Sales for the third quarter were $1.2 billion, up 36% year-over-year and net income for the quarter was $175 million, up 92% year-over-year as we delivered strong incremental profit on the higher volume. In our Enterprise business, sales were up 55% year-over-year driven by continued strong adoption of AI-related connectivity solutions. This marks another record quarter in this business and adds to our confidence in our plan to grow Enterprise at a 25% compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2027. We also grew year-over-year in our carrier business in the third quarter. We're encouraged by new customer agreements, including our recent announcements with AT&T and Lumen. Overall, we expect both cyclical and secular drivers in Optical Communications to sustain growth in 2025 and beyond. Moving to Display Technologies. Third quarter sales were $1 billion, consistent with the second quarter. Net income was $285 million, up 10% sequentially. Our third quarter volume was down sequentially as panel makers began to lower their utilization rates in the quarter. We expect panel makers to continue managing their operations to maintain healthy inventory levels. As a result, we expect the glass market and our volume to decline sequentially in the fourth quarter. Longer term, we expect the display glass market to grow at a low single-digit rate, supported by stable TV unit sales and average screen size growing about one inch per year. As we shared with you at our September investor event, we are raising glass prices to ensure we can maintain stable US dollar net income. Specifically, we implemented currency-based price increases in Q3. Overall, our customers are experiencing a double-digit price increase in the second half of 2024. In total, our price increases offset the weaker yen in our hedges, and therefore, we expect to maintain the same profitability. As a result, when we move to our new yen core rate in 2025, we do not plan to recast our 2024 financials. As a reminder, we have the majority of our yen exposure hedged for 2025 and 2026 and we also have hedges in place beyond 2026. Our hedges are not at the 2024 core rate of 107, but they're much better than the current spot rate. We expect to deliver net income of $900 million to $950 million next year and net income margin of 25%, consistent with the last five years. Turning to Specialty Materials. Sales in the third quarter were $548 million, up 9% sequentially, primarily driven by premium glass for mobile devices. Net income was $72 million, up 14% sequentially, reflecting higher volume. In Environmental Technologies, third quarter sales were $382 million, down 11% sequentially reflecting the continued impact of the Class 8 truck down cycle in North America, as anticipated. Net income of $75 million was down sequentially, reflecting lower volume. We expect the heavy-duty market weakness to continue and sales and environmental to remain muted in the fourth quarter. In Life Sciences, sales in the quarter were $244 million, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was $15 million, up 15% year-over-year. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. Sales in the third quarter were $298 million, consistent sequentially. Finally, I'd like to touch on operating expenses. As we've told you in the past, our pay is tied directly to our financial performance. As our performance has accelerated this year, we have increased our variable compensation accruals accordingly. This leads to temporarily higher operating expenses in the back half of 2024. With that, I'd like to shift gears and put our third quarter results and Q4 guidance in context of Springboard and update you on how we are tracking against the plan. This chart shows both our non-risk adjusted $5 billion sales plan and our $3 billion high confidence sales plan. So how are we doing? Let me first explain the $1.84 billion dot point you see on the chart. Our Q3 2024 sales were $3.73 billion. Our Q4 2023 sales, which is our Springboard starting point were $3.27 billion. So our sales were $460 million higher in Q3 2024 than in Q4 of 2023. And when you annualize that, you get to $1.84 billion. Therefore, we're currently tracking at a $1.84 billion incremental annual sales run rate against our $3 billion plus target. And that trend continues into quarter four. The additional sequential growth implied in our Q4 guidance increases our run rate in the fourth quarter to $1.9 billion. As we shared in September, our Springboard plan includes an operating margin target of 20% by the end of 2026. This target leads to an improving return profile with profitability growing significantly faster than sales. You can see this in our third quarter results, where EPS grew 20% year-over-year, more than twice as fast as the sales growth rate. Additionally, our operating margin was 18.3%. This represents a 200 basis point improvement from our starting point of 16.3% in Q4 2023. Stepping back, we've made great progress against our sales and operating margin targets to date. But please remember, we're only three quarters into a 12-quarter plan. Springboard is a milestone-based plan evolving through 2026. And finally, we expect to generate significant cash flow over the Springboard time frame because we already have the capacity and technical capabilities in place to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales by the end of 2026. For the year, we've reduced our capital expenditures to approximately $1.1 billion. So let me spend a minute on capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same. We prioritize investing for organic growth opportunities. We believe this creates the most value for our shareholders over the long-term. We also seek to maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet. And we're in great shape here. We have one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is about 23 years with only $1 billion in debt coming due over the next five years and we have no significant debt coming due in any given year. Finally, we expect to continue our strong track record of returning excess cash to shareholders. And because of our growing confidence in Springboard, we started to buy back shares in the second quarter and we continue to do so in the third quarter. So as I wrap up today, I'd like to reiterate that we had an outstanding third quarter. We're tracking ahead of our Springboard plan. We expect continued strong performance in Q4 with year-over-year sales growth accelerating and EPS again growing faster than sales and we expect to sustain our momentum in 2025 and beyond. We look forward to updating you as we continue to make progress. With that, I'll turn it back to Ann. Yes. Hey, Matt, it's Ed. Thanks for the question. So first, on Lumen. No impact in the third quarter and I would say minimal to no impact in the fourth quarter expected. We see that as a 2025, 2026 opportunity. And with respect to our guide, as we always do, we factor in a number of potential outcomes across all of our different segments. I think the one thing that's maybe a little noteworthy about the fourth quarter guide is typically, we're not seasonally up Q4 versus Q3. We're typically flat to slightly down. So we're seeing a lot of positive momentum in general, in particular, in Optical Communications. But in general, I think that's what's driving us to guide ourselves a little bit above normal seasonality. Hey, Steve, let me do the free cash flow one first. So yes, we agree, Q3 was a great free cash flow quarter, very strong. Nice call out on the last time we were at that level. I think if you think about Springboard and the way we've positioned ourselves, we're not adding capacity. So we're not spending capital at a level where you would have seen us potentially do that in the past. And we're converting our income, which is growing into cash. So I don't know that every quarter is going to be at this level of conversion, but I do expect us to continue to generate strong free cash flow as we go forward. Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. So I think what's really driving it is operating leverage consistent with how we've been sharing our view on Springboard. We have the cost and the capacity in place, technical capabilities to deliver the higher sales. So as our sales go up, we're experiencing a higher gross margin. 39% plus is a great place. I would say my only caution on thinking about it going forward is that not every quarter is necessarily going to be up, but we do think we can go higher from where we are at these levels. Yes. Thanks, John. So, yes, we did receive a CHIPS grant award and we are looking at what it would take to build out additional semiconductor capacity. I think it's a great opportunity for us to do that. We will figure out sort of the timing. I don't think you should think about it as necessarily having an impact in the Springboard window of time here that we've been talking about through 2026. We've sort of factored in the cost and capacity that we need to support the sales in that window of time. But it's certainly an upside opportunity to that as we go forward. Yes. And, Asiya, on OpEx, I think the only thing that I would note other than what I shared is that when we book our accrual in the third quarter, we did have a catch-up for the first nine months of the year. So as our performance has accelerated and we've increased our accrual, we've done that in a catch-up. We don't have to book that catch-up in the fourth quarter, but I would expect our OpEx to be temporarily elevated as well in the fourth quarter. Yes. So I would say 39% is a great place. We're happy. We delivered that in the third quarter. But I think there's opportunity for us to go up from that level. I just would be cautious that it may not be up every single quarter as we go forward. And I think as Wendell pointed out, the 20% operating margin target as we exit the Springboard plan is where we have high confidence, which implies we can do better on gross margin. I would say we're not necessarily adding much capacity. We have some small capital projects that we're finishing up. I don't think there was anything specific to note in the guidance reduction, mostly just where we're running. So we wanted to make sure people understood that. And we continue to believe we have the capacity in place to support at least the $3 billion in sales. If that changes or we have any other plans, we'll certainly share that. Yes. And Tim on your margin question I just want to clarify. You're specifically talking about optical? So I think the thing to think about is it ties a little bit with what you asked in terms of your first question, right? So our sales are starting to get back close to the peak level, but we haven't yet filled all of our capacity, right? We have capacity in place to support a higher level. So I actually think we can improve our margins in optical as we fill that capacity and grow from here, which we expect to do. So I do think our margins accrete up in optical."

            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced strong third quarter 2024 results. Year-over-year, sales grew 8% to $3.73 billion, and EPS grew 20% to $0.54. Our quarter three outperformance was led by Optical Communications, where continued strong adoption of our new optical connectivity products for generative AI drove 55% year-over-year growth in the Enterprise portion of the segment. Our momentum continues as we close out the year. In the fourth quarter, we expect year-over-year sales growth to accelerate and EPS to continue growing faster than sales. And Ed will elaborate more on that in a moment. Overall, our results and outlook show we're making strong progress on our Springboard plan to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales with powerful incremental profit and cash flow and to achieve an operating margin of 20% by the end of 2026. So before Ed and I get into the details, let me just briefly recap the primary elements of Springboard. First, this chart reflects our internal non-risk adjusted Springboard plan. This is what our business operators are focused on delivering. There's a lot to take away from this slide. We have a significant sales opportunity. We're looking at potential growth of $8 billion in annualized sales run rate by the end of 2028 with $5 billion by the end of 2026. Now remember, this is our internal plan. When we say it's not risk adjusted, what we mean is the projections are based on a number of assumptions including markets recovering to historical trend lines with continued growth thereafter, successful adoption of new innovations across a number of markets and platforms and successful execution of all our operational milestones for productivity and for price. But what we wanted to do was take our $8 billion opportunity and translate it into a high confidence plan for our shareholders. To do that, first, we focused on a three-year time period. Second, we probabilistically adjusted for different potential outcomes in each of our market access platforms including market dynamics, timing of secular trends, successful adoption of our innovations, as well as volume, pricing and market share across all our businesses as well as the potential that some of our markets may go through down cycles. And this is how we come to the high confidence Springboard plan, to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales and achieved operating margin of 20% by the end of 2026. It's also important to know that we purposely drew this as a wedge. We weren't trying to guide every quarter for the next 12 quarters. It obviously will not be a straight line, but we're also not dealing with a hockey stick. When we built the plan, we expected to see strong growth this year. And that's exactly what you're seeing in our results. So I'd like to take a moment to share two important observations about our performance. First, we're significantly improving our return profile. In the third quarter, we again drove sales growth while demonstrating our ability to deliver the powerful incrementals embedded in Springboard. In the third quarter, sales grew 8% year-over-year. EPS grew more than twice as fast as sales. Operating margin expanded 160 basis points year-over-year to 18.3% and gross margin expanded 220 basis points to 39.2%. We also generated strong free cash flow of $553 million and we continued buying back shares in the third quarter. Second, we're reaching key strategic milestones that underscore the significant progress we've made against our high confidence plan. Let me just briefly summarize the recent milestones in Display and in Optical. In Display, our Springboard plan is centered on maintaining stable US dollar net income. To achieve this, we are raising glass prices. Our price actions, in combination with the hedges we have in place through 2026 will deliver consistent profitability in the segment. We expect to deliver net income of $900 million to $950 million next year and to deliver net income margin of 25%, consistent with the last five years. Simply put, our price increases offset the weaker yen in our hedges and we expect to maintain the same profitability. Most importantly, we will continue to be the low-cost technology and market leader in Display. Overall, we're providing a strong base in Display for our Springboard growth. In Optical Communications, our Springboard plan is about revenue growth as cyclical and secular trends converge to drive demand for our unique capabilities. When we introduced our Gen AI products in June, we said we expected to grow our Enterprise business at a 25% compound annual growth rate over the next four years. Looking back to the second quarter, strong demand for our new Gen AI products drove outperformance and our Enterprise business grew by 42% year-over-year. As I noted, our performance continues. Enterprise grew by 55% in the third quarter versus last year. That growth reflects the Gen AI opportunity inside the data center. We've also introduced a set of innovations to help our customers build a new network to interconnect AI-enabled data centers. As part of an agreement with Lumen Technologies, which reserves 10% of our global fiber capacity for each of the next two years. We recently launched the first outside plant deployment of Corning's new Gen AI fiber and cable system that enables Lumen to fit anywhere from two to four times the amount of fiber into their existing conduit. This is an exciting new space and we expect to capture other large opportunities. Optical is also marking important developments with other important carrier customers, Verizon and AT&T. At the Broadband Strategy Event last week, Verizon highlighted their partnership with Corning and said we're delivering technologies to make it easier for them to reach their deployment goals. They plan to significantly expand their fiber footprint from 25 million fiber passings to more than 30 million fiber passings by 2028. We also just announced a multiyear purchase agreement with AT&T to provide next-generation fiber, cable and connectivity solutions to support the expansion of AT&T's fiber network and help bring high-speed Internet to more Americans. The agreement valued at more than $1 billion builds on a decades-long collaboration between our companies. AT&T is expanding its network to bring world-class fiber to more people and places across the country. By using Corning's newest preconnectorized solutions, AT&T can accelerate its network expansion and enhance network performance while minimizing deployment cost. They'll leverage our latest additions to our portfolio of connectivity solutions, which are fully compliant with the Build America Buy America provisions of the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment program. The program known as BEAD is part of the government's efforts to bring high-speed Internet to rural communities. Stepping back. As you can see, we're three quarters into our three-year Springboard plan and we're making significant progress. Our third quarter results demonstrate the sales growth and the powerful incremental profit and cash flow we expect to deliver as we improve our return profile and march steadily toward our 20% operating margin target by the end of 2026. And we're marking significant milestones along our Springboard journey. And we have plenty of milestones ahead. In Optical Communications, we expect carriers to return to buying at deployment rates and for their deployment rates to increase and drive growth in 2025. And we expect the BEAD program to gather momentum starting in the second half of 2025. We have a triple-digit automotive glass business today and we expect sales in that business to almost triple by 2026. We expect recently announced US EPA regulations to force gas particulate filter adoption and drive hundreds of millions of dollars of growth for us in the US alone with sales starting in 2026. Finally, we plan to launch a new solar market access platform. Overall, we positioned our businesses to benefit from a convergence of cyclical and secular trends to drive growth across the company through 2026 and beyond. We'll continue to update you as we hit significant milestones. Now let me turn it over to Ed for some more detail and perspective on the quarter as well as Springboard. And Samik, a question for you on clarification. When you say fiber utilization, you mean? Totally understand. Thank you, Samik. I would divide this really into two major sections. The first, let's address the AT&T announcement. That's really our carrier segment and it's part of the cyclical upward trend that we identified as part of our Springboard plan and we're viewing this to be very much in line with Springboard and an encouraging sign for us that we can expect the carrier spring to activate sometime here in the near future. We're not calling that yet because we'd like to see a couple more quarters of the actual order rate and the actual deployment rates. But it's certainly encouraging. And this is what we mean by one of the cyclical trends in our Springboard plan for Optical. So encouraging, but we're not yet calling the spring activated. To your next question, one of the things you've seen with a lot of the announcements sort of has to do with Gen AI and interconnecting Gen AI-enabled data centers. Of that, we are seeing really a different link has to get activated and therefore using your terminology of fiber utilization on those links between Gen AI data centers are relatively full. And that's what you saw with the Lumen announcement. We'll have to see how Gen AI develops and how they end up splitting the very large clusters, but that could develop into a very significant growth driver for us going forward, Samik. And on the cloud, Steve, as you'll recall, when we looked at the Gen AI driver, what we said is we would expect that to drive a 25% compound annual growth rate through '27 on that Enterprise portion of our optical segment. Obviously, we are growing a lot faster than that at this time and our momentum is very strong. We'll be reflecting more on that. And when we get together at the investor event in quarter one of next year, we'll update with our latest architectural thoughts and our various modeling to see how we feel about that long-term guidance. And all I would add to that, Wamsi, is this we do expect to see a return profile to continue to improve and that's how we hit our operating margin target of 20% by the end of 2026. We remain confident that our customers will experience a double-digit price increase in the second half of this year. Our goal, as we have shared, is for us to deliver consistent profitability in Display, a 25% net income margin next year and generate net income of between $900 million and $950 million. As time goes forward, we continue to be quite confident in being able to deliver that. We continue to make progress on hitting the milestones we need to, to launch a new solar map for us and that will add significantly -- to a significant part of our Springboard plan especially the non-risk adjusted portion of it. We would expect to be able to provide you with a relatively detailed explanation of the various pieces. And we would expect to have the major milestones in place by the around the timing of our IR event, our investor event in the first quarter next year. So to deliver the Springboard plan, we don't anticipate a significant sort of increase in our capital investments. If, of course, the $8 billion begins to look more and more probable, that could generate some more investment on our part in terms of capacity. What you see in our capital today is much more aimed at continued productivity improvement as well as reconfiguring some of our factories to produce some of our new Gen AI product set. So it's cost a lot less for us to tailor our equipment and to upgrade than it does to put in place significant new plant and equipment. So unless we start really moving towards that $8 billion non-risk adjusted revenue run rate, but I would say we have an appropriate amount of property, plant and equipment in place and that our capital plans will continue to be relatively modest. Our price increase is aimed at maintaining a stable US dollar net income. And that's exactly what we're doing, and that's what you see with the -- our customers experiencing a double-digit price increase in the back half of this year. And what that is meant to do is that price increase will offset the weaker yen in our hedges for 2025 and 2026 delivering after that move a stable display net income percent of around 25% and the $900 million to $950 million expectation we have for the net income. Remember, all we're doing here so is more appropriately sharing the benefits that our customers get from buying at that yen rate. So of course any time you increase prices with customers, it is always challenging. But we've been able to do it successfully and that's what you see in our guide. Yes. But we will plan to share that as we turn the year. We just want to make sure everything is in place and all of our commercial agreements before we are too forthcoming on where our hedges are at. Okay. Tim, let me start with carrier. I think it's too early. First, your observation is correct. We are seeing carriers still at a relative cyclical level as we have talked about before. I think it's still a little too early for us to be able to confidently call the turn. But you are quite right in observing that all of these customer announcements show carriers leaning into, we have to increase deployments, and they're establishing with their lead technology partner, who is us, the necessary capacity reservations to facilitate those builds. So you're right. It's very encouraging. But we just don't have enough evidence yet, Tim, to reach a conclusion on that spring is activated. And we'll keep you posted as we go forward."

[Operator Instructions] It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning's second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the second quarter, the difference between GAAP and core EPS, primarily reflected constant currency adjustments, translated earnings contract gains and translation gains on Japanese yen-denominated debt as well as restructuring and primarily non-cash asset write-off charges. As a reminder, GAAP mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. We are also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced strong second quarter 2024 results. We returned to year-over-year growth, and we exceeded the sales and EPS guidance we shared going into the quarter in April. The outperformance was driven primarily by the strong adoption of our new optical connectivity products for generative AI. So why don't we start today with a quick explanation of why this application provides a great growth opportunity for our shareholders. Our traditional data centers contain a network of interconnected switches and CPUs. GenAI requires a second network within data centers to connect every GPU to every other GPU in the cluster, creating a neural network. Now because GPUs have more processing capacity than CPUs, they need higher bandwidth links connecting them. The result is about 10 times the number of fiber connections in this new network versus a traditional data center. Now this not only provides volume, which is great, but also the opportunity to innovate with the major players in this space. So, over the past four years, we've helped key customers design the optical links needed for this second network in their next-generation AI data centers. We invented new to the world, fibers, cables, connectors and custom integrated solutions. These new products dramatically reduce installation time and on-site labor, save space and lower embodied carbon. All while reducing installed cost and increasing the overall reliability of the network. As I noted, strong adoption of these Gen AI products primarily drove our outperformance in the second quarter. In fact, it drove record sales in the enterprise portion of our optical business. which grew more than 40% year-over-year. I've been talking about the Gen AI opportunity inside the data center. Gen AI also increases bandwidth requirements between data centers. We've reached an agreement with Lumen Technologies that reserves 10% of our global fiber capacity for each of the next two years to facilitate Lumen's build of a new network to interconnect AI-enabled data centers This will be the first outside plant deployment of Corning's new Gen AI fiber and cable system that will enable Lumen to fit anywhere from two to four times the amount of fiber into their existing conduit. Now, Gen AI is just one of the many growth opportunities we've included in the plan we call Springboard, which adds more than $3 billion in annualized sales with strong incremental profit and cash flow within the next three years. We've been sharing some of the key points on Springboard for the last few quarters. But today, I want to outline our plan in a more comprehensive way. We've built a tremendous opportunity for our shareholders, and we want to help you understand how we think about Springboard. Let's start with the core components. First, we previously shared with you that the first quarter would be the low quarter for the year and as our results show, we began our march up. Sales grew 11% sequentially to $3.6 billion in the second quarter, and we returned to year-over-year growth. And the third quarter guidance we provided in our release this morning shows that we expect to continue growing in the third quarter with sales of approximately $3.7 billion. Second, we expect to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales within the next three years as cyclical factors and secular trends converge and drive demand for our capabilities. Our market positions are strong, and we're seeing encouraging signs of markets improve. And we continue to innovate new product sets tied to secular trends to drive growth above market levels. Third, as we capture this growth, we expect to deliver powerful incremental profit and cash flow. We have the required capacity and technical capabilities in place to service that $3 billion in the three-year window, and the cost and capital are already reflected in our financials. Our second quarter results and third quarter guidance serve as a strong proof point of our powerful incrementals. We grew EPS 24% sequentially, more than double our sales growth rate. And as you can see in our guidance, we expect EPS to grow about three times faster than sales in the third quarter. Gross margin improved sequentially and year-over-year by 110 and 170 basis points, respectively. Operating margin expanded 190 basis points versus quarter one. We also generated strong free cash flow and with the success of Springboard, we expect to be able to accelerate the return of cash to shareholders. In fact, due our growing confidence in the plan, we began buying back shares in the second quarter and will do so in the third quarter. So I'd just walk through the core components of Springboard. Now I want to provide more context on our sales opportunity because this is an extraordinary time for the company. I've had a chance to talk with many of you recently, and you've probably heard me say, material science is really slow until it gets wicked fast. You hit these moments of inflection. For example, I just noted, our new product suite for GenAI. To do all that, we had a dedicated team that I've been part of for the last four years, capitalizing on our deep insight and customer relationships to develop these products long before they become a seemingly overnight success. Some strategies take even longer to come to fruition. Meaningful innovation takes time. And then you hit these critical milestones and everything starts happening in quick succession. We are one of these moments. Over the next several quarters, we expect to share a number of customer announcements. You'll see more commercialized innovations and a steady march up in our quarterly performance. So I want to give you a structure to help you put those coming milestones into the context of our total Springboard plan as they happen. I'm going to use this chart to explain our incremental sales opportunity. We introduced Springboard in quarter three last year using our quarter four projected sales of $3.25 billion as the starting point, which put us at a $13 billion annualized run rate. The Y-axis represents incremental sales above our quarter four 2023 run rate. And the X-axis simply represents time for the following five years. Now let's fill in some numbers. Here is our internal non-risk adjusted plan. Now there is a lot to take away from this slide. The first is we have a significant sales opportunity. We're looking at potential growth of $8 billion in annualized sales run rate by the end of 2028, with $5 billion by the end of 2026. We expect growth across all our market access platforms, driven by a combination of upward cyclical and secular trends, and we'll provide insight behind the springs or drivers of that growth. Now this is our internal plan. When we say it's not risk adjusted, what mean is that the projections are based on a number of assumptions, including markets recovering back to historical trend lines with continued growth thereafter, successful adoption of new innovations across a number of markets and platforms and successful execution of all our operational milestones for productivity and for price. That said, we've taken this opportunity and translated it into a high confidence plan to help inform investors. To do that first, we focused on the next three years. Second, we probabilistically adjusted for different potential outcomes in each of our market access platforms, including market dynamics, timing of secular trends, successful adoption of our innovations as well as volume, pricing and market share across all our businesses and the potential that some of our markets may go through down cycles. And this is how we come to the high confidence Springboard plan for our shareholders to help inform their investment decisions. It's also important to note that we purposely drew this as a wedge. We weren't trying to guide every quarter for the next 12 quarters. It obviously, won't be a straight line. But we are also not dealing with a hockey stick, when we built the plan we expected to see strong growth this year. So how are we doing so far? We are off to a terrific time. Let me explain the $1.3 billion dot point you see on the chart here. Our quarter two 2024 sales were $3.6 billion. Our quarter four 2023 sales were $3.27 billion, the difference is $330 million. And when you annualize that, you get to $1.3 billion. And that trend continues into quarter three. The additional sequential growth increases our run rate in the third quarter by $1.7 billion. As you can see, we are running well ahead of our Springboard plan run rate. That being said, please remember, we're only two quarters into a 12-quarter plan. Springboard is a milestone-based plan evolving over the next three years. We have plenty of opportunity ahead of us, a lot of springs yet to activate. We'll update you as we hit significant milestones. Clearly, we're off to a very strong start, well above the run rates we need to deliver. So as I wrap up this morning, I think you can see why we're energized about Springboard. And we're pleased with our early progress, including, of course, the encouraging response to our Gen AI Products. We expect to have a lot more news over the next few months as milestones start to hit and we're scheduling around those. We're planning another investor event in September as well as a full Investor Day in early 2025. Also, it is important to note that as we proceed forward with Springboard, we'll continue to seek the guidance of our Board of Directors. To that end, we will be refreshing our Board composition to more closely align the skill set profiles of the Board with our Springboard plan. Now, let me turn it over to Ed for some more detail and perspective on the quarter and on Springboard.\nEd Schlesinger: Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start. We believe our second quarter results are a strong proof point of both the sales and the incremental profit and cash flow opportunity in our Springboard plan. So before I dive into the results, I'd like to share some of the major growth drivers we see across our market access platforms. Wendell shared with you our internal non-risk-adjusted plan, which is $8 billion in incremental sales by the end of 2028 and $5 billion by the end of 2026. I'm going to share some of the cyclical and secular drivers of this growth, while focusing in on the three-year window. Let's start with Optical Communications. The Gen AI opportunity, Wendell spoke about, adds a significant amount of growth. We expect our enterprise business to grow at a 25% compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2027, driven by the adoption of our connectivity solutions for generative AI. And this is already underway. We delivered record sales in enterprise in the second quarter, which grew more than 40% year-over-year. In our carrier business, customers are reaching the end of their inventory drawdowns and beginning to order closer to their current deployment levels. Additionally, government efforts bring high-speed Internet to rural communities through the broadband equity access and deployment program will contribute to growth beginning in 2025 and add significant sales over the next several years. In display, we're not counting on TV unit growth. Instead, we expect to capitalize on the trend of larger screens with about an inch of screen size growth per year to add low to mid-single-digit volume growth. Additionally, as we've previously explained, we're currently undertaking currency-based price adjustments to maintain appropriate returns in our display business. In automotive, we have a triple-digit automotive glass business today, and we expect sales in that business to almost triple by 2026. Recently announced US EPA regulations will require the adoption of GPFs in US, starting with model year 2027. This adoption offers hundreds of millions of dollars of growth for us in the US alone. Even in the face of BEV adoption, we expect sales to start in 2026. And finally, we expect to build an entirely new map, as we leverage the Inflation Reduction Act to support the build-out of a US solar supply chain. These are just some of the growth drivers in our $5 billion opportunity. As Wendell shared, we probabilistically adjusted this opportunity to the $3 billion high confidence Springboard plan we've been sharing with you since the third quarter of 2023. We expect to have strong incremental profit and cash flow as we capture the growth, and we're starting from a strong operating base. Our productivity ratios are at best demonstrated levels and we've raised price to more appropriately share inflation with our customers. Our improvement in gross margin is a great proof point. In the second quarter of 2024, gross margin was 37.9%, up 430 basis points from 33.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022 on the same level of sales. With that, let me share some highlights from our second quarter results. Sales grew 11% sequentially reaching $3.6 billion in the quarter, returning us to year-over-year growth. The outperformance versus our April guidance of $3.4 billion was primarily driven by the strong adoption of our new optical connectivity products for Gen AI. EPS grew 24% sequentially, more than twice as fast as sales, coming in at $0.47, also above our April guidance range. Gross margin improved sequentially and year-over-year by 110 and 170 basis points, respectively. Operating margin expanded 190 basis points versus the first quarter, and we generated strong free cash flow of $353 million. Next, let me turn to our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales for the second quarter were $1.1 billion, up 20% sequentially, reflecting a return to growth for the segment. Year-over-year, sales increased 4%. Enterprise network sales were up 42% driven by AI-related connectivity solutions. Carrier sales were actually down 10%, as customers continue to draw down their inventory. Encouragingly though, carrier network sales grew sequentially as customers began to order closer to their current deployment levels. We delivered strong incremental profit in Optical, with net income for the quarter at $143 million, up 43% sequentially on the 20% sales growth. Moving to display technologies. Second quarter sales were $1 billion, up 16% sequentially as panel makers ran at higher utilization rates in the second quarter to support mid-year promotions. Glass price was consistent with the first quarter. Net income was $258 million, up 28% sequentially. Year-over-year, sales were up 9% and net income was up 24%, driven by higher volume and price. Now let me spend a minute on our approach to display price going forward. As we've said before, we plan to make currency-based price adjustments to maintain appropriate returns in our display business. We're in the midst of doing just that and we will update you on our progress at an appropriate time. With respect to the yen, we have hedges in place for 2025 and beyond. They're not at the 2024 core rate of 107, but they're much better than the current spot rate. We expect the combination of our currency-based price adjustments and our hedges to deliver an appropriate level of profitability for the display business. For your modeling purposes, you can think about appropriate profitability as being the average of the last five years of net income margin from our segment reports. Turning to Specialty Materials. Sales in the second quarter were $501 million, up 18% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand for premium glasses for mobile devices and semiconductor-related products. Net income was $63 million, up 91% year-over-year, reflecting volume and manufacturing. In Environmental Technologies, second quarter sales were $431 million, down 6% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the Class 8 truck down cycle in North America as anticipated. Net income was $97 million, down 9% year-over-year on decreased volume. We expect the heavy-duty market weakness to continue in the second half of this year and sales and environmental to be down sequentially in the third quarter. In Life Sciences, sales in the second quarter were $249 million, up 8% year-over-year. Net income was $17 million, up 55% year-over-year. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses. Sales in the quarter were $296 million, down 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower pricing for solar-grade polysilicon. Now let me turn to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect sales to grow to approximately $3.7 billion, driven primarily by our optical communications business including the continued adoption of our new optical connectivity solutions for Gen AI products, which we expect will more than offset the expected slowdown in the US Class 8 truck market. We expect EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.54, with EPS growing three times the rate of sales. As we previously shared, our sales are running well ahead of Springboard plan. And our incrementals are strong, in fact, if you compare our projected Q3 sales and EPS guide to Q4 2023, which is our Springboard base, sales are up approximately 13% and EPS is up approximately 33%. Additionally, in Q3, we anticipate another quarter of strong free cash flow. As it relates to cash, our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We prioritize investing for organic growth opportunities, we believe this creates the most value for our shareholders over the long term. As we've shared today, in the mid-term, we have the technical capabilities and capacity in place to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales with minimal cash investment. And you can see that reflected in our CapEx expectations for 2024 of $1.2 billion. We also seek to maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet. We're in great shape. We have one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is about 23 years with about only $1 billion in debt coming due over the next five years and we have no significant debt coming due in any given year. And finally, we expect to continue our strong track record of returning excess cash to shareholders. Since 2013, we bought back half of our outstanding shares for almost 800 million shares. This generated about $15 billion of value for our shareholders. Because of our growing confidence in Springboard, we started to buy back shares in the second quarter, and we expect to continue share buybacks in the third quarter. In summary, we're off to a great start on our Springboard plan. We're well on track to deliver on our $3 billion plus sales opportunity. Our second quarter results and our third quarter guidance our strong proof points of the incremental profit and cash flow we expect to deliver as we capture the sales growth. I look forward to sharing more in the coming months as we make progress on our Springboard plan and continue create value for shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Ann.\nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, Ed. Okay. We're ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Asiya Merchant from Citi. Your line is open.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity and congratulations on the strong results. On the optical side, if I may, especially on the Gen AI, if you could maybe double-click a little bit on this -- the customers who are demanding the Gen AI products that you've talked about and the visibility that you have over the next couple of quarters and even as you look into your Springboard plan, over the next 12 quarters, what kind of visibility do you have in sustaining this momentum that you have outlined? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Our visibility for strong growth is relatively high. And that is because what we do is we take the wiring diagram for some of these brand-new data centers that are getting put in place and we're building that that customized system they'll use to connect. So we've been working on most of these products versus the core components for the last few years directly with those customers from what they'll need then we start to actually put it all together to be drop ship at exactly the right day for them. So in a way, we're already beginning to build some of their network needs well ahead of when they will install them. So we have pretty good visibility on that. So far, what's driving the out performance is that the word of mouth on our product has been very positive. And other folks who we haven't been consistently working with over this time period have come to us to help them solve some of the challenges. And so as a result, we're picking up new customers for us into this new ecosystem that is building around putting together these back in network. So far, what we're seeing is most of our variance has been upside variance if that helps you at all.\nAsiya Merchant: Yes, that's great. And so it's the competitive moat that maybe Corning has an optical on the enterprise side, much greater in your, as you think about the opportunity ahead versus let's say, a couple of quarters ago or even with your prior solution? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: So the competitive moats that we're trying to build here is driven around us doing a new-to-the-world fiber cable and connectivity system. And we're really the only person in the world who can put that all together. And strength of that moat will reflect directly on these new super high-density systems that we're putting in place, where you should think about it almost like Moore's Law, where we\u2019re doubling the amount of light guides within the same volume area, geometric volume area. And while increasing the performance of the componentry. There's very few people who can do this and the way we're doing it to increase the optical performance is protected intellectual properties. So we believe our competitive advantages will increase in this segment.\nAsiya Merchant: Okay. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Wendell, in the slide deck, you mentioned the $8 billion Springboard opportunity by 2026. Roughly half of that is from optical. I'm just wondering if you can give us a bit more color on how to sort of split that opportunity between carrier and enterprise and then maybe if you can talk about the magnitude of what this Lumen agreement means in terms of revenue, how to think about the opportunity specifically to Lumen in terms of revenue over the next couple of years? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Well, to your first question, it is both in carrier and enterprise. But the majority is coming out of the enterprise piece as you see the fundamental change in compute-driven by Gen AI and its related networking requirements. And we can come back to that if you want. Lumen, let's just start with sizing, when we say 10% of our global fiber capacity, I think the way you can think about it, it's -- you won't be far off as you size it. If you just take your sort of expected view of what our total revenue will be in Opto and you take 10% of it, and that's going to get you in the zone Samik, right? What makes the Lumen transaction so exciting for us is that we've always had a significant business connecting data centers to each other in the network at large. Because that's how data gets in and out of the cloud, right? The technical question has been with the advent of a new GPU-based back-end network for Gen AI within data centers will there be a dramatic increase in the need for fiber to connect these Gen AI-enabled data centers to each other and the network. The answer is going to depend on where is the power located and how that interacts with the architecture of the large language model and how and where both inference and training are accomplished. It's exciting about the Lumen deal is that it is certainly a strong proof point in favor of a bull case for that segment of the network. Does that make sense to you, Samik, if I've been responsive your question.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes. And I guess if I just sneak one more part, what do you think about the scope of similar agreements with other carriers as well in terms of just the -- solidifying the springboard opportunity with them? Thank you. And I'll drop, pass it on.\nWendell Weeks: I don't want to speculate at this time, right? What is great about what Lumen has done is they're going to be the first customer to apply our new tech sort of double the amount of fiber they can place in their existing conduit. And that is super exciting. I would believe that, that is so exciting that it will generate lots of interest.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Hey, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors LLC. Your line is open.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just one more question on optical for me also. Can you just -- Wendell, you guys mentioned the 25% CAGR for the enterprise business over the next few years. There's a lot of concern, I think, that while there's optimism for this type of growth rate that it could be more diversity in nature, have some puts and takes as you go through the quarters. How do we get comfortable with the idea that you have enough customer diversity, project diversity that this is sort of a steady type of growth prospect for Gen AI over the next few years? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: It's a great question, Steve. And the way that we have addressed that since this is far from our first rodeo, right, is if you think about it, when we put together that $5 billion springboard plan, right, that is us believing what it is we truly think will happen. Then when we start to probabilistically adjust drop that 5 down to that 3 were after things exactly like you're talking about, where you can get whenever you're chasing a new tech, you can get these pieces where you'll have a bunch of project builds, and then it will slow while as that gets consumed. And then again -- and that's how we sought to address that as you start to think through your modeling. Does that make sense to you, Steve?\nSteven Fox: Yeah, it does. Maybe just to push that a little bit further, like do you see that happening over the next few quarters? Or are we so early stages that there's a consistent route to the growth around GenAI? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: Yes. For the next few quarters, like you just saw us do is Edwin, I think he was together with a number of you guided for enterprise to grow at a 25% rate. And then the first quarter, we show up post providing that guidance, we grew at 40. Right now, in the near-term, our visibility is pretty high, and we feel really comfortable about the 25% guidance that Ed has given you.\nSteven Fox: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Martin Yang from OpCo. Your line is open.\nMartin Yang: Hi. Tanks for taking the question. Just a quick confirmation on the 3Q guidance. Is it right to assume there's no price increase assumed or display in 3Q?\nEd Schlesinger: Yeah, Martin, so thanks for that question. In general, as we always do with our guidance, we have a number of potential outcomes that drive where we guide you to. And we provided a range on EPS and approximately $3.7 billion in our mind also has a range encapsulated around that well. So we're not specifically guiding anything in display price at this time, because we're in the midst of speaking with our customers about a currency based price adjustment, but that doesn't mean there won't be an impact in Q3.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you, Ed.\nAnn Nicholson: Great. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Ruplu Bhattacharya [Bank of America Securities]. Your line is open.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm filling in for Wamsi today. Ed, you saw strong growth both sequentially and year-on-year in gross margins this quarter. How should we think about gross margin trend over the next few quarters? And what are the drivers for margin growth? And I have a follow-up.\nEd Schlesinger: Yeah. Thanks. Great question. I think in general, the drivers for us on gross margin are we have the capacity and the technical capabilities in place to support a higher level of sales. So in general, we're not having to add fixed costs as our sales go up. So that is really what's going to drive both gross margin and operating margin for us as we go forward. And I do think there is room for our gross margin to continue go up as sales go up, I think our guide implies that for Q3.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Thanks for that. And if I can ask a follow-up on the display segment, what is your expectation for panel maker utilization rates in calendar 3Q and as you're implementing these currency based price adjustments, do you see any impact of that on your glass market share? And Ed, when should we expect the reset of the core yen rate? Thank you.\nEd Schlesinger: Yes. So, I'll take those, sort of, one at a time. So, I think on utilization, when we spoke about Q2, we expected it to increase significantly from Q1. It did that. It actually was even better than our expectations. They ran a little hot. I think as we think about Q3, they're likely to run at that level or a little lower to sort of average out for the year. We think they're running more or less in line to meet expected retail demand. And with respect to the core rate, right now, we have hedges in place for 2025 and beyond. We're in the middle of a currency-based price adjustment with our customers. We're going to come back when all that's complete and we'll share our thoughts on how all that will work. But I think the most important thing is that when you think about our profitability going forward, our goal is to get the combination of the price adjustments and our hedges to get a net income margin or net income percent of sales that averages out at about the last five years. And Ruplu, I apologize if you had -- did I miss any of your components of your question?\nWendell Weeks: I think just share and our intention would be to hold our share as a result of our overall approach to this industry and our currency-based upward price adjustment.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thank you for all the details. Appreciate it.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. This is for the team. And I want to go back to Optical and trying to better understand the profitability of this business. I understand the secular growth and AI and everything that it brings. But when I think about profitability, net income margin is more than -- and less than half of what it is for Display. So, how should I think about the revenue growth that will be sufficient to meet dollars of net income comparable to Display, assuming that the Display is just going go sideways from here? Hopefully, that's clear.\nEd Schlesinger: Yes. Thanks Mehdi. So, I think stepping back, if you think about our sales growing 11% and EPS growing 21% in the second quarter and then our guide implying a sales growth rate in the low single-digits and EPS growing 3 times faster than that, I think we can continue to have EPS growth outpacing sales regardless of where that growth comes from, primarily because we have the cost, the technical capabilities, the capacity in place to support the growth. I also think that the margins are quite attractive in the Optical business and especially in the data center space and AI data center space, where we expect to see growth.\nMehdi Hosseini: Let me be kind of more concise and clear. Would you be able to significantly outperform Optical margin net income in the past, it has averaged by 13%. So looking forward, could it significantly be above 13%.\nEd Schlesinger: I think it can be above 13%.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is open.\nJames Cannon: Hey, guys. This is James Cannon on for Josh. Congrats on the strong quarter of enterprise sales. I was just wondering if you could frame you called out a 10% decline in on the carrier side of that business? If you could just frame how that compares to what you did last quarter and maybe kind of what you're seeing in terms of the trajectory for the third quarter?\nEd Schlesinger: Yeah. So our carrier business is increasing sequentially. I think that's the good news. So although we're still down year-over-year because last year, you still had carriers sort of building inventory and now they're still in the process of drawing down their inventory, that's really causing that year-over-year decline. But the good news is order rates are going up, sales were up sequentially, and I think we would expect that trend to continue.\nWendell Weeks: What we're seeing is that our carrier order rates are now starting to approach what we see as their deployment rates. And so that's also encouraging. So we have sort of that upward spring still in front of us when you begin to think of your year-over-year growth rates James.\nJames Cannon: Okay. Got it. And then just as a follow-up, kind of another way to ask the last question, I think. But as enterprise becomes a bigger piece of the optical portfolio. Can you just frame how the -- how those two pieces of the business compare margin-wise?\nWendell Weeks: Enterprise.\nJames Cannon: Versus carrier.\nWendell Weeks: Yeah. Enterprise tends to be higher margin than carrier, primarily because it uses more of those customized connectivity systems. And so that is, as you move up the stack, in the degree of sophistication that we offer to our customers as that helps them reduce their installation cost, we end up sharing a portion of that value we create with those total passive optical systems that we do those. We'll have a higher degree of adoption in enterprise as a share of revenue than they do in carrier as a share of the total revenue.\nJames Cannon: Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Great. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. I appreciate commentary on Carrier that you guys are getting towards a better inventory position or that orders are getting more aligned with deployments. But just any latest update in terms of -- of when you expect carriers to kind be through their inventory or orders to be aligning with deployments? And then maybe a second question, just in terms of the price increases on the display side or those negotiations? Is that something you expect to kind of have completed by Q3? And just as we think about that going forward, as you're going through those negotiations, is there any hope of kind of moving that to more USD-based pricing? Or just, do you expect that to be more dynamic with currency going forward? Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: So as we complete those currency-based pricing negotiations, we will update you. One of the reasons you see us scheduling an investor session in September, would be to update you on our progress on those dialogues with our customers in this point. So I think you should be expecting us to provide you an update at that date. As for moving to US dollar base, we're engaged with our customers as part of this whole dialogue. That exact question as we seek to find the right way, to share appropriately the relative value of the currency moves relative. Of course, the debate is our customers would lag an exchange rate closer to our current spot rate, and we would like one closer to the past 30-year average. And this is what God created negotiations for and we're in the midst of working our way through all that. And we look forward to having a more detailed discussion with you when we get together in September.\nEd Schlesinger: Yes. Meta, on carrier, I think it's customer-by-customer the inventory situations are different. We're not quite there yet on people being completely at their -- buying at their deployment rates. I think we'll make progress on that as we go into the third quarter. We'll keep you updated, but I don't know that will necessarily be through all of it.\nWendell Weeks: In total, I think, as you think about both questions together, carriers since it's so as Ed points out, it depends on particular carrier strategies. We should wait for them to talk more fully about it. But we'll update on where we are versus deployment rate. And we do expect that to close to continue to close relatively quickly. And for display, what our aim is, is that is to make this just be really simple for investors, and we're just going to end up delivering the profitability that you're used to out of display. Sort of no matter where the currency is coming out because we're going to price appropriately to reward our shareholders for the investment and risk that they have put in place to develop this terrific business.\nMeta Marshall: Okay. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tim Long from Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long: Thank you. I was hoping I could get a two-parter on optical. First part, for this current Gen AI business you're talking about. Just curious, I think a lot of the hyperscalers have -- there's some different types of architectures they're using AOC, EOC, so some electrical, some optical. What you're selling now in this portfolio, is that across any single hyperscaler deployment? Or would it fit better into certain architectures? And then number two, if you could just touch on the other more traditional enterprise like entrancing type market? When do you expect that to develop? And what type of uptick in optical component or fiber content would you expect to see when we get that more traditional enterprise deployments? Thank you.\nWendell Weeks: To take your questions in order. To the first part, the revenue that you see us reporting today is basically the fiber optic connections between the switches. Okay. Doesn't work exactly like this, but the way people talk about sort of top of the rack switches that then connect to other switch layers, which enable us to connect every GPU to every other GPU. There is work as you are reflecting on what will happen then within the server racks whether those will end up becoming optical connections as well. Historically, they have been copper. And then once the bit rate distance rises above sort of 100 gigabit per meter second, you end up going to optical. So as distance climbs, fickle tends to become the technology that is dominant use of the tech. That same dynamic because of density and complexity is now starting to work its way. We're beginning that long-term material science is slower work, right, on what happens within the server rack. And that tends to get at the architecture as you're speaking about more fully. To the part two of your question is what happens with influence, there's a bunch of different opinions on how inference architectures will work. It tends to be largely driven by what that particular players market position is and different arguments around data gravity, right? So I would say it's too early for us to have a point of view on which architectures will become the predominant ones, for inference, Tim. As our understanding evolves and we developed a more converged view of how that evolves, we'll be happy to share with you. Does that address your questions, Tim?\nTim Long: Yes. That's great. Thank you.\nAnn Nicholson: Great. I think we can take one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question will come from George Notter from Jefferies LLC. Your line is open.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks a lot for squeezing me in. I guess I wanted to just go back to the question of your competitive differentiation in the optical business. I guess for starters, I'm just curious about how much of this Gen AI solution is customized from Corning. Curious about how many customers you're doing customization work for? And then also, I know there are other suppliers making smaller diameter fiber cables. I know there's a bunch of work folks are doing on connectors, higher-density racks. I guess I'm just hoping to drill down into what's precisely unique to Corning versus some of those other guys. Thanks.\nWendell Weeks: Great. So as you know, George, what we do is we participate in all the levels of that value stream. And we will take our new to the world fiber and provide it to other cables. We'll also design proprietary cables that incorporate our fiber to compete at that level and then we, of course, do our connectors to US connect, we will provide those to other players and take our competitive advantages at the component level. But at the same time, we'll then put them together in unique ways at the total system level. So we deliberately provide to other players because that is best for our overall customers are different componentry for them to put together in their own novel waves. Now what makes our fiber so unique is when most people just shrink the diameter of the fiber, actually the optical performance decreases. The spot size gets smaller, the bend resistance drops. The attenuation can get a little bit less. What makes our inventions so cool is that we ended up reducing the diameter of the fiber, while improving versus standard fiber, all of the optical performance, because we redesigned the actual profile and the way we make the fiber in a proprietary way, and we managed to deliver all of this without any significant increase in our cost when competitors try to do something at the fiber level, they end up having to increase their cost to meet that that performance. So is the core of our advantage of fiber. And then we just start multiplying it with our expertise at each level. As far as what share of our revenue going forward will be more customized versus at the componentry level. Our desire would be to have of the majority of our revenues be driven by delivery of those customized solutions and the value that we add there on reduced installation time. At the same time, we're in the business of delighting our customers. And if what they would like us to do is to provide some of the component building blocks at the appropriate price, of course, to our competitors, we will be happy to do that.\nGeorge Notter: Great. Thank you very much.\nAnn Nicholson: Thank you, George, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Before we close, I wanted to let you know that we're going to attend two conferences in the third quarter; JPMorgan Hardware and Semi Management Access Forum on August 14th and Citi's 2024, Global TMT Conference on September 5th. We also plan to host a visit to our facilities in September. Finally, we'll be scheduling management visits to investor offices in select pay. There will be replay of today's call on our website starting later this morning. So once again, thanks for joining us. Operator, that concludes our call. Please disconnect all lines.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Ed Schlesinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start. We believe our second quarter results are a strong proof point of both the sales and the incremental profit and cash flow opportunity in our Springboard plan. So before I dive into the results, I'd like to share some of the major growth drivers we see across our market access platforms. Wendell shared with you our internal non-risk-adjusted plan, which is $8 billion in incremental sales by the end of 2028 and $5 billion by the end of 2026. I'm going to share some of the cyclical and secular drivers of this growth, while focusing in on the three-year window. Let's start with Optical Communications. The Gen AI opportunity, Wendell spoke about, adds a significant amount of growth. We expect our enterprise business to grow at a 25% compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2027, driven by the adoption of our connectivity solutions for generative AI. And this is already underway. We delivered record sales in enterprise in the second quarter, which grew more than 40% year-over-year. In our carrier business, customers are reaching the end of their inventory drawdowns and beginning to order closer to their current deployment levels. Additionally, government efforts bring high-speed Internet to rural communities through the broadband equity access and deployment program will contribute to growth beginning in 2025 and add significant sales over the next several years. In display, we're not counting on TV unit growth. Instead, we expect to capitalize on the trend of larger screens with about an inch of screen size growth per year to add low to mid-single-digit volume growth. Additionally, as we've previously explained, we're currently undertaking currency-based price adjustments to maintain appropriate returns in our display business. In automotive, we have a triple-digit automotive glass business today, and we expect sales in that business to almost triple by 2026. Recently announced US EPA regulations will require the adoption of GPFs in US, starting with model year 2027. This adoption offers hundreds of millions of dollars of growth for us in the US alone. Even in the face of BEV adoption, we expect sales to start in 2026. And finally, we expect to build an entirely new map, as we leverage the Inflation Reduction Act to support the build-out of a US solar supply chain. These are just some of the growth drivers in our $5 billion opportunity. As Wendell shared, we probabilistically adjusted this opportunity to the $3 billion high confidence Springboard plan we've been sharing with you since the third quarter of 2023. We expect to have strong incremental profit and cash flow as we capture the growth, and we're starting from a strong operating base. Our productivity ratios are at best demonstrated levels and we've raised price to more appropriately share inflation with our customers. Our improvement in gross margin is a great proof point. In the second quarter of 2024, gross margin was 37.9%, up 430 basis points from 33.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022 on the same level of sales. With that, let me share some highlights from our second quarter results. Sales grew 11% sequentially reaching $3.6 billion in the quarter, returning us to year-over-year growth. The outperformance versus our April guidance of $3.4 billion was primarily driven by the strong adoption of our new optical connectivity products for Gen AI. EPS grew 24% sequentially, more than twice as fast as sales, coming in at $0.47, also above our April guidance range. Gross margin improved sequentially and year-over-year by 110 and 170 basis points, respectively. Operating margin expanded 190 basis points versus the first quarter, and we generated strong free cash flow of $353 million. Next, let me turn to our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales for the second quarter were $1.1 billion, up 20% sequentially, reflecting a return to growth for the segment. Year-over-year, sales increased 4%. Enterprise network sales were up 42% driven by AI-related connectivity solutions. Carrier sales were actually down 10%, as customers continue to draw down their inventory. Encouragingly though, carrier network sales grew sequentially as customers began to order closer to their current deployment levels. We delivered strong incremental profit in Optical, with net income for the quarter at $143 million, up 43% sequentially on the 20% sales growth. Moving to display technologies. Second quarter sales were $1 billion, up 16% sequentially as panel makers ran at higher utilization rates in the second quarter to support mid-year promotions. Glass price was consistent with the first quarter. Net income was $258 million, up 28% sequentially. Year-over-year, sales were up 9% and net income was up 24%, driven by higher volume and price. Now let me spend a minute on our approach to display price going forward. As we've said before, we plan to make currency-based price adjustments to maintain appropriate returns in our display business. We're in the midst of doing just that and we will update you on our progress at an appropriate time. With respect to the yen, we have hedges in place for 2025 and beyond. They're not at the 2024 core rate of 107, but they're much better than the current spot rate. We expect the combination of our currency-based price adjustments and our hedges to deliver an appropriate level of profitability for the display business. For your modeling purposes, you can think about appropriate profitability as being the average of the last five years of net income margin from our segment reports. Turning to Specialty Materials. Sales in the second quarter were $501 million, up 18% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand for premium glasses for mobile devices and semiconductor-related products. Net income was $63 million, up 91% year-over-year, reflecting volume and manufacturing. In Environmental Technologies, second quarter sales were $431 million, down 6% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the Class 8 truck down cycle in North America as anticipated. Net income was $97 million, down 9% year-over-year on decreased volume. We expect the heavy-duty market weakness to continue in the second half of this year and sales and environmental to be down sequentially in the third quarter. In Life Sciences, sales in the second quarter were $249 million, up 8% year-over-year. Net income was $17 million, up 55% year-over-year. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses. Sales in the quarter were $296 million, down 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower pricing for solar-grade polysilicon. Now let me turn to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect sales to grow to approximately $3.7 billion, driven primarily by our optical communications business including the continued adoption of our new optical connectivity solutions for Gen AI products, which we expect will more than offset the expected slowdown in the US Class 8 truck market. We expect EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.54, with EPS growing three times the rate of sales. As we previously shared, our sales are running well ahead of Springboard plan. And our incrementals are strong, in fact, if you compare our projected Q3 sales and EPS guide to Q4 2023, which is our Springboard base, sales are up approximately 13% and EPS is up approximately 33%. Additionally, in Q3, we anticipate another quarter of strong free cash flow. As it relates to cash, our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We prioritize investing for organic growth opportunities, we believe this creates the most value for our shareholders over the long term. As we've shared today, in the mid-term, we have the technical capabilities and capacity in place to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales with minimal cash investment. And you can see that reflected in our CapEx expectations for 2024 of $1.2 billion. We also seek to maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet. We're in great shape. We have one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is about 23 years with about only $1 billion in debt coming due over the next five years and we have no significant debt coming due in any given year. And finally, we expect to continue our strong track record of returning excess cash to shareholders. Since 2013, we bought back half of our outstanding shares for almost 800 million shares. This generated about $15 billion of value for our shareholders. Because of our growing confidence in Springboard, we started to buy back shares in the second quarter, and we expect to continue share buybacks in the third quarter. In summary, we're off to a great start on our Springboard plan. We're well on track to deliver on our $3 billion plus sales opportunity. Our second quarter results and our third quarter guidance our strong proof points of the incremental profit and cash flow we expect to deliver as we capture the sales growth. I look forward to sharing more in the coming months as we make progress on our Springboard plan and continue create value for shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Ann. Yeah, Martin, so thanks for that question. In general, as we always do with our guidance, we have a number of potential outcomes that drive where we guide you to. And we provided a range on EPS and approximately $3.7 billion in our mind also has a range encapsulated around that well. So we're not specifically guiding anything in display price at this time, because we're in the midst of speaking with our customers about a currency based price adjustment, but that doesn't mean there won't be an impact in Q3. Yeah. Thanks. Great question. I think in general, the drivers for us on gross margin are we have the capacity and the technical capabilities in place to support a higher level of sales. So in general, we're not having to add fixed costs as our sales go up. So that is really what's going to drive both gross margin and operating margin for us as we go forward. And I do think there is room for our gross margin to continue go up as sales go up, I think our guide implies that for Q3. Yes. So, I'll take those, sort of, one at a time. So, I think on utilization, when we spoke about Q2, we expected it to increase significantly from Q1. It did that. It actually was even better than our expectations. They ran a little hot. I think as we think about Q3, they're likely to run at that level or a little lower to sort of average out for the year. We think they're running more or less in line to meet expected retail demand. And with respect to the core rate, right now, we have hedges in place for 2025 and beyond. We're in the middle of a currency-based price adjustment with our customers. We're going to come back when all that's complete and we'll share our thoughts on how all that will work. But I think the most important thing is that when you think about our profitability going forward, our goal is to get the combination of the price adjustments and our hedges to get a net income margin or net income percent of sales that averages out at about the last five years. And Ruplu, I apologize if you had -- did I miss any of your components of your question? Yes. Thanks Mehdi. So, I think stepping back, if you think about our sales growing 11% and EPS growing 21% in the second quarter and then our guide implying a sales growth rate in the low single-digits and EPS growing 3 times faster than that, I think we can continue to have EPS growth outpacing sales regardless of where that growth comes from, primarily because we have the cost, the technical capabilities, the capacity in place to support the growth. I also think that the margins are quite attractive in the Optical business and especially in the data center space and AI data center space, where we expect to see growth. I think it can be above 13%. Yeah. So our carrier business is increasing sequentially. I think that's the good news. So although we're still down year-over-year because last year, you still had carriers sort of building inventory and now they're still in the process of drawing down their inventory, that's really causing that year-over-year decline. But the good news is order rates are going up, sales were up sequentially, and I think we would expect that trend to continue. Yes. Meta, on carrier, I think it's customer-by-customer the inventory situations are different. We're not quite there yet on people being completely at their -- buying at their deployment rates. I think we'll make progress on that as we go into the third quarter. We'll keep you updated, but I don't know that will necessarily be through all of it."

            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced strong second quarter 2024 results. We returned to year-over-year growth, and we exceeded the sales and EPS guidance we shared going into the quarter in April. The outperformance was driven primarily by the strong adoption of our new optical connectivity products for generative AI. So why don't we start today with a quick explanation of why this application provides a great growth opportunity for our shareholders. Our traditional data centers contain a network of interconnected switches and CPUs. GenAI requires a second network within data centers to connect every GPU to every other GPU in the cluster, creating a neural network. Now because GPUs have more processing capacity than CPUs, they need higher bandwidth links connecting them. The result is about 10 times the number of fiber connections in this new network versus a traditional data center. Now this not only provides volume, which is great, but also the opportunity to innovate with the major players in this space. So, over the past four years, we've helped key customers design the optical links needed for this second network in their next-generation AI data centers. We invented new to the world, fibers, cables, connectors and custom integrated solutions. These new products dramatically reduce installation time and on-site labor, save space and lower embodied carbon. All while reducing installed cost and increasing the overall reliability of the network. As I noted, strong adoption of these Gen AI products primarily drove our outperformance in the second quarter. In fact, it drove record sales in the enterprise portion of our optical business. which grew more than 40% year-over-year. I've been talking about the Gen AI opportunity inside the data center. Gen AI also increases bandwidth requirements between data centers. We've reached an agreement with Lumen Technologies that reserves 10% of our global fiber capacity for each of the next two years to facilitate Lumen's build of a new network to interconnect AI-enabled data centers This will be the first outside plant deployment of Corning's new Gen AI fiber and cable system that will enable Lumen to fit anywhere from two to four times the amount of fiber into their existing conduit. Now, Gen AI is just one of the many growth opportunities we've included in the plan we call Springboard, which adds more than $3 billion in annualized sales with strong incremental profit and cash flow within the next three years. We've been sharing some of the key points on Springboard for the last few quarters. But today, I want to outline our plan in a more comprehensive way. We've built a tremendous opportunity for our shareholders, and we want to help you understand how we think about Springboard. Let's start with the core components. First, we previously shared with you that the first quarter would be the low quarter for the year and as our results show, we began our march up. Sales grew 11% sequentially to $3.6 billion in the second quarter, and we returned to year-over-year growth. And the third quarter guidance we provided in our release this morning shows that we expect to continue growing in the third quarter with sales of approximately $3.7 billion. Second, we expect to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales within the next three years as cyclical factors and secular trends converge and drive demand for our capabilities. Our market positions are strong, and we're seeing encouraging signs of markets improve. And we continue to innovate new product sets tied to secular trends to drive growth above market levels. Third, as we capture this growth, we expect to deliver powerful incremental profit and cash flow. We have the required capacity and technical capabilities in place to service that $3 billion in the three-year window, and the cost and capital are already reflected in our financials. Our second quarter results and third quarter guidance serve as a strong proof point of our powerful incrementals. We grew EPS 24% sequentially, more than double our sales growth rate. And as you can see in our guidance, we expect EPS to grow about three times faster than sales in the third quarter. Gross margin improved sequentially and year-over-year by 110 and 170 basis points, respectively. Operating margin expanded 190 basis points versus quarter one. We also generated strong free cash flow and with the success of Springboard, we expect to be able to accelerate the return of cash to shareholders. In fact, due our growing confidence in the plan, we began buying back shares in the second quarter and will do so in the third quarter. So I'd just walk through the core components of Springboard. Now I want to provide more context on our sales opportunity because this is an extraordinary time for the company. I've had a chance to talk with many of you recently, and you've probably heard me say, material science is really slow until it gets wicked fast. You hit these moments of inflection. For example, I just noted, our new product suite for GenAI. To do all that, we had a dedicated team that I've been part of for the last four years, capitalizing on our deep insight and customer relationships to develop these products long before they become a seemingly overnight success. Some strategies take even longer to come to fruition. Meaningful innovation takes time. And then you hit these critical milestones and everything starts happening in quick succession. We are one of these moments. Over the next several quarters, we expect to share a number of customer announcements. You'll see more commercialized innovations and a steady march up in our quarterly performance. So I want to give you a structure to help you put those coming milestones into the context of our total Springboard plan as they happen. I'm going to use this chart to explain our incremental sales opportunity. We introduced Springboard in quarter three last year using our quarter four projected sales of $3.25 billion as the starting point, which put us at a $13 billion annualized run rate. The Y-axis represents incremental sales above our quarter four 2023 run rate. And the X-axis simply represents time for the following five years. Now let's fill in some numbers. Here is our internal non-risk adjusted plan. Now there is a lot to take away from this slide. The first is we have a significant sales opportunity. We're looking at potential growth of $8 billion in annualized sales run rate by the end of 2028, with $5 billion by the end of 2026. We expect growth across all our market access platforms, driven by a combination of upward cyclical and secular trends, and we'll provide insight behind the springs or drivers of that growth. Now this is our internal plan. When we say it's not risk adjusted, what mean is that the projections are based on a number of assumptions, including markets recovering back to historical trend lines with continued growth thereafter, successful adoption of new innovations across a number of markets and platforms and successful execution of all our operational milestones for productivity and for price. That said, we've taken this opportunity and translated it into a high confidence plan to help inform investors. To do that first, we focused on the next three years. Second, we probabilistically adjusted for different potential outcomes in each of our market access platforms, including market dynamics, timing of secular trends, successful adoption of our innovations as well as volume, pricing and market share across all our businesses and the potential that some of our markets may go through down cycles. And this is how we come to the high confidence Springboard plan for our shareholders to help inform their investment decisions. It's also important to note that we purposely drew this as a wedge. We weren't trying to guide every quarter for the next 12 quarters. It obviously, won't be a straight line. But we are also not dealing with a hockey stick, when we built the plan we expected to see strong growth this year. So how are we doing so far? We are off to a terrific time. Let me explain the $1.3 billion dot point you see on the chart here. Our quarter two 2024 sales were $3.6 billion. Our quarter four 2023 sales were $3.27 billion, the difference is $330 million. And when you annualize that, you get to $1.3 billion. And that trend continues into quarter three. The additional sequential growth increases our run rate in the third quarter by $1.7 billion. As you can see, we are running well ahead of our Springboard plan run rate. That being said, please remember, we're only two quarters into a 12-quarter plan. Springboard is a milestone-based plan evolving over the next three years. We have plenty of opportunity ahead of us, a lot of springs yet to activate. We'll update you as we hit significant milestones. Clearly, we're off to a very strong start, well above the run rates we need to deliver. So as I wrap up this morning, I think you can see why we're energized about Springboard. And we're pleased with our early progress, including, of course, the encouraging response to our Gen AI Products. We expect to have a lot more news over the next few months as milestones start to hit and we're scheduling around those. We're planning another investor event in September as well as a full Investor Day in early 2025. Also, it is important to note that as we proceed forward with Springboard, we'll continue to seek the guidance of our Board of Directors. To that end, we will be refreshing our Board composition to more closely align the skill set profiles of the Board with our Springboard plan. Now, let me turn it over to Ed for some more detail and perspective on the quarter and on Springboard. Our visibility for strong growth is relatively high. And that is because what we do is we take the wiring diagram for some of these brand-new data centers that are getting put in place and we're building that that customized system they'll use to connect. So we've been working on most of these products versus the core components for the last few years directly with those customers from what they'll need then we start to actually put it all together to be drop ship at exactly the right day for them. So in a way, we're already beginning to build some of their network needs well ahead of when they will install them. So we have pretty good visibility on that. So far, what's driving the out performance is that the word of mouth on our product has been very positive. And other folks who we haven't been consistently working with over this time period have come to us to help them solve some of the challenges. And so as a result, we're picking up new customers for us into this new ecosystem that is building around putting together these back in network. So far, what we're seeing is most of our variance has been upside variance if that helps you at all. So the competitive moats that we're trying to build here is driven around us doing a new-to-the-world fiber cable and connectivity system. And we're really the only person in the world who can put that all together. And strength of that moat will reflect directly on these new super high-density systems that we're putting in place, where you should think about it almost like Moore's Law, where we're doubling the amount of light guides within the same volume area, geometric volume area. And while increasing the performance of the componentry. There's very few people who can do this and the way we're doing it to increase the optical performance is protected intellectual properties. So we believe our competitive advantages will increase in this segment. Well, to your first question, it is both in carrier and enterprise. But the majority is coming out of the enterprise piece as you see the fundamental change in compute-driven by Gen AI and its related networking requirements. And we can come back to that if you want. Lumen, let's just start with sizing, when we say 10% of our global fiber capacity, I think the way you can think about it, it's -- you won't be far off as you size it. If you just take your sort of expected view of what our total revenue will be in Opto and you take 10% of it, and that's going to get you in the zone Samik, right? What makes the Lumen transaction so exciting for us is that we've always had a significant business connecting data centers to each other in the network at large. Because that's how data gets in and out of the cloud, right? The technical question has been with the advent of a new GPU-based back-end network for Gen AI within data centers will there be a dramatic increase in the need for fiber to connect these Gen AI-enabled data centers to each other and the network. The answer is going to depend on where is the power located and how that interacts with the architecture of the large language model and how and where both inference and training are accomplished. It's exciting about the Lumen deal is that it is certainly a strong proof point in favor of a bull case for that segment of the network. Does that make sense to you, Samik, if I've been responsive your question. I don't want to speculate at this time, right? What is great about what Lumen has done is they're going to be the first customer to apply our new tech sort of double the amount of fiber they can place in their existing conduit. And that is super exciting. I would believe that, that is so exciting that it will generate lots of interest. It's a great question, Steve. And the way that we have addressed that since this is far from our first rodeo, right, is if you think about it, when we put together that $5 billion springboard plan, right, that is us believing what it is we truly think will happen. Then when we start to probabilistically adjust drop that 5 down to that 3 were after things exactly like you're talking about, where you can get whenever you're chasing a new tech, you can get these pieces where you'll have a bunch of project builds, and then it will slow while as that gets consumed. And then again -- and that's how we sought to address that as you start to think through your modeling. Does that make sense to you, Steve? Yes. For the next few quarters, like you just saw us do is Edwin, I think he was together with a number of you guided for enterprise to grow at a 25% rate. And then the first quarter, we show up post providing that guidance, we grew at 40. Right now, in the near-term, our visibility is pretty high, and we feel really comfortable about the 25% guidance that Ed has given you. I think just share and our intention would be to hold our share as a result of our overall approach to this industry and our currency-based upward price adjustment. What we're seeing is that our carrier order rates are now starting to approach what we see as their deployment rates. And so that's also encouraging. So we have sort of that upward spring still in front of us when you begin to think of your year-over-year growth rates James. Enterprise. Yeah. Enterprise tends to be higher margin than carrier, primarily because it uses more of those customized connectivity systems. And so that is, as you move up the stack, in the degree of sophistication that we offer to our customers as that helps them reduce their installation cost, we end up sharing a portion of that value we create with those total passive optical systems that we do those. We'll have a higher degree of adoption in enterprise as a share of revenue than they do in carrier as a share of the total revenue. So as we complete those currency-based pricing negotiations, we will update you. One of the reasons you see us scheduling an investor session in September, would be to update you on our progress on those dialogues with our customers in this point. So I think you should be expecting us to provide you an update at that date. As for moving to US dollar base, we're engaged with our customers as part of this whole dialogue. That exact question as we seek to find the right way, to share appropriately the relative value of the currency moves relative. Of course, the debate is our customers would lag an exchange rate closer to our current spot rate, and we would like one closer to the past 30-year average. And this is what God created negotiations for and we're in the midst of working our way through all that. And we look forward to having a more detailed discussion with you when we get together in September. In total, I think, as you think about both questions together, carriers since it's so as Ed points out, it depends on particular carrier strategies. We should wait for them to talk more fully about it. But we'll update on where we are versus deployment rate. And we do expect that to close to continue to close relatively quickly. And for display, what our aim is, is that is to make this just be really simple for investors, and we're just going to end up delivering the profitability that you're used to out of display. Sort of no matter where the currency is coming out because we're going to price appropriately to reward our shareholders for the investment and risk that they have put in place to develop this terrific business. To take your questions in order. To the first part, the revenue that you see us reporting today is basically the fiber optic connections between the switches. Okay. Doesn't work exactly like this, but the way people talk about sort of top of the rack switches that then connect to other switch layers, which enable us to connect every GPU to every other GPU. There is work as you are reflecting on what will happen then within the server racks whether those will end up becoming optical connections as well. Historically, they have been copper. And then once the bit rate distance rises above sort of 100 gigabit per meter second, you end up going to optical. So as distance climbs, fickle tends to become the technology that is dominant use of the tech. That same dynamic because of density and complexity is now starting to work its way. We're beginning that long-term material science is slower work, right, on what happens within the server rack. And that tends to get at the architecture as you're speaking about more fully. To the part two of your question is what happens with influence, there's a bunch of different opinions on how inference architectures will work. It tends to be largely driven by what that particular players market position is and different arguments around data gravity, right? So I would say it's too early for us to have a point of view on which architectures will become the predominant ones, for inference, Tim. As our understanding evolves and we developed a more converged view of how that evolves, we'll be happy to share with you. Does that address your questions, Tim? Great. So as you know, George, what we do is we participate in all the levels of that value stream. And we will take our new to the world fiber and provide it to other cables. We'll also design proprietary cables that incorporate our fiber to compete at that level and then we, of course, do our connectors to US connect, we will provide those to other players and take our competitive advantages at the component level. But at the same time, we'll then put them together in unique ways at the total system level. So we deliberately provide to other players because that is best for our overall customers are different componentry for them to put together in their own novel waves. Now what makes our fiber so unique is when most people just shrink the diameter of the fiber, actually the optical performance decreases. The spot size gets smaller, the bend resistance drops. The attenuation can get a little bit less. What makes our inventions so cool is that we ended up reducing the diameter of the fiber, while improving versus standard fiber, all of the optical performance, because we redesigned the actual profile and the way we make the fiber in a proprietary way, and we managed to deliver all of this without any significant increase in our cost when competitors try to do something at the fiber level, they end up having to increase their cost to meet that that performance. So is the core of our advantage of fiber. And then we just start multiplying it with our expertise at each level. As far as what share of our revenue going forward will be more customized versus at the componentry level. Our desire would be to have of the majority of our revenues be driven by delivery of those customized solutions and the value that we add there on reduced installation time. At the same time, we're in the business of delighting our customers. And if what they would like us to do is to provide some of the component building blocks at the appropriate price, of course, to our competitors, we will be happy to do that."

Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along, and they're also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell. \nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. Today, we announced first quarter 2024 results. Sales were nearly $3.3 billion and EPS was $0.38. Year-over-year, gross margin grew 160 basis points to 36.8%, and free cash flow improved by $300 million. These results were at the high end of our guidance. More importantly, but we're seeing encouraging signs of improving market conditions. We continue to expect that the first quarter will be the low quarter for the year.  \n We are executing our plans to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales within the next 3 years. And we already have the required capacity and capabilities in place. As a result, we're poised to deliver powerful incremental profit and cash flow and generate substantial shareholder value. Last quarter, we outlined a framework under which we expect to drive stronger returns on our existing innovation and capacity investments and we shared our expectation that these returns will begin in 2024.  \n The framework has 3 primary components: First, we believe that the first quarter will be the lowest quarter for the year. We will improve from here. Second, we expect to grow by more than $3 billion in annualized sales in the midterm, which we define as within the next 3 years. The outlook in each of our markets remains positive, and our market positions are quite strong. Third, as we capture this growth, we expect to deliver powerful incrementals. We already have the required production capacity and technical capabilities in place, and the cost and the capital are already reflected in our financials. This is a tremendous opportunity for our shareholders.  \n In the 3 months since our last call, our confidence in these 3 components has only increased. We expect our sales to grow from here and we have reflected this in our second quarter guidance. Today, I'd like to review each component of the framework and share some of the reasons why our confidence has grown. Let me begin with the first component. Our expectation that quarter 1 will be the lowest quarter of 2024. Near term, we expect optical and display to be the biggest drivers of our improvement. \n In Optical Communications, carrier inventory drawdowns have been the primary source of our below-trend sales. Once carrier inventory starts returning to more normal levels and our customers resume purchasing to support their deployment rates, we would expect to see our order book grow. And that's exactly what is happening.  \n Our order book grew nicely from fourth quarter levels. This and our regular conversations with large carrier customers indicate that the gap between our sales and customer deployments is moderating. As a result, we expect carrier sales to increase from first quarter levels. Additionally, in the enterprise portion of our optical business, we expected our recent wins for AI data centers will translate into orders and sales during the year. In display, panel makers increased their utilization rates late in the first quarter, and we expect the higher utilization to continue into the second quarter, driven by expected growth in retail demand resulting from midyear promotions.  \n For the full year 2024, our expectations for the retail glass market remain unchanged from our January view and consistent with industry expectations. We anticipate relatively flat television unit volume, another year of television screen size growth, and some recovery in PC demand. This leads to mid-single-digit percent growth in glass volume at retail versus 2023. As a result, we expect our financial performance in display to improve significantly from our first quarter run rate. Ed will share more details on that in just a few moments.  \n Now let's move to the second component of our framework. Our expectation that we will add more than $3 billion in annualized sales within the next 3 years. Our positive outlook for each of our market opportunities, results from our leadership positions and the power of the secular trends that we're addressing through innovation and close collaboration with customers. There's a lot more Corning to be had in our markets.  \n In Optical Communications, fiber is the ascendant technology, and we're the clear market leader. As I've covered in the last 2 calls, fiber shipments are more than 30% below trend. We fully expect that gap to close, adding more than 40% to our overall optical communication sales. In conversations with our large carrier customers during the quarter, they reinforced their commitment to increasing fiber deployments in 2024 and beyond. Additionally, we expect BEAD-related projects for network builds in underserved areas to add to our addressable market for the next several years. The industry expects funding approvals to begin late this year, leading to spending in 2025.  \n Next, generative AI is an especially attractive opportunity for us, it creates significant demand for passive optical connectivity solutions and strengthens our value proposition and our competitive advantages. All data centers consist of a front-end network, connecting racks of CPUs. To meet the computational demands of AI, customers are building a new fiber-rich second network to connect GPUs, which increases our market opportunity.  \n Now we'll see this in our financials as customers begin to build large GPU clusters and adopt our latest high-density innovations. Customers want fast deployment. Our preconnectorized structured cabling solutions offer big installation time advantages. And the GPU clusters, which pack a very large amount of computing power per rack require smaller, tensor cables, making connector size and cable diameter, important requirements. To meet these high-density requirements, we've introduced new-to-the-world fiber cable and connectivity products.  \n At OFC a few weeks ago, we introduced RocketRibbon cable with Flow Ribbon technology that can reduce cable diameter by 60% with fibers per cable approaching 7,000. A key part of delivering this innovation is our Contour optical fiber, which has a 40% smaller cross-sectional area than legacy fibers. Now our ability to integrate innovations across fiber, cable and connectors, to create end-to-end solutions is a unique competitive advantage, and we're accumulating significant customer wins for upcoming AI data center builds. In our recent customer wins, our revenue is low single-digit hundreds of dollars per GPU. \n We believe the customer density needs combined with our technology superior performance will sustain these attractive sales attach rates long term. Let's turn to automotive. The U.S. EPA announced new multi-pollutant standards last month. They include a strong particulate emissions limit that will require gasoline particulate filter adoption on U.S. gasoline vehicles, including hybrids, as early as 2026 for model year 2027. We are the inventor and the clear market leader in GPF and these standards increase our environmental technologies content opportunity by 2 to 3 times per U.S. ICE vehicle. This adoption offers hundreds of millions of dollars of growth for us in the U.S. alone, even in the face of BEV adoption. Keep in mind, we're also pursuing additional more Corning content opportunities in the automotive industry by introducing our automotive glass solutions, which are building success and momentum and are being adopted by both ICE and BEV platforms.  \n In Mobile Consumer Electronics, our goal is to outpace the market by increasing the content we provide for each device. Our sales have consistently outpaced the market over the last decade, and we expect that to continue to be the case going forward. We've done this by advancing the state of the art for cover materials and adding more content per device, a classic more Corning play. We have a strong innovation portfolio in support of our close collaborations with leading OEMs, and we expect to continue delivering new products that increase our value per device.  \n In display, we expect volume growth at retail to be driven mainly by television screen size growth. In fact, in the first quarter, sales of 85-inch TVs increased by more than 50% year-over-year. Overall, we expect to capture growth in display because we are the undisputed technology leader. Our successful development of Gen 10.5 and advanced capabilities aligned with the continued move to larger-sized TVs produced on the lowest cost platforms for large displays.  \n Finally, we continue to build entirely new product platforms to capture opportunities in new categories. Examples include automotive glass solutions to support high autonomy systems, the growing opportunity to localize U.S. solar supply and pharmaceutical packaging. In sum, we expect the power of our market leadership positions and more Corning innovations to allow us to grow faster than our markets in advance our $3 billion plus opportunity.  \n Now I'd like to move to the third component of the framework. Our expectation for powerful incrementals as we add sales. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a set of actions to restore historic productivity ratios and also to raise price to share the impact of inflation more equitably with our customers. Since we initiated these activities, we have expanded our gross margin by 320 basis points despite sales being down almost $400 million.  \n Our actions have established a significantly stronger profitability and cash flow base even while our P&L includes the costs and technical capabilities necessary to support $3 billion plus in additional sales. Importantly, we have put processes and governance mechanisms in place to generate operating leverage as we grow sales. So as I close today, here's what I'd like to leave you with. Our first quarter results show encouraging signs of improving market conditions. We continue to expect this quarter will be the lowest quarter for the year. Additionally, we've established a higher profitability and cash flow base.  \n Finally, as our markets improve, we have the opportunity to increase our annualized sales by more than $3 billion. As we capture that growth, we expect to deliver powerful incrementals because the required capacity, the technical capabilities are already in place and the costs are already in our financials. This represents a terrific opportunity for our shareholders. Our second quarter guidance reflects higher sales and strong incremental profit. And you'll hear more about this from Ed.  \n We will continue making progress on this opportunity in 2024. Think of us as continuing to march up. I look forward to updating you at investor conferences in the next few months. Now before I turn the call over to Ed, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, who will retire from Corning at the end of May.  \n I want to thank Jeff for his 13 years of outstanding leadership at our company. During his tenure, he's helped grow the company, develop frameworks that define our priorities and guide our actions and raised awareness of glass as a key enabling material. He also increased Corning's focus on sustainability. Jeff, we wish you the very best. With that, I'll turn things over to Ed. \nEdward Schlesinger: Thank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter sales were $3.26 billion, and EPS was $0.38, at the high end of our guidance. Our actions to increase price and improve productivity ratios are paying off. In the first quarter, despite lower year-over-year sales, we grew gross margin by 160 basis points. We also grew free cash flow by more than $300 million versus the first quarter of 2023. Overall, we have established a significantly stronger profitability and cash flow base, and we expect to grow from first quarter levels.  \n In the second quarter, we expect sales of approximately $3.4 billion, with strong incremental profit and EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.46. Let's take a closer look at our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales for the first quarter were $930 million, down 17% year-over-year, reflecting temporarily lower carrier demand as customers continued to draw down inventory. Net income for the quarter was $100 million, down 37% year-over-year, reflecting the lower volume.  \n We are seeing clear signs of improving market conditions, and we think Q1 represents an inflection point. Sequentially, sales grew in both carrier and enterprise in the first quarter, which is more favorable than normal seasonality. And our order rates are steadily increasing as some of our carrier customers are reaching the end of their inventory drawdowns. We believe we're well positioned to take advantage of the industry's long-term growth drivers, specifically broadband, 5G, cloud computing and AI. We will also benefit from public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the U.S. population.  \n Moving to Display Technologies. As we shared with you in January, panel makers reduced their utilization levels in the fourth quarter in response to a softer retail selling season. Additionally, as expected, panel makers utilization levels remained low in the first quarter to align supply to demand. Our first quarter sales were $872 million, up 14% year-over-year and net income was $201 million, up 26% year-over-year. The increase in net income was primarily driven by higher volume and pricing actions taken in the second half of 2023.  \n First quarter glass price was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2023 as expected. Now it's worth noting that first quarter net income was negatively impacted by our decision to reduce our production to align to the lower volume we experienced in the fourth and first quarters. Our profitability will be higher in the second quarter. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect panel makers to run at higher utilization rates, driven by growth in retail demand resulting from midyear promotions, and we will return our production volume to more normal levels. We expect the second quarter glass market and our volume to increase sequentially as a result of higher panel maker utilization, and we expect glass price to be consistent with the first quarter.  \n For the full year, our expectations for the retail market remain unchanged from our January view and are consistent with industry expectations. Specifically, we anticipate relatively flat television unit volume, another year of TV screen size growth, and some recovery in PC demand. This adds mid-single-digit percent growth in glass volume at retail versus 2023. Overall, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable.  \n Before I move on, I want to take a minute to address currency exchange rates. As a reminder, we have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect our cash flow, enhance our ability to invest and protect shareholder returns. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. And we've received more than $2.5 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception.  \n Our most significant hedge contracts are for the Japanese yen, which support our yen core rate of 107 through the end of 2024. As we look beyond 2024, our goal is to maintain an appropriate return on our display business through a combination of currency hedges and industrial solutions like price increases. First, on hedging, we are actively working to improve our hedge coverage for 2025 and into the future. The yen forward curve works in our favor. So if you go out a year, the forward rate is about JPY 8 stronger than today's spot rate; out 2 years, it's approximately 14; and so on.  \n The current yen spot rate is significantly weaker than the 30-year average of approximately JPY 110. We have made some progress on our hedges and are now partially hedged for 2025, and we'll continue to look for attractive opportunities to increase our hedges. Second, our customers sell panels in U.S. dollars, and they buy glass from us in yen. They are benefiting from the current weak yen rate. We plan to share the economics more appropriately with our customers by raising glass prices in yen.  \n We successfully took a first step in this direction in the second half of 2023. We will continue to keep you updated as we make progress. Moving to Specialty Materials. Sales in the first quarter were $454 million, up 12% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our premium smartphone cover materials as well as semiconductor-related products. Net income was $44 million, up 13% year-over-year, driven by higher volume. Our more Corning approach will continue to help us win as handheld and IT markets recover.  \n Additionally, over time, we anticipate growth from new innovations such as bendable glass and augmented reality as they are adopted more broadly. Environmental Technologies first quarter sales were $455 million, up 6% year-over-year, driven by increased GPF adoption in China which more than offset a decline in heavy-duty diesel in North America, an impact we expect to continue through 2024. Net income was $105 million, up 28% year-over-year, driven by higher volume and improved operating performance. In Life Sciences, Sales in the first quarter were $236 million, down 8% versus the first quarter of 2023 as customers in North America and Europe continue to draw down their inventory.  \n Net income was $13 million, up 44% year-over-year, reflecting improved productivity. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses. Sales in the first quarter were $311 million, down 19% year-over-year, reflecting lower pricing for solar grade polysilicon and lower sales in pharmaceutical technologies from the completion of volume commitments for COVID-related products.  \n Now let's turn to our outlook. Last quarter, we shared our expectation that the first quarter would be the low quarter of the year, and we're even more confident that, that is the case. In the second quarter, we expect sales to grow sequentially to approximately $3.4 billion with strong incremental profit and EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.46. We also anticipate free cash flow to grow sequentially by approximately $300 million in the second quarter and we expect CapEx of approximately $1.2 billion for the year.  \n Wendell outlined our framework to drive strong returns on our existing innovation and capacity investments and shared our expectations for powerful incremental profit and cash flow. Given this opportunity, we've begun to think about our approach to the allocation of that cash going forward. As a reminder, we prioritize investing for organic growth opportunities.  \n And as we've shared today, in the midterm, we have the capabilities and capacity in place to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales with minimal cash investment. You can see that reflected in our CapEx expectations for 2024. This contributes to the strong free cash flow we expect to generate. Additionally, we maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet, and we're in great shape. We have one of the longest debt centers in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is about 23 years with about only $1 billion in debt coming due over the next 5 years, and we have no significant debt due -- coming due in any given year.  \n So as our cash flow increases, we remain committed to providing returns to our shareholders. We have grown our dividend 40% since 2019 and our dividend yield is top quartile in the S&P 500, and we will continue to be opportunistic on share repurchases. I look forward to sharing more in the coming months as we continue to make progress building a solid foundation for durable, profitable long-term growth. Now I'll turn things back over to Ann. \nAnn Nicholson: Great. Thank you, Ed. We're ready for our first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  \n Our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. \nWamsi Mohan: If I could, one for Wendell, one for Ed. Wendell, on the commentary around the data center opportunity around AI. I was wondering if you could just share some color on when you think these incremental orders and revenue will flow into Corning. And these hundreds of -- low hundreds of dollars per GPU, can you just break that down into maybe just a little bit more color on where exactly that's coming from? Is this rack-to-rack connections in optical and data center? And how large do you think the TAM for that is? And I have a follow-up for Ed please. \nWendell Weeks: So the timing of when we'll start to see it in our financials. So we start with a pretty large business and enterprise, all related to the sort of front-end -- we think about it as a front-end network, which is all connecting the CPUs. So off over that base, you'll start to see sort of a relatively robust revenue growth assuming the orders that we've closed here all ship in the back half of this year. You're just going to start to see that momentum begin to build.  \n Where does it come from? Well, the simplest way to think about this is let's just start at the rack level. A typical front-end rack filled with CPUs has about 32 fibers to sort of come into that top of the rack switch, right, 16 ports, 2 fibers per port. There's different ways to do it. But assuming one of these back-end network, GPU racks will tend to have on the order of a couple of [ 100 ] servers. To service those, you need more like 256 fibers on that same rack. So you've got about an 8x increase in the amount of fibers per rack. So this is what leads to the demand for us to do a more Corning innovation, how do you fit 8 times as many light pipes into fundamentally the same area. And that's why you see all of our new product innovation, what we've been working on the last few years is aimed at that. So as you start to see those large cluster GPU installations begin is when you should start to see it in our numbers, Wamsi. Was that -- did that answer your question? \nWamsi Mohan: Yes, it did. I wonder, Wendell, if you might also comment on the B100, which seems to be a much more higher density solution than the H100 and the need for bandwidth probably -- order of magnitude higher between racks. \nWendell Weeks: So you -- that is a great observation, and it is in line with the sort of secular trend that we see that basically says we have plenty of innovation we have to get done because density continues to increase as well as the bandwidth requirements increase. And so what that does is it reduces the amount of distance with which you can travel in an electron and therefore pushes the photons closer and closer to sort of the beachfront of those GPUs, which is opening up an entire new set of categories for us -- for our flat glass, for our ability to couple light into various formats. And so in a way what you're describing is what's leading to a whole new family of innovations upon which we are working diligently, Wamsi. \nWamsi Mohan: Okay. I appreciate the answer. And maybe quickly for Ed. I appreciate the yen commentary here as we look into 2025, there seem to be a lot of moving pieces for display between yen rate and the pricing you alluded to? How large is the partial hedge or where do you expect to -- as you exit this year, where do you think you will be hedged for 2025?  \n What do you think is the sort of core rate that if we were to shift next year to a different core rate, where would you think that would be using all the tools that you have? And if you could perhaps just roll it up at the high level, including the price changes that you spoke about. How should we think about display at sort of the top line level, given all these different changes? \nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. Thanks for the question, Wamsi, and I understand the desire to have all that information. I think the simplest way to think about it is we are committed to generating return in this business. And we think we will do that in 2024. We did that in 2023. And our goal is to get the economics to be similar as we go forward regardless of where the yen winds up and where we are able to hedge.  \n We'll be -- we're good at hedging. We've got a long-standing program. We will look for attractive opportunities to build our 2025 hedge portfolio. And if the yen breaks our way, we'll go out beyond that. I think it's too early to talk about core rate or that kind of discussion, but I think you should just think about our display economics that we'll deliver in 2024 as being the way to think about our display business. So we'll raise price to offset the impact of the yen and the net of those two things to get you to the same place. That's the way we're thinking about it. We've made some nice progress on hedging, and we'll continue to keep you updated as we go. I think that's the way you all should think about it. \nAnn Nicholson: Operator, we're ready for our next question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. \nMeta Marshall: Great. Maybe a question for me. You noted that you have the capacity kind of today with capital you've already built to have $3 billion of additional revenue. You noted that you expect to kind of grow over the next 3 years by more than that $3 billion. And so just trying to get a sense of where you think that the biggest opportunities or investments will be over the next couple of years?  \n And then maybe a second question. There's been obviously, a lot made of BEAD timing and understanding that you're seeing kind of improving demand trends on service provider as they come out of inventory digestion, but just kind of what your latest thoughts are around kind of BEAD timing as an enhancement to the optical business. \nWendell Weeks: I'll start with the second one and then maybe, Ed, you can discuss the first. So on BEAD timing, we tend to be relatively conservative in our outlook of how effective the government can be in allocating resources to build networks. We're in strong support of this. It requires U.S. content and we think it's aimed well and it will be done. The funds have been allocated. But the process, we would tend to be a little -- our expectations are being a little slower than what you see as the industry overall. We think they'll get allocated this year and you won't really start to see spending until next year. That's our current point of view [indiscernible]. Does that answer your question? \nMeta Marshall: Yes, that's helpful. \nEdward Schlesinger: Yes, Meta, on your other question. So first, I would start with we actually have capacity to do much more than $3 billion in sales. I think we're framing it up as we see it. Where those sales come from, where those opportunities come from will depend on whether we need to add anything beyond what we have in place today, but we feel very confident in supporting a number well above $3 billion.  \n There are certainly a few places where we might spend a little money, but it's all encapsulated in the CapEx guide we gave for 2024, and we ramped our capital spend down in the back half of 2023. So sitting here today, I don't see any need for significant amount of capital. A good example might be as we build out our auto glass business, and we continue to win there. We might need to spend a little bit, but not the kind of capital you're used to when you build like melting capacity for glass, more on the finishing side. So I think we -- our goal is to generate a significant amount of cash flow off of the existing capacity we have in place. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. \nMartin Yang: I would like to ask about your opinion regarding newly announced subsidy programs for home appliance trading in China. I know your retail estimates on PV sales this year hasn't changed. Do you think this could be a new catalyst to drive upside to retail TV market and your glass volume in '24? \nWendell Weeks: That's a great question. They're relatively recent, and we're still in the midst of trying to understand how that will play out when it hits the consumer. Our expectations have been for China retail demand to be relatively muted this year. You're right to point it out, we're just a little early in being able to analyze and predict what its impact will be like. We'll get back to you on that as our understanding evolves. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. \nSamik Chatterjee: Maybe to sort of ask you another one on display, just a bit more longer term. I know you have a strong position in the display market with the display glass, but traditionally or historically, the problem with this market has been the shorter cycle nature of the swings in the volume cycle. When you think about the duration of this current cycle, are you thinking about it any differently, how does the cycle track rate to some of the sort of volatility we've seen in the past? And then a bit more near term.  \n I know you mentioned you're expecting a step up in terms of industry volume into 2Q. But any more color there because that does seem like 1Q panel maker utilization improved late in the quarter more than you expected. So how are you thinking about 2Q now based on the sort of stronger exit of 1Q? \nWendell Weeks: Right, that's -- let me take the first question. That is a wonderful deep question, Samik, on the first one, mainly because as the locus of panel manufacturing has shifted from Korea, Taiwan, into China and that high concentration there has begun to lead to sort of different behavior between set makers and panel makers. One of the things that led to the sort of classic crystal cycles would be that, a, you had a very strongly growing market, which meant predicting how much capacity you would need was challenging because you had to get the rate right.  \n But then the second was that set makers would tend to have very strong back half demand. Panel makers would tend to want to make it pretty consistently. And therefore, you have build ups of value chain inventory that added volatility to the markets. Two things have changed. First, we're now in the mature stage of the display market, at least until such time [indiscernible] something like a very new format as displays start to move -- so that end market has become easier to predict. Second, what we're seeing with the behavior of the new very strong panel makers is they're seeking to optimize panel price, and they are reducing their utilization to match more closely with the actual orders from set makers. So this has begun to change that dynamic of how much inventory gets built up in the value chain.  \n Now this has only been a couple of quarters, a couple of 3 quarters. And so it's too early to tell is this going to be a more longer-term change. If it is a longer-term change, that will reflect well on the health of the industry and the smoothing out of these cycles that you are pointing out. The pandemic was sort of a mega cycle, and we're sort of still dealing with some of the things that happened during that period. So that may be more color than you're looking for, Samik, but it is a question upon which obviously we're pondering. \nSamik Chatterjee: And any thoughts on 2Q, the step-up from 1Q, 2Q just given the exit run rate was higher in 1Q. \nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. Samik, as you articulate, panel maker utilization was low generally in Q1. We certainly saw a step-up towards the end of the quarter. We're expecting them to run at higher levels through the second quarter and really through the year because if retail is flat just to meet that flat unit demand, they would have to run at significantly higher levels for the remaining 3 quarters of the year to meet that demand. We're not guiding specific volume increase from Q1 to Q2, but I think it's pretty meaningful. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. \nTimothy Long: Thank you. Maybe just a 2 parter on the optical comms business. First, on the telco side, you talked about the inventory normalization, but there's also a lot of chatter out there and weakness given 5G hasn't seemed to work all that successfully to the telcos. So could you just talk about that business in the context of 5G isn't really successful and what that means for some of these longer-term contracts that you have with some of the larger players?  \n And then secondly, on the enterprise side, could you just touch on the opportunity for a lot of chatter about GPUs kind of chasing where there happens to be spare capacity for energy. Do you see an opportunity for your enterprise business with large data centers popping up in new areas that will need to be connected? \nWendell Weeks: Thank you, Tim. On the 5G piece, I think that the challenge that our customers in telco have faced is that 5G, you move from a technology in 4G, which wireless is very wireless, right, to 5G, which, therefore, takes wireless and starts to make it more wireline. And therefore, taking a good amount of infrastructure to put in place. Now interestingly, what they've taken advantage of is if they're going to do that, you see them combining their networks from wireline and wireless into one. And that allows them some significant cost savings and offers many different potential revenue opportunities for a given deployment of network. Now -- so in a way, you're seeing their cost productivity improve, their ability to serve improve. There is a challenge of how much revenue -- incremental revenue the 5G at this stage has generated, and that is something they have wrestled with.  \n What you see reflected in our thoughts for the year is a relatively muted deployment outlook. But we'll still see the pickup because what's pushing us below sort of long-term deployment rates of fiber has been eating through the inventory largely purchased during the pandemic and dealing with that step-up. And then -- but it does incorporate a lower deployment outlook. So that's what we've sought to do for that, Tim. Does that address your question on that piece? \nTimothy Long: Yes, yes. And then just on the data centers popping up in other places impact? \nWendell Weeks: The answer to your question is yes. It is an interesting opportunity. And it is -- coming back to [ enhancing ], hey, capability we have that others don't, which is this ability for us to actually respond globally across a really big geographic footprint, not only in the U.S. but across the globe. Because this search for energy is more than just finding the exact right communities here. And so yes, it does offer a significant opportunity for us for both innovation as well as volume. But it's too early to factor that in because they haven't found all the energy sources yet that will be required, and they're still dealing with the infrastructure ramifications therein. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citi. \nAsiya Merchant: Great. And apologies if this question has been answered. But I did notice inventory was a little higher this quarter and OpEx tracked a little bit higher as well. Just if you can provide some clarity on that. \nEdward Schlesinger: Sure. Thanks, Asiya. On inventory, just think of it as we had a very low volume quarter in general. Our volume will go up through the year. So we still view inventory as an opportunity to take it down from the level we're at and we think that will be a catalyst for cash flow in 2024. With respect to OpEx, I'm going to answer your question, but I'm going to reframe it a little bit as well.  \n So sequentially, our OpEx was up. The simplest way to think about it is that our variable compensation in '23 was lower than normal because we didn't perform to target in 2023, so we just didn't pay out at target. We've reset our targets, we expect to perform in 2024. So our variable compensation is at a normal level. But what I think is important to take away on OpEx is we are committed to keep our OpEx relatively flat to where it is. It will move around in any given quarter. It's -- I think we're -- we were about $700 million in the first quarter. It could be in the $700 million to $725 million range. But if we're able to do that over time, it creates another leverage point for us as our sales grow, and that's why we talk about powerful incrementals, gross margin expands and operating margin expands as well where profitability expands more than sales. So I feel good about OpEx overall. \nAsiya Merchant: Well, I was just going to ask, I know there was commentary on yen earlier, but investors have been asking when Corning would feel comfortable sharing sort of the new yen hedges. And perhaps this question has already been answered, but I did join late, so apologies if this is a repetitive question. But any color on this. \nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. No apologies necessary, Asiya. Yes, what I shared earlier was the most important thing is to think about the return we generate in this business, our goal is to generate an appropriate return. You could think of that as what we will deliver in 2024 or what we delivered in 2023. And we're going to use yen hedging and raising price in combination to generate that economics or those economics to generate that return.  \n And so we have made progress on our hedges. We've made some nice progress, and we'll be opportunistic throughout the year, and we'll look to hedge at attractive rates. We're not sort of discussing the details. And I think it's too early to think about how to frame up core rate for 2025. So we'll keep you posted on that. But just think of it as the overall profitability level or cash generation level in the display business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Spector with UBS. \nJames Cannon: Congrats on a solid quarter. This is James Cannon on for Josh. I just wanted to poke on the powerful incrementals you described. We're talking about a $3 billion sales opportunity. I mean if I look back at kind of last couple of quarters, your gross margin has held in pretty steady despite sales declining. I think there's some noise with display pricing coming through. Can you just give me some color as to how we should think about the cadence of gross margins as we go through the rest of the year? \nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the way to think about it is if you go back to Q2 of -- I'm sorry, Q4 of 2022, that was our low point. We've expanded our gross margin 300 basis points while our sales have come down almost $400 million. We've done that by improving our productivity ratios, running our factories better and by raising price.  \n So we're actually at a very nice baseline of 37%. And I'd remind you that 37% is closer to 39% when you think about the old map before we absorb inflation and raised price, right? So we're starting from a very nice base and we have the capacity in place to support a lot higher sales, which is not normally the way we would grow. So as sales come back, we would expect our gross margin to march up along with those sales nicely each quarter. And then I mentioned just before, we also believe OpEx are on the operating margin line is another leverage point for us. So that's how we think about those powerful incrementals. I think you should just think of it as we will march up as our sales grow from 37%. \nJames Cannon: Okay. I guess just another way to think about it is, as that $3 billion comes through, like I think 40 has typically been your target. Like has that changed? Or is that where you think -- that's where you think you can get to? \nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. So I think we can get there. But just as a reminder, the 40, if you go back in time, we've absorbed a significant amount of inflation and raised price, which brings our margin percentage down. So 38% is sort of the new 40% in old math. But I still think despite that new base, we can get back to that 40% level as we accrete our sales up. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. \nSteven Fox: I guess I was just wondering on the Specialty Materials business, if you can provide some more detail. From my seat, it looks like it did much better than I would have thought for Q1. How much of that was due to Gorilla Glass? How do you sort of look at the rest of the year, given sort of mixed results in Q1 on the phone side, like what kind of seasonality, et cetera, are we looking at? \nEdward Schlesinger: Yes. I think it was more or less in line with how we would have expected it. I think it's a business that will grow as we add more Corning content. That's the way we think about it for the year. We don't see smartphone market being up that much in units maybe a point or 2 for the year. There certainly can be some growth in the IT space, but even that is single digit, maybe mid-single-digit level. \n So I think the growth catalyst here is for us to add content into the market. \nWendell Weeks: And we just don't see a lot of that happening this year. Steve, we'll be -- this is most of our newest innovation will be aimed at the model year following this. So we're not looking at MC as being a big catalyst for near-term growth in terms of versus Q1, right, for this year, but future it will be. \nAnn Nicholson: Super. We've got time for another question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. \nGeorge Notter: I guess I'm curious about your comments on display. I think you mentioned an appropriate level of profitability. I get what that is. But when you go out and re-up the hedging portfolio, obviously, there's a cost that comes with that. Do you still -- I think if I go back in the past, you guys looked at the hedging portfolio as being pretty neutral in terms of cost between what you were long and what you were short. Is that still going to be the case as we re-up the hedges going forward? And then when you talk about an appropriate level of profitability, are you including the cost of the hedging program when you make that statement? \nWendell Weeks: The appropriate level of profitability would include any cost of hedging. We're long yen, right? And so the -- you heard, and Ed was pointing out sort of over the sweep of time, we generated on the order of $2.5 billion of cash, positive cash arising from our hedges, right? That or us hedging that long end position. And the way we think about this is that position is coming from the fact we sell in yen. And so we will resolve this either in the currency market should the yen come back to more sort of reasonable levels, right? And we'll be opportunistic about that.  \n But if not, our customers are picking up the game in terms of lower-cost glass because we sell in yen. And so what we will do is just raise our price in yen to share some of that volatility that we're seeing in the yen. Does that make sense, George? \nGeorge Notter: It does. I assume it's still fair to say that the cost of the hedging program is pretty minimal to shareholders, we're pretty balanced in terms of the 2 sides. \nWendell Weeks: Yes. \nAnn Nicholson: Thanks, George, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Before we close, I wanted to let you know that we will hold our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 2. In addition, we'll also attend the JPMorgan Technology Conference on May 21. And finally, we'll be hosting management visits to investor offices in [ select cities ].  \n There'll be a web replay of today's call on our site starting later this morning. Thank you all for joining us. Shannon, that concludes our call. Please disconnect all lines. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Edward Schlesinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter sales were $3.26 billion, and EPS was $0.38, at the high end of our guidance. Our actions to increase price and improve productivity ratios are paying off. In the first quarter, despite lower year-over-year sales, we grew gross margin by 160 basis points. We also grew free cash flow by more than $300 million versus the first quarter of 2023. Overall, we have established a significantly stronger profitability and cash flow base, and we expect to grow from first quarter levels.  \n In the second quarter, we expect sales of approximately $3.4 billion, with strong incremental profit and EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.46. Let's take a closer look at our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales for the first quarter were $930 million, down 17% year-over-year, reflecting temporarily lower carrier demand as customers continued to draw down inventory. Net income for the quarter was $100 million, down 37% year-over-year, reflecting the lower volume.  \n We are seeing clear signs of improving market conditions, and we think Q1 represents an inflection point. Sequentially, sales grew in both carrier and enterprise in the first quarter, which is more favorable than normal seasonality. And our order rates are steadily increasing as some of our carrier customers are reaching the end of their inventory drawdowns. We believe we're well positioned to take advantage of the industry's long-term growth drivers, specifically broadband, 5G, cloud computing and AI. We will also benefit from public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the U.S. population.  \n Moving to Display Technologies. As we shared with you in January, panel makers reduced their utilization levels in the fourth quarter in response to a softer retail selling season. Additionally, as expected, panel makers utilization levels remained low in the first quarter to align supply to demand. Our first quarter sales were $872 million, up 14% year-over-year and net income was $201 million, up 26% year-over-year. The increase in net income was primarily driven by higher volume and pricing actions taken in the second half of 2023.  \n First quarter glass price was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2023 as expected. Now it's worth noting that first quarter net income was negatively impacted by our decision to reduce our production to align to the lower volume we experienced in the fourth and first quarters. Our profitability will be higher in the second quarter. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect panel makers to run at higher utilization rates, driven by growth in retail demand resulting from midyear promotions, and we will return our production volume to more normal levels. We expect the second quarter glass market and our volume to increase sequentially as a result of higher panel maker utilization, and we expect glass price to be consistent with the first quarter.  \n For the full year, our expectations for the retail market remain unchanged from our January view and are consistent with industry expectations. Specifically, we anticipate relatively flat television unit volume, another year of TV screen size growth, and some recovery in PC demand. This adds mid-single-digit percent growth in glass volume at retail versus 2023. Overall, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable.  \n Before I move on, I want to take a minute to address currency exchange rates. As a reminder, we have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect our cash flow, enhance our ability to invest and protect shareholder returns. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. And we've received more than $2.5 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception.  \n Our most significant hedge contracts are for the Japanese yen, which support our yen core rate of 107 through the end of 2024. As we look beyond 2024, our goal is to maintain an appropriate return on our display business through a combination of currency hedges and industrial solutions like price increases. First, on hedging, we are actively working to improve our hedge coverage for 2025 and into the future. The yen forward curve works in our favor. So if you go out a year, the forward rate is about JPY 8 stronger than today's spot rate; out 2 years, it's approximately 14; and so on.  \n The current yen spot rate is significantly weaker than the 30-year average of approximately JPY 110. We have made some progress on our hedges and are now partially hedged for 2025, and we'll continue to look for attractive opportunities to increase our hedges. Second, our customers sell panels in U.S. dollars, and they buy glass from us in yen. They are benefiting from the current weak yen rate. We plan to share the economics more appropriately with our customers by raising glass prices in yen.  \n We successfully took a first step in this direction in the second half of 2023. We will continue to keep you updated as we make progress. Moving to Specialty Materials. Sales in the first quarter were $454 million, up 12% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our premium smartphone cover materials as well as semiconductor-related products. Net income was $44 million, up 13% year-over-year, driven by higher volume. Our more Corning approach will continue to help us win as handheld and IT markets recover.  \n Additionally, over time, we anticipate growth from new innovations such as bendable glass and augmented reality as they are adopted more broadly. Environmental Technologies first quarter sales were $455 million, up 6% year-over-year, driven by increased GPF adoption in China which more than offset a decline in heavy-duty diesel in North America, an impact we expect to continue through 2024. Net income was $105 million, up 28% year-over-year, driven by higher volume and improved operating performance. In Life Sciences, Sales in the first quarter were $236 million, down 8% versus the first quarter of 2023 as customers in North America and Europe continue to draw down their inventory.  \n Net income was $13 million, up 44% year-over-year, reflecting improved productivity. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses. Sales in the first quarter were $311 million, down 19% year-over-year, reflecting lower pricing for solar grade polysilicon and lower sales in pharmaceutical technologies from the completion of volume commitments for COVID-related products.  \n Now let's turn to our outlook. Last quarter, we shared our expectation that the first quarter would be the low quarter of the year, and we're even more confident that, that is the case. In the second quarter, we expect sales to grow sequentially to approximately $3.4 billion with strong incremental profit and EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.46. We also anticipate free cash flow to grow sequentially by approximately $300 million in the second quarter and we expect CapEx of approximately $1.2 billion for the year.  \n Wendell outlined our framework to drive strong returns on our existing innovation and capacity investments and shared our expectations for powerful incremental profit and cash flow. Given this opportunity, we've begun to think about our approach to the allocation of that cash going forward. As a reminder, we prioritize investing for organic growth opportunities.  \n And as we've shared today, in the midterm, we have the capabilities and capacity in place to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales with minimal cash investment. You can see that reflected in our CapEx expectations for 2024. This contributes to the strong free cash flow we expect to generate. Additionally, we maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet, and we're in great shape. We have one of the longest debt centers in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is about 23 years with about only $1 billion in debt coming due over the next 5 years, and we have no significant debt due -- coming due in any given year.  \n So as our cash flow increases, we remain committed to providing returns to our shareholders. We have grown our dividend 40% since 2019 and our dividend yield is top quartile in the S&P 500, and we will continue to be opportunistic on share repurchases. I look forward to sharing more in the coming months as we continue to make progress building a solid foundation for durable, profitable long-term growth. Now I'll turn things back over to Ann. Yes. Thanks for the question, Wamsi, and I understand the desire to have all that information. I think the simplest way to think about it is we are committed to generating return in this business. And we think we will do that in 2024. We did that in 2023. And our goal is to get the economics to be similar as we go forward regardless of where the yen winds up and where we are able to hedge.  \n We'll be -- we're good at hedging. We've got a long-standing program. We will look for attractive opportunities to build our 2025 hedge portfolio. And if the yen breaks our way, we'll go out beyond that. I think it's too early to talk about core rate or that kind of discussion, but I think you should just think about our display economics that we'll deliver in 2024 as being the way to think about our display business. So we'll raise price to offset the impact of the yen and the net of those two things to get you to the same place. That's the way we're thinking about it. We've made some nice progress on hedging, and we'll continue to keep you updated as we go. I think that's the way you all should think about it. Yes, Meta, on your other question. So first, I would start with we actually have capacity to do much more than $3 billion in sales. I think we're framing it up as we see it. Where those sales come from, where those opportunities come from will depend on whether we need to add anything beyond what we have in place today, but we feel very confident in supporting a number well above $3 billion.  \n There are certainly a few places where we might spend a little money, but it's all encapsulated in the CapEx guide we gave for 2024, and we ramped our capital spend down in the back half of 2023. So sitting here today, I don't see any need for significant amount of capital. A good example might be as we build out our auto glass business, and we continue to win there. We might need to spend a little bit, but not the kind of capital you're used to when you build like melting capacity for glass, more on the finishing side. So I think we -- our goal is to generate a significant amount of cash flow off of the existing capacity we have in place. Yes. Samik, as you articulate, panel maker utilization was low generally in Q1. We certainly saw a step-up towards the end of the quarter. We're expecting them to run at higher levels through the second quarter and really through the year because if retail is flat just to meet that flat unit demand, they would have to run at significantly higher levels for the remaining 3 quarters of the year to meet that demand. We're not guiding specific volume increase from Q1 to Q2, but I think it's pretty meaningful. Sure. Thanks, Asiya. On inventory, just think of it as we had a very low volume quarter in general. Our volume will go up through the year. So we still view inventory as an opportunity to take it down from the level we're at and we think that will be a catalyst for cash flow in 2024. With respect to OpEx, I'm going to answer your question, but I'm going to reframe it a little bit as well.  \n So sequentially, our OpEx was up. The simplest way to think about it is that our variable compensation in '23 was lower than normal because we didn't perform to target in 2023, so we just didn't pay out at target. We've reset our targets, we expect to perform in 2024. So our variable compensation is at a normal level. But what I think is important to take away on OpEx is we are committed to keep our OpEx relatively flat to where it is. It will move around in any given quarter. It's -- I think we're -- we were about $700 million in the first quarter. It could be in the $700 million to $725 million range. But if we're able to do that over time, it creates another leverage point for us as our sales grow, and that's why we talk about powerful incrementals, gross margin expands and operating margin expands as well where profitability expands more than sales. So I feel good about OpEx overall. Yes. No apologies necessary, Asiya. Yes, what I shared earlier was the most important thing is to think about the return we generate in this business, our goal is to generate an appropriate return. You could think of that as what we will deliver in 2024 or what we delivered in 2023. And we're going to use yen hedging and raising price in combination to generate that economics or those economics to generate that return.  \n And so we have made progress on our hedges. We've made some nice progress, and we'll be opportunistic throughout the year, and we'll look to hedge at attractive rates. We're not sort of discussing the details. And I think it's too early to think about how to frame up core rate for 2025. So we'll keep you posted on that. But just think of it as the overall profitability level or cash generation level in the display business. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the way to think about it is if you go back to Q2 of -- I'm sorry, Q4 of 2022, that was our low point. We've expanded our gross margin 300 basis points while our sales have come down almost $400 million. We've done that by improving our productivity ratios, running our factories better and by raising price.  \n So we're actually at a very nice baseline of 37%. And I'd remind you that 37% is closer to 39% when you think about the old map before we absorb inflation and raised price, right? So we're starting from a very nice base and we have the capacity in place to support a lot higher sales, which is not normally the way we would grow. So as sales come back, we would expect our gross margin to march up along with those sales nicely each quarter. And then I mentioned just before, we also believe OpEx are on the operating margin line is another leverage point for us. So that's how we think about those powerful incrementals. I think you should just think of it as we will march up as our sales grow from 37%. Yes. So I think we can get there. But just as a reminder, the 40, if you go back in time, we've absorbed a significant amount of inflation and raised price, which brings our margin percentage down. So 38% is sort of the new 40% in old math. But I still think despite that new base, we can get back to that 40% level as we accrete our sales up. Yes. I think it was more or less in line with how we would have expected it. I think it's a business that will grow as we add more Corning content. That's the way we think about it for the year. We don't see smartphone market being up that much in units maybe a point or 2 for the year. There certainly can be some growth in the IT space, but even that is single digit, maybe mid-single-digit level. \n So I think the growth catalyst here is for us to add content into the market."

            "name": "Wendell Weeks",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. Today, we announced first quarter 2024 results. Sales were nearly $3.3 billion and EPS was $0.38. Year-over-year, gross margin grew 160 basis points to 36.8%, and free cash flow improved by $300 million. These results were at the high end of our guidance. More importantly, but we're seeing encouraging signs of improving market conditions. We continue to expect that the first quarter will be the low quarter for the year.  \n We are executing our plans to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales within the next 3 years. And we already have the required capacity and capabilities in place. As a result, we're poised to deliver powerful incremental profit and cash flow and generate substantial shareholder value. Last quarter, we outlined a framework under which we expect to drive stronger returns on our existing innovation and capacity investments and we shared our expectation that these returns will begin in 2024.  \n The framework has 3 primary components: First, we believe that the first quarter will be the lowest quarter for the year. We will improve from here. Second, we expect to grow by more than $3 billion in annualized sales in the midterm, which we define as within the next 3 years. The outlook in each of our markets remains positive, and our market positions are quite strong. Third, as we capture this growth, we expect to deliver powerful incrementals. We already have the required production capacity and technical capabilities in place, and the cost and the capital are already reflected in our financials. This is a tremendous opportunity for our shareholders.  \n In the 3 months since our last call, our confidence in these 3 components has only increased. We expect our sales to grow from here and we have reflected this in our second quarter guidance. Today, I'd like to review each component of the framework and share some of the reasons why our confidence has grown. Let me begin with the first component. Our expectation that quarter 1 will be the lowest quarter of 2024. Near term, we expect optical and display to be the biggest drivers of our improvement. \n In Optical Communications, carrier inventory drawdowns have been the primary source of our below-trend sales. Once carrier inventory starts returning to more normal levels and our customers resume purchasing to support their deployment rates, we would expect to see our order book grow. And that's exactly what is happening.  \n Our order book grew nicely from fourth quarter levels. This and our regular conversations with large carrier customers indicate that the gap between our sales and customer deployments is moderating. As a result, we expect carrier sales to increase from first quarter levels. Additionally, in the enterprise portion of our optical business, we expected our recent wins for AI data centers will translate into orders and sales during the year. In display, panel makers increased their utilization rates late in the first quarter, and we expect the higher utilization to continue into the second quarter, driven by expected growth in retail demand resulting from midyear promotions.  \n For the full year 2024, our expectations for the retail glass market remain unchanged from our January view and consistent with industry expectations. We anticipate relatively flat television unit volume, another year of television screen size growth, and some recovery in PC demand. This leads to mid-single-digit percent growth in glass volume at retail versus 2023. As a result, we expect our financial performance in display to improve significantly from our first quarter run rate. Ed will share more details on that in just a few moments.  \n Now let's move to the second component of our framework. Our expectation that we will add more than $3 billion in annualized sales within the next 3 years. Our positive outlook for each of our market opportunities, results from our leadership positions and the power of the secular trends that we're addressing through innovation and close collaboration with customers. There's a lot more Corning to be had in our markets.  \n In Optical Communications, fiber is the ascendant technology, and we're the clear market leader. As I've covered in the last 2 calls, fiber shipments are more than 30% below trend. We fully expect that gap to close, adding more than 40% to our overall optical communication sales. In conversations with our large carrier customers during the quarter, they reinforced their commitment to increasing fiber deployments in 2024 and beyond. Additionally, we expect BEAD-related projects for network builds in underserved areas to add to our addressable market for the next several years. The industry expects funding approvals to begin late this year, leading to spending in 2025.  \n Next, generative AI is an especially attractive opportunity for us, it creates significant demand for passive optical connectivity solutions and strengthens our value proposition and our competitive advantages. All data centers consist of a front-end network, connecting racks of CPUs. To meet the computational demands of AI, customers are building a new fiber-rich second network to connect GPUs, which increases our market opportunity.  \n Now we'll see this in our financials as customers begin to build large GPU clusters and adopt our latest high-density innovations. Customers want fast deployment. Our preconnectorized structured cabling solutions offer big installation time advantages. And the GPU clusters, which pack a very large amount of computing power per rack require smaller, tensor cables, making connector size and cable diameter, important requirements. To meet these high-density requirements, we've introduced new-to-the-world fiber cable and connectivity products.  \n At OFC a few weeks ago, we introduced RocketRibbon cable with Flow Ribbon technology that can reduce cable diameter by 60% with fibers per cable approaching 7,000. A key part of delivering this innovation is our Contour optical fiber, which has a 40% smaller cross-sectional area than legacy fibers. Now our ability to integrate innovations across fiber, cable and connectors, to create end-to-end solutions is a unique competitive advantage, and we're accumulating significant customer wins for upcoming AI data center builds. In our recent customer wins, our revenue is low single-digit hundreds of dollars per GPU. \n We believe the customer density needs combined with our technology superior performance will sustain these attractive sales attach rates long term. Let's turn to automotive. The U.S. EPA announced new multi-pollutant standards last month. They include a strong particulate emissions limit that will require gasoline particulate filter adoption on U.S. gasoline vehicles, including hybrids, as early as 2026 for model year 2027. We are the inventor and the clear market leader in GPF and these standards increase our environmental technologies content opportunity by 2 to 3 times per U.S. ICE vehicle. This adoption offers hundreds of millions of dollars of growth for us in the U.S. alone, even in the face of BEV adoption. Keep in mind, we're also pursuing additional more Corning content opportunities in the automotive industry by introducing our automotive glass solutions, which are building success and momentum and are being adopted by both ICE and BEV platforms.  \n In Mobile Consumer Electronics, our goal is to outpace the market by increasing the content we provide for each device. Our sales have consistently outpaced the market over the last decade, and we expect that to continue to be the case going forward. We've done this by advancing the state of the art for cover materials and adding more content per device, a classic more Corning play. We have a strong innovation portfolio in support of our close collaborations with leading OEMs, and we expect to continue delivering new products that increase our value per device.  \n In display, we expect volume growth at retail to be driven mainly by television screen size growth. In fact, in the first quarter, sales of 85-inch TVs increased by more than 50% year-over-year. Overall, we expect to capture growth in display because we are the undisputed technology leader. Our successful development of Gen 10.5 and advanced capabilities aligned with the continued move to larger-sized TVs produced on the lowest cost platforms for large displays.  \n Finally, we continue to build entirely new product platforms to capture opportunities in new categories. Examples include automotive glass solutions to support high autonomy systems, the growing opportunity to localize U.S. solar supply and pharmaceutical packaging. In sum, we expect the power of our market leadership positions and more Corning innovations to allow us to grow faster than our markets in advance our $3 billion plus opportunity.  \n Now I'd like to move to the third component of the framework. Our expectation for powerful incrementals as we add sales. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a set of actions to restore historic productivity ratios and also to raise price to share the impact of inflation more equitably with our customers. Since we initiated these activities, we have expanded our gross margin by 320 basis points despite sales being down almost $400 million.  \n Our actions have established a significantly stronger profitability and cash flow base even while our P&L includes the costs and technical capabilities necessary to support $3 billion plus in additional sales. Importantly, we have put processes and governance mechanisms in place to generate operating leverage as we grow sales. So as I close today, here's what I'd like to leave you with. Our first quarter results show encouraging signs of improving market conditions. We continue to expect this quarter will be the lowest quarter for the year. Additionally, we've established a higher profitability and cash flow base.  \n Finally, as our markets improve, we have the opportunity to increase our annualized sales by more than $3 billion. As we capture that growth, we expect to deliver powerful incrementals because the required capacity, the technical capabilities are already in place and the costs are already in our financials. This represents a terrific opportunity for our shareholders. Our second quarter guidance reflects higher sales and strong incremental profit. And you'll hear more about this from Ed.  \n We will continue making progress on this opportunity in 2024. Think of us as continuing to march up. I look forward to updating you at investor conferences in the next few months. Now before I turn the call over to Ed, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, who will retire from Corning at the end of May.  \n I want to thank Jeff for his 13 years of outstanding leadership at our company. During his tenure, he's helped grow the company, develop frameworks that define our priorities and guide our actions and raised awareness of glass as a key enabling material. He also increased Corning's focus on sustainability. Jeff, we wish you the very best. With that, I'll turn things over to Ed. So the timing of when we'll start to see it in our financials. So we start with a pretty large business and enterprise, all related to the sort of front-end -- we think about it as a front-end network, which is all connecting the CPUs. So off over that base, you'll start to see sort of a relatively robust revenue growth assuming the orders that we've closed here all ship in the back half of this year. You're just going to start to see that momentum begin to build.  \n Where does it come from? Well, the simplest way to think about this is let's just start at the rack level. A typical front-end rack filled with CPUs has about 32 fibers to sort of come into that top of the rack switch, right, 16 ports, 2 fibers per port. There's different ways to do it. But assuming one of these back-end network, GPU racks will tend to have on the order of a couple of [ 100 ] servers. To service those, you need more like 256 fibers on that same rack. So you've got about an 8x increase in the amount of fibers per rack. So this is what leads to the demand for us to do a more Corning innovation, how do you fit 8 times as many light pipes into fundamentally the same area. And that's why you see all of our new product innovation, what we've been working on the last few years is aimed at that. So as you start to see those large cluster GPU installations begin is when you should start to see it in our numbers, Wamsi. Was that -- did that answer your question? So you -- that is a great observation, and it is in line with the sort of secular trend that we see that basically says we have plenty of innovation we have to get done because density continues to increase as well as the bandwidth requirements increase. And so what that does is it reduces the amount of distance with which you can travel in an electron and therefore pushes the photons closer and closer to sort of the beachfront of those GPUs, which is opening up an entire new set of categories for us -- for our flat glass, for our ability to couple light into various formats. And so in a way what you're describing is what's leading to a whole new family of innovations upon which we are working diligently, Wamsi. I'll start with the second one and then maybe, Ed, you can discuss the first. So on BEAD timing, we tend to be relatively conservative in our outlook of how effective the government can be in allocating resources to build networks. We're in strong support of this. It requires U.S. content and we think it's aimed well and it will be done. The funds have been allocated. But the process, we would tend to be a little -- our expectations are being a little slower than what you see as the industry overall. We think they'll get allocated this year and you won't really start to see spending until next year. That's our current point of view [indiscernible]. Does that answer your question? That's a great question. They're relatively recent, and we're still in the midst of trying to understand how that will play out when it hits the consumer. Our expectations have been for China retail demand to be relatively muted this year. You're right to point it out, we're just a little early in being able to analyze and predict what its impact will be like. We'll get back to you on that as our understanding evolves. Right, that's -- let me take the first question. That is a wonderful deep question, Samik, on the first one, mainly because as the locus of panel manufacturing has shifted from Korea, Taiwan, into China and that high concentration there has begun to lead to sort of different behavior between set makers and panel makers. One of the things that led to the sort of classic crystal cycles would be that, a, you had a very strongly growing market, which meant predicting how much capacity you would need was challenging because you had to get the rate right.  \n But then the second was that set makers would tend to have very strong back half demand. Panel makers would tend to want to make it pretty consistently. And therefore, you have build ups of value chain inventory that added volatility to the markets. Two things have changed. First, we're now in the mature stage of the display market, at least until such time [indiscernible] something like a very new format as displays start to move -- so that end market has become easier to predict. Second, what we're seeing with the behavior of the new very strong panel makers is they're seeking to optimize panel price, and they are reducing their utilization to match more closely with the actual orders from set makers. So this has begun to change that dynamic of how much inventory gets built up in the value chain.  \n Now this has only been a couple of quarters, a couple of 3 quarters. And so it's too early to tell is this going to be a more longer-term change. If it is a longer-term change, that will reflect well on the health of the industry and the smoothing out of these cycles that you are pointing out. The pandemic was sort of a mega cycle, and we're sort of still dealing with some of the things that happened during that period. So that may be more color than you're looking for, Samik, but it is a question upon which obviously we're pondering. Thank you, Tim. On the 5G piece, I think that the challenge that our customers in telco have faced is that 5G, you move from a technology in 4G, which wireless is very wireless, right, to 5G, which, therefore, takes wireless and starts to make it more wireline. And therefore, taking a good amount of infrastructure to put in place. Now interestingly, what they've taken advantage of is if they're going to do that, you see them combining their networks from wireline and wireless into one. And that allows them some significant cost savings and offers many different potential revenue opportunities for a given deployment of network. Now -- so in a way, you're seeing their cost productivity improve, their ability to serve improve. There is a challenge of how much revenue -- incremental revenue the 5G at this stage has generated, and that is something they have wrestled with.  \n What you see reflected in our thoughts for the year is a relatively muted deployment outlook. But we'll still see the pickup because what's pushing us below sort of long-term deployment rates of fiber has been eating through the inventory largely purchased during the pandemic and dealing with that step-up. And then -- but it does incorporate a lower deployment outlook. So that's what we've sought to do for that, Tim. Does that address your question on that piece? The answer to your question is yes. It is an interesting opportunity. And it is -- coming back to [ enhancing ], hey, capability we have that others don't, which is this ability for us to actually respond globally across a really big geographic footprint, not only in the U.S. but across the globe. Because this search for energy is more than just finding the exact right communities here. And so yes, it does offer a significant opportunity for us for both innovation as well as volume. But it's too early to factor that in because they haven't found all the energy sources yet that will be required, and they're still dealing with the infrastructure ramifications therein. And we just don't see a lot of that happening this year. Steve, we'll be -- this is most of our newest innovation will be aimed at the model year following this. So we're not looking at MC as being a big catalyst for near-term growth in terms of versus Q1, right, for this year, but future it will be. The appropriate level of profitability would include any cost of hedging. We're long yen, right? And so the -- you heard, and Ed was pointing out sort of over the sweep of time, we generated on the order of $2.5 billion of cash, positive cash arising from our hedges, right? That or us hedging that long end position. And the way we think about this is that position is coming from the fact we sell in yen. And so we will resolve this either in the currency market should the yen come back to more sort of reasonable levels, right? And we'll be opportunistic about that.  \n But if not, our customers are picking up the game in terms of lower-cost glass because we sell in yen. And so what we will do is just raise our price in yen to share some of that volatility that we're seeing in the yen. Does that make sense, George? Yes."
