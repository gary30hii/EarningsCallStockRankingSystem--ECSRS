At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. \nJustine Stone: Hi, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. I'm Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C Technologies. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Pedonti, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, we need to review the Safe Harbor statement. Please note that various remarks we make today about future expectations, plans and prospects, including the financial outlook we provide, constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K which is on file with the SEC and can also be accessed on our website. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of today, February 10th, 2021. While the Company may elect to update these forward-looking statements, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in today's earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stone: Thanks, Justine. And thanks everyone for joining. Our results for the fourth quarter were $1.206 billion. In adjusted revenue, it's down 0.5% and $1.13 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is up almost 5%. For the full year, we had $4.681 billion in adjusted revenue, up 0.3% and $4.30 of adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 12.3%. Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $475.8 million for the fourth quarter and our adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin was 39.4%. Our Q4 adjusted organic revenue was down 2% and for full year or 2020 organic revenue was down 0.5%. As expected, we had weakness in our large license software business in the fourth quarter. But our alternatives business are interlinked in our ads business grew nicely and the DST business saw improvement from the previous quarter. Operating cash flow was one $1.84.7 million -- $1.1847 billion for the 12 months ended December 31st, 2020, up 10% if you exclude the one-time $250 million upfront license payment paid in the second half of 2019. $1,184.7 million represents a 103% cash conversion rate on our adjusted net income of $1,146.8 billion.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks, Bill. As you noted, we had a strong quarter with a broad-based lift in revenue from Q3, across many of our business lines. DST, SS&C Health, the Alternatives, Intralinks, Regulatory and Algorithmics, all posted improved performance in Q4. Our Alternatives business grew 5.5% in Q4 and 5.7% for the year. Clients remain optimistic about their growth outlook, which is reflected in our data, including the Capital Movement and other indices we publish. Bill mentioned the rapid adoption of Eze Eclipse in his earlier comments and in Q4, we launched the Eze app powered by Eclipse and made it available in iOS and Android app stores in November. User adoption and design collaboration for the apps' next phase have been strong.\nPatrick Pedonti: Thank you. Results for the fourth quarter were GAAP revenues of $1,203.4 million. GAAP net income was $197.1 million and diluted EPS of $0.74. On an adjusted basis, revenues were $1,206.1 million, including the impact of the adoption of the revenue standard 606 and acquired deferred revenue adjustments for acquisitions. Adjusted revenue was down 0.5%, adjusted operating income decreased 2.4% and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.13, a 4.6% increase over Q4 2019. Adjusted revenue decreased $6.1 million or 0.5% over Q4 '19. Our acquisitions contributed $27.4 million, foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $6 million or 0.5% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue decline on a constant currency basis, was 2% driven by weakness in the Advent, Institutional, Software Products and DST Financial Services. These were offset by strength in Fund Administration, Intralinks and the Eze business. And we had strong sequential growth in the DST Financial Services and Healthcare businesses over the third quarter. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $458.8 million, a decline of $12.2 million or 2.4% from the fourth quarter 2019. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $3.5 million on expenses in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins were 38.8%, compared to 38.0% in 2019. The expenses were driven by higher employee compensation and benefits, higher sales commissions and professional services and these expenses were partially offset by lower travel and contractor expenses. Adjusted EBITDA defined in Note 3 of our earnings release, was $475.8 million, or 39.4% of adjusted revenue. Net interest expense for the fourth quarter was $53.3 million and includes $3.4 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID. The average rate in the quarter for our amended credit facility and our senior notes was 2.99%, compared to 4.53% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and resulted in an interest expense decrease of $47.2 million or 47%. We recorded a GAAP tax provision of $37.7 million or, 16.1% of pre-tax income. Adjusted net income as defined in Note 4 of our earnings release, was $302.6 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.13. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares increased to $268.1 million from $266.7 million in Q3. The impact of the increase in the average share price and option exercises, was partially offset by share repurchases in the quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow as of December 31st, we had approximately $29.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $6.5 billion of gross debt for a net debt position of approximately $6.3 billion.\nOperator: Excuse me, I think Mr. Bill got disconnected, but he is reconnecting now.\nPatrick Pedonti: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Excuse me, Mr. Bill Stone is reconnected.\nBill Stone: Sorry about that. Thanks, Patrick.\nPatrick Pedonti: Thank you.\nBill Stone: We continue to operate in the global pandemic. 99% of our global workforce is still remote and business travel and in-person sales meetings are essentially non-existent. Over the past 11 months, we have learned how to operate under these circumstances. Utilizing video conferencing, web-based marketing and promoting the power of our business model and reliability of our people and technology. As you can tell from this call, we are optimistic. We believe our performance during this pandemic will pay dividends well into the future -- well into the future. We will now open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Presenters.  We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ICE. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good afternoon. Could you comment on fourth quarter 2020 total organic revenue growth, quantify please? And then, if you could break down organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter by Fund Administration, Intralinks and CST?\nBill Stone: For the fourth quarter, total -- total adjusted organic growth was down 2%. The Alternatives Fund Administration business was up 5.5% and DST, we can provide you kind of a breakout between the two groups. The Financial Services group was down 1.1% and the Healthcare group was up 3.1%. I think that combined to be down 0.3% for the full year. And Intralinks was up 3.8%\nDavid Togut: Got it. Thanks for that. And just as my follow-up, could you comment on your acquisition pipeline and appetite to acquire in the year ahead, based on the quality of the pipeline and valuations that you see?\nBill Stone: Well, we constantly look at -- at acquisitions and we're disciplined about it. Obviously, we deployed $8.3 billion in 2018 and that bought DST as and Intralinks. We spent, I think a about $138 million in 2020, which was less than we would have expected, but -- but we looked at lots of things and obviously in the public domain, you know that we looked at Link Administration down in Australia. So, we're disciplined about it and we're quite aware that all the questions that we get on -- on the conference calls and from our shareholders, are organic revenue growth or unit. So, we want to make sure that we focus on our organic revenue growth and as Rahul had detailed in his remarks, we've made lots of changes. All of our businesses are getting better. All of them. Because if they don't get better, we get different executives and that's how we operate. So, we're very optimistic about where we're going, about generating tons of cash, paying down a bunch of debt, looking at great acquisitions and earning more money for our shareholders and then deciding how we're going to allocate our capital, whether that's going to be on acquisitions, which is generally our first choice. But we also like to pay down debt and we also like to evaluate buying back our shares. So, I don't think our -- our business plan, our strategy has changed. I believe that what we're doing is executing and I think that's what we'll continue. So, there is a lot of stuff for sale, and you see stuff getting -- getting purchased all time. And the question becomes, is this -- is that strategic for us. Will it drive our organic revenue growth and what is it going to do over the long term. So, those are the criteria that we have and I think we will probably buy some things in 2021, but as usual, we'll be disciplined about it and we are going into 2021 with some optimism.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt from Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions here. I wanted to touch on the sales cycle briefly. I know you mentioned in your revenue assumptions, you expect customer appetite and buying behavior to improve throughout the year, but I'm wondering what you're seeing more recently as we -- we're heading into 2021. Are you seeing customer behavior and buying patterns, improve. Obviously, you're still in a large remote environment, but just curious what you're seeing from a sales cycle perspective, especially as it pertains to large deals?\nBill Stone: I'll give that a quick shot and then Rahul can comment. But, we have a pretty full pipeline. We have large deals, we have what we believe are -- are a number of large deals that we hope to close this quarter. We have a very reasonable January and I believe that we will continue to execute and we're seeing some strength across our different businesses. I think our indicators that we have in Intralinks are all as strong as they've ever been. I think we have a pipeline and gaining rhythm we've ever had and some services, the hedge fund industry has proven to be quite resilient and I think will continue to be, as more and more private assets become the most attractive place to put money, whether that's private equity or private credit or real estate. I think that SS&C is well positioned to do well there. And I think that the DST business is getting stronger. Our Retirements business grew very nicely in Q4 and we expect it to grow very nicely throughout 2021. We have some challenges in our Healthcare business, but, Daniel DelMastro and his team are doing a good job and they are very focused. And so, with that I'll let Rahul take a crack.\nRahul Kanwar: You know, I think the thing that I would add is, as time has passed in this pandemic -- pandemic, we have gotten more comfortable and our customers as prospects have gotten more comfortable, transacting over digital and virtual and we always had an element of that. But obviously, we've had to rely on it a lot more. So, we've seen our yield for virtual events and all the things that we do to get the pipeline go up pretty substantially. And we've also seen contract signings and things like that, which we're certainly slow at the start of this process, pick back up. So, we feel pretty good about the current state, it's better than it was three months ago and we think it's going to keep getting better throughout the course of the year.\nAndrew Schmidt: That's great. Good to hear about the improvement, especially in the DST side. Maybe to cab on to that, when you think about the FY '21 organic growth outlook, this year with a 4%, what are the three -- what are the primary things that drive sort of the bottom and the top end and then within that, what are the assumptions for DST, as the year progresses? Any color there would be helpful.\nBill Stone: No, again, right. The -- the when you, when -- when you're selling $20 million to $50 million deals for a year or $10 million to $25 million deals for the -- for the year, multi-year deals, if we win them, we will be at that 4% and if we don't win them, we will be closer to that 0%. But we're confident that we are going to win a lot more than we lose, we're going to continue to perform. The feedback from our clients has been tremendous, based on -- on the work that our entire staff is put in and the attention to detail that we have delivered. In places like Advent and others, that do Net Promoter Scores, highest it's ever been, customer satisfaction, as we track is very high. And our retention rates, will stick at 96% or so. And so I think that we have a lot of optimism that we can perform, you know we got to win. You got to throw passes, somebody has got to catch them and they got to go across goal line. I mean, that's the nature of the beast. And I don't know if Rahul, you would have anything else to add to that.\nRahul Kanwar: Just I guess on the second part of that, on DST in particular. So, to talk about the pieces that DST separately. The DST Financial Services business, which is really everything except Health, we're expecting to see low single-digit type growth, that's kind of what's been so at the midpoint, maybe something like 3.5% or something like that, and the Health business, as Bill mentioned, we do have some challenges, and we're still dealing with some COVID impacts and we expect that to be flat to slightly down for the year.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. That's good context. Very helpful, guys. I appreciate it, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yeah, hi, good evening, everyone. Can you talk about the cost structure in the margin a little bit, if I -- if I look at the guidance correctly here, it looks like continued margin expansion. So, any more details there? But, but more importantly, it's just operating leverage or is it still a lot of efficiency gains that you're getting? I know you've been doing a lot of that. So just wondering, where you are still finding opportunities to I guess cut, if that's what's happening?\nBill Stone: Well, I think, Alex, we would say that we manage, we cut where we have to, and you know, but we have a large workforce, we have almost 25,000 people. And there is opportunities everywhere, right and we have to get more efficient. And if you get you know 5% efficiency, then on 25,000 people, that's 1200 people I think, right. So, we need to drive revenue in order to be able to continue to grow our workforce and continue to -- to increase our margins, and so that's what everyone at SS&C is focused on and -- and we manage it. We manage it every week. Also, we picked places that we want to put our -- our resources in, I think we spent $600 million between -- between R&D and capitalized software and $140 million or so in acquisitions we did. So, we're investing back in our business, and we think that there is tremendous opportunity for us and we think we have some very large competitors, but that just aren't going to be able to keep up. We think, over 2021 goals, in 2022, we are going to continue to execute on a much higher level than our competitors.\nAlex Kramm: Okay, great. And then secondly, quick one, I think the buybacks were pretty soft in the fourth quarter, is that just because you were looking at deals and maybe also your cash balance is fairly low I think, so. So just have to step back or -- or where do they come from? And what's your expectations for 2021? I mean you accelerated nicely in 2020, so that's still pretty focused on repurchases all else equal?\nBill Stone: Well, again, we try to allocate our capital as best we can. And obviously, we think -- we think our stock is -- is certainly not overvalued. So, we look at that somewhat fondly, but it's not our first choice. You know and even as we buy any, if we buy more than we did in 2020, it would not surprise me, but I don't believe that we will probably spend more than we pay down debt. So obviously, if we do acquisitions, the interest rates stay where they are, we'll probably use a lot of debt on acquisitions. So, we generate a ton of cash, we generated a ton of cash in January, we'll generate ton of cash throughout the year. And we hopefully, we'll use it wisely for the best-in-class .\nAlex Kramm: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thank you so much for taking my questions. My first is for Bill. Bill, I'm wondering if you have any perspective on the higher trading volumes and volatility related to retail flows in the equity markets and how, if at all in any way, they have impacted parts of your business, maybe the health of fund admin clients or anything else worth noting? And Bill, I know you've been around long enough to see just about everything, curios if you have any perspective on this force in the market. And if in any way it's an opportunity for SS&C?\nBill Stone: Well I've -- You know, me and Moses have been around for quite a while, Brad, as you well know. So, if -- as I look back on my 400 years in the business, Yeah, you know these things happen, right. They get -- they get to be bubbles and when you start taking technology and spreading it around the world and then allow people to collaborate, as always, you know it's difficult for the regulators to be able to manage all of the various schemes, so to speak, that people can deploy to drive up stocks or drive down stocks. And so I think -- I think the regulators will catch up and I think that this will be another thing that isn't much different than in year 2000 and how many eyeballs are looking at your screen, since. And so, I think that the drive up on some of these very well-known -- very well-known stocks, I think is probably a little bit a bubble, maybe more than a little bit, but I don't know about where we would step and how it is as an advantage for us, other than our Regulatory Services business that can help our clients see insight into that and then our Algorithmics business where we have an awful lot of quarks that are constantly looking at this stuff, so we can give our clients insights into what's happening and I think that can be very valuable.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you, Bill. Makes perfect sense to me. I appreciate the thoughtful answer. Maybe for Rahul. Rahul in your prepared remarks you talked about a comprehensive solutions program under Eamonn Greaves, combining products and services. Just curious, what prompted this now, what's the opportunity really and with total respect, it sounds obvious. So, why wasn't this something you were already doing?\nRahul Kanwar: So, about a year ago and it's the end of fourth quarter of 2019, we put Eamonn in-charge of Global Sales. And his mandate was really to help us collaborate more effectively and more than collaborate, integrate, right. So that, if you could see a customer and a customer is a bank or an insurance company or a hedge fund manager, we're bringing together different parts of the organization and offering that comprehensive solution and the more we can do of that, the more strategic become for them, the more likely it is to buy bigger, right. So, just remember that we, as Bill pointed out, we bought DST as an Intralinks in 2018 and we're trying to sell things that work together. Right. So, it takes some time to integrate them, it takes some time to get the user interfaces and the functionality that they want and we feel like we're in a good place with that product offering, we're putting the right focus behind the sales and marketing of that, was the right move. So, I think where -- for what I think, things we've done all along, but we're off to a good start.\nBrad Zelnick: Makes sense. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Rahul, I just wanted to go back to a comment that you made on the DST. If I heard you right, the DST Financial could potentially grow 3.5% this year, in fiscal '21 at the midpoint. I just want to confirm if I heard that right. And then maybe just a question on that one is, obviously, that's pretty strong compared to the DST financial growth profile historically, what's really driving that strength, is that the new, -- there a couple of large deals that we won last year. Are those -- is the implementation really driving it? And then if you can maybe provide any incremental color within DST financial, where are you seeing pockets of strength or pockets of strong demand, any color will be helpful. Thanks.\nRahul Kanwar: Sure. So, we have at the midpoint, approximately 3.5% or so, organic growth. The Retirement business, where we've talked about a number of large deals and done some press releases on them, is clearly one of the bright spots. We're also seen good strength in our UK-based Wealth and Insurance Services business and really across all of DST. We've been working hard for since 2018 really, focused on the sales efforts there, focused on the product development efforts there, focused on digital and web portals and different ways in which our end customers can interact with their clients, and that's what they deem most valuable, we're starting to see some signs that the work we've done is paying off, and we're pretty bullish on what might happen with that business, not just in 2021, but beyond.\nAshish Sabadra: That's great, very helpful color. And maybe just a quick question on pricing in the Alternatives Fund Admin side, there was a pricing increase back in end of 2018 -- sorry, end of 2019 or early 2020. Are there opportunities for more annual price increases going forward, any thoughts on '21? Thanks.\nRahul Kanwar: So, we're doing and I think we said this last year, we really try to set this up as a price conversation that was going to happen once a year. Right. And it's been reasonable increases, that I think our customers, well nobody welcomes them, they understand where we're coming from. We're working our way through that process right now and it's going pretty well and we do expect it to have a positive impact on Alternatives, but really across our business.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful. Thanks and great and good quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon from Needham. Your line is open.\nMayank Tandon: Thank you. Good evening. Bill, just wanted to get a sense from you or maybe Rahul can chime in too. How should we think about the growth within the installed base, i.e., land and expand versus contribution from new logos? Have you got back to some level of normalcy in terms of organic trends across your portfolio of solutions?\nBill Stone: Mayank, such a very good question and it really is kind of at the core of what we're doing. We bought DST and closed in April of 2018. In 2020, DST clients represented 75 of our top 100 clients. And they're all the largest investment organizations in the world. And there are tremendous opportunity, right. But, there's a lot of work to do with DST and we've done a lot of work. You know, we've doubled EBITDA, I know it doesn't matter because -- it doesn't matter because our organic growth would go up, but our earnings won't weigh up, our cash wont weigh up, cash flow wont weigh up and -- and it gave us tremendous opportunity to drill into all of those great big clients and start showing them all of our opportunities. Algorithmics is a treasure trove of expertise, with a worldwide business. So, we have opportunities to go into these large organizations. And I think we just did a million-dollar deal with one of our clients on our new Blue Sky portal, you know and that makes it so easy for our clients to be able to comply with all the regulations in all 50 states, you know and it's a pain in the neck. The more things that we can take away from our clients that are a pain to them, the larger our land and expand process goes. And that's why we've put Eamonn in-charge. I think several others of our top sales executives are also now drilling into all of our different opportunities that our client base -- our 18,000 clients. But you know you can't go into a place as large as DST and start just swinging a sledge hammer, you got to go in there, you got to understand and you've got to be willing to except the slings and arrows of low Street for a while, but there is no way we'd be at without -- without those three acquisitions and guys like Mike Sleightholme and Kevin Rafferty and John Tevoy and Danny Domasco and Tory Dorigatti and a whole bunch of other people like at DST, have done a great job and I think that those people understand, that SS&C likes beyond the gas pedal and this break stuff is not in our DNA. But you know, they had a lot of breaks -- lots of breaks, so we had to break those breaks and on the gas pedal, but remember, it's $2 billion in revenue. $2 billion, now that it starts growing, that's going to really put some wind in our sails and allow us, if we execute, and I believe we are executing, it's going to get better and better and best and that's why you see the changes we've made, the bundling of our products and you know the -- the improved outlook that we have, because of all the work we've done. When a stone cutter swings that axe at a piece of granite, it doesn't crack the first time, it might crack the 100th time. But something tells me, those 99 swings he made before or she made, before it cracked, had an impact on it cracking. And that's the same thing we've done. We know it's granite, we know we've got to swing, we know we got to stay focused, we know we got to push, that's not easy for everybody. That's what we do. That's how we manage. That's how we generate cash flow. That's how we generate earnings. And it used to be earnings and cash flow, were really important, now, it's kind of important, but they're not as important as organic revenue growth, but we did the things we think were necessary in order to set the platform to get organic revenue.\nMayank Tandon: Great, that's very helpful perspective. Thank you for that. And, if I can just follow-up, briefly, has the pandemic and the effect of that, flushed out some of the competition in the fragmented portions of your markets? In other words, are you now even stronger in some of the segments where you might have had more competition from some of the startups and smaller players that are not as well funded?\nBill Stone: Well, I think actually I think we're going to do better against the larger ones. The biggest ones. I think the use of third parties in India has not been very effective for an awful lot of very large places and we use our own people, almost 100% and it's taken us a year, two years, 2.5 years, to bring the whole thing under two, but -- but we had I think 1600 - 1800 contractors from Syntel that worked for DST, that we've now completely re-badged. They now work for us, right. And we have less and less outsider's inside SS&C and we operate better, when we're in charge of people's raises, peoples' bonuses, peoples' promotions, people's careers and that's been a really big -- a really big help for our -- for our business. And Sunil over in India has done a great job for us and I think we're going to continue to -- to execute. And I think we're going to continue to -- to surprise positively. And Rahul, what do you think?\nRahul Kanwar: Well, I would just -- coming back to what you said about customer satisfaction and net promoter scores, we -- we've seen really levels of accolades from our customers throughout the, both large and small customers. And we do think that this has been a disruptive time for many in the marketplace. So, relatively placed, we're getting stronger on an absolute basis but also relative to others, equal or may be well positioned going forward.\nMayank Tandon: Great, thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nJackson Ader: Great, thanks for taking my questions guys. Bill, the first one for you on main reasons you win and lose, you're talking about big at the high end or low end of the guidance range just depends on whether you actually went on these deals or not. And I'm curious, the reason that you win and the reasons that you lose, have they changed over the last -- over the last couple of years? Just curious on your thoughts?\nBill Stone: Well, I think -- I think you know for a number of the businesses that we inherited with DST, they hadn't had a win in a number of years, right. So, changing that entire attitude, you've got to believe you can win, if you're going to win, right. So, your prospects are known immediately, if you're not confident. So, knocking that insecurity out of people is not easy, it's not comfortable for people. But that's who we are. You know, let's get at it. You know, since we've built software and whether that's a fraud, waste, and abuse app, that we built for -- for SS&C Health or whether that's the improvements that we've made to the -- to the -- the transfer agency business that's a large business for us or what we've done in the Retirement business. So first, you have to have a superior product, then you have to have a very trained workforce, right, so that they can implement and you have to have a knowledgeable marketing team that can market it and you have to have a great sales force, so as I've said many times, right, we -- we need a sales team every week, some of these prices we bought didn't meet accept every month. So, there is a big difference in -- in the culture and in the drive and you know and again, you have to recognize that we did $1.184 billion in cash flow in 2020. In 2017, we did about 400 million, so we've tripled our cash flow and again, that's a very positive thing, it gives us lots of resources to invest in training and education and more technology. We've hired some great people that have done some great work for us. You know, Anthony Caiafa, John Bellone, Jason White, all kinds of people who have done just a great jobs for us and I think that's going to continue, because they like winning. They get paid more when they win, right. So, I think that's been the major drive, the major reasons why we win, is it's more organized, Eamonn is doing a great job getting it more organized than it was. And -- and we're competitive and we're not going to just sit back and not go after our competitors' clients, directly, you know and they don't like it, so, that's fine. That's the nature of competition.\nJackson Ader: Great. Yeah, I appreciate the thoughts. What about the Link asset? What did you find really attractive about it and what are some of the main, main reasons that you kind of went through there?\nBill Stone: Well, I mean it's, I think it's a good business. So, we really like Australia as a market. We have done very well in Canada and we feel like we can replicate that in Australia, and we've got a nice business in Australia and we want to have a bigger outsourcing business in Australia and Link would have fit that bill. But there's a lot of work to do on Link and I believe that Link started their process, but we -- we have a lot of work on DST. We have lots of positive momentum as you know on this call and we didn't really want to, you know have another situation where I got to tell you guys, could just turn it over to -- your cage you know and so we decided that that really didn't fit with what we wanted to do and so and so we were through, it's still a good company. I think they will do fine but -- but it wasn't something that we wanted to -- we wanted to tackle right now.\nJackson Ader: Okay, great. That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from DA Davidson. Your line is open.\nPeter Heckmann: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Just one maintenance question. I didn't hear you mention the pending Capita acquisition, is that deal still pending or has it closed?\nBill Stone: It is still pending.\nPatrick Pedonti: I think it's good for us though.\nPeter Heckmann: But it's not dead, at least theoretically. Are you still pursuing the close?\nBill Stone: Yeah, we had one -- one large client at Capita that was not going to fit in quick with that acquisition and they had to find alternative. But we believe that has been rectified and we would expect -- expect it to close in the next 60 - 90 days and, but we have expected that a couple of times in the past. So -- So we want to -- we want to make sure, it's not that big of an acquisition anyway.\nPeter Heckmann: Right, right. Okay and then just in terms when we're looking out over the next couple of years, could you identify any pending regulations, kind of like a see saw whether it's in the US or globally, that you think can serve as demand drivers for -- for spend or upgrade activity, anything out there that we should be monitoring?\nBill Stone: Well, I mean obviously you have a new, a new administration in United States and it's going to be much more active in Financial Services. I'm going to view Financial Services as a -- as a money pot for taxes and so going to be regulation and no different than Form PF and other things that came out in the 2012 - 2014 timeframe. And so we would expect that it's going to be, I'm guessing it will be pretty similar from what it was 2008 - 2016 and -- and there will be, there will be opportunities to help our clients meet those new regulations, those new tax requirements in as cost effective way as possible.\nPeter Heckmann: Got it, got it. Okay. If I could just sneak in one more. There was a joint venture announced by a number of Financial Services companies, Day 3, PIMCO, Man Group and it looked like they were going to be focusing on business process outsourcing for the fund industry. Is that something that's on your radar? And do you think that will be something that would be potentially competing with any operations of SS&C or perhaps DST?\nBill Stone: Well, I think those are large sophisticated RF companies with a lot of great people and -- and I guess is there is probably a little bit of politics in every one of those places. So, when they all get together, might be like the United Nations. So -- so we'll have to see what happens with -- what happens with that. We're well aware, but we're also executing on our plan and now, hopefully, we'll see them in our rear view mirror.\nPeter Heckmann: Fair enough. I appreciate it, Bill. Thanks.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Michael Young from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nMichael Young: Hey, thanks for the question. I wanted to just kind of ask maybe high level, coming from 2020 which was heavily impacted pandemic year, to some hopes of reopening this year, could you just maybe give some color on the conversations with clients and how they've trended and could there be sort of a backlog of activity as people kind of refocus on operating core businesses in 2021? Just any color on that would be helpful.\nBill Stone: Well, I think you know as you well know, right, when you have a crisis such as this, the rapidity of change probably goes up tenfold, so companies that would have never believed they could operate from a remote, now operate from remote. And I think that it's going to change part of them. So how we all execute on our strategy use and how we deploy our greatest asset, obviously is our people and keeping them safe is paramount. There is going to be a lot of things that are going to be important that we -- that we focus on and -- and I think obviously you guys are our recent merger of two large banking organizations and my guess is that, there's a lot of change going on at Truist. And you have a no major acquisition during pandemic. So, there is added impetus to streamline your operations, making this as efficient as possible. Make sure you have redundancy, cyber security is a very big deal. And I think that we need to be cognizant of what is -- what is out there. And we need to be prudent, when we know, we need to act quickly, but being precipitous seems to me to be a poor strategy.\nMichael Young: Okay. And my second question, I just wanted to follow up on a few of your comments, I think you've kind of highlighted, how the markets are more eager and revenue growth versus good stable cash flow businesses. Is there any desire with either your next M&A deal or just kind of how you're managing internally to try to ramp up the revenue growth piece of the business, as opposed to just cash flow?\nBill Stone: We're trying, I would tell you that our focus is probably -- we're not going to forget about cash. We're not going to forget about earnings, but our focus is on growing revenue. And anybody who has any conversations with me knows exactly what I'm talking about or any conversation with Patrick or any conversation with Rahul, or any conversation with Eamonn or Justine or anyone else in the company. Everybody knows, it's revenue. Now you can't pigeon hole everything, you got to make sure what its, you know, everybody admires Jeff Bezos and he is apparently didn't earn revenue growth. And it's admirable, but not everybody has -- has an Amazon business. So we need to be prudent, we're not going to go buy up 100,000, 200,000 square feet of office space in New York and London, in Paris and Frankfurt and other places, you know, because we think that would be a poor use of our -- of our cash and our -- you know, not that we don't have strong cash and not that we probably couldn't afford it. We probably could, but we're not Google, we don't have more money than most nations, we're going to be prudent, we're going to think and we're going to make sure our people are safe and they're not coming back into the offices and until -- until we can make sure that that environment is safe for them and -- and we're ready. So, I repeat, that's how we're trying to operate in a way we're very focused on revenue growth. It's a little more difficult, getting a large scale licenses when you don't get in person meetings, so, but we're working at it, we win some deals and we're win. And like I said, the Funds and Services business has been strong Intralinks has kind of very, very full pipeline and Ken Bisconti and Bob Petrocchi are doing a great job there and Petrocchi and -- are doing a great job there, and I think that our opportunities are greater than they've ever been. But those are opportunities to kind of catch the ball to go to the goal line.\nMichael Young: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from -- from the line of Chris Donat from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nChristopher Donat: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Bill, I wanted to ask one question about the Redemption Indicator that we see for GlobeOp and that January was the lowest number on record since 2008. Do you think that's mostly market forces or is there anything changing in the competitive landscape that's keeping Redemptions from -- from leaving SS&C?\nBill Stone: I mean, I think that we have really blue chip roster of -- of funds. But that being said, it's probably a heavy, heavy dose of what's happening in the market. I mean if you look at, at the amount of assets going into private equity and real estate, private credit and hedge funds, I think you see that that people are starving for -- for return, starving for income and they're not finding it in corporate bonds or our government bonds for sure. So I think that -- that people redeem either when they have a life event like buying a house or our retiring or something or that they have an alternate place to put their money. And if they don't have an alternate place to put their money, they tend to stay intact. And I think the hedge fund industry in particular and the other ones, the real estate industry as well as investment industry as well as the private equity industry, has learned to communicate with their investors and that communication is paramount. And again, that's something that SS&C is very well positioned and able to help our customers communicate with their customers, with their investors. And I think that's another reason why the Redemption Indicator remained historically low.\nChristopher Donat: Okay, thanks for that. And then, Patrick, one question about guidance and well for the fourth quarter you commented that there was less travel and less usage of contractors in the fourth quarter, are those two things that you would expect to stay low through the remainder of 2021? Or do you expect travel and contractor usage to increase kind of over the course of the years, as things get to some level of new normal?\nPatrick Pedonti: Yeah. The contract reduction is through the fact that we moved the India contractors to in-house employees. So, that will not be a problem for 2021. And on travel, I think basically we've assumed that travel expenses won't be a heck of a lot different than Q1 and most of Q2 and then gradually start increasing in the third and fourth quarter, but not be back to pre-pandemic levels. So it's kind of the assumption we've made.\nChristopher Donat: Got it. Thanks very much, Patrick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open\nJames Faucette: Hey, thanks. Just a couple of quick questions for me to follow up on previous questions and answers. First on DST, I think you made a comment around some incremental work or improvement on DST that you're working. I'm just wondering if you can touch on that, first of all.\nPatrick Pedonti: Well, again, I'll take 30 seconds and then give it to Rahul. But we have made a lot of changes, like flight owners made a lot of changes. You know Nick Wright took over in at the end of June last year and he's done a great job for us. He's based in London. And Kevin Rafferty came in, and he's running our Retirement Solutions business. And he is doing it with John Eli and they're both doing a great, great job for us. We have a -- our focus on that business. So, we've made a number of changes, Danny, we talked about Danny DelMastro and Tori Dargati running on our Healthcare business and they bought it up to quite of increased level of focus and intensity and I believe that will pay off. Danny took over, I think maybe be September or maybe we might have in August last year and so we made a lot of changes and the sales forces is now reporting up through Eamonn as a global and Mike has taken Rob Stone and some other top sales executives that we have and slotted them into the DST business.  a bunch of others that are really top-flight people and know how we operate, how we prepare and how we show our wares to our various -- various prospects. Would you have anything else, Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: Well, the only -- the only thing I would add is in addition to the sales focus and just overall more attention to the speed at which we execute and making sure that there is tangible things that we're trying to do and we're all marching and with some just some pace to it. We're also really focused on product development and innovation. So, a lot of our hires even below the senior executives that you've -- that we've mentioned, have been in folks that are bringing in new technologies, whether that's digital, which a lot of our clients are looking for or things we can do with artificial intelligence and machine learning, we've made an acquisition at Vidado there's others. So, we're giving that sales force more tools to be able to differentiate themselves from our competitors and that's helping.\nJames Faucette: Got it, got it. And then, I appreciate that. And then, Bill, you started off talking about acquisitions and discipline and look, clearly you've built and established an incredibly strong reputation of being able to find the right things at the right time and under the right circumstances, what kind of moves your guardrails, if you will, of discipline around and I guess I'm thinking about the current environment and maybe more generally, how you think this ultimately -- how the current environment ultimately plays out and what do you at SS&C, have to do to be prepared to take advantage of, when things do change and start to adjust?\nBill Stone: You know James, you know it -- again it, just have to do the work, right. I mean you have to have people find businesses that we can -- we can ultimately buy. We have -- have looked at making a number of different investments to get to know -- get to know businesses better and then -- then see if we can -- can help them grow and then -- and then ultimately acquire them. We have to stay close to the private equity industry. We have to stay close to large scale financial institutions that want to get rid of divisions or want a joint venture with us in ways that they can really improve their margin profile. So, there is a number of those kinds of things that I think are the -- are the path to very accretive acquisitions, that -- that drive revenue growth. But it's work, right. I mean it's looking at a lot of deals, it's having discipline about it. You know it's not -- not turning this into -- the focus isn't on our business, the focus is on what we could do to buy additional businesses. We have a lot of businesses. We have 18,000 clients. We have tremendous up-sell and cross-sell opportunities, right. We have tremendous development team, the housing, the developers right. We need to be able to build product, deliver product, market product, sell product, raise prices, right. We need to create this entire environment where we're the best, right. So when we went into Fund Administration in 2002, we didn't have a dollar in AUA. Now we have $2 trillion, it's the same thing, execute and then you can bring in places like at Eisner fast, where we get people like Rahul Kanwar, Rene Moody and Carl, Chris Madpak and a bunch of others, that add quality and capability and breadth and depth and you keep marching through and now that we're the largest as a Fund Administrator, both in hedge and private equity and we're moving up fast to real estate, Brigesh Maldiv  has done a great job and we just got a lot of great people and you know, there is also a lot of work to do with deploying $8.3 billion in 2018.\nJames Faucette: Thanks a lot, Bill. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Thanks for taking the question guys. Just following up on the comment about the focus around revenues and growth. Can you talk a little bit about maybe how pricing fits into that strategy in terms of how you think about it on an annual basis? And then if there is any impact that we should be thinking about from a COVID perspective this year in the sense that maybe there is clients that have asked you to hold off on pricing increases and any color you can provide there would be helpful.\nBill Stone: Rahul, you want that one?\nRahul Kanwar: Yeah. So, thus far, in the annual pricing conversations that we've had, it really hasn't been that different than it was last year and now this was a pretty new process for us, last year was the first time, but the conversations have gone well and there are, as I mentioned earlier, we are going to be reasonable and to the extent that we have a customer that has some constraints, obviously we're going to respect that and -- and try to make it work, to the satisfaction of both SS&C and that customer, but they've been going pretty well.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then just a quick, I guess a modeling question, just can you remind us of the expected impact on revenues in 2021 for the DST clients that were terminated pre-acquisition?\nRahul Kanwar: It's -- it's $25 million for the full year.\nSurinder Thind: Okay, thank you. Thanks guys.\nOperator: No further questions at this time. I will now turn back the call over to Mr. Bill Stone.\nBill Stone: Thank you. Again, thanks everybody for -- for your thoughtful questions and -- and again, we're going to execute. And I look forward to talking to you in late April or early May. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you again for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Stone",
            "content": "Thanks, Justine. And thanks everyone for joining. Our results for the fourth quarter were $1.206 billion. In adjusted revenue, it's down 0.5% and $1.13 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is up almost 5%. For the full year, we had $4.681 billion in adjusted revenue, up 0.3% and $4.30 of adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 12.3%. Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $475.8 million for the fourth quarter and our adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin was 39.4%. Our Q4 adjusted organic revenue was down 2% and for full year or 2020 organic revenue was down 0.5%. As expected, we had weakness in our large license software business in the fourth quarter. But our alternatives business are interlinked in our ads business grew nicely and the DST business saw improvement from the previous quarter. Operating cash flow was one $1.84.7 million -- $1.1847 billion for the 12 months ended December 31st, 2020, up 10% if you exclude the one-time $250 million upfront license payment paid in the second half of 2019. $1,184.7 million represents a 103% cash conversion rate on our adjusted net income of $1,146.8 billion. Sorry about that. Thanks, Patrick. We continue to operate in the global pandemic. 99% of our global workforce is still remote and business travel and in-person sales meetings are essentially non-existent. Over the past 11 months, we have learned how to operate under these circumstances. Utilizing video conferencing, web-based marketing and promoting the power of our business model and reliability of our people and technology. As you can tell from this call, we are optimistic. We believe our performance during this pandemic will pay dividends well into the future -- well into the future. We will now open it up for questions. For the fourth quarter, total -- total adjusted organic growth was down 2%. The Alternatives Fund Administration business was up 5.5% and DST, we can provide you kind of a breakout between the two groups. The Financial Services group was down 1.1% and the Healthcare group was up 3.1%. I think that combined to be down 0.3% for the full year. And Intralinks was up 3.8% Well, we constantly look at -- at acquisitions and we're disciplined about it. Obviously, we deployed $8.3 billion in 2018 and that bought DST as and Intralinks. We spent, I think a about $138 million in 2020, which was less than we would have expected, but -- but we looked at lots of things and obviously in the public domain, you know that we looked at Link Administration down in Australia. So, we're disciplined about it and we're quite aware that all the questions that we get on -- on the conference calls and from our shareholders, are organic revenue growth or unit. So, we want to make sure that we focus on our organic revenue growth and as Rahul had detailed in his remarks, we've made lots of changes. All of our businesses are getting better. All of them. Because if they don't get better, we get different executives and that's how we operate. So, we're very optimistic about where we're going, about generating tons of cash, paying down a bunch of debt, looking at great acquisitions and earning more money for our shareholders and then deciding how we're going to allocate our capital, whether that's going to be on acquisitions, which is generally our first choice. But we also like to pay down debt and we also like to evaluate buying back our shares. So, I don't think our -- our business plan, our strategy has changed. I believe that what we're doing is executing and I think that's what we'll continue. So, there is a lot of stuff for sale, and you see stuff getting -- getting purchased all time. And the question becomes, is this -- is that strategic for us. Will it drive our organic revenue growth and what is it going to do over the long term. So, those are the criteria that we have and I think we will probably buy some things in 2021, but as usual, we'll be disciplined about it and we are going into 2021 with some optimism. I'll give that a quick shot and then Rahul can comment. But, we have a pretty full pipeline. We have large deals, we have what we believe are -- are a number of large deals that we hope to close this quarter. We have a very reasonable January and I believe that we will continue to execute and we're seeing some strength across our different businesses. I think our indicators that we have in Intralinks are all as strong as they've ever been. I think we have a pipeline and gaining rhythm we've ever had and some services, the hedge fund industry has proven to be quite resilient and I think will continue to be, as more and more private assets become the most attractive place to put money, whether that's private equity or private credit or real estate. I think that SS&C is well positioned to do well there. And I think that the DST business is getting stronger. Our Retirements business grew very nicely in Q4 and we expect it to grow very nicely throughout 2021. We have some challenges in our Healthcare business, but, Daniel DelMastro and his team are doing a good job and they are very focused. And so, with that I'll let Rahul take a crack. No, again, right. The -- the when you, when -- when you're selling $20 million to $50 million deals for a year or $10 million to $25 million deals for the -- for the year, multi-year deals, if we win them, we will be at that 4% and if we don't win them, we will be closer to that 0%. But we're confident that we are going to win a lot more than we lose, we're going to continue to perform. The feedback from our clients has been tremendous, based on -- on the work that our entire staff is put in and the attention to detail that we have delivered. In places like Advent and others, that do Net Promoter Scores, highest it's ever been, customer satisfaction, as we track is very high. And our retention rates, will stick at 96% or so. And so I think that we have a lot of optimism that we can perform, you know we got to win. You got to throw passes, somebody has got to catch them and they got to go across goal line. I mean, that's the nature of the beast. And I don't know if Rahul, you would have anything else to add to that. Well, I think, Alex, we would say that we manage, we cut where we have to, and you know, but we have a large workforce, we have almost 25,000 people. And there is opportunities everywhere, right and we have to get more efficient. And if you get you know 5% efficiency, then on 25,000 people, that's 1200 people I think, right. So, we need to drive revenue in order to be able to continue to grow our workforce and continue to -- to increase our margins, and so that's what everyone at SS&C is focused on and -- and we manage it. We manage it every week. Also, we picked places that we want to put our -- our resources in, I think we spent $600 million between -- between R&D and capitalized software and $140 million or so in acquisitions we did. So, we're investing back in our business, and we think that there is tremendous opportunity for us and we think we have some very large competitors, but that just aren't going to be able to keep up. We think, over 2021 goals, in 2022, we are going to continue to execute on a much higher level than our competitors. Well, again, we try to allocate our capital as best we can. And obviously, we think -- we think our stock is -- is certainly not overvalued. So, we look at that somewhat fondly, but it's not our first choice. You know and even as we buy any, if we buy more than we did in 2020, it would not surprise me, but I don't believe that we will probably spend more than we pay down debt. So obviously, if we do acquisitions, the interest rates stay where they are, we'll probably use a lot of debt on acquisitions. So, we generate a ton of cash, we generated a ton of cash in January, we'll generate ton of cash throughout the year. And we hopefully, we'll use it wisely for the best-in-class . Well I've -- You know, me and Moses have been around for quite a while, Brad, as you well know. So, if -- as I look back on my 400 years in the business, Yeah, you know these things happen, right. They get -- they get to be bubbles and when you start taking technology and spreading it around the world and then allow people to collaborate, as always, you know it's difficult for the regulators to be able to manage all of the various schemes, so to speak, that people can deploy to drive up stocks or drive down stocks. And so I think -- I think the regulators will catch up and I think that this will be another thing that isn't much different than in year 2000 and how many eyeballs are looking at your screen, since. And so, I think that the drive up on some of these very well-known -- very well-known stocks, I think is probably a little bit a bubble, maybe more than a little bit, but I don't know about where we would step and how it is as an advantage for us, other than our Regulatory Services business that can help our clients see insight into that and then our Algorithmics business where we have an awful lot of quarks that are constantly looking at this stuff, so we can give our clients insights into what's happening and I think that can be very valuable. Mayank, such a very good question and it really is kind of at the core of what we're doing. We bought DST and closed in April of 2018. In 2020, DST clients represented 75 of our top 100 clients. And they're all the largest investment organizations in the world. And there are tremendous opportunity, right. But, there's a lot of work to do with DST and we've done a lot of work. You know, we've doubled EBITDA, I know it doesn't matter because -- it doesn't matter because our organic growth would go up, but our earnings won't weigh up, our cash wont weigh up, cash flow wont weigh up and -- and it gave us tremendous opportunity to drill into all of those great big clients and start showing them all of our opportunities. Algorithmics is a treasure trove of expertise, with a worldwide business. So, we have opportunities to go into these large organizations. And I think we just did a million-dollar deal with one of our clients on our new Blue Sky portal, you know and that makes it so easy for our clients to be able to comply with all the regulations in all 50 states, you know and it's a pain in the neck. The more things that we can take away from our clients that are a pain to them, the larger our land and expand process goes. And that's why we've put Eamonn in-charge. I think several others of our top sales executives are also now drilling into all of our different opportunities that our client base -- our 18,000 clients. But you know you can't go into a place as large as DST and start just swinging a sledge hammer, you got to go in there, you got to understand and you've got to be willing to except the slings and arrows of low Street for a while, but there is no way we'd be at without -- without those three acquisitions and guys like Mike Sleightholme and Kevin Rafferty and John Tevoy and Danny Domasco and Tory Dorigatti and a whole bunch of other people like at DST, have done a great job and I think that those people understand, that SS&C likes beyond the gas pedal and this break stuff is not in our DNA. But you know, they had a lot of breaks -- lots of breaks, so we had to break those breaks and on the gas pedal, but remember, it's $2 billion in revenue. $2 billion, now that it starts growing, that's going to really put some wind in our sails and allow us, if we execute, and I believe we are executing, it's going to get better and better and best and that's why you see the changes we've made, the bundling of our products and you know the -- the improved outlook that we have, because of all the work we've done. When a stone cutter swings that axe at a piece of granite, it doesn't crack the first time, it might crack the 100th time. But something tells me, those 99 swings he made before or she made, before it cracked, had an impact on it cracking. And that's the same thing we've done. We know it's granite, we know we've got to swing, we know we got to stay focused, we know we got to push, that's not easy for everybody. That's what we do. That's how we manage. That's how we generate cash flow. That's how we generate earnings. And it used to be earnings and cash flow, were really important, now, it's kind of important, but they're not as important as organic revenue growth, but we did the things we think were necessary in order to set the platform to get organic revenue. Well, I think actually I think we're going to do better against the larger ones. The biggest ones. I think the use of third parties in India has not been very effective for an awful lot of very large places and we use our own people, almost 100% and it's taken us a year, two years, 2.5 years, to bring the whole thing under two, but -- but we had I think 1600 - 1800 contractors from Syntel that worked for DST, that we've now completely re-badged. They now work for us, right. And we have less and less outsider's inside SS&C and we operate better, when we're in charge of people's raises, peoples' bonuses, peoples' promotions, people's careers and that's been a really big -- a really big help for our -- for our business. And Sunil over in India has done a great job for us and I think we're going to continue to -- to execute. And I think we're going to continue to -- to surprise positively. And Rahul, what do you think? Well, I think -- I think you know for a number of the businesses that we inherited with DST, they hadn't had a win in a number of years, right. So, changing that entire attitude, you've got to believe you can win, if you're going to win, right. So, your prospects are known immediately, if you're not confident. So, knocking that insecurity out of people is not easy, it's not comfortable for people. But that's who we are. You know, let's get at it. You know, since we've built software and whether that's a fraud, waste, and abuse app, that we built for -- for SS&C Health or whether that's the improvements that we've made to the -- to the -- the transfer agency business that's a large business for us or what we've done in the Retirement business. So first, you have to have a superior product, then you have to have a very trained workforce, right, so that they can implement and you have to have a knowledgeable marketing team that can market it and you have to have a great sales force, so as I've said many times, right, we -- we need a sales team every week, some of these prices we bought didn't meet accept every month. So, there is a big difference in -- in the culture and in the drive and you know and again, you have to recognize that we did $1.184 billion in cash flow in 2020. In 2017, we did about 400 million, so we've tripled our cash flow and again, that's a very positive thing, it gives us lots of resources to invest in training and education and more technology. We've hired some great people that have done some great work for us. You know, Anthony Caiafa, John Bellone, Jason White, all kinds of people who have done just a great jobs for us and I think that's going to continue, because they like winning. They get paid more when they win, right. So, I think that's been the major drive, the major reasons why we win, is it's more organized, Eamonn is doing a great job getting it more organized than it was. And -- and we're competitive and we're not going to just sit back and not go after our competitors' clients, directly, you know and they don't like it, so, that's fine. That's the nature of competition. Well, I mean it's, I think it's a good business. So, we really like Australia as a market. We have done very well in Canada and we feel like we can replicate that in Australia, and we've got a nice business in Australia and we want to have a bigger outsourcing business in Australia and Link would have fit that bill. But there's a lot of work to do on Link and I believe that Link started their process, but we -- we have a lot of work on DST. We have lots of positive momentum as you know on this call and we didn't really want to, you know have another situation where I got to tell you guys, could just turn it over to -- your cage you know and so we decided that that really didn't fit with what we wanted to do and so and so we were through, it's still a good company. I think they will do fine but -- but it wasn't something that we wanted to -- we wanted to tackle right now. It is still pending. Yeah, we had one -- one large client at Capita that was not going to fit in quick with that acquisition and they had to find alternative. But we believe that has been rectified and we would expect -- expect it to close in the next 60 - 90 days and, but we have expected that a couple of times in the past. So -- So we want to -- we want to make sure, it's not that big of an acquisition anyway. Well, I mean obviously you have a new, a new administration in United States and it's going to be much more active in Financial Services. I'm going to view Financial Services as a -- as a money pot for taxes and so going to be regulation and no different than Form PF and other things that came out in the 2012 - 2014 timeframe. And so we would expect that it's going to be, I'm guessing it will be pretty similar from what it was 2008 - 2016 and -- and there will be, there will be opportunities to help our clients meet those new regulations, those new tax requirements in as cost effective way as possible. Well, I think those are large sophisticated RF companies with a lot of great people and -- and I guess is there is probably a little bit of politics in every one of those places. So, when they all get together, might be like the United Nations. So -- so we'll have to see what happens with -- what happens with that. We're well aware, but we're also executing on our plan and now, hopefully, we'll see them in our rear view mirror. Well, I think you know as you well know, right, when you have a crisis such as this, the rapidity of change probably goes up tenfold, so companies that would have never believed they could operate from a remote, now operate from remote. And I think that it's going to change part of them. So how we all execute on our strategy use and how we deploy our greatest asset, obviously is our people and keeping them safe is paramount. There is going to be a lot of things that are going to be important that we -- that we focus on and -- and I think obviously you guys are our recent merger of two large banking organizations and my guess is that, there's a lot of change going on at Truist. And you have a no major acquisition during pandemic. So, there is added impetus to streamline your operations, making this as efficient as possible. Make sure you have redundancy, cyber security is a very big deal. And I think that we need to be cognizant of what is -- what is out there. And we need to be prudent, when we know, we need to act quickly, but being precipitous seems to me to be a poor strategy. We're trying, I would tell you that our focus is probably -- we're not going to forget about cash. We're not going to forget about earnings, but our focus is on growing revenue. And anybody who has any conversations with me knows exactly what I'm talking about or any conversation with Patrick or any conversation with Rahul, or any conversation with Eamonn or Justine or anyone else in the company. Everybody knows, it's revenue. Now you can't pigeon hole everything, you got to make sure what its, you know, everybody admires Jeff Bezos and he is apparently didn't earn revenue growth. And it's admirable, but not everybody has -- has an Amazon business. So we need to be prudent, we're not going to go buy up 100,000, 200,000 square feet of office space in New York and London, in Paris and Frankfurt and other places, you know, because we think that would be a poor use of our -- of our cash and our -- you know, not that we don't have strong cash and not that we probably couldn't afford it. We probably could, but we're not Google, we don't have more money than most nations, we're going to be prudent, we're going to think and we're going to make sure our people are safe and they're not coming back into the offices and until -- until we can make sure that that environment is safe for them and -- and we're ready. So, I repeat, that's how we're trying to operate in a way we're very focused on revenue growth. It's a little more difficult, getting a large scale licenses when you don't get in person meetings, so, but we're working at it, we win some deals and we're win. And like I said, the Funds and Services business has been strong Intralinks has kind of very, very full pipeline and Ken Bisconti and Bob Petrocchi are doing a great job there and Petrocchi and -- are doing a great job there, and I think that our opportunities are greater than they've ever been. But those are opportunities to kind of catch the ball to go to the goal line. I mean, I think that we have really blue chip roster of -- of funds. But that being said, it's probably a heavy, heavy dose of what's happening in the market. I mean if you look at, at the amount of assets going into private equity and real estate, private credit and hedge funds, I think you see that that people are starving for -- for return, starving for income and they're not finding it in corporate bonds or our government bonds for sure. So I think that -- that people redeem either when they have a life event like buying a house or our retiring or something or that they have an alternate place to put their money. And if they don't have an alternate place to put their money, they tend to stay intact. And I think the hedge fund industry in particular and the other ones, the real estate industry as well as investment industry as well as the private equity industry, has learned to communicate with their investors and that communication is paramount. And again, that's something that SS&C is very well positioned and able to help our customers communicate with their customers, with their investors. And I think that's another reason why the Redemption Indicator remained historically low. You know James, you know it -- again it, just have to do the work, right. I mean you have to have people find businesses that we can -- we can ultimately buy. We have -- have looked at making a number of different investments to get to know -- get to know businesses better and then -- then see if we can -- can help them grow and then -- and then ultimately acquire them. We have to stay close to the private equity industry. We have to stay close to large scale financial institutions that want to get rid of divisions or want a joint venture with us in ways that they can really improve their margin profile. So, there is a number of those kinds of things that I think are the -- are the path to very accretive acquisitions, that -- that drive revenue growth. But it's work, right. I mean it's looking at a lot of deals, it's having discipline about it. You know it's not -- not turning this into -- the focus isn't on our business, the focus is on what we could do to buy additional businesses. We have a lot of businesses. We have 18,000 clients. We have tremendous up-sell and cross-sell opportunities, right. We have tremendous development team, the housing, the developers right. We need to be able to build product, deliver product, market product, sell product, raise prices, right. We need to create this entire environment where we're the best, right. So when we went into Fund Administration in 2002, we didn't have a dollar in AUA. Now we have $2 trillion, it's the same thing, execute and then you can bring in places like at Eisner fast, where we get people like Rahul Kanwar, Rene Moody and Carl, Chris Madpak and a bunch of others, that add quality and capability and breadth and depth and you keep marching through and now that we're the largest as a Fund Administrator, both in hedge and private equity and we're moving up fast to real estate, Brigesh Maldiv  has done a great job and we just got a lot of great people and you know, there is also a lot of work to do with deploying $8.3 billion in 2018. Rahul, you want that one? Thank you. Again, thanks everybody for -- for your thoughtful questions and -- and again, we're going to execute. And I look forward to talking to you in late April or early May. Thanks."

On an adjusted basis, revenues were $1,206.1 million, including the impact of the adoption of the revenue standard 606 and acquired deferred revenue adjustments for acquisitions. Adjusted revenue was down 0.5%, adjusted operating income decreased 2.4% and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.13, a 4.6% increase over Q4 2019. Adjusted revenue decreased $6.1 million or 0.5% over Q4 '19. Our acquisitions contributed $27.4 million, foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $6 million or 0.5% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue decline on a constant currency basis, was 2% driven by weakness in the Advent, Institutional, Software Products and DST Financial Services. These were offset by strength in Fund Administration, Intralinks and the Eze business. And we had strong sequential growth in the DST Financial Services and Healthcare businesses over the third quarter. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $458.8 million, a decline of $12.2 million or 2.4% from the fourth quarter 2019. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $3.5 million on expenses in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins were 38.8%, compared to 38.0% in 2019. The expenses were driven by higher employee compensation and benefits, higher sales commissions and professional services and these expenses were partially offset by lower travel and contractor expenses. Adjusted EBITDA defined in Note 3 of our earnings release, was $475.8 million, or 39.4% of adjusted revenue. Net interest expense for the fourth quarter was $53.3 million and includes $3.4 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID. The average rate in the quarter for our amended credit facility and our senior notes was 2.99%, compared to 4.53% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and resulted in an interest expense decrease of $47.2 million or 47%. We recorded a GAAP tax provision of $37.7 million or, 16.1% of pre-tax income. Adjusted net income as defined in Note 4 of our earnings release, was $302.6 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.13. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares increased to $268.1 million from $266.7 million in Q3. The impact of the increase in the average share price and option exercises, was partially offset by share repurchases in the quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow as of December 31st, we had approximately $29.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $6.5 billion of gross debt for a net debt position of approximately $6.3 billion. Okay, thank you. Thank you. I think it's good for us though. Yeah. The contract reduction is through the fact that we moved the India contractors to in-house employees. So, that will not be a problem for 2021. And on travel, I think basically we've assumed that travel expenses won't be a heck of a lot different than Q1 and most of Q2 and then gradually start increasing in the third and fourth quarter, but not be back to pre-pandemic levels. So it's kind of the assumption we've made. Well, again, I'll take 30 seconds and then give it to Rahul. But we have made a lot of changes, like flight owners made a lot of changes. You know Nick Wright took over in at the end of June last year and he's done a great job for us. He's based in London. And Kevin Rafferty came in, and he's running our Retirement Solutions business. And he is doing it with John Eli and they're both doing a great, great job for us. We have a -- our focus on that business. So, we've made a number of changes, Danny, we talked about Danny DelMastro and Tori Dargati running on our Healthcare business and they bought it up to quite of increased level of focus and intensity and I believe that will pay off. Danny took over, I think maybe be September or maybe we might have in August last year and so we made a lot of changes and the sales forces is now reporting up through Eamonn as a global and Mike has taken Rob Stone and some other top sales executives that we have and slotted them into the DST business.  a bunch of others that are really top-flight people and know how we operate, how we prepare and how we show our wares to our various -- various prospects. Would you have anything else, Rahul?"

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. As you noted, we had a strong quarter with a broad-based lift in revenue from Q3, across many of our business lines. DST, SS&C Health, the Alternatives, Intralinks, Regulatory and Algorithmics, all posted improved performance in Q4. Our Alternatives business grew 5.5% in Q4 and 5.7% for the year. Clients remain optimistic about their growth outlook, which is reflected in our data, including the Capital Movement and other indices we publish. Bill mentioned the rapid adoption of Eze Eclipse in his earlier comments and in Q4, we launched the Eze app powered by Eclipse and made it available in iOS and Android app stores in November. User adoption and design collaboration for the apps' next phase have been strong. You know, I think the thing that I would add is, as time has passed in this pandemic -- pandemic, we have gotten more comfortable and our customers as prospects have gotten more comfortable, transacting over digital and virtual and we always had an element of that. But obviously, we've had to rely on it a lot more. So, we've seen our yield for virtual events and all the things that we do to get the pipeline go up pretty substantially. And we've also seen contract signings and things like that, which we're certainly slow at the start of this process, pick back up. So, we feel pretty good about the current state, it's better than it was three months ago and we think it's going to keep getting better throughout the course of the year. Just I guess on the second part of that, on DST in particular. So, to talk about the pieces that DST separately. The DST Financial Services business, which is really everything except Health, we're expecting to see low single-digit type growth, that's kind of what's been so at the midpoint, maybe something like 3.5% or something like that, and the Health business, as Bill mentioned, we do have some challenges, and we're still dealing with some COVID impacts and we expect that to be flat to slightly down for the year. So, about a year ago and it's the end of fourth quarter of 2019, we put Eamonn in-charge of Global Sales. And his mandate was really to help us collaborate more effectively and more than collaborate, integrate, right. So that, if you could see a customer and a customer is a bank or an insurance company or a hedge fund manager, we're bringing together different parts of the organization and offering that comprehensive solution and the more we can do of that, the more strategic become for them, the more likely it is to buy bigger, right. So, just remember that we, as Bill pointed out, we bought DST as an Intralinks in 2018 and we're trying to sell things that work together. Right. So, it takes some time to integrate them, it takes some time to get the user interfaces and the functionality that they want and we feel like we're in a good place with that product offering, we're putting the right focus behind the sales and marketing of that, was the right move. So, I think where -- for what I think, things we've done all along, but we're off to a good start. Sure. So, we have at the midpoint, approximately 3.5% or so, organic growth. The Retirement business, where we've talked about a number of large deals and done some press releases on them, is clearly one of the bright spots. We're also seen good strength in our UK-based Wealth and Insurance Services business and really across all of DST. We've been working hard for since 2018 really, focused on the sales efforts there, focused on the product development efforts there, focused on digital and web portals and different ways in which our end customers can interact with their clients, and that's what they deem most valuable, we're starting to see some signs that the work we've done is paying off, and we're pretty bullish on what might happen with that business, not just in 2021, but beyond. So, we're doing and I think we said this last year, we really try to set this up as a price conversation that was going to happen once a year. Right. And it's been reasonable increases, that I think our customers, well nobody welcomes them, they understand where we're coming from. We're working our way through that process right now and it's going pretty well and we do expect it to have a positive impact on Alternatives, but really across our business. Well, I would just -- coming back to what you said about customer satisfaction and net promoter scores, we -- we've seen really levels of accolades from our customers throughout the, both large and small customers. And we do think that this has been a disruptive time for many in the marketplace. So, relatively placed, we're getting stronger on an absolute basis but also relative to others, equal or may be well positioned going forward. Well, the only -- the only thing I would add is in addition to the sales focus and just overall more attention to the speed at which we execute and making sure that there is tangible things that we're trying to do and we're all marching and with some just some pace to it. We're also really focused on product development and innovation. So, a lot of our hires even below the senior executives that you've -- that we've mentioned, have been in folks that are bringing in new technologies, whether that's digital, which a lot of our clients are looking for or things we can do with artificial intelligence and machine learning, we've made an acquisition at Vidado there's others. So, we're giving that sales force more tools to be able to differentiate themselves from our competitors and that's helping. Yeah. So, thus far, in the annual pricing conversations that we've had, it really hasn't been that different than it was last year and now this was a pretty new process for us, last year was the first time, but the conversations have gone well and there are, as I mentioned earlier, we are going to be reasonable and to the extent that we have a customer that has some constraints, obviously we're going to respect that and -- and try to make it work, to the satisfaction of both SS&C and that customer, but they've been going pretty well. It's -- it's $25 million for the full year."

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand the conference over to your speaker today, Justine Stone. Please go ahead. \nJustine Stone: Hi, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for our Q3 2020 earnings call. I'm Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C Technologies. \n With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Pedonti, our Chief Financial Officer. \n Before we get started, we need to review the safe harbor statement. Please note that various remarks we make today about future expectations, plans and prospects, including the financial outlook we provide, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigations Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and can also be accessed on our website. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of today, October 28, 2020. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. \n During today's call, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in today's earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. I will now turn the call over to Bill. \nBill Stone: Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I hope you and yours are home safe and healthy. I'll discuss our results and walk through our assumptions for the remainder of the year as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 world. Our results for the quarter were $1.156 billion in adjusted revenue, up 0.5% and $1.10 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 18.3%. Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $463 million -- $466.3 million, and our adjusted consolidated EBITDA increased to 40.3%. I think that was up 180 basis points. \n Our Q3 adjusted organic revenue was down 1.4%. And while we have seen some sales improvement, particularly within our recent corporate businesses, and we have continued weaknesses in our perpetual [indiscernible] when we can get back in front of people, and we face some COVID specific headwinds in our health care business. Obviously, people had not been able to fulfill as many prescriptions as they did prior to COVID. \n Alternative fund administration had a strong quarter with 4.3% organic growth and the rebound in the M&A market helped drive Intralinks growth to 5.9%. Organic cash flow was $755 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2020. Our secured net leverage is 2.52x, and total net leverage is 3.58x. \n We bought back 3.1 million shares of common at price of $61.44 per share for $191.9 million. We still prioritize high-quality acquisitions and are evaluating a number of assets. In September, we brought on Frank Egan to be Managing Director of Mergers and Acquisitions. Frank has over 35 years of experience in investment banking and venture capital, and he will help us both source new deals and work with our business unit managers to evaluate different acquisition prospects. \n The pandemic has caused a lot of uncertainty in our global accounts in major swings in the stock market. Despite this, SS&C has preserved our core DNA. Our sales force is hungry, and our technology teams are innovating. Over the past couple of months, we have signed 2 of the largest deals ever in the retirement space. We believe retirement will continue to be a hot area for us, and we hope to build solid references at Nationwide and ICMA. \n The industry continues to adopt their Eclipse, and we signed a record 20 new clients in September. As you know, we sell as Eclipse on a term basis, so the revenue will be ratably earned over the next few years. We have integrated Black Diamond and InnoTrust, and we have begun to get some traction. Banks and trust companies are competing with wirehouse's not RIAs, and we anticipate this being an ongoing trend in 2021. \n Our alternatives business set a new record high for our alternative assets under administration at $1.89 trillion, surpassing our previous record set last quarter. So much for the demise of the alternatives industry. We believe alternative asset managers are well positioned in these volatile markets. Our 2020 scenario analysis can be found on Pages 15 of our earnings results slides. We continue to use 202's1 scenario as our baseline with an incremental increase -- decrease of about $25 million dependent upon the state of the economy, which, obviously, is also dependent upon the global pandemic. We anticipate earnings per share to come in at about $4.21 as our baseline, up $0.11 from last quarter's estimate. \n I'll now turn the call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in a little more detail. \nRahul Kanwar: Thanks, Bill. While a majority of our workforce is still remote, we have opened 4 international offices and are in the planning phase for several more. We are all anxious to return to normalcy but the health and well-being of our employees is our first priority. We're monitoring guidelines from governments and health authorities around the world, including the CDC here in the United States and will not open an office unless it's safe to do so. \n SS&C continues to innovate how our employees continue to collaborate despite working from home. Within Intralinks, we have enhanced our investor vision portal with expanded general partner capabilities, launched an Intralink steel marketing and road show offering and integrated Zoom web conferences. Integration between Algorithmics and Singularity brings embedded risk analytics to our Singularity product. We have already signed one client using this expanded functionality and are building momentum. \n We've also rebranded our Global Transfer Agency Business to Global Investor and Distribution Solutions, GIDS. GIDS delivers transfer agency and investor servicing powered by a single global servicing platform. Nick Wright, previously leading Financial Services International has assumed the newly created role of Head of GIDS to bring together SS&C's transfer agency capabilities around the world. \n Now I will mention some key deals for Q3. A $40 billion in asset hedge fund and turn fund administration client licensed Geneva for their internal operations. A long-term Advent client upgraded their APX license to a cloud delivery solution added Genesis for rinsing capabilities and BD Link as an investor portal, an existing large strategic client looking to consolidate vendors extended our transfer agency services to their European operations. The Boutique Superannuation Fund based in Australia licensed our Bluedoor solution for its ability to meet their complex requirements. \n An existing SS&C health client absorbing a number of acquisitions that the resulting increased membership required additional licenses and infrastructure to support their growth. A large hedge fund-based in Boston expanded their fund administration services, a $4 billion in asset hedge fund shows SS&C's fund administration services, including middle office, regulatory reporting and tax preparation, citing our reputation and commitment to implement on a tight time frame. The European alternative investment manager converted to SS&C fund services from a competitor due to our expertise and ability to meet loan servicing requirements. \n A large DSD insurance client required a reporting solution and chose to license vision, with a successful cross-sell offer between DSD and our institutional and investment management group. \n I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials. \nPatrick Pedonti: Thank you. Results for the third quarter 2020 were GAAP revenues of $1.1528 billion, GAAP net income of $159.4 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.60. Adjusted revenues were $1.1562 billion, including the impact of the adoption of the revenue standard 606 and for required deferred revenue adjustments for acquisitions. \n Adjusted revenue was up 0.5%. Adjusted operating income increased 5.5%, and adjusted EPS was $1.10, an 18.3% increase over Q3 2019. Adjusted revenue increased 5.4% over $5.4 million over Q3 2019. Our acquisitions contributed $29.8 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $6.5 million or 0.6% in the quarter. Organic revenue decline on a constant-currency basis was 1.4%, driven by some weakness in the DSD asset management and health care businesses. These were offset by strength in the fund administration and the Intralinks businesses. \n Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $448.8 million, an increase of $23.2 million or 5.5% in the third quarter. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $3.2 million on expenses in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins improved from 37% in the third quarter of 2019 to 38.8% in the third quarter of 2020, driven by lower personnel costs, lower costs-related to independent cost factors, lower out-of-pocket expenses and lower travel expenses. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA, which was defined in Note 3 in the earnings release, was $466.3 million or 40.3% adjusted revenue, an increase of $20.5 million or 4.6% over Q3 2019. \n Net interest expense for the third quarter was $54.7 million and includes $3.4 million of noncash amortized financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter for our amended credit facility and the senior notes was 3.0% compared to 4.84% in the third quarter of 2019 and resulted in interest expense decrease of $43.8 million. We recorded GAAP tax provision for the quarter of $58.6 million or 26.9% of pretax income.\n Adjusted net income, as defined in Note 4 of the earnings release, was $294.2 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.10. And the effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares increased to 266.7 million from 265.8 million in Q2. The impact of an increase in the average share price and option exercises was partially offset by share repurchases. \n On the balance sheet and cash flow, as of September, we had approximately $184 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $6.9 billion gross debt for a net debt position of approximately $6.7 billion. Operating cash flow for the 9 months ended September 2020 was $755.1 million. For the 9 months, we had net debt payments of $330.3 million compared to $629.1 million in 2019. Treasury stock buybacks totaled $219.8 million for purchases of 3.6 million shares at an average price of $61.07 per share compared to treasury stock buybacks of $60.3 million for 1.3 million shares in 2019. The 9 months, we declared and paid $99.9 million of common stock dividends as compared to $76 million in the same period last year, an increase of 31.4%. Year-to-date, we paid interest of $212.7 million compared to $294.6 million last year due to lower debt levels and lower average interest rates. \n In the 9 months, we paid income taxes of $182.5 million compared to $180.3 million in the same period of 2019. Our accounts receivable DSO improved in the quarter, to 50.4 days compared to 53.3 days as of June 2020. Capital expenditures and capitalized software totaled $80 million or 2.3% of adjusted revenue compared to $99.1 million or 2.9% of adjusted revenue in the prior year. Spending was predominantly for capitalized software, IT infrastructure, and leasehold of -- facilities leasehold improvements. \n Option exercises increased this year to $129.6 million for proceeds and 4.2 million shares compared to $74.5 million of proceeds and 2.7 million shares last year. On an LTM consolidated basis EBITDA, which is used for our covenant compliance, was $1.876 billion as of September and includes $8 million of acquired EBITDA and cost savings related to our acquisition. Based on net debt of approximately $6.7 billion, our total leverage ratio was 3.58x, and our secured ratio was 2.52x. \n On outlook for the year, we got basically these assumptions included -- assumed in our outlook. We assume that markets continue to be volatile, large-scale outsourcing deals and license sales are impacted. AUA levels remained flat and fund launches are somewhat delayed. As we're focusing on client service, retention rates will continue to be in the range of our most recent results. \n Foreign currency exchange will be at current levels. Adjusted organic growth -- revenue growth for the year will be in the range of negative 1% to negative 2%. Interest rates on our term loan facility will approximately be 1-month LIBOR plus the spread, which is currently at 175 bps. We will manage our expenses during this period by controlling variable expenses and staff hire but we'll continue to invest in our business for the long term with capital expenditures of approximately 2.4% of revenue and R&D expenditures of approximately $400 million on a GAAP basis. We expect the tax rate to approximately be 26% on an adjusted basis. \n The first scenario assumes that the economic conditions start to improve in the fourth quarter of 2020. Under these assumptions, we expect approximately the following results: Adjusted revenue of $4.650 billion, adjusted net income of $1.130 billion; diluted shares of 267 million and operating cash flow of $1.130 billion. \n The second scenario assume that the economic conditions continue the same as current conditions. And in this assumption, we expect the following results: adjusted revenue of $4.625 million; adjusted net income of $1.120 billion, diluted shares of 266.3 million, and operating cash flow of $1.115 billion. The third assumption assumes that economic conditions don't start improving until later in 2021. \n Under this assumption, we expect possibly the following results: Adjusted revenue of $4.600 billion; adjusted net income of $1.110 billion, diluted shares of 265.5 million and operating cash flow of $1.100 billion. \n And now I'll turn it back over to Bill for final comments. \nOperator: Mr. Stone, do you have any closing remarks? \nBill Stone: Thanks, Patrick. In the past 34 years, we have put together a remarkably diverse portfolio of products and services, supported by a diverse group of talented professionals. Each year has presented challenges but perhaps no year more so than this year, an election year, a global pandemic, civil unrest. SS&C, like a fine timepiece just keeps ticking away. Adjusted EPS up 18% for the quarter, and we suspect 2020 will be up 10% for the year. \n SS&C is a transaction processing and accounting engine, trades, dividend, interest payments, pharmacy claims, tax returns, Medicare, Medicaid, compliance checks, mutual fund redemptions and subscriptions and hundreds of other regulatory tax and commercial transaction. The world has more people generally doing more things. SS&C will continue to be a trusted partner to our clients, a strong and successful company for our employees and a haven for value for our investors. \n And with that, we'll open it up to questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rayna Kumar with Evercore. \nRayna Kumar: It looks like the organic revenue in the quarter came in a lot better than what The Street is modeling. And if you can maybe talk a little bit about the drivers of that organic revenue, how much of that came from growth from the fund administration business, the ease business and growing -- and DST, that would be really helpful. And separately, if you can also talk about what the underlying organic revenue growth assumption is for the fourth quarter and the drivers for your baseline case? \nBill Stone: Rahul, you want to take that? \nRahul Kanwar: Yes, I can certainly start and maybe Patrick can comment on the underlying assumptions. But I think that the business is -- we have pretty good performance across the board in Q3, but the businesses that -- the highlights of our fund administration had a -- really a pretty good quarter. And we also saw within Intralinks a bounce back or starting to build some momentum in the M&A business again, and so Intralinks had a pretty good quarter as well. And Patrick, if you could comment on the guidance or the scenarios, rather? \nPatrick Pedonti: Sure. I think at the -- I'll talk about the midpoint of the scenario -- of the scenarios, we expect adjusted organic growth to be, negative about 5.5%. And difficulty in the fourth quarter is that there's a very difficult comp compared to Q4 2019 when revenue was $1.212 billion, and we had very strong license sales in that quarter. But we expect fund administration business growth to continue and be around 5% for the full year and also our influence business and seeing some improvement in the DSD business. \nRayna Kumar: Got it. That's very helpful. And if you can call out the actual growth rate for the fund administration business in the fourth -- in the third quarter, and definitely, if you can talk a little bit about the growth that we saw in DST, and if it's possible to get back to at least low single-digit top line growth in 2021. \nPatrick Pedonti: I'll give you -- so the alternatives fund administration business was up 4.3% in the quarter. And the DST business, on an adjusted basis, was down 3.8% in Q3. \nBill Stone: And if you look forward… \nRayna Kumar: All right. Go ahead? \nBill Stone: 2021. I think these deals that we have had press releases out on are very large deals. And the revenue really starts to kick in throughout the fourth quarter and then really kicks in, in 2021. So we have some reason for optimism, and we believe that we have a lot more prospects in the pipeline. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brad Zelnick with Crédit Suisse. \nMarco Iaboni: This is Marco on the line for Brad. I wanted to talk a bit about the hiring of Frank. I think this is for you, Bill. So what excites you about this hiring? Is there perhaps a shift in M&A strategy? Or nothing changing in the environment? \nBill Stone: Well, I think Frank has been a pretty senior person at a number of different investment banks, including UBS, and then he found something called Lake Ridge Capital and ran that venture capital fund for a number of years. He's very well connected in both fintech and in health care. And so he brings a network of people and capabilities that we didn't really have in the organization before. And I think that he's helping our individual business units on how to frame, how to make an offer and then how to move towards close in a confident way where the target is comfortable with what we're going to do. \n So we're excited about it. He's been here a couple of months. I think in general, all of us are pretty pleased with his performance. \nMarco Iaboni: Great. For my follow-up, Patrick, I wanted to ask about the transition of contractors to in-house employees that you spoke of. How much would you say that contributes to margins this quarter? And how should we think about the potential for savings going forward? \nPatrick Pedonti: I think most of the -- I think all the contractors would transition to in-house employees in the quarter, and the savings was about $6 million in the quarter, somewhere in that neighborhood. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. \nJackson Ader: Just a quick follow-up on some of those retirement services deals, Bill, that you talked about. Can you give us a sense how those contracts are priced? Are they based on dollars per account similar to the mutual fund accounting business that DST has? And then, any particular revenue recognition and oddities that we should be aware of in those retirement business wins? \nBill Stone: I think in general, it's -- again, it's matrixed and it's the number of participants, the size of the assets and the number of transactions. So these are all large deals, and JPMorgan also came out with the -- probably every day 401(k) or something along those lines that we're also going to administer that for you guys. And again, these are large-scale deals. I mean, JPMorgan is a start-up, but you guys don't have a lot of market power. So there's great anticipation. And then nationwide has a big business at the ICMA. And so we're expecting tens of millions of revenue in 2021 and then an acceleration to 2022. \nJackson Ader: Got it. Okay. And then on the fund administration business, I think this is a second quarter in a row that the AUM has actually outpaced the organic revenue growth. And so I'm just curious, is this a signal of pricing pressure is it a signal of maybe the types of assets that are flowing into your customers, maybe where it's more plain vanilla, you're not able to get the same type of basis points on the assets under administration? Any comments you have there? \nPatrick Pedonti: Bill, I could take a shot at that. So I think what's happening is as our private equity and real assets businesses continue to grow quickly, some of the kinds of mandates we're getting in there are for things like limited partners and private capital and things like that, that are very, very profitable but don't have the same yield in terms of basis points. And that's probably what you're seeing. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. \nAlex Kramm: Just a couple of quick ones. First, on retention, noticed that tick down. I mean 95.3% is still a very high number. But just curious if you would call out anything why that's come off a little bit. I mean, again, tough environment, but just curious, any particular ideas? \nBill Stone: I'd just say that there's been a couple of accounts that we've withdrawn from, and that makes up the bulk of that. \nAlex Kramm: Okay. And then maybe just on the guide, I guess, the updated guide. I know these are scenarios, but at the same time, we're, I guess, at the end of October with 2 months left in the year. So just curious, the $50 million range, what are the biggest swing factors with 2 months left to still have such a wide range? Like what could go awry, what could go wrong still in this year? \nBill Stone: We could sign some large-scale licenses where we take a very large chunk of revenue into this fourth quarter, and we could not sign some large-scale licenses where we take very large chunk revenue in the fourth quarter. Now I think that's just about it. \nAlex Kramm: Okay. No, that's fair. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. \nPeter Heckmann: Patrick, did you comment on the closing of the unit of -- I believe it was Capita, the timing of that in the quarter, and what type of revenue that -- what kind of acquired revenue that contributed? \nPatrick Pedonti: Capita has not closed. \nPeter Heckmann: It has not closed. Okay. \nPatrick Pedonti: Has not closed. It's still hung up with some regulatory approvals and some other approvals. And we're not sure at this point what it's going to close. \nPeter Heckmann: Okay. So there is no acquired revenue from Capita in your updated guidance ranges? \nPatrick Pedonti: No. There's really no changes from our previous guidance. Last acquisition, I think, was in a vest in May. \nPeter Heckmann: Got it. Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just the -- I saw the recent U.K. win come across. It remind me a little bit of the St. James contract. Is the replatforming of wealth managers still ongoing within the U.K.? And do you feel that you can use some of the successes to gain share there? I mean, is that an opportunity for the DST business? \nBill Stone: Yes. We went in just a -- we would say all of our all of our money management businesses are participating in the capabilities that we are packaging together for Brooks and Macdonald and other large-scale U.K. money managers and actually throughout Ireland and Scotland and then into the -- Europe. We also have a lot of opportunities in Australia [indiscernible] and in the rest of Asia. So I think some of the pandemic slowed down stuff. It's really that you're going to get a chance to get in front of them and maybe be able to cement vehicles faster. But Brooks Macdonalds, a first-class place, and we have a great opportunity to have a great partnership with them and then also leverage that for more business throughout the U.K. and Europe. \nPeter Heckmann: Got it. Got it. And then -- and you're breaking up there just a little bit, just so you know but just in Health Solutions, I guess you talked -- you called out a couple of wins there and maybe some opportunities. But is that a business that you think can grow high single digits over the next 3 or 4 quarters? \nBill Stone: We have the pipeline for it to be able to close at higher rates even than that. I think we have some momentum. It's a question of -- I mean, a lock in on the contract and then making sure that the revenue streams are coming again. But we have some momentum in health care, and we're cautiously optimistic about what we can do. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham. \nMayank Tandon: Bill, just looking at the portfolio of offerings that you have, any noticeable shifts in competition implications for pricing? And then how have your win rates been trending across the various segments of your portfolio? \nBill Stone: Yes. I think the strongest areas continue to be wealth management where you see Black Diamond and then a few of the other add-in products that we've built around and acquired around Black Diamond like [indiscernible] and other products like that. And then you have real assets that have done a very nice job and continue to have a very full pipeline. We also have a lot of opportunity in private equity. We think that, that continues, as Rahul had spoken about that prior, and that's a very full pipeline and still may come out on a dollars basis, still 70% of the dollars in private equity are still administered in-house. So there's a real opportunity for us to execute into that business even more so. \n And I think we believe retirement is going to be a very nice sweet spot for us because the deals are large and the contracts are long and as are the tightness of the relationships. So that's really the kind of the essence of the business, by getting Innovest, we get InnoTrust. We have 16 Diamond RIAs and what they're finding as they get into high net worth individuals is a lot of them have trust, which is you need trust accounting. And Milltrust is a very, very powerful product, and we're excited about our opportunity to cross them and upsell into those [indiscernible] \nMayank Tandon: That's a helpful color. And then if I could just ask about '21, as we're trying to frame our models of the various scenarios you actually laid out, when you say a mid-2021 recovery or an early '21 recovery or with the recoveries back-end weighted, what does that mean in terms of the organic growth and margin levels when we talk about these recovery levels for '21? \nBill Stone: Yes. I think, Mayank, again, the margin levels are really -- SS&C manages its business. So we can manage our expenses. And as we've told many times, we have some flexibility in how much money we spend. So we're not as concerned about the margins. We're not as concerned about the earnings. But we have a very good sales force, and the global pandemic hasn't crippled us. It certainly has not put wind in our sails. We've hired a lot of new salespeople, and we're training them through soon. But they don't get the interaction and the ability to be able to bounce ideas after -- on each other and be able to see what's working in the rest of the sales force. So that's been the biggest issue for us is just to be able to close deals. People want to really look at you in the eye and make sure X, Y and Z, whereas in the smart scale and medium-scale fund administration businesses. We're such a Colossus in these businesses that we really have lots and lots and lots of breadth of references. And we're going to work, right, whereas if you buy a big license then you have to do the implementation, you get concerned that you're not going to have people on-site from us. It adds to the trepidation. So that's the real challenge with the revenue side. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. \nAshish Sabadra: Actually, my question for you, for the fourth quarter organic guide, if we exclude that onetime difficult comps from license headwinds in the license revenues in the prior year, what would the organic growth would have been excluding that was one like difficult comps? \nPatrick Pedonti: I'll take the last part here… \nBill Stone: [indiscernible] Patrick. \nPatrick Pedonti: Yes, I'll take about -- yes. That's about right. So that's about a 3.5% impact or so. \nAshish Sabadra: Okay. That's helpful. \nPatrick Pedonti: 3% to 4% impact. \nAshish Sabadra: 3%, 4%. That's helpful. And maybe a question for you, Bill, if you can size the DST prospect pipeline. You talked about $60 million to $65 million pipeline last quarter. Obviously, you've had some really good large deal wins. And so both the prospect pipeline? And as we think about, as you mentioned, as you close these prospect pipeline and the new deals, the follow-up question was, how do we think about the DST growth next year? Can it get back into a growth mode at low single-digit growth next year? \nBill Stone: I think we have opportunities. It's -- again, it's a very competitive business, but the wins that ICMA -- and that nationwide and that JPMorgan, for that matter indicate that we have a superior offering, and we have to get out and get after it. Now we have a talented group of executives working in that business with Mike Sleightholme and Kevin Rafferty and John Geli and a number of others, but those 3 guys are leading a very talented group of people that are in there selling and selling hard. And we put the financial services sales in North America under Rob Stone who's also a fairly talented sales executive. And I think that we're getting some -- we're getting focused, we're getting tracking and we're getting increased intensity. \n So I'm optimistic about where we're going with this. And I think that the addition of things like Algorithmics with the embedded analytics and embedded risk and things like InnoTrust, which gives you the ability to handle 1940 Trust Act portfolios and be able to answer for different states on their trust on a state's law. I think there's a lot of stuff like that, that SS&C has gathered like Vidado that does handwritten notes and being able to immediately convert it into machine readable. I mean, there's a lot of things like that, that gives our solution a superior look, a superior feel and then superior productivity. And I think that's the optimism. \nAshish Sabadra: Congrats once again on a good quarter. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. \nAndrew Schmidt: Just a question on buying behavior in the sales cycle. It seems like you guys pulled through some nice wins over the past quarter. It seems like the -- obviously, there's still some pressure, but it sounds like the sales cycle and closed rates and things like that are starting to normalize. I guess, just to get your perspective on that? And then if there is improvement, what have you seen into the fourth quarter from that perspective? \nBill Stone: Well, again, Andrew, I think trying to be perspicacious about this. I think is very difficult because everybody's crystal ball is a little cloudy. And when you say things are coming back to normal, I would tell you 80% or 90% of our sales needs are now, going soon, are Webex, whatever Microsoft is, or whoever is, right? But some sort of collaboration software where people are in normal places. \n And as are our preparation meeting, all of our preparation meetings are through Zoom and collaboration software. And so back to normal seems like a very difficult -- a very, very difficult standard to define. And the further that we get away from February of 2020, the harder it is to remember what normal was, right? So traveling for business and in the airplane, I have not done in 6 months, maybe? That hasn't happened in 30 years. So I just think that we need not to get precipitous, and we need to be able to work methodically, have data to ensure we're supporting our team and our customers. \n And then when you see spots of lightness, pounce. So I think it's much more kind of a watchful waiting. We're watchfully waiting, right? And like a hawk in the tree. Until we see movement on the ground, we're not going to waste our energy. And so that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to be wise. And in October of 2020, that's a difficult proposition. \nAndrew Schmidt: Sure. No, that makes a lot of sense. I guess in a virtual selling environment, have you seen clients sort of adapt this sort of environment in terms of buying patterns? Or is it still very much tenuous from just a virtual sales engagement perspective? \nBill Stone: Well, it's just longer, right? It just takes longer. And then there's a contract, right? And then that's done virtually too. So the length of those kinds of things all kind of stretch out, and I know Rahul has been in the midst of a number. And I think maybe Rahul, you could kind of give your perspective. \nRahul Kanwar: Yes. I think just to add to some of that, there are signs that people are getting more comfortable. So I think people are adjusting to the -- and like Bill said a little while ago, some of the things that -- some of their challenges, those challenges do need to get solved, right? But at the same time, this is all about rate of buying behavior more than anything else. So we are seeing prospects make decisions and sign contracts and move forward. And maybe there's -- maybe the rate of that happening is a little better than it was 3, 4 months ago, for sure, but it's not -- it's nowhere close to what it would be in that normalized environment. And I think that's really what we're facing. \nAndrew Schmidt: Understood. And then just a question on capital allocation. We saw the buyback this quarter. Should we expect consistent buybacks? And then I guess, in terms of the M&A pipeline, just any update there in terms of prospects and things like that? \nBill Stone: Well, again, that's another wise discussion point, right? So we'll sit down and we'll talk in there. We can buyback debt. But as Patrick pointed out, our debt is 1-month LIBOR plus our spread, and 1-month LIBOR right now is [indiscernible]. So our interest rate on our -- about $4.8 billion in Term Loan B debt is 1.9%. Last year, I think we generated $5 a share in cash -- $5 per share in cash. So we want to be cognizant that if we have a quality acquisition, that we can get it at a fair price, then we want to make sure we have the wherewithal to do that. And then we're going to split the rest of our cash flow between paying down debt. And it looks like now we can buy something in the open market and then also buy back shares. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Shutler from William Blair. \nChristopher Shutler: Just looking at the fourth quarter implied net income range. I'm coming up with a range of $266 million, $286 million. You did $294 million in the third quarter. So I guess the question is, why would net income come down from Q3 to Q4? \nPatrick Pedonti: Well, there's a little bit of decline in sequential revenue. But the midpoint scenario, right? And the fourth quarter also typically has higher costs related to employee reviews and raises that are effective on October 1. So we're going to see that increase in compensation and a few other expenses kind of go up sequentially in Q4. And then at the midpoint, revenue is down a little bit. \nBill Stone: So that began on October 1. And I think our ranges for 2020, while more modest than they are generally, still in the $30 million to $40 million range. So $8 million to $10 million a quarter. \nChristopher Shutler: Okay. Got it. And then, Bill, I just want to come back to the hiring of Frank Egan one more time. You've obviously led the R&D effort for a long time at SS&C, and you've been a very large acquisitive growing company for years. So maybe just -- would you mind putting a finer point on why you brought on Frank? I guess, I'm still not clear on it? \nBill Stone: Well, Chris, I think SS&C is a way bigger place, right? We're at $4.6 billion and we have upwards of 25,000 employees, we have 50 offices, we're in 35, 40 countries, right? There's opportunities all over the world. And we've done a number of acquisitions where those management teams are used to buying stuff too. So in the incoming numbers of acquisitions and then the ability to really project how I think or Rahul thinks our Patrick think, we still have full-time jobs, right? I mean, we still try to manage the business. We try to help the sales force on-call. We try to help the development people get the right people in and be able to really get to high enough level people at our prospects and our clients to make sure that what we're building, people are going to buy, right? You get as many developers as we have that have a lot of talent, and you got to be careful you don't have bunch of science projects. That's really cool, and you could sell it to your mother, right? That's the business, right? That's the management of the business. \n We might have a -- we do. We have opportunities to buy banks in Germany, in France, all over the United States, in Asia, right, and in Mexico and all over the place. So I think Frank's job and so far in the first 60 days, [indiscernible] is to help the business unit managers understand how you're going to go about negotiating this, how are you going to make that target feel well, feel good, how you're going to keep Patrick informed and Joe Frank informed for the finance and legal have a cadence through this whole thing. So it's not like I'm getting out of it. I'm not. And there's a chance I might have some veto power right. We need to be more disciplined when we're going to have so many opportunities around the world. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. \nSurinder Thind: Just a clarification on the commentary around the capital allocation. From my perspective, obviously, share purchases were a little bit larger than I was anticipating. But on a go-forward basis, as we think about the opportunity set that's out for you, can you help me understand the trade-off between share repurchases versus maybe just paying down debt, I understand that debt. I understand that debt is effectively free at 1.9% at this point. But maybe that allowing yourself to increase flexibility in terms of maybe doing even a bigger deal or obviously, one of the challenges with the firm from an outsider's perspective has been just leverage ratios and stuff. \nBill Stone: Well, I think, hey, that's a really good question, and that's where you try to be wise. That's why we spent $330 million on paying down debt and buying back debt. And we spent $191 million on buying back shares [indiscernible]. We did do an offer of $750 million to buy back shares. And we don't send out press releases on authorizations that we don't have any intention on acting upon. That doesn't mean we're going to buy $750 million worth of those [indiscernible] shares. I don't think we will. But at the same time, when you're generating $5 a share in cash, that's a pretty compelling CFE kind of analysis as to [ more ] economically valuable to you. But your point is still well taken, right, that the market prefers that we have less debt that we have less leverage and that we pay down debt faster, but there aren't many places that pay down debt that the way we do. And we're focused, and we're disciplined, and we're not -- we haven't changed our general philosophy that our target is good acquisitions. \n Second is we want more leverage. Third is, is when our stock appears to be undervalued, which we believe it is, but we're not charge of setting the value of our stock to market's in charge to set the value of our stock. We're generating lots of cash. Winning big new deals. We've got a lot of great technology coming out. We got a great workforce. We're ambitious, we're disciplined. \n And I think you can go back to 2015, we did $1 billion of revenue. 2010, when we went public, we did $329 million. 2005, when we went private with Carlisle, we did $95 million. So we have a history of growing and I believe we'll keep growing because that's what we do. It's in our DNA. It's who we are. We have other entrepreneurs that would like to join us, like Nina Wallis at Alco, [indiscernible] at Innovest, all kinds of different people that are still with us that we have bought their companies. So I think that's a great diverse group products and services and a diverse group of people. And we're just excited about where we sit and how we perform vis-à-vis our competitors in the fintech business. \nSurinder Thind: That's very helpful, Bill. And as a quick follow-on. In terms of just when we think about the -- where you're seeing opportunity in terms of the mix, and there's an earlier question about how maybe the sales process has changed with time. How much of your new business that you're looking to win is maybe with existing clients versus trying to bring new clients in the door at this point? And is it the new clients that are maybe hesitant to sign the bigger deals at this point? Or any color there would be appreciated if just -- it's one of those things where maybe not this quarter or now, but as we kind of get more comfortable with living with the coronavirus that sales just kind of ultimately gets back to a normalized place regardless of what the environment might be like? \nBill Stone: As we get bigger, obviously, right, more and more people are our clients. I think we have some upwards of 18,000 now. And so obviously, our opportunity in the cross-sell, upsell in our current client base continues to grow. Now I think at the same time, we're at $4.6 billion in revenue, and my estimation of transaction processing in the financial technology space, there's $100 billion in the United States, and another $100 billion in the United States. \n And I would guess, in health care, transaction processing is at least [ $100 million ] in the United States and I don't really know what it might be outside United States. \n So if you take $4.6 billion and you divide it by $300 billion, we represent to 0.5%. So there's plenty of opportunity. It's a question of being able to have the right products at the right time at the right place and then have a need, right? Nationwide has a need or ICMA may have a need or JPMorgan have a need or -- we have to have a need, Brooks Macdonald or other ones, right? They have to have a need and then we have to meet it. And we have to meet it at the right price with the best solution. And I think in general, we do that, and we do that very well. \nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Crispin Love with Piper Sandler. \nCrispin Love: So the monthly redemption data seems to be mostly unaffected by the pandemic over the last several months. I was just wondering if there's anything interesting going on underneath the service in terms of the types of funds that are raising assets versus those that are seeing some outflows. \nPatrick Pedonti: We're continuing to see -- as I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to see broad based flows. So really, all of the different parts of our business, whether it's hedge funds and different strategies within hedge funds, private equity, real assets, we're seeing some flows into. The private equity and real assets have tended to raise some larger funds. And so maybe it's skewed a little bit in that direction. And within the hedge fund market, the credit focus funds continue to do pretty well, but it is pretty widespread. \nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Stone, do you have any closing remarks? \nBill Stone: I would just -- again, I appreciate everybody being on there. And as always, we work very hard for our shareholders, and we appreciate your interest in our company. Thank you. Stay safe. Bye. \nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Stone",
            "content": "Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I hope you and yours are home safe and healthy. I'll discuss our results and walk through our assumptions for the remainder of the year as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 world. Our results for the quarter were $1.156 billion in adjusted revenue, up 0.5% and $1.10 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 18.3%. Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $463 million -- $466.3 million, and our adjusted consolidated EBITDA increased to 40.3%. I think that was up 180 basis points. \n Our Q3 adjusted organic revenue was down 1.4%. And while we have seen some sales improvement, particularly within our recent corporate businesses, and we have continued weaknesses in our perpetual [indiscernible] when we can get back in front of people, and we face some COVID specific headwinds in our health care business. Obviously, people had not been able to fulfill as many prescriptions as they did prior to COVID. \n Alternative fund administration had a strong quarter with 4.3% organic growth and the rebound in the M&A market helped drive Intralinks growth to 5.9%. Organic cash flow was $755 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2020. Our secured net leverage is 2.52x, and total net leverage is 3.58x. \n We bought back 3.1 million shares of common at price of $61.44 per share for $191.9 million. We still prioritize high-quality acquisitions and are evaluating a number of assets. In September, we brought on Frank Egan to be Managing Director of Mergers and Acquisitions. Frank has over 35 years of experience in investment banking and venture capital, and he will help us both source new deals and work with our business unit managers to evaluate different acquisition prospects. \n The pandemic has caused a lot of uncertainty in our global accounts in major swings in the stock market. Despite this, SS&C has preserved our core DNA. Our sales force is hungry, and our technology teams are innovating. Over the past couple of months, we have signed 2 of the largest deals ever in the retirement space. We believe retirement will continue to be a hot area for us, and we hope to build solid references at Nationwide and ICMA. \n The industry continues to adopt their Eclipse, and we signed a record 20 new clients in September. As you know, we sell as Eclipse on a term basis, so the revenue will be ratably earned over the next few years. We have integrated Black Diamond and InnoTrust, and we have begun to get some traction. Banks and trust companies are competing with wirehouse's not RIAs, and we anticipate this being an ongoing trend in 2021. \n Our alternatives business set a new record high for our alternative assets under administration at $1.89 trillion, surpassing our previous record set last quarter. So much for the demise of the alternatives industry. We believe alternative asset managers are well positioned in these volatile markets. Our 2020 scenario analysis can be found on Pages 15 of our earnings results slides. We continue to use 202's1 scenario as our baseline with an incremental increase -- decrease of about $25 million dependent upon the state of the economy, which, obviously, is also dependent upon the global pandemic. We anticipate earnings per share to come in at about $4.21 as our baseline, up $0.11 from last quarter's estimate. \n I'll now turn the call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in a little more detail. Thanks, Patrick. In the past 34 years, we have put together a remarkably diverse portfolio of products and services, supported by a diverse group of talented professionals. Each year has presented challenges but perhaps no year more so than this year, an election year, a global pandemic, civil unrest. SS&C, like a fine timepiece just keeps ticking away. Adjusted EPS up 18% for the quarter, and we suspect 2020 will be up 10% for the year. \n SS&C is a transaction processing and accounting engine, trades, dividend, interest payments, pharmacy claims, tax returns, Medicare, Medicaid, compliance checks, mutual fund redemptions and subscriptions and hundreds of other regulatory tax and commercial transaction. The world has more people generally doing more things. SS&C will continue to be a trusted partner to our clients, a strong and successful company for our employees and a haven for value for our investors. \n And with that, we'll open it up to questions. Rahul, you want to take that? And if you look forward... 2021. I think these deals that we have had press releases out on are very large deals. And the revenue really starts to kick in throughout the fourth quarter and then really kicks in, in 2021. So we have some reason for optimism, and we believe that we have a lot more prospects in the pipeline. Well, I think Frank has been a pretty senior person at a number of different investment banks, including UBS, and then he found something called Lake Ridge Capital and ran that venture capital fund for a number of years. He's very well connected in both fintech and in health care. And so he brings a network of people and capabilities that we didn't really have in the organization before. And I think that he's helping our individual business units on how to frame, how to make an offer and then how to move towards close in a confident way where the target is comfortable with what we're going to do. \n So we're excited about it. He's been here a couple of months. I think in general, all of us are pretty pleased with his performance. I think in general, it's -- again, it's matrixed and it's the number of participants, the size of the assets and the number of transactions. So these are all large deals, and JPMorgan also came out with the -- probably every day 401(k) or something along those lines that we're also going to administer that for you guys. And again, these are large-scale deals. I mean, JPMorgan is a start-up, but you guys don't have a lot of market power. So there's great anticipation. And then nationwide has a big business at the ICMA. And so we're expecting tens of millions of revenue in 2021 and then an acceleration to 2022. I'd just say that there's been a couple of accounts that we've withdrawn from, and that makes up the bulk of that. We could sign some large-scale licenses where we take a very large chunk of revenue into this fourth quarter, and we could not sign some large-scale licenses where we take very large chunk revenue in the fourth quarter. Now I think that's just about it. Yes. We went in just a -- we would say all of our all of our money management businesses are participating in the capabilities that we are packaging together for Brooks and Macdonald and other large-scale U.K. money managers and actually throughout Ireland and Scotland and then into the -- Europe. We also have a lot of opportunities in Australia [indiscernible] and in the rest of Asia. So I think some of the pandemic slowed down stuff. It's really that you're going to get a chance to get in front of them and maybe be able to cement vehicles faster. But Brooks Macdonalds, a first-class place, and we have a great opportunity to have a great partnership with them and then also leverage that for more business throughout the U.K. and Europe. We have the pipeline for it to be able to close at higher rates even than that. I think we have some momentum. It's a question of -- I mean, a lock in on the contract and then making sure that the revenue streams are coming again. But we have some momentum in health care, and we're cautiously optimistic about what we can do. Yes. I think the strongest areas continue to be wealth management where you see Black Diamond and then a few of the other add-in products that we've built around and acquired around Black Diamond like [indiscernible] and other products like that. And then you have real assets that have done a very nice job and continue to have a very full pipeline. We also have a lot of opportunity in private equity. We think that, that continues, as Rahul had spoken about that prior, and that's a very full pipeline and still may come out on a dollars basis, still 70% of the dollars in private equity are still administered in-house. So there's a real opportunity for us to execute into that business even more so. \n And I think we believe retirement is going to be a very nice sweet spot for us because the deals are large and the contracts are long and as are the tightness of the relationships. So that's really the kind of the essence of the business, by getting Innovest, we get InnoTrust. We have 16 Diamond RIAs and what they're finding as they get into high net worth individuals is a lot of them have trust, which is you need trust accounting. And Milltrust is a very, very powerful product, and we're excited about our opportunity to cross them and upsell into those [indiscernible] Yes. I think, Mayank, again, the margin levels are really -- SS&C manages its business. So we can manage our expenses. And as we've told many times, we have some flexibility in how much money we spend. So we're not as concerned about the margins. We're not as concerned about the earnings. But we have a very good sales force, and the global pandemic hasn't crippled us. It certainly has not put wind in our sails. We've hired a lot of new salespeople, and we're training them through soon. But they don't get the interaction and the ability to be able to bounce ideas after -- on each other and be able to see what's working in the rest of the sales force. So that's been the biggest issue for us is just to be able to close deals. People want to really look at you in the eye and make sure X, Y and Z, whereas in the smart scale and medium-scale fund administration businesses. We're such a Colossus in these businesses that we really have lots and lots and lots of breadth of references. And we're going to work, right, whereas if you buy a big license then you have to do the implementation, you get concerned that you're not going to have people on-site from us. It adds to the trepidation. So that's the real challenge with the revenue side. [indiscernible] Patrick. I think we have opportunities. It's -- again, it's a very competitive business, but the wins that ICMA -- and that nationwide and that JPMorgan, for that matter indicate that we have a superior offering, and we have to get out and get after it. Now we have a talented group of executives working in that business with Mike Sleightholme and Kevin Rafferty and John Geli and a number of others, but those 3 guys are leading a very talented group of people that are in there selling and selling hard. And we put the financial services sales in North America under Rob Stone who's also a fairly talented sales executive. And I think that we're getting some -- we're getting focused, we're getting tracking and we're getting increased intensity. \n So I'm optimistic about where we're going with this. And I think that the addition of things like Algorithmics with the embedded analytics and embedded risk and things like InnoTrust, which gives you the ability to handle 1940 Trust Act portfolios and be able to answer for different states on their trust on a state's law. I think there's a lot of stuff like that, that SS&C has gathered like Vidado that does handwritten notes and being able to immediately convert it into machine readable. I mean, there's a lot of things like that, that gives our solution a superior look, a superior feel and then superior productivity. And I think that's the optimism. Well, again, Andrew, I think trying to be perspicacious about this. I think is very difficult because everybody's crystal ball is a little cloudy. And when you say things are coming back to normal, I would tell you 80% or 90% of our sales needs are now, going soon, are Webex, whatever Microsoft is, or whoever is, right? But some sort of collaboration software where people are in normal places. \n And as are our preparation meeting, all of our preparation meetings are through Zoom and collaboration software. And so back to normal seems like a very difficult -- a very, very difficult standard to define. And the further that we get away from February of 2020, the harder it is to remember what normal was, right? So traveling for business and in the airplane, I have not done in 6 months, maybe? That hasn't happened in 30 years. So I just think that we need not to get precipitous, and we need to be able to work methodically, have data to ensure we're supporting our team and our customers. \n And then when you see spots of lightness, pounce. So I think it's much more kind of a watchful waiting. We're watchfully waiting, right? And like a hawk in the tree. Until we see movement on the ground, we're not going to waste our energy. And so that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to be wise. And in October of 2020, that's a difficult proposition. Well, it's just longer, right? It just takes longer. And then there's a contract, right? And then that's done virtually too. So the length of those kinds of things all kind of stretch out, and I know Rahul has been in the midst of a number. And I think maybe Rahul, you could kind of give your perspective. Well, again, that's another wise discussion point, right? So we'll sit down and we'll talk in there. We can buyback debt. But as Patrick pointed out, our debt is 1-month LIBOR plus our spread, and 1-month LIBOR right now is [indiscernible]. So our interest rate on our -- about $4.8 billion in Term Loan B debt is 1.9%. Last year, I think we generated $5 a share in cash -- $5 per share in cash. So we want to be cognizant that if we have a quality acquisition, that we can get it at a fair price, then we want to make sure we have the wherewithal to do that. And then we're going to split the rest of our cash flow between paying down debt. And it looks like now we can buy something in the open market and then also buy back shares. So that began on October 1. And I think our ranges for 2020, while more modest than they are generally, still in the $30 million to $40 million range. So $8 million to $10 million a quarter. Well, Chris, I think SS&C is a way bigger place, right? We're at $4.6 billion and we have upwards of 25,000 employees, we have 50 offices, we're in 35, 40 countries, right? There's opportunities all over the world. And we've done a number of acquisitions where those management teams are used to buying stuff too. So in the incoming numbers of acquisitions and then the ability to really project how I think or Rahul thinks our Patrick think, we still have full-time jobs, right? I mean, we still try to manage the business. We try to help the sales force on-call. We try to help the development people get the right people in and be able to really get to high enough level people at our prospects and our clients to make sure that what we're building, people are going to buy, right? You get as many developers as we have that have a lot of talent, and you got to be careful you don't have bunch of science projects. That's really cool, and you could sell it to your mother, right? That's the business, right? That's the management of the business. \n We might have a -- we do. We have opportunities to buy banks in Germany, in France, all over the United States, in Asia, right, and in Mexico and all over the place. So I think Frank's job and so far in the first 60 days, [indiscernible] is to help the business unit managers understand how you're going to go about negotiating this, how are you going to make that target feel well, feel good, how you're going to keep Patrick informed and Joe Frank informed for the finance and legal have a cadence through this whole thing. So it's not like I'm getting out of it. I'm not. And there's a chance I might have some veto power right. We need to be more disciplined when we're going to have so many opportunities around the world. Well, I think, hey, that's a really good question, and that's where you try to be wise. That's why we spent $330 million on paying down debt and buying back debt. And we spent $191 million on buying back shares [indiscernible]. We did do an offer of $750 million to buy back shares. And we don't send out press releases on authorizations that we don't have any intention on acting upon. That doesn't mean we're going to buy $750 million worth of those [indiscernible] shares. I don't think we will. But at the same time, when you're generating $5 a share in cash, that's a pretty compelling CFE kind of analysis as to [ more ] economically valuable to you. But your point is still well taken, right, that the market prefers that we have less debt that we have less leverage and that we pay down debt faster, but there aren't many places that pay down debt that the way we do. And we're focused, and we're disciplined, and we're not -- we haven't changed our general philosophy that our target is good acquisitions. \n Second is we want more leverage. Third is, is when our stock appears to be undervalued, which we believe it is, but we're not charge of setting the value of our stock to market's in charge to set the value of our stock. We're generating lots of cash. Winning big new deals. We've got a lot of great technology coming out. We got a great workforce. We're ambitious, we're disciplined. \n And I think you can go back to 2015, we did $1 billion of revenue. 2010, when we went public, we did $329 million. 2005, when we went private with Carlisle, we did $95 million. So we have a history of growing and I believe we'll keep growing because that's what we do. It's in our DNA. It's who we are. We have other entrepreneurs that would like to join us, like Nina Wallis at Alco, [indiscernible] at Innovest, all kinds of different people that are still with us that we have bought their companies. So I think that's a great diverse group products and services and a diverse group of people. And we're just excited about where we sit and how we perform vis-à-vis our competitors in the fintech business. As we get bigger, obviously, right, more and more people are our clients. I think we have some upwards of 18,000 now. And so obviously, our opportunity in the cross-sell, upsell in our current client base continues to grow. Now I think at the same time, we're at $4.6 billion in revenue, and my estimation of transaction processing in the financial technology space, there's $100 billion in the United States, and another $100 billion in the United States. \n And I would guess, in health care, transaction processing is at least [ $100 million ] in the United States and I don't really know what it might be outside United States. \n So if you take $4.6 billion and you divide it by $300 billion, we represent to 0.5%. So there's plenty of opportunity. It's a question of being able to have the right products at the right time at the right place and then have a need, right? Nationwide has a need or ICMA may have a need or JPMorgan have a need or -- we have to have a need, Brooks Macdonald or other ones, right? They have to have a need and then we have to meet it. And we have to meet it at the right price with the best solution. And I think in general, we do that, and we do that very well. I would just -- again, I appreciate everybody being on there. And as always, we work very hard for our shareholders, and we appreciate your interest in our company. Thank you. Stay safe. Bye."

            "content": "Thank you. Results for the third quarter 2020 were GAAP revenues of $1.1528 billion, GAAP net income of $159.4 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.60. Adjusted revenues were $1.1562 billion, including the impact of the adoption of the revenue standard 606 and for required deferred revenue adjustments for acquisitions. \n Adjusted revenue was up 0.5%. Adjusted operating income increased 5.5%, and adjusted EPS was $1.10, an 18.3% increase over Q3 2019. Adjusted revenue increased 5.4% over $5.4 million over Q3 2019. Our acquisitions contributed $29.8 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $6.5 million or 0.6% in the quarter. Organic revenue decline on a constant-currency basis was 1.4%, driven by some weakness in the DSD asset management and health care businesses. These were offset by strength in the fund administration and the Intralinks businesses. \n Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $448.8 million, an increase of $23.2 million or 5.5% in the third quarter. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $3.2 million on expenses in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins improved from 37% in the third quarter of 2019 to 38.8% in the third quarter of 2020, driven by lower personnel costs, lower costs-related to independent cost factors, lower out-of-pocket expenses and lower travel expenses. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA, which was defined in Note 3 in the earnings release, was $466.3 million or 40.3% adjusted revenue, an increase of $20.5 million or 4.6% over Q3 2019. \n Net interest expense for the third quarter was $54.7 million and includes $3.4 million of noncash amortized financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter for our amended credit facility and the senior notes was 3.0% compared to 4.84% in the third quarter of 2019 and resulted in interest expense decrease of $43.8 million. We recorded GAAP tax provision for the quarter of $58.6 million or 26.9% of pretax income.\n Adjusted net income, as defined in Note 4 of the earnings release, was $294.2 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.10. And the effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares increased to 266.7 million from 265.8 million in Q2. The impact of an increase in the average share price and option exercises was partially offset by share repurchases. \n On the balance sheet and cash flow, as of September, we had approximately $184 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $6.9 billion gross debt for a net debt position of approximately $6.7 billion. Operating cash flow for the 9 months ended September 2020 was $755.1 million. For the 9 months, we had net debt payments of $330.3 million compared to $629.1 million in 2019. Treasury stock buybacks totaled $219.8 million for purchases of 3.6 million shares at an average price of $61.07 per share compared to treasury stock buybacks of $60.3 million for 1.3 million shares in 2019. The 9 months, we declared and paid $99.9 million of common stock dividends as compared to $76 million in the same period last year, an increase of 31.4%. Year-to-date, we paid interest of $212.7 million compared to $294.6 million last year due to lower debt levels and lower average interest rates. \n In the 9 months, we paid income taxes of $182.5 million compared to $180.3 million in the same period of 2019. Our accounts receivable DSO improved in the quarter, to 50.4 days compared to 53.3 days as of June 2020. Capital expenditures and capitalized software totaled $80 million or 2.3% of adjusted revenue compared to $99.1 million or 2.9% of adjusted revenue in the prior year. Spending was predominantly for capitalized software, IT infrastructure, and leasehold of -- facilities leasehold improvements. \n Option exercises increased this year to $129.6 million for proceeds and 4.2 million shares compared to $74.5 million of proceeds and 2.7 million shares last year. On an LTM consolidated basis EBITDA, which is used for our covenant compliance, was $1.876 billion as of September and includes $8 million of acquired EBITDA and cost savings related to our acquisition. Based on net debt of approximately $6.7 billion, our total leverage ratio was 3.58x, and our secured ratio was 2.52x. \n On outlook for the year, we got basically these assumptions included -- assumed in our outlook. We assume that markets continue to be volatile, large-scale outsourcing deals and license sales are impacted. AUA levels remained flat and fund launches are somewhat delayed. As we're focusing on client service, retention rates will continue to be in the range of our most recent results. \n Foreign currency exchange will be at current levels. Adjusted organic growth -- revenue growth for the year will be in the range of negative 1% to negative 2%. Interest rates on our term loan facility will approximately be 1-month LIBOR plus the spread, which is currently at 175 bps. We will manage our expenses during this period by controlling variable expenses and staff hire but we'll continue to invest in our business for the long term with capital expenditures of approximately 2.4% of revenue and R&D expenditures of approximately $400 million on a GAAP basis. We expect the tax rate to approximately be 26% on an adjusted basis. \n The first scenario assumes that the economic conditions start to improve in the fourth quarter of 2020. Under these assumptions, we expect approximately the following results: Adjusted revenue of $4.650 billion, adjusted net income of $1.130 billion; diluted shares of 267 million and operating cash flow of $1.130 billion. \n The second scenario assume that the economic conditions continue the same as current conditions. And in this assumption, we expect the following results: adjusted revenue of $4.625 million; adjusted net income of $1.120 billion, diluted shares of 266.3 million, and operating cash flow of $1.115 billion. The third assumption assumes that economic conditions don't start improving until later in 2021. \n Under this assumption, we expect possibly the following results: Adjusted revenue of $4.600 billion; adjusted net income of $1.110 billion, diluted shares of 265.5 million and operating cash flow of $1.100 billion. \n And now I'll turn it back over to Bill for final comments. Sure. I think at the -- I'll talk about the midpoint of the scenario -- of the scenarios, we expect adjusted organic growth to be, negative about 5.5%. And difficulty in the fourth quarter is that there's a very difficult comp compared to Q4 2019 when revenue was $1.212 billion, and we had very strong license sales in that quarter. But we expect fund administration business growth to continue and be around 5% for the full year and also our influence business and seeing some improvement in the DSD business. I'll give you -- so the alternatives fund administration business was up 4.3% in the quarter. And the DST business, on an adjusted basis, was down 3.8% in Q3. I think most of the -- I think all the contractors would transition to in-house employees in the quarter, and the savings was about $6 million in the quarter, somewhere in that neighborhood. Bill, I could take a shot at that. So I think what's happening is as our private equity and real assets businesses continue to grow quickly, some of the kinds of mandates we're getting in there are for things like limited partners and private capital and things like that, that are very, very profitable but don't have the same yield in terms of basis points. And that's probably what you're seeing. Capita has not closed. Has not closed. It's still hung up with some regulatory approvals and some other approvals. And we're not sure at this point what it's going to close. No. There's really no changes from our previous guidance. Last acquisition, I think, was in a vest in May. I'll take the last part here... Yes, I'll take about -- yes. That's about right. So that's about a 3.5% impact or so. 3% to 4% impact. Well, there's a little bit of decline in sequential revenue. But the midpoint scenario, right? And the fourth quarter also typically has higher costs related to employee reviews and raises that are effective on October 1. So we're going to see that increase in compensation and a few other expenses kind of go up sequentially in Q4. And then at the midpoint, revenue is down a little bit. We're continuing to see -- as I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to see broad based flows. So really, all of the different parts of our business, whether it's hedge funds and different strategies within hedge funds, private equity, real assets, we're seeing some flows into. The private equity and real assets have tended to raise some larger funds. And so maybe it's skewed a little bit in that direction. And within the hedge fund market, the credit focus funds continue to do pretty well, but it is pretty widespread."

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. While a majority of our workforce is still remote, we have opened 4 international offices and are in the planning phase for several more. We are all anxious to return to normalcy but the health and well-being of our employees is our first priority. We're monitoring guidelines from governments and health authorities around the world, including the CDC here in the United States and will not open an office unless it's safe to do so. \n SS&C continues to innovate how our employees continue to collaborate despite working from home. Within Intralinks, we have enhanced our investor vision portal with expanded general partner capabilities, launched an Intralink steel marketing and road show offering and integrated Zoom web conferences. Integration between Algorithmics and Singularity brings embedded risk analytics to our Singularity product. We have already signed one client using this expanded functionality and are building momentum. \n We've also rebranded our Global Transfer Agency Business to Global Investor and Distribution Solutions, GIDS. GIDS delivers transfer agency and investor servicing powered by a single global servicing platform. Nick Wright, previously leading Financial Services International has assumed the newly created role of Head of GIDS to bring together SS&C's transfer agency capabilities around the world. \n Now I will mention some key deals for Q3. A $40 billion in asset hedge fund and turn fund administration client licensed Geneva for their internal operations. A long-term Advent client upgraded their APX license to a cloud delivery solution added Genesis for rinsing capabilities and BD Link as an investor portal, an existing large strategic client looking to consolidate vendors extended our transfer agency services to their European operations. The Boutique Superannuation Fund based in Australia licensed our Bluedoor solution for its ability to meet their complex requirements. \n An existing SS&C health client absorbing a number of acquisitions that the resulting increased membership required additional licenses and infrastructure to support their growth. A large hedge fund-based in Boston expanded their fund administration services, a $4 billion in asset hedge fund shows SS&C's fund administration services, including middle office, regulatory reporting and tax preparation, citing our reputation and commitment to implement on a tight time frame. The European alternative investment manager converted to SS&C fund services from a competitor due to our expertise and ability to meet loan servicing requirements. \n A large DSD insurance client required a reporting solution and chose to license vision, with a successful cross-sell offer between DSD and our institutional and investment management group. \n I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials. Yes, I can certainly start and maybe Patrick can comment on the underlying assumptions. But I think that the business is -- we have pretty good performance across the board in Q3, but the businesses that -- the highlights of our fund administration had a -- really a pretty good quarter. And we also saw within Intralinks a bounce back or starting to build some momentum in the M&A business again, and so Intralinks had a pretty good quarter as well. And Patrick, if you could comment on the guidance or the scenarios, rather? Yes. I think just to add to some of that, there are signs that people are getting more comfortable. So I think people are adjusting to the -- and like Bill said a little while ago, some of the things that -- some of their challenges, those challenges do need to get solved, right? But at the same time, this is all about rate of buying behavior more than anything else. So we are seeing prospects make decisions and sign contracts and move forward. And maybe there's -- maybe the rate of that happening is a little better than it was 3, 4 months ago, for sure, but it's not -- it's nowhere close to what it would be in that normalized environment. And I think that's really what we're facing."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Justine Stone. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nJustine Stone: Hi, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for our Q2 2020 earnings call. I'm Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Pedonti, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, we need to review the safe harbor statement. Please note that various remarks we make today about future expectations, plans and prospects, including the financial outlook we provide, constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and can also be accessed on our website. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of today, July 28, 2020. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in today's earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Stone: Thanks, Justine, and thanks everyone for joining us today. I hope you and yours are home safe and healthy. I'll discuss our results for the quarter and then talk through our assumptions for the remainder of the year as we continue to navigate in a COVID-19 world. Our results for the second quarter were $1.1408 billion in adjusted revenue, down 1.3%; and $1.04 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 14.3%. Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $448.4 million, and adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin remained constant at 39.3%. Our Q2 adjusted organic revenue was down 1.4%. Many perpetual license software and complex outsourcing deals have been pushed as well as delayed fund launches, but firms are now adjusting to the new environment. We continue to see strength in the alternative funds administration and Eze businesses with 4.6% and 3.6% organic growth, respectively. We were encouraged by Intralinks' solid performance of 3% organic growth. DST in our perpetual license businesses saw a bit more Q2 weakness, but we are encouraged by our large deal pipeline and initial Q3 acceptances of our bids. Operating cash flow was $555.7 million for the first 6 months ended June 30, 2020, a 33.4% increase from the $416.6 million for the prior 6 months. Our secured net leverage ratio was 2.53x, and our total net leverage ratio was 3.6x. With our secured leverage levels well below 3x, we will consider other uses of free cash flow, including stock buybacks, which you have seen we have renewed and increased our authorized buyback program to $750 million. In Q2, we bought back 0.5 million shares of common stock at an average price of $58.62 per share or $27.9 million. Despite the challenges of COVID-19 and the global economic shutdown has presented us, SS&C has maintained a high level of service to our customers and has continued to win mandates. One of our largest strategic partners has transitioned all technology operations in Canada and Europe to SS&C's international potential services business. This equates to tens of millions of dollars in revenue annually, and we started to recognize a portion of this in Q2. We also have set a high alternative assets under administration, the high-level mark, of $1.81 trillion. This was driven by lower-than-average fund closures in Q2, new mandates won, and a big rebound in organic assets under administration growth. We believe alternative asset management are well positioned in these volatile markets. Black Diamond continues to grow nicely and had its best-ever sales quarter in Q2, including a contract with the wealth management division of a top 10 U.S. bank. We have updated our 2020 scenario analysis, which can be found on Page 4 and 5 of our earnings result slides. We are now using the 2021 scenario as our baseline with an incremental increase or decrease in revenue of about $40 million dependent upon the state of the economy for the rest of 2020. We anticipate earnings per share to come in at $4.10 as our baseline. This is up $0.27 from our original 2021 scenario. We are also excited about changes to our senior management team. Dan DelMastro is assuming the reins of SS&C Health. And as previously announced in Q2, Karen Geiger and Steve Leivent are leading our Advent business. I'll now turn it over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks, Bill. Our operations are well settled into remote working conditions as a result of COVID, and our clients have complimented us on the quality of our delivery. We have maintained revenue retention rates and continue to grow in some of our key markets. We saw growth in alternative fund services, Eze and Intralinks in Q2. Drivers included competitive takeaways in alternatives, heightened trading volumes in Eze, and a large payment protection plan win for Intralinks, offsetting a reduction in M&A volumes. As expected, we saw a slowdown in perpetual license sales in our institutional and investment management and other software license businesses. DST revenue was impacted by reduced volumes and activity in both financial services and health care as well as a reduction in interest revenues due to the interest rate decline. Our pipeline remains strong, and we are optimistic about being able to win large mandates at DST and elsewhere in our business over the next few quarters. The products and services we provide are mission-critical to our client base, and we have seen a significant increase in log-in and usage activity on our web and mobile client portals and applications. We have increased inbound interest for cloud hosting and outsourced services as firms in this remote working environment look to us to provide access to production systems and augment their staff and processing capability. We're making investments in our business to innovate and support our clients. Black Diamond's new time line feature that allows for personalized digital communication at scale was adopted by over 60 clients in Q2. In SS&C Health, we're developing dashboards that are updated in real time related to COVID-19 product utilization and trends. We're using the Vidado technology to help state and local governments scan handwritten medical documents and forms. Algorithmics continues to perform well, and we have several ongoing projects to incorporate the technology into our existing solutions. Now I will mention some key deals for Q2. A large fund administration client using Geneva upgraded to our cloud delivery solution, giving them our application and IT infrastructure in one solution. A U.S. bank bought our Black Diamond solution to help them attract registered investment advisers. An independent money manager with over $100 billion in assets bought a suite of SS&C products, including Global Wealth Platform. They needed a comprehensive end-to-end solution with scalability to handle high volumes. An existing health care client added our Drug Discount Wrap to their suite of services. A large Brazilian asset manager chose SS&C GlobeOp's fund services suite, citing our team's expertise and technology. A commercial real estate company chose Precision LM for their loan origination and servicing. A $20 billion U.K.-based investment manager looking to consolidate vendors moved an additional fund from a competitor to SS&C GlobeOp. A $28 billion alternative manager upgraded to Eze Eclipse. They were impressed with the interface and anywhere, anytime functionality. I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials.\nPatrick Pedonti: Thank you. The results for the second quarter were GAAP revenues of $1.1381 billion, GAAP net income of $169.5 million and diluted EPS of $0.64. Adjusted revenue was $1.1408 billion, excluding the impact of the adoption of revenue standard 606 and for acquired deferred revenue adjustments for the acquisition. Adjusted revenue was down 1.3%. Adjusted operating income increased 0.9%, and adjusted EPS was $1.04, a 14.3% increase over Q2 2019. Adjusted revenue decreased $15 million or 1.3% over Q2 2019. The acquisitions contributed $25.1 million. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $7.2 million or 0.6% in the quarter. An organic decline on a constant currency basis was 1.4% driven by weakness in the health care transfer agency, Advent Software products, due to the current environment. These were offset by strength in fund administration, the Eze business, Intralinks and institutional products. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2020 was $430.1 million, an increase of $3.9 million or 0.9% in the second quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of $8.3 million in expenses in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins improved from 36.9% in 2019 to 37.7% in the second quarter of 2020 driven by lower personnel costs, lower third-party service expenses, lower out-of-pocket expenses and lower travel expenses. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA defined in Note 3 of the earnings release was $448.4 million or 39.3% of adjusted revenue, a slight increase of $0.2 million over Q2 '19. Interest expense for the second quarter was 220 -- of 2020 was $60.5 million and includes $3.5 million of noncash amortized financing costs in OID. The average rate in the quarter for our credit facility and the senior notes was 3.19% compared to 4.96% in the second quarter of 2019 and resulted in an interest expense decrease of $43.8 million. We recorded a GAAP tax provision of $29.5 million or 14.8% of pretax income. Adjusted net income as defined in Note 4 in the earnings release was $276.1 million, and adjusted EPS was $1.04. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares increased slightly to 265.8 million in the quarter. The impact of option exercises and share issuance was offset by a decrease in the average share price. On our balance sheet and cash flow, as of June 30, we had approximately $262 million of cash, cash equivalents and approximately $7 billion of gross debt for a net debt position of approximately $6.7 billion. Operating cash flow for the 6 months ended June 2020 was $555.7 million, a $139 million increase or 34 -- 33.4% compared to the same period in 2019. For the 6 -- for the first 6 months of this year, we paid off gross debt of $503.3 million and we borrowed $246 million on our revolver in the first quarter. The $246 million revolver was paid off in the second quarter. We paid $133.1 million of cash interest compared to $169.9 million in the same period last year. We paid $34.7 million in cash taxes compared to $125.8 million in the same period last year as we deferred some tax payments into Q3 2020. Accounts receivable DSO was 53.3 days compared to 52.5 as of March and 49.7 as of December 2019. We used approximately $52 million of cash or 2.2% of adjusted revenue for capital expenditures and capitalized software mostly for IT as well as leasehold improvements. The first 6 months, we declared and paid $64 million of common stock dividends compared to $50.6 million in the same period last year. And we used $27.8 million cash to buy back 0.5 million shares of treasury stock at an average price of $58.62. Our LTM consolidated EBITDA that we use for covenant compliance was $1,864,000 as of June 2020 and includes $16.1 million of acquired EBITDA and cost savings related to our acquisitions. Based on net debt of $6.7 billion, our total leverage ratio was 3.6x and our secured leverage ratio was 2.53x as of June 30. On the remainder of the year, due to the current unpredictability of the market and economic conditions, we are providing 3 scenarios for the year depending on the timing of the recovery. These are the assumptions on these scenarios. Markets will continue to be volatile. Large-scale outsourcing deals and license deals are impacted. AUA levels remain flat, and fund launches are delayed. As we're focusing on client service, retention rates will continue to be in the range of our most recent results. We've assumed foreign currency exchange to be at where they are at current levels. Adjusted organic growth for the year will be in the range of negative 1% to negative 2.7%. Interest rates on our term loan facility will be approximately the 1-month LIBOR plus the spread, which is currently 175 bps. We will manage our expenses during this period by controlling variable expenses and staff hiring. We'll continue to invest in our business for the long term with capital expenditures of approximately 2.5% of revenues. And we'll continue to use a tax rate of approximately 26% on adjusted basis. The first scenario assumes that the economic conditions start improving in the fourth quarter of 2020. And in this assumption, we expect approximately the following results: adjusted revenue of $4.640 billion; adjusted net income of $1.107 billion; diluted shares of 267.5 million; and operating cash flow of $1.1 billion. The second scenario assumes economic conditions start improving in the first quarter of 2021. And in this assumption, we expect approximately the following results: adjusted revenue of $4.6 billion; adjusted net income of $1,093.5 billion; diluted shares of 267 million; and operating cash flow of $1.090 billion. The third scenario assumes that the economic conditions don't start improving until the second half of 2021. And under this assumption, we expect approximately the following results: adjusted revenue of $4.560 billion; adjusted net income of $1.080 billion; diluted shares of 266.5 million; and operating cash flow of $1.075 billion. And I'll turn it back over to Bill for closing comments.\nWilliam Stone: Thanks, Patrick. In closing, I'd like to thank the 23,300 people for staying focused -- 23,300 people that work for SS&C for staying focused and delivering. We are blessed to have such a talented workforce. I'd also like to reiterate the confidence we have in our business model, its cash flow characteristics and resiliency. While we cannot control the macroeconomic headwinds of COVID-19, we can control the quality of our deliverables and our high-touch customer service. We have solid visibility into our earnings and cash flow generation for the remainder of the year, and we will continue to manage cost, track receivables and support our sales force in winning new businesses. Our pipeline continues to grow with specific large opportunities within SS&C Health and Retirement Solutions. We believe we will come out of this current crisis as a stronger company. With that, I'll turn it over to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.\nSurinder Thind: Can you help me -- when I look at the second half for guidance, can you break that down in terms of your expectations for what you're seeing in terms of maybe the Eze growth -- or DST versus the rest of the business. If you can break that out versus -- and Intralinks as well, please.\nWilliam Stone: Well, I think that overall, we think the business is, I think, looking at 1 point to 2.7%. And I would say that -- as we said on the call, that we think that the fund administration, the Eze business and Intralinks will probably grow at the low end of our expectations at the beginning of the year but still probably grow somewhere between 3% and 4.5%. We would expect DST to probably be flat to down 2%. We have several very large deals in DST, but they have to sign and they have to start generating revenue. So we're optimistic about DST in 2021. But for 2020, they will continue to be revenue challenged, but we still will generate tremendous cash flow and earnings.\nSurinder Thind: And then as a follow-up, when I look at your margin guidance, obviously, versus the guidance that was provided in the last quarter, the expectation is sort of margins to be better, but it's also expected that margins will be relatively steady regardless of the revenue outcome. And so are you guys targeting margins at this point? Or how should we think about that aspect?\nWilliam Stone: I think that in general, we target margins at about 40% EBITDA margins. And we haven't really changed that. And it's going to bounce between 38% and 42%. And a lot of that is going to -- at the beginning of this COVID thing, we bought a lot of equipment, shipped it out and expensed it all right in. And so there's going to be times when our expenses are a little bit higher, and there'd be other times when our revenue is a little bit higher. But I would say that in general, that's about where we target our consolidated EBITDA percentages.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hill with Rosenblatt.\nKenneth Hill: Just wanted to ask one on kind of the capital allocation front. You guys have leverage. It seems like where you need it, you had the share repurchase authorization there. But I was hoping you could talk a little bit about M&A and how that fits into the picture and maybe what you're seeing as it relates to the ability to approach companies right now in the environment, evaluate transactions and actually start implementing on them, that would be helpful.\nWilliam Stone: Well, we constantly go after acquisition candidates, and we're methodical about it, and then we're also disciplined about what we're going to pay. Even in today's world, I mean there was a company that just sold today for somewhere around 30x EBITDA. And it's very difficult for us to do that and see how we ever make money with that. But we have plenty of firepower. We have plenty of management bandwidth. So we're active. But right now, even in today's world, it's a pretty high price for good assets.\nKenneth Hill: Okay. Fair enough. I just had one question then on the guidance differences between the baseline scenario, the kind of 2021 recovery piece. It looked like revenues went up by about $50 million. Is it fair to assume that Innovest is coming in there? I think that was -- you guys had a target of around $40 million-ish in revenue, growing at a high single-digit rate. And then kind of any thoughts on the impact on net income? Is that actually coming into the higher margin just given the net income uptake was greater in your most recent guidance?\nRahul Kanwar: I think the -- this is Rahul. The change in the scenario -- Innovest is definitely a part of it, probably about half. I think the rest of it is we did a little better in Q2, and we expect to do a little better in Q3 and Q4 from that baseline 2021 scenario. Margin on Innovest at least right now, we expect to be about 20% or so and then we've got improvement plans to get up from there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlexander Kramm: In terms of your scenarios, you obviously are saying economic recovery, but can you kind of lay out what really needs to happen for the business to reaccelerate in terms of the pandemic? I mean it seems like your business is very reliant upon going into seeing clients, doing installs or using consultants on-premise. So any flavor you can give us, like how you think that will progress from here considering that, well, on the financial services industry -- and I think we're all very conservative in terms of going back to offices and letting people back in our premises, so -- and then maybe how have you changed your business to kind of get around that? And how much of your business can do off-premise, I guess, or cloud? That makes sense?\nWilliam Stone: Yes. So Alex, as you take a look at it, right, 99% of our people work from home, right? So we are either working on an individual client's account where the data reside in our data farms and the systems reside in our data farms or we're working where the systems and data reside in their data farms, often which might be a third-party data farm. So the work, even the implementation work, is pretty similar. The difference is that you're doing it from your home rather than from your desk and you're not surrounded by other people doing the same thing. You're working from home. So in some ways, you get better productivity because you get the focus and there's not the interruption of the office. And in another way, there's challenges because you don't have access as readily to expertise right around you. But in general, the business operates the same once we secure a client and begin the implementation. What's more challenging a little bit is on large-scale sales opportunity. It's a lot of Zoom meetings and a lot of relationship building from a touch point, \"Hey, we know Alex Kramm at UBS,\" or \"We know Surinder at Jefferies,\" or \"We know somebody else,\" right, and trying to connect all those dots to get whoever is in the buying position to be comfortable to buy from us. And that becomes a little bit more challenging when it's done from a remote basis, and they can't look in the eye and ask you the really hard questions and see how you handle them and those kinds of things. So I would say that's the biggest difference. And Rahul, you can comment on that.\nRahul Kanwar: Bill, I would just add -- obviously, I agree with that. And I would just add, in particular, it's the large capital expenditures, right, so people that are buying perpetual licenses or they're going to kick off some projects that has a lengthy conversion period and they really need to get comfortable with our team and environment. That's where we've seen some slowdown so far this year. But as Bill said in his remarks, we're starting to see people get more comfortable even in this remote working environment and make some of those decisions. So coming back to these scenarios, I think the assumption is under the recovery scenario or the improvement scenario that we have, we continue to have that and we have people go back to making decisions on some of those larger deals.\nAlexander Kramm: Okay. Fair enough. And then you said DST is still going to be fairly challenged this year but maybe more positive next year. So do you think it can actually grow next year? And any sort of ranges where you think next year can already be for that business?\nWilliam Stone: Well, we've gotten some solid acceptances of our bids in Q3. I mean we haven't signed the contracts yet, but we're in the midst of contract negotiations on those and we've been selected. And that totals upwards $50 million, $60 million, and we have a full pipeline of other deals. And so we're getting some traction. And so we think that there's an opportunity that DST in 2021 could be positive in the 1% to 2% range.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Crédit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Congrats to everybody on the great quarter and especially with the performance on Intralinks. Can you talk about the puts and takes between M&A activity and corporate use cases? And how should we calibrate our expectations going forward for Intralinks coming off of this large PPP-related win and just the overall strength in the quarter?\nWilliam Stone: Well, first, I think Ken Bisconti and Bob Petrocchi, who we put in charge of that business, I guess, about 8 or 9 months ago, have really done a great job, right? They're on top of it. They know their customers. They know their markets and they're aggressive. And Intralinks also has a very good development organization, and they've been bringing out new products and services. And I think that even though M&A has been down, I think, 7% so far in the first 6 months, they've been able to use their data room capability for other things such as tracking this PPP program for one of the largest banks in the country and also for other things. And so I would just say that it's a pretty flexible business. It's a really bright workforce, and Ken and Bob are good leaders. Rahul may say something else.\nRahul Kanwar: Well, I would add that secure document exchange, right, is obviously a lot broader than just M&A. So we found some good use cases for it with the Payment Protection Program, but there's plenty other use cases that I think Bob and Ken and their sales teams and development teams are working on.\nBrad Zelnick: Can I just follow up one for Patrick? Appreciate the very thorough disclosure, and I might have missed it, but can you just help to reconcile the really strong first half cash flow generation and the scenario guidance that actually ticks down on cash flow? Is that just the acquisitions or I'm missing something else?\nPatrick Pedonti: Well, the main difference is that we were able to defer about $50 million, $60 million of cash tax payments from Q2 to Q3 as per the legislation that Congress passed. So we have to make a tax payment of about $60 million in July 15. So essentially, we moved tax payments from Q2 to Q3. So that helped Q2 cash flow a little bit, but we also had strong collections and good revenues for the quarter that helped cash flow.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi.\nAndrew Schmidt: Question on organic growth. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about just thoughts on how organic growth should trend sequentially into the third quarter. It seems like the outlook suggests that there's a sequential decline in organic revenue. So I'm just trying to reconcile what's going on from quarter to quarter would be helpful.\nWilliam Stone: Well, we still have some runoff in the DST business. So that's a bit of a headwind. We've also had, as you know, some challenges in being able to close large perpetual license deals. And then on the large outsourcing deals we have, sometimes the revenue doesn't ramp up for a couple of quarters. So those are 3 reasons for -- or kind of a flat organic revenue picture between the second quarter and the fourth quarter. Rahul, do you have a comment on that?\nRahul Kanwar: No. I think that -- I think in the baseline scenario, we are assuming that sales and sales activity remains at current levels and doesn't get a lot better and doesn't get a lot worse from here, hence, kind of a flattish outlook. If that starts to come back, then we expect to be closer to our economic improvement scenario.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. That's helpful. And then retention, that's a pretty bright spot, sticking with the 96% rate. That's an LTM measure. Can you just talk a little bit how it trended in the most recent quarter? And then if there are any variations by product or service, that would be helpful.\nPatrick Pedonti: I think the LTM trended down from 96.4% to 96%. So it was a little bit of a decline on the LTM basis. And pretty much all the businesses have high retention rates in that range. There's no really outliers. They're pretty much hanging in that range, most of the businesses.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.\nAshish Sabadra: Congrats on the solid results. A question about the DST deals that are in the pipeline right now. I was just wondering if you could provide any flavor or color around whether those are transfer agency deals, any color on those fronts. And then also on the health care side, I understand some of the headwinds near term because some of the elective surgeries are getting -- facilities are getting pushed down, but can you just talk about the momentum in that business, ability to sign new deals on the health care front as well?\nWilliam Stone: Yes. So on the deal picture, we have several large deals in both fund services business and our health care business. And so those look pretty good to us, and we have a couple very nice deals in financial services. So it's across the board in DST and it's been a lot of hard work, and a lot of people have done yeoman's work in filling out RFPs and meeting with various prospects. So that's been the kind of -- and I would say we probably have a pipeline of maybe 10 deals in the DST business that has somewhere between $10 million and $30 million in revenue attached. And then the second part of your question was about -- I'm sorry but I don't recall.\nAshish Sabadra: Yes. No, no. Just about health care and the deal flow on that front as well and just the near-term headwind that we are seeing on the health care side and just as you think about when do we start to see that normalize going forward.\nWilliam Stone: Well, that's right. I mean in particular, right, at the beginning of the pandemic, everybody rushed out and got their prescriptions refilled, and there was a lot of value into us. But obviously, once you've done that, you don't need to continuously refill it. So with that part of the business, slowed down a little bit. And then we get a lot of business in paying claims on the -- on elective surgery in our health plan business and stuff like that. So without any elective surgeries, there's again less prescriptions for pain, less prescriptions for antibiotics and other things like that. So we're waiting for the elective surgery process to come back. And obviously, if the hospital beds are all taken up by COVID patients, then that's not going to happen. So those are the types of things that went into our thought process on our scenarios. So I think they're well thought out. I think we have opportunities in health care. And I would tell you that we're pretty optimistic that we're going to have a really good '21, and we're going to have a very solid end to '20.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful. And maybe just a quick question on alternatives. Alternatives delivered a pretty strong growth in this quarter as well. And Rahul, you mentioned share gains there, competitive events on that front. I was just wondering if you could talk about both private equity as well as hedge funds. What are you seeing on both those fronts?\nRahul Kanwar: Yes. So it's been pretty much across the board there as well. In our hedge business, we've seen new funds -- clients start new funds. We've had some competitive wins. We've had organic rebound from the decline earlier in the year. And our private equity and real assets businesses are -- remain very strong both in terms of wins as well as the prospects that we have and several large deals that we're working. So across the board, alternatives has been pretty good.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with Davidson.\nPeter Heckmann: Patrick, just a minutia, but was there a onetime gain from the sale of an asset in the quarter?\nPatrick Pedonti: There was. You can see the adjustment in the cash flow statement.\nPeter Heckmann: I got that far, yes.\nPatrick Pedonti: It's mark-to-market and a gain.\nPeter Heckmann: Got it. Got it.\nPatrick Pedonti: The $16.5 million.\nPeter Heckmann: That's the gain, and $34 million was the proceeds -- total proceeds.\nPatrick Pedonti: Right.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. And then within your scenario guidance, have you assumed any level of buybacks?\nPatrick Pedonti: We haven't assumed any level of buybacks in the scenarios and diluted shares count.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. Great. And then just -- can you give me an approximate number for just the perpetual software license fees in the quarter?\nPatrick Pedonti: Professional services revenue in the quarter?\nPeter Heckmann: I'm sorry. Perpetual software license fees -- or total license fee revenue would be fine. Just trying to get a feel...\nPatrick Pedonti: Perpetual licenses?\nPeter Heckmann: Yes.\nPatrick Pedonti: It was $5.9 million.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader with JPMorgan.\nJackson Ader: First one actually is on -- is the, call it, 3.5% organic growth or so. Curious how much of that was driven by -- if you can rank order maybe the volumes that you saw in the market versus new logo wins.\nWilliam Stone: Go ahead, Rahul.\nRahul Kanwar: Yes. So I would say probably 60% of it was market volumes and volatility, and 40% of it was new sales both on Eze as well as the new Eclipse platform. So Mike Hutner and his team have been doing a pretty good job of both accelerating the development and innovation we have on that as well as getting the prospects to buy even in this environment. So pretty pleased about that. And I'd say 60-40.\nJackson Ader: And so just a quick follow-up on that. Is that about what you guys are kind of expecting in the long term? Or is that being impacted by the economic outlook as well just in terms of logo additions and, call it, nonvolume-related growth with the Eze business?\nRahul Kanwar: I think we're expecting nonvolume-related growth to get -- to continue to get better from here. Obviously, when you sell a deal, in the beginning, you don't get all the revenue. You get some kind of ramped down revenue during the implementation period. I think that's kind of where we are right now on the new clients that we have sold recently. And so we expect those clients to get up to full strength, and we expect to continue to sell more run rate revenue. So we do expect it to grow over time.\nJackson Ader: That's great. And then if I could just sneak in one quick one. The DST headwinds, we've passed it out certainly pretty thoroughly tonight. But just asked a different way, is the DST exposure or maybe the perpetual mix, what -- is anything surprising you as far as maybe how relatively less resilient that business has been relative to the other businesses that you have?\nWilliam Stone: I don't think so. I think that it's a big, complex business that is getting a pretty hefty overhaul. And as you go through this pretty hefty overhaul, there's all kinds of things you find, right? This is a business that when we bought it had 16,400 head count and $420 million, $430 million in EBITDA. And now it has less head count and closer to $800 million in EBITDA. And so we're trying to do things in a wise way. We think there's some great opportunities and we have some great clients, and we have to suggest to them and present to them things they want to buy. We can't be in the business of building things we want to build. We have to build things that people want to buy, and I think we're making progress in that regard. And I think that's the -- will end up being the holy grail. There's no -- nothing magic here. It's just hard work with very large clients and generally very big systems that need some innovation and some new product deliveries.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair.\nChristopher Shutler: Could you talk about the reasons for the management changes at both Advent and DST Health recently?\nWilliam Stone: At Advent, Rob Roley, who was running that business for the last couple of years for us and have been with Advent for 19 years, had -- got an offer to go be an operating partner at a large private equity firm and he decided to do it. And he's also from California, and he was living in New York with us, and there's a good chance he'll move back to the West Coast. So he's a great guy. We wish him well. And Karen and Leivent -- Steve had been running the Black Diamond business for a long time. And I think Karen has been the #2 person to Rob for a number of years. And so we're both excited about Karen and Steve's opportunity. And also, we wish Robert well. So not much else there. And then we've been bang around the health care business a little bit now for over 2 years and 3 months. And Danny DelMastro, who started a company called Aero-Med in Connecticut and grew that to a pretty large company and sold it to Cardinal Health and was a senior executive at Cardinal Health for 4 years, I think, and then left there, and we were fortunate enough to pick him up. And we've been impressed with his presence and sales capability and executive capabilities. So we decided to put him in charge. And we think he's done a great job for us, and he has great client relationships, and we're excited about our opportunities.\nChristopher Shutler: Okay, Bill. And then I guess looking at the scenarios, the baseline scenarios' revenue is, I think, a little bit lower if we normalize for Innovest, but the profit is up nicely versus your original guidance -- or the original scenarios rather. So I guess the question is, where are you taking out costs considerably more aggressively than the original scenarios?\nWilliam Stone: Well, I think a couple of things. I mean obviously, we appreciate that the Federal Reserve has interest rates at 19 basis points or something. So interest costs are a lot less.\nChristopher Shutler: That helps.\nWilliam Stone: Yes, that helps. And then obviously, we're also moving from 1,900 contractors or so. We will have, I believe, none by the end of August. And we will get a big pickup in expense savings from moving those contractors to employees. And then third, obviously, travel and entertainment is dormant, the most part. And so that saved us a tremendous amount of money. And then there's a bunch of things that go with the commute and paying for all kinds of different things for our people to get into and backhaul. So there's none of those commute expenses and stuff like that. So I think the expense, in general, will tend to be -- will be pretty moderated.\nChristopher Shutler: Bill, just to follow up on that, the move from contractors to employees. Like when did that process really begin in earnest? And it sounds like it's completing soon.\nWilliam Stone: I think we notified Syntel about a year ago because that's what the contract said, and we started onboarding as employees probably in about March, and we were hoping to be done by the end of June, but COVID kind of bumped into that a little bit. So now we expect it to be done by the end of August. Is that pretty accurate, Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: Yes. That's right, Bill.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJonathan Lee: This is Jonathan on for James. How has pricing held up? And is there any sort of appetite for further price increases in this environment?\nWilliam Stone: Well, we certainly have appetite for it. I guess you're probably asking one of our clients' appetite for it.\nJonathan Lee: That's fair.\nRahul Kanwar: If I could add, it's held up pretty well in the sense that deals that we are winning, we're not seeing any trends that force us to kind of revise pricing down or anything like that. And I think on the price increase process, we're pretty pleased with how that went at the end of the year. And we think most of our clients understand that we need to deliver more value. And in exchange, we would like a little bit of an uptick on a regular basis. So we do think that, that process is going to be good for us over the long term.\nJonathan Lee: Understood. And it may be early days, but how are you thinking about the potential for cost takeouts for '21 versus the expense controls that you have in place for '20?\nWilliam Stone: Yes. I wouldn't say that we have anything that is right on the horizon. The people that run our businesses are in charge of going through their budget and making sure that we have meaningful work for everyone. But we're a strong, profitable company, and we like our workforce and we want to support them. And our -- most of our costs are employee-related. So we're very, very circumspect about how we go about that process. And we think this move of bringing the contractors into the fold -- and most of the stuff you can do through attrition if you want to have a smaller workforce. So we're optimistic that we're going to be able to have great margins, high cash flow and really good earnings.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlexander Kramm: Just want to come back to organic growth for a minute. I think there's still a little bit of confusion here, what changed at least there for me. So I think your old kind of range was 0 to negative 2%, and now it's negative 1% to negative 2.7%. So I think you said a lot of things on this call. But can you just kind of sum up what really changed and I -- because I think you did better than you thought in the second quarter as well.\nWilliam Stone: Well, again, Alex, I think the organic revenue numbers are going to get tied to our ability to close new business and be able to drive that business into revenue in Q3 and Q4 and obviously in Q2 as well but given that the real revenue pops you get in this business are when you do large-scale perpetual licenses because they close immediately. So given that, that has slowed down. I think that's kind of the biggest issue on organic revenue growth impact between Q2 and in the second half of the year.\nAlexander Kramm: Okay. And then just one quick one. You raised your buyback authorization significantly, but you really haven't shown much appetite to buy back. So it's nice to have the authorization. But with the stock basically trading at the lowest relative level it has in history, I think, relative to the S&P 500, I mean what does it take for you to actually do something with the authorization?\nWilliam Stone: Alex, it takes courage and it also -- it takes not having acquisitions that you're thinking about closing and deciding that the acquisitions are inferior to buying back our own stock. So we try to be judicious about not buying our stock and understanding the ramifications of buying back stock versus paying down debt. I mean -- I think a first year finance person can figure out that buying back stock from an economic standpoint is better for us than paying down debt, but there's still a perception that no leverage is better than some leverage. And so it's just a -- it's always a catch-22, but we didn't raise our authorization to just raise our authorization. If we go in, it's like most things we do. We don't go in half-hearted, right? We spent $8.4 billion in 2018 to buy companies. And over the last 10 or 12 years, I think we spent about $14 billion to buy companies. So we're not afraid to make decisions and make large decisions. It's just trying to do it at the right time. And maybe we've been a little bit too searching a perfect when we could have had excellent times, but we're not bashful about our track record. We kind of like it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: Just one question from me, a follow-up on the question earlier about pricing. There were a couple of lawsuits filed this past quarter that seem at least indirectly related to your pricing initiatives. To what extent were those lawsuits and those client disagreements outliers in terms of pushback to your pricing efforts? Or is there -- or has there been some broad resistance to you guys trying to adjust your pricing?\nWilliam Stone: I think they were outliers. You're not going to be able to do price increases. And I think that there -- it's also -- some of the things are contractual. There's contractual issues in both cases that have nothing to do with pricing. So I just think they're outliers, and we don't -- we have great relationships with our clients, which is evidenced by our 96.2% retention rate in that type of stuff. So I think those are both outliers. I don't know if you have a different comment, Rahul.\nRahul Kanwar: Bill, I'd agree with that. And like Bill said, the issues in those items are -- for the most part, the significant issues are unrelated to this pricing initiative we've had.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Bill Stone.\nWilliam Stone: Well, again, thanks, everybody, for being on the call. We are focused on our business and excited about our opportunities, and we believe that we have great opportunities through the rest of this year and really set ourselves up for a great 2021. So thanks again, and we look forward to talking to you at the end of October. Thanks. Bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "William Stone",
            "content": "Thanks, Justine, and thanks everyone for joining us today. I hope you and yours are home safe and healthy. I'll discuss our results for the quarter and then talk through our assumptions for the remainder of the year as we continue to navigate in a COVID-19 world. Our results for the second quarter were $1.1408 billion in adjusted revenue, down 1.3%; and $1.04 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 14.3%. Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $448.4 million, and adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin remained constant at 39.3%. Our Q2 adjusted organic revenue was down 1.4%. Many perpetual license software and complex outsourcing deals have been pushed as well as delayed fund launches, but firms are now adjusting to the new environment. We continue to see strength in the alternative funds administration and Eze businesses with 4.6% and 3.6% organic growth, respectively. We were encouraged by Intralinks' solid performance of 3% organic growth. DST in our perpetual license businesses saw a bit more Q2 weakness, but we are encouraged by our large deal pipeline and initial Q3 acceptances of our bids. Operating cash flow was $555.7 million for the first 6 months ended June 30, 2020, a 33.4% increase from the $416.6 million for the prior 6 months. Our secured net leverage ratio was 2.53x, and our total net leverage ratio was 3.6x. With our secured leverage levels well below 3x, we will consider other uses of free cash flow, including stock buybacks, which you have seen we have renewed and increased our authorized buyback program to $750 million. In Q2, we bought back 0.5 million shares of common stock at an average price of $58.62 per share or $27.9 million. Despite the challenges of COVID-19 and the global economic shutdown has presented us, SS&C has maintained a high level of service to our customers and has continued to win mandates. One of our largest strategic partners has transitioned all technology operations in Canada and Europe to SS&C's international potential services business. This equates to tens of millions of dollars in revenue annually, and we started to recognize a portion of this in Q2. We also have set a high alternative assets under administration, the high-level mark, of $1.81 trillion. This was driven by lower-than-average fund closures in Q2, new mandates won, and a big rebound in organic assets under administration growth. We believe alternative asset management are well positioned in these volatile markets. Black Diamond continues to grow nicely and had its best-ever sales quarter in Q2, including a contract with the wealth management division of a top 10 U.S. bank. We have updated our 2020 scenario analysis, which can be found on Page 4 and 5 of our earnings result slides. We are now using the 2021 scenario as our baseline with an incremental increase or decrease in revenue of about $40 million dependent upon the state of the economy for the rest of 2020. We anticipate earnings per share to come in at $4.10 as our baseline. This is up $0.27 from our original 2021 scenario. We are also excited about changes to our senior management team. Dan DelMastro is assuming the reins of SS&C Health. And as previously announced in Q2, Karen Geiger and Steve Leivent are leading our Advent business. I'll now turn it over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Patrick. In closing, I'd like to thank the 23,300 people for staying focused -- 23,300 people that work for SS&C for staying focused and delivering. We are blessed to have such a talented workforce. I'd also like to reiterate the confidence we have in our business model, its cash flow characteristics and resiliency. While we cannot control the macroeconomic headwinds of COVID-19, we can control the quality of our deliverables and our high-touch customer service. We have solid visibility into our earnings and cash flow generation for the remainder of the year, and we will continue to manage cost, track receivables and support our sales force in winning new businesses. Our pipeline continues to grow with specific large opportunities within SS&C Health and Retirement Solutions. We believe we will come out of this current crisis as a stronger company. With that, I'll turn it over to questions. Well, I think that overall, we think the business is, I think, looking at 1 point to 2.7%. And I would say that -- as we said on the call, that we think that the fund administration, the Eze business and Intralinks will probably grow at the low end of our expectations at the beginning of the year but still probably grow somewhere between 3% and 4.5%. We would expect DST to probably be flat to down 2%. We have several very large deals in DST, but they have to sign and they have to start generating revenue. So we're optimistic about DST in 2021. But for 2020, they will continue to be revenue challenged, but we still will generate tremendous cash flow and earnings. I think that in general, we target margins at about 40% EBITDA margins. And we haven't really changed that. And it's going to bounce between 38% and 42%. And a lot of that is going to -- at the beginning of this COVID thing, we bought a lot of equipment, shipped it out and expensed it all right in. And so there's going to be times when our expenses are a little bit higher, and there'd be other times when our revenue is a little bit higher. But I would say that in general, that's about where we target our consolidated EBITDA percentages. Well, we constantly go after acquisition candidates, and we're methodical about it, and then we're also disciplined about what we're going to pay. Even in today's world, I mean there was a company that just sold today for somewhere around 30x EBITDA. And it's very difficult for us to do that and see how we ever make money with that. But we have plenty of firepower. We have plenty of management bandwidth. So we're active. But right now, even in today's world, it's a pretty high price for good assets. Yes. So Alex, as you take a look at it, right, 99% of our people work from home, right? So we are either working on an individual client's account where the data reside in our data farms and the systems reside in our data farms or we're working where the systems and data reside in their data farms, often which might be a third-party data farm. So the work, even the implementation work, is pretty similar. The difference is that you're doing it from your home rather than from your desk and you're not surrounded by other people doing the same thing. You're working from home. So in some ways, you get better productivity because you get the focus and there's not the interruption of the office. And in another way, there's challenges because you don't have access as readily to expertise right around you. But in general, the business operates the same once we secure a client and begin the implementation. What's more challenging a little bit is on large-scale sales opportunity. It's a lot of Zoom meetings and a lot of relationship building from a touch point, \"Hey, we know Alex Kramm at UBS,\" or \"We know Surinder at Jefferies,\" or \"We know somebody else,\" right, and trying to connect all those dots to get whoever is in the buying position to be comfortable to buy from us. And that becomes a little bit more challenging when it's done from a remote basis, and they can't look in the eye and ask you the really hard questions and see how you handle them and those kinds of things. So I would say that's the biggest difference. And Rahul, you can comment on that. Well, we've gotten some solid acceptances of our bids in Q3. I mean we haven't signed the contracts yet, but we're in the midst of contract negotiations on those and we've been selected. And that totals upwards $50 million, $60 million, and we have a full pipeline of other deals. And so we're getting some traction. And so we think that there's an opportunity that DST in 2021 could be positive in the 1% to 2% range. Well, first, I think Ken Bisconti and Bob Petrocchi, who we put in charge of that business, I guess, about 8 or 9 months ago, have really done a great job, right? They're on top of it. They know their customers. They know their markets and they're aggressive. And Intralinks also has a very good development organization, and they've been bringing out new products and services. And I think that even though M&A has been down, I think, 7% so far in the first 6 months, they've been able to use their data room capability for other things such as tracking this PPP program for one of the largest banks in the country and also for other things. And so I would just say that it's a pretty flexible business. It's a really bright workforce, and Ken and Bob are good leaders. Rahul may say something else. Well, we still have some runoff in the DST business. So that's a bit of a headwind. We've also had, as you know, some challenges in being able to close large perpetual license deals. And then on the large outsourcing deals we have, sometimes the revenue doesn't ramp up for a couple of quarters. So those are 3 reasons for -- or kind of a flat organic revenue picture between the second quarter and the fourth quarter. Rahul, do you have a comment on that? Yes. So on the deal picture, we have several large deals in both fund services business and our health care business. And so those look pretty good to us, and we have a couple very nice deals in financial services. So it's across the board in DST and it's been a lot of hard work, and a lot of people have done yeoman's work in filling out RFPs and meeting with various prospects. So that's been the kind of -- and I would say we probably have a pipeline of maybe 10 deals in the DST business that has somewhere between $10 million and $30 million in revenue attached. And then the second part of your question was about -- I'm sorry but I don't recall. Well, that's right. I mean in particular, right, at the beginning of the pandemic, everybody rushed out and got their prescriptions refilled, and there was a lot of value into us. But obviously, once you've done that, you don't need to continuously refill it. So with that part of the business, slowed down a little bit. And then we get a lot of business in paying claims on the -- on elective surgery in our health plan business and stuff like that. So without any elective surgeries, there's again less prescriptions for pain, less prescriptions for antibiotics and other things like that. So we're waiting for the elective surgery process to come back. And obviously, if the hospital beds are all taken up by COVID patients, then that's not going to happen. So those are the types of things that went into our thought process on our scenarios. So I think they're well thought out. I think we have opportunities in health care. And I would tell you that we're pretty optimistic that we're going to have a really good '21, and we're going to have a very solid end to '20. Go ahead, Rahul. I don't think so. I think that it's a big, complex business that is getting a pretty hefty overhaul. And as you go through this pretty hefty overhaul, there's all kinds of things you find, right? This is a business that when we bought it had 16,400 head count and $420 million, $430 million in EBITDA. And now it has less head count and closer to $800 million in EBITDA. And so we're trying to do things in a wise way. We think there's some great opportunities and we have some great clients, and we have to suggest to them and present to them things they want to buy. We can't be in the business of building things we want to build. We have to build things that people want to buy, and I think we're making progress in that regard. And I think that's the -- will end up being the holy grail. There's no -- nothing magic here. It's just hard work with very large clients and generally very big systems that need some innovation and some new product deliveries. At Advent, Rob Roley, who was running that business for the last couple of years for us and have been with Advent for 19 years, had -- got an offer to go be an operating partner at a large private equity firm and he decided to do it.

And so we're both excited about Karen and Steve's opportunity. And also, we wish Robert well. So not much else there.

Adjusted revenue was $1.1408 billion, excluding the impact of the adoption of revenue standard 606 and for acquired deferred revenue adjustments for the acquisition. Adjusted revenue was down 1.3%. Adjusted operating income increased 0.9%, and adjusted EPS was $1.04, a 14.3% increase over Q2 2019. Adjusted revenue decreased $15 million or 1.3% over Q2 2019. The acquisitions contributed $25.1 million. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $7.2 million or 0.6% in the quarter. An organic decline on a constant currency basis was 1.4% driven by weakness in the health care transfer agency, Advent Software products, due to the current environment. These were offset by strength in fund administration, the Eze business, Intralinks and institutional products. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2020 was $430.1 million, an increase of $3.9 million or 0.9% in the second quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of $8.3 million in expenses in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins improved from 36.9% in 2019 to 37.7% in the second quarter of 2020 driven by lower personnel costs, lower third-party service expenses, lower out-of-pocket expenses and lower travel expenses. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA defined in Note 3 of the earnings release was $448.4 million or 39.3% of adjusted revenue, a slight increase of $0.2 million over Q2 '19. Interest expense for the second quarter was 220 -- of 2020 was $60.5 million and includes $3.5 million of noncash amortized financing costs in OID. The average rate in the quarter for our credit facility and the senior notes was 3.19% compared to 4.96% in the second quarter of 2019 and resulted in an interest expense decrease of $43.8 million. We recorded a GAAP tax provision of $29.5 million or 14.8% of pretax income. Adjusted net income as defined in Note 4 in the earnings release was $276.1 million, and adjusted EPS was $1.04. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares increased slightly to 265.8 million in the quarter. The impact of option exercises and share issuance was offset by a decrease in the average share price. On our balance sheet and cash flow, as of June 30, we had approximately $262 million of cash, cash equivalents and approximately $7 billion of gross debt for a net debt position of approximately $6.7 billion. Operating cash flow for the 6 months ended June 2020 was $555.7 million, a $139 million increase or 34 -- 33.4% compared to the same period in 2019. For the 6 -- for the first 6 months of this year, we paid off gross debt of $503.3 million and we borrowed $246 million on our revolver in the first quarter. The $246 million revolver was paid off in the second quarter. We paid $133.1 million of cash interest compared to $169.9 million in the same period last year. We paid $34.7 million in cash taxes compared to $125.8 million in the same period last year as we deferred some tax payments into Q3 2020. Accounts receivable DSO was 53.3 days compared to 52.5 as of March and 49.7 as of December 2019. We used approximately $52 million of cash or 2.2% of adjusted revenue for capital expenditures and capitalized software mostly for IT as well as leasehold improvements. The first 6 months, we declared and paid $64 million of common stock dividends compared to $50.6 million in the same period last year. And we used $27.8 million cash to buy back 0.5 million shares of treasury stock at an average price of $58.62. Our LTM consolidated EBITDA that we use for covenant compliance was $1,864,000 as of June 2020 and includes $16.1 million of acquired EBITDA and cost savings related to our acquisitions. Based on net debt of $6.7 billion, our total leverage ratio was 3.6x and our secured leverage ratio was 2.53x as of June 30. On the remainder of the year, due to the current unpredictability of the market and economic conditions, we are providing 3 scenarios for the year depending on the timing of the recovery. These are the assumptions on these scenarios. Markets will continue to be volatile. Large-scale outsourcing deals and license deals are impacted. AUA levels remain flat, and fund launches are delayed. As we're focusing on client service, retention rates will continue to be in the range of our most recent results. We've assumed foreign currency exchange to be at where they are at current levels. Adjusted organic growth for the year will be in the range of negative 1% to negative 2.7%. Interest rates on our term loan facility will be approximately the 1-month LIBOR plus the spread, which is currently 175 bps. We will manage our expenses during this period by controlling variable expenses and staff hiring. We'll continue to invest in our business for the long term with capital expenditures of approximately 2.5% of revenues. And we'll continue to use a tax rate of approximately 26% on adjusted basis. The first scenario assumes that the economic conditions start improving in the fourth quarter of 2020. And in this assumption, we expect approximately the following results: adjusted revenue of $4.640 billion; adjusted net income of $1.107 billion; diluted shares of 267.5 million; and operating cash flow of $1.1 billion. The second scenario assumes economic conditions start improving in the first quarter of 2021. And in this assumption, we expect approximately the following results: adjusted revenue of $4.6 billion; adjusted net income of $1,093.5 billion; diluted shares of 267 million; and operating cash flow of $1.090 billion. The third scenario assumes that the economic conditions don't start improving until the second half of 2021. And under this assumption, we expect approximately the following results: adjusted revenue of $4.560 billion; adjusted net income of $1.080 billion; diluted shares of 266.5 million; and operating cash flow of $1.075 billion. And I'll turn it back over to Bill for closing comments. Well, the main difference is that we were able to defer about $50 million, $60 million of cash tax payments from Q2 to Q3 as per the legislation that Congress passed. So we have to make a tax payment of about $60 million in July 15. So essentially, we moved tax payments from Q2 to Q3. So that helped Q2 cash flow a little bit, but we also had strong collections and good revenues for the quarter that helped cash flow. I think the LTM trended down from 96.4% to 96%. So it was a little bit of a decline on the LTM basis. And pretty much all the businesses have high retention rates in that range. There's no really outliers. They're pretty much hanging in that range, most of the businesses. There was. You can see the adjustment in the cash flow statement. It's mark-to-market and a gain. The $16.5 million. Right. We haven't assumed any level of buybacks in the scenarios and diluted shares count. Professional services revenue in the quarter? Perpetual licenses? It was $5.9 million."

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Our operations are well settled into remote working conditions as a result of COVID, and our clients have complimented us on the quality of our delivery. We have maintained revenue retention rates and continue to grow in some of our key markets. We saw growth in alternative fund services, Eze and Intralinks in Q2. Drivers included competitive takeaways in alternatives, heightened trading volumes in Eze, and a large payment protection plan win for Intralinks, offsetting a reduction in M&A volumes. As expected, we saw a slowdown in perpetual license sales in our institutional and investment management and other software license businesses. DST revenue was impacted by reduced volumes and activity in both financial services and health care as well as a reduction in interest revenues due to the interest rate decline. Our pipeline remains strong, and we are optimistic about being able to win large mandates at DST and elsewhere in our business over the next few quarters. The products and services we provide are mission-critical to our client base, and we have seen a significant increase in log-in and usage activity on our web and mobile client portals and applications. We have increased inbound interest for cloud hosting and outsourced services as firms in this remote working environment look to us to provide access to production systems and augment their staff and processing capability. We're making investments in our business to innovate and support our clients. Black Diamond's new time line feature that allows for personalized digital communication at scale was adopted by over 60 clients in Q2. In SS&C Health, we're developing dashboards that are updated in real time related to COVID-19 product utilization and trends. We're using the Vidado technology to help state and local governments scan handwritten medical documents and forms. Algorithmics continues to perform well, and we have several ongoing projects to incorporate the technology into our existing solutions. Now I will mention some key deals for Q2. A large fund administration client using Geneva upgraded to our cloud delivery solution, giving them our application and IT infrastructure in one solution. A U.S. bank bought our Black Diamond solution to help them attract registered investment advisers. An independent money manager with over $100 billion in assets bought a suite of SS&C products, including Global Wealth Platform. They needed a comprehensive end-to-end solution with scalability to handle high volumes. An existing health care client added our Drug Discount Wrap to their suite of services. A large Brazilian asset manager chose SS&C GlobeOp's fund services suite, citing our team's expertise and technology. A commercial real estate company chose Precision LM for their loan origination and servicing. A $20 billion U.K.-based investment manager looking to consolidate vendors moved an additional fund from a competitor to SS&C GlobeOp. A $28 billion alternative manager upgraded to Eze Eclipse. They were impressed with the interface and anywhere, anytime functionality. I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials. I think the -- this is Rahul. The change in the scenario -- Innovest is definitely a part of it, probably about half. I think the rest of it is we did a little better in Q2, and we expect to do a little better in Q3 and Q4 from that baseline 2021 scenario. Margin on Innovest at least right now, we expect to be about 20% or so and then we've got improvement plans to get up from there. Bill, I would just add -- obviously, I agree with that. And I would just add, in particular, it's the large capital expenditures, right, so people that are buying perpetual licenses or they're going to kick off some projects that has a lengthy conversion period and they really need to get comfortable with our team and environment. That's where we've seen some slowdown so far this year. But as Bill said in his remarks, we're starting to see people get more comfortable even in this remote working environment and make some of those decisions. So coming back to these scenarios, I think the assumption is under the recovery scenario or the improvement scenario that we have, we continue to have that and we have people go back to making decisions on some of those larger deals. Well, I would add that secure document exchange, right, is obviously a lot broader than just M&A. So we found some good use cases for it with the Payment Protection Program, but there's plenty other use cases that I think Bob and Ken and their sales teams and development teams are working on. No. I think that -- I think in the baseline scenario, we are assuming that sales and sales activity remains at current levels and doesn't get a lot better and doesn't get a lot worse from here, hence, kind of a flattish outlook. If that starts to come back, then we expect to be closer to our economic improvement scenario. Yes. So it's been pretty much across the board there as well. In our hedge business, we've seen new funds -- clients start new funds. We've had some competitive wins. We've had organic rebound from the decline earlier in the year. And our private equity and real assets businesses are -- remain very strong both in terms of wins as well as the prospects that we have and several large deals that we're working. So across the board, alternatives has been pretty good. Yes. So I would say probably 60% of it was market volumes and volatility, and 40% of it was new sales both on Eze as well as the new Eclipse platform. So Mike Hutner and his team have been doing a pretty good job of both accelerating the development and innovation we have on that as well as getting the prospects to buy even in this environment. So pretty pleased about that. And I'd say 60-40. I think we're expecting nonvolume-related growth to get -- to continue to get better from here. Obviously, when you sell a deal, in the beginning, you don't get all the revenue. You get some kind of ramped down revenue during the implementation period. I think that's kind of where we are right now on the new clients that we have sold recently. And so we expect those clients to get up to full strength, and we expect to continue to sell more run rate revenue. So we do expect it to grow over time. Yes. That's right, Bill. If I could add, it's held up pretty well in the sense that deals that we are winning, we're not seeing any trends that force us to kind of revise pricing down or anything like that. And I think on the price increase process, we're pretty pleased with how that went at the end of the year. And we think most of our clients understand that we need to deliver more value. And in exchange, we would like a little bit of an uptick on a regular basis. So we do think that, that process is going to be good for us over the long term. Bill, I'd agree with that. And like Bill said, the issues in those items are -- for the most part, the significant issues are unrelated to this pricing initiative we've had."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Justine Stone. Ma'am, you may begin.\nJustine Stone: Hi, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for our Q1 2020 earnings call. I'm Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C Technologies. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Pedonti, our Chief Financial Officer.

And I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stone: Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I hope you and yours are safe and healthy at home. I'll discuss our results for the quarter and walk through our assumptions for the remainder of the year as we navigate this COVID-19 world. Our results for the first quarter are $1.178 billion or if $1,178 million in adjusted revenues, up 2.4% and $1.03 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 13.2%.Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $463.5 million, and our adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin was 39.3%, up 80 basis points from Q1 last year. Q1 organic revenue growth adjusted for DST terminations prior to the close of that acquisition was 2.7%. This was driven by strong performance in our alternative fund administration business with over 8% growth.Business was strong through February. In March, social distancing and work from home pushed some license sales into Q2. Q1 2020 net cash from operating activities came in at $147,700,000 up $10.3 million from Q1 2019.Our secured net leverage ratio was 2.67 times, and our total net leverage ratio was 3.74 times. Term restrictions, as you know, on our debt are light with only a 6.75 times max secured net leverage being relevant, with three plus turns of leverage that are available to us represents $5.8 billion in available room.We are living in unprecedented times. We have taken prudent steps and carefully review contingency plans covering personnel business operations and client delivery. We have validated they operate as intended. SS&C moved swiftly to protect our employees, and 99% of our global workforce is now remote. Overall, we have had minimal disruption in client service and client satisfaction remains high.We have seen an uptick in interest for outsourcing services for our clients to create a more resilient and efficient operation. One example is the SS&C ALPS customer asking us to take on their settlement processing during the height of the crisis as they were challenged with work from home.Our Eze Software client service saw a 50% spike in client inquiries. Given the unprecedented volume increases, SS&C products performed and our service level remained high. The team worked long hours and continued to deliver outstanding service. SS&C Health has deployed our AI-based Vidado technology to state and local government to scan handwritten documents and forms.Due to the uncertainty surrounding with local pandemic, we are withdrawing our 2020 guidance. We are providing possible revenue, margin and cash flow scenarios, based on different assumptions. These scenarios are our best estimates given current economic climate. Please refer to slides five and six of our earnings results slides posted on our IR website.In our Q3 revenue scenario, that means that the economy recovers in Q3, we expect revenues of $4.65 billion or a little over $50 million less than our previous guidance. In this scenario, we expect to have 30.5% EBITDA margins and $1.145 billion operating cash flow for the year. If we don't recover until Q4, we expect revenues of $4.6 billion or a little over $100 million less than our previous guidance.In this scenario, we expect to have $38.2 million EBITDA margins and $1.125 billion in operating cash flow. Finally, if we don't see economic recovery until Q1 2021, we expect 2020 revenues of $4.55 billion or about $220 million less than our previous guidance. We'll have 37.8% EBITDA margins and about $1.1 billion in operating cash flow.I'll now turn the call over to Rahul, to discuss the revenue impacts in more depth.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks, Bill. We have noted at various times that even in the face of significant market volatility, we expect the impact on our fund administration business to be muted, due to fixed fees, minimum thresholds and non-AUA-related revenue drivers. We're pleased to see this hold up in the current environment, while we're expecting our alternatives business will continue to grow through 2020, albeit at the lower end of historical ranges.The reduction is primarily due to delayed launches on new funds, delayed decisions where new customers are not eager to switch from competitors, while in the business continuity mode and some impact from asset level declines. The scenarios for our transfer agency and wealth business assume high client retention but slowdown in new sales and customers delaying large-scale conversions.We also see the negative impact of FX from the British pound and reduced interest earnings on balances. In our trading, software and financial markets businesses, including Eze, our OMS and EMS trading software, we get some incremental benefit from market volatility, which largely offsets an expected reduction in new software sales.At Intralinks, our scenarios assume a decline, in the pipeline of new M&A deals, still current data rooms remain open longer and derive some revenue benefit from the resulting extended usage. We also have some ability to pivot to other applications of the data rooms, such as corporate restructuring efforts.Our software businesses, particularly Advent and institutional and investment management are expected to see reduced growth from our initial guidance, as a result of customers delaying new license purchases, until conditions start to normalize. We continue to see demand in SS&C Health, with some slowdown in purchasing decisions on new mandates.COVID-related medical activities have driven up claims processing, which is offset by a reduction in elective and preventative procedures. A bright spot is Algorithmics, so we expect revenue to be on the high-end of our initial guidance in the 2021 recovery scenario, around $60 million. Algorithmics is a high-quality business with talented management. And we have high expectations.Now we will mention some key deals for Q1 2020. An existing client with a long-standing relationship with DST shows SS&C's retirement outsourcing services, including customer interface development. A managed care provider extended their relationship with SS&C Health, through professional services and technology.The Hong Kong wealth management arm of a multinational bank upgraded its AWD platform. A large New York-based, single-family office chose SS&C's private capital fund services. An existing SS&C GlobeOp fund admin client sought to improve its data model, through SS&C's core SightLine platform and enhance their middle office operations.An existing SS&C GlobeOp fund administration client expanded their relationship to include their real assets funds. A deep understanding of their fund structures and internal processes allowed us to provide a solution quickly. A $4 billion in assets trust firm chose a suite of SS&C Advent products for a family office, including partnership accounting. They were previously contemplating building this in-house.A $600 million AUM bank asset manager based in the Middle East, an existing APX client licensed Syncova and Investrack. A Greenwich, Connecticut-based hedge fund upgraded to the Eze Eclipse cloud platform. The firm was impressed with the analytics capabilities for analysts and portfolio managers to access from a laptop or tablet.I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials.\nPatrick Pedonti: Thanks. Our results for the first quarter of 2020 was GAAP revenues of $1,173.6 million, GAAP net income of $99.2 million and EPS of $0.37. Adjusted revenue was $1,178 million, excluding the impact for the adoption of the revenue standard 606 and for acquired deferred revenue adjustment for the DST Intralinks and Algorithmics acquisitions.Overall, we had a strong quarter. Adjusted revenue was up 2.4%. Adjusted operating income increased 5.5%, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.03, a 13.2% increase over Q1 2019.Adjusted revenue in total increased $28 million or 2.4% over Q1 2019. The acquisitions of Investrack, Algorithmics and Captricity contributed $18.1 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $5.5 million or 0.5%. And adjusted organic growth on a constant-currency basis was 2.8%, driven by the strength in the Institutional Investment Management alternatives and Eze businesses.Adjusted operating income was $444.2 million, an increase of $23.3 million or 5.5% from the first quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of $4.8 million on expenses in the quarter. And adjusted operating margins improved from 36.6% in the first quarter of 2019 to 37.7% in the first quarter of 2020.Adjusted consolidated EBITDA, which is defined in Note three in our earnings release, was $463.5 million or 39.3% of adjusted revenue and increased 4.5% over Q1 2019. Net interest expense for the first quarter was $77.4 million and includes $3.5 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID.The average rate in the quarter for our amended credit facility, including the senior notes, was 4.18% compared to 4.77% in the first quarter of 2019. We recorded a GAAP tax provision in the quarter of $24.8 million or 20% of pre-tax income.Adjusted net income was $274 million, and adjusted EPS was $1.03. Adjusted net income excludes $157.6 million of amortization of intangible assets; $22.5 million of stock-based compensation; $9.5 million of purchase accounting adjustment, mostly deferred revenue adjustment and depreciation related to revaluation of assets; $3.5 million of amortization of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID; $2.8 million of loss and extinguishment of debt related to our repricing in the first quarter; $2.3 million of adjustments related to ASC 606 revenue standard; and $0.7 million of equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates; and $48.8 million of non-operating costs, including $31.4 million of severance costs related to staff reductions; $11.3 million loss on mark-to-market adjustment on investments; $6 million of foreign exchange impact. Effective tax rates we used for adjusted net income was 26%.On our cash and cash flow for the quarter, we ended March with approximately $374 million in cash and a net debt position of approximately $7 billion. Operating cash flow for the three months was $147.7 million, a $10.3 million or 7.5% increase compared to the same period of 2019.A few highlights on our -- the quarter, we paid gross debt of $95.9 million, and we borrowed $246 million from our revolver as a precaution to provide near-term liquidity if necessary. We've paid down $2,142 million of debt since we acquired DST.In the quarter, we paid $102.5 million of cash interest compared to $96.4 million in the same period last year. In the quarter, we paid $17.7 million of cash taxes compared to $60.3 million in the same period last year. We will be deferring our tax payments into Q3 as provided by the Cares Act.Accounts receivable, DSO was 52.4 days compared to 49.7 days as of December 2019 and 53.7 days as of March 2019. And we used $26.5 million of cash, or 2.2% of adjusted revenue for capital expenditures, capitalized software, mostly IT and leasehold improvements. In the quarter, we declared a dividend of $31.9 million, an increase from $25.2 million in the same period last year.Our LTM consolidated EBITDA, was $1,873 million as of March and includes about $25 million of acquired EBITDA and cost savings related to our acquisitions. Based on net debt of $1 billion, the total leverage ratio was 3.74 times and secured was 2.67 times.On our view for the year, due to the current unpredictability of market and economic conditions, we're withdrawing our specific guidance and providing three scenarios for the year depending on the timing of the recovery.A few assumptions we've used in our scenario, we've assumed that markets will continue to be volatile, large-scale outsourcing deals and license deals will be impacted, AUA, inflows and outflows in our fund administration business will continue to be volatile and fund launches will be delayed.But as Bill mentioned, we're focusing on client service, and our retention rates continue to be high, and we'll use our most recent retention rates will be assumed in our plans for the year.Foreign currency exchange, we've assumed current levels, and that will impact the business approximately $30 million for the remainder of the year, compared to our original plan. Adjusted -- as a result, adjusted organic growth for the year in the range will be between 0% and negative 2%. We've assumed that interest rates in our term loan facility will be approximately the current 12-month LIBOR plus our current spread, which is 175 bps.On the expense side, we'll manage our expenses during this period by controlling variable expenses and staff hiring, but we'll continue investing in our business for the long-term and capital expenditures will be approximately 2.7% of revenues. On the tax rate, we've assumed for GAAP in the range of 24% to 25%, the tax rate for adjusted earnings to be 26%.[Technical Difficulty]\nBill Stone: So Patrick fairly drops. So the first scenario assumes that economic conditions start improving in the third quarter 2020. Under this assumption, we expect approximately the following results: adjusted revenue of $4.65 billion, adjusted net income of $1.077 billion, diluted shares of 269.5 million and operating cash flow of $1.145 billion. The second scenario assumes that economic conditions start improving in the fourth quarter of 2020.Under this assumption, we expect approximately the following results, adjusted revenue of $4.6 billion, adjusted net income of $1.05 billion, diluted shares of 268.5 million and operating cash flow of $1.125 billion.The third scenario assumes that the economic conditions don't start improving until 2021. And under this assumption, we expect approximately the following results; adjusted revenues of $4.55 billion, adjusted net income of $1.025 billion; diluted shares of 267.5 million and operating cash flow of $1.1 billion.Patrick will now turn it over to me for final comments. You can pass up on the thanks, Patrick. But thanks, Patrick. We are all adjusting to this new normal, and we are evaluating our operations, customer service and productivity on an ongoing basis. We are a strong company in these trying times to reiterate the resiliency of SS&C's business model. We reported $373.7 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31st, and we expect to generate at least $1 billion in operating cash flow for the year. Our capital allocation strategy will remain the same, and we will prioritize debt paydown and allocate capital towards high quality acquisitions in a methodically opportunistic manner.As we begin to open the call for questions, I want to reiterate, SS&C is a strong company with a highly educated and productive workforce, which stands at 23,000 strong. SS&C markets and sells its products and services to a worldwide client base of over 18,000 and a total addressable market in the hundreds of billions.SS&C is a nimble and innovative company with little or -- who, with little or no disruption, we redeployed 99% of our workforce to work-from-home. Since our IPO on March 31, 2010, SS&C has annually compounded its adjusted revenue, revenue per share and cash flow by 34%, 27% and 38%, respectively.I will now open it up for questions\nJustine Stone: Manisha, are you there?\nOperator: Yes, we do have a question from the line of Alex Cram. Alex Kramm, UBS.\nAlex Kramm: Yes, hey, how are you? Alex Kramm, UBS. Thanks for all the good detail here. One of the -- on your guidance, one of the things that stood out to me was your assumption that retention rate is going to remain at this 96% level. Just wanted you to maybe flush this out a little bit more. I mean, I guess the question is why are you so comfortable if there's carnage out there, certain hedge funds may be going under? I mean, is there a risk to that, I guess, is what I'm saying, or if it is a bad environment, which I just outlined, is this more of a flowing into 2021 results, and that's why you didn't really touch it? I guess, what are the puts and takes that could make this get a little bit worse?\nBill Stone: Well, I mean, obviously, Alex, you hit the nail on the head. If everybody goes out of business, it won't be 96%. But so far, what we have seen is very little shutting out the doors. We have seen more where it's not as quick to launch. But as you saw in Q1, we had 8% growth in the fund administration business, and I don't think you think that most of the major banks or most of the major insurance companies or mutual fund complexes are going to fold.So you're really looking at the alternative space, and we've seen really no change in private equity. And our hedge fund business has shown remarkable strength, and I think it will continue. And I think this may be a catalyst to SS&C's growth, not a -- not short-term, it's not going to be -- but three, four, five quarters out, it could certainly be a -- we need an administrator that this is all they do. And they focus on it and they're resilient, and they have experts, and it's all the way up to the top of the house. So, I don't know if you have anything, Rahul, to add.\nRahul Kanwar: Well, I would just echo what you said, which is we've seen some slowdown in people that were going to start new funds. But with current customers, I think, if anything, what we have seen in the last six to eight weeks is more opportunity where folks are looking at how they've done in this environment and what their business continuity plans are and trying to figure out if they can outsource more activities to us.\nAlex Kramm: All right. Great. And then maybe just another quick one, and I'll jump back in the queue. But one of the things that you were messaging last quarter was pricing becoming a little bit of a bigger lever. Just wondering if in this environment, is that basically just off the table? Is that still kind of normal inflators that are happening? Or is this going to be more, again, a story that we need to revisit next year as people maybe have different things to worry about right now?\nBill Stone: Well, we -- as we spoke on the last two calls, I mean, we have implemented a lot of this. So it's behind us now, Alex. That doesn't mean it was 100% behind us, but I'm guessing it was maybe probably in the 60%, 70%, 75% range, maybe. So it's not really nearly as front and center as it was. And then we'll revisit, obviously, again in December. And depending on what's transpired between now and December, we'll see whether or not maybe a modest increase is sustainable.\nAlex Kramm: All right. Fair enough. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you.\nOperator: We have another question from the line of Andrew Schmidt.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hey, guys. Andrew Schmidt from Citi. Thanks for taking my questions. Question on just the quarterly trajectory as we progress throughout this year. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about just what you should expect on a quarterly basis. And just a clarification, when we when you think about Q3 recovery, Q4 recovery, et cetera, is that a comment on revenue bottoming out? Or is it a comment in terms of return to revenue growth?\nBill Stone: Well, I think I'll comment and then maybe Rahul can comment, but what I would say is that, Andrew, is that the scenarios you're trying to do is to give you -- we're not all looking at the COVID pandemic as being an accelerator in our businesses, unless maybe your Gilead or some other pharmaceutical company. The rest of us are trying to navigate the rapid. And so yes, the scenarios that you see us delivering to you are an expectation that we don't get the fund launches we expected. People are hesitant about large perpetual licenses, which has to get sometimes capital improvements, capital approval from the board. So there's a lot of things like that, large-scale outsourcing mandates when people are in business continuity mode, I think are less likely. And so yes, this is an analysis of what could happen while the world's economy comes back to full strength. Rahul, would you comment?\nRahul Kanwar: Sure. I think in terms of the trajectory, in general, what we've assumed is the Q3 recovery scenario assumes that things start to normalize towards the end of Q2. So Q3 is -- we're building our way back up and Q4 is nearly almost as good of a quarter as perhaps we would have anticipated previously. In the Q4 scenario, it's the same thing, but one quarter delayed. So towards the end of Q3, people are getting back to work. And Q4 is better from that going forward. And in 2021, once again, all of these are just timings. In 2021, we're assuming that that really doesn't happen. These things don't start to normalize and people start to buy again at historical levels until the end of the year, so we don't really see the full benefit of that until the first quarter of 2021.\nAndrew Schmidt: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful context. And then just for my follow-up, what is the proportion of, I guess, just in the scenario analysis, what is the -- what's the proportion of revenues that are just delayed implementations versus maybe a slower sales cycle? Any comment on that? And then just to maybe correspond with that, just can you talk about what you've been hearing from clients recently. I mean, you made some pretty positive comments in terms of just -- it sounds like clients consulting with you more to see how they can outsource a little bit better and things like that. But maybe just a question in terms of what you're hearing and when clients will be prepared to get back and start implementing solutions?\nBill Stone: Well, again, I've been talking to a lot of our clients at the most senior levels, and most of them have been quite complementary of our response to this COVID-19 crisis, and I can understand, why? I mean we redeployed 23 -- 22,750 people, and we did it in a week or two, and we have not had disruptions in our service. And I don't know if that's true around the financial services marketplace.So when you can be in a crisis and you can differentiate yourself, then when things start to come back to normal, people say, I never want to go through that again. And where can I turn? And I think we have a chance to be that's shining a light on the hill.We've got to continue to execute, and these are not the easiest of times. And all of us hope that the pandemic goes away, but I don't think we're just going to snap our fingers and it goes away, so we have to be diligent. We have to focus. And I think we have a great team, and I think that's what they've been doing.\nAndrew Schmidt: Great. Thank you very much, guys.\nOperator: We do have a question from the line of Peter Heckman.\nPeter Heckmann: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Could you confirm for me that the most recent acquisitions are not included in your scenario analysis? And if possible, could you give us a revenue estimate in the aggregate of the Captricity and the two pending deals?\nPatrick Pedonti: Yes, this is Patrick. So to give you an idea, Innovest was -- they had about $42 million of revenue in 2019. And they're probably -- it's hard to predict, they'll have some impact this year, but they've probably been growing in the high single-digits in revenue. And then Captricity, assuming we close in June 1, and for the remainder of the year were probably around $20 million of revenue.\nPeter Heckmann: Patrick, that's the Capita deal?\nPatrick Pedonti: That's Capita. Capita. Captricity is already included.\nPeter Heckmann: That's right. All right. Perfect. And then just as a follow-up, Rahul, can you just give us a little bit of color on -- within fund of funds, I see on the last slide of the deck is AUA, just a 1% sequential decline. Can you talk about the interplay between market action and net flows on that?\nRahul Kanwar: Sure. So we had a pretty good sales quarter, particularly at the start of Q1. So there's some -- included in there is, obviously, those assets coming on. The -- we did see market declines in our hedge fund business and in particularly at the end of March, and we are starting to see some recovery there as well. And our private equity business and real assets business continue to have both good sales levels as well as good asset inflows into current funds.\nPeter Heckmann: Got it. Got it. And any notable change in the mix that we should think about?\nRahul Kanwar: No, not really.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from the line of Mayank Tandon.\nMayank Tandon: Well, thank you. Good evening. Bill or Rahul, could you comment on the visibility in terms of how much of that recurring piece of revenue that you have is truly under a long-term contract that would be vulnerable. But then what is the project-centric or the variable piece that could be more exposed, especially the downturn is prolonged, which might render some of the scenarios maybe not as conservative and maybe the recovery is more later in 2021? Just want to get a better feel for the visibility you have under these various scenarios.\nBill Stone: Well, I'll take a quick crack and let Rahul comment. But Mayank, when you think about the various components of our revenue streams, the per basis point charges that we get from the hedge funds and private equity funds in fund of funds, that has all kinds of buffers in it so depending on the decline in various asset prices or asset values that can have more impact. But we have the volatility like you saw -- in March and has continued through April, that just is more kind of like a sales swinging from side to side. It ultimately does not impact revenue very dramatically.We do tax returns and financial statements and stuff like that, that are all per piece or per year charges. The other recurring revenue we have is in maintenance on our software contracts, and asset values are not impacted -- do not impact. Those are already set fees, and similar, I think, with our maintenance on our term licenses, which is all ASC 606-defined anyway. So almost all of our revenue that is recurring is not impacted. The per piece revenue that we get that, like, on our F6 network or on our data businesses or on some of Eze's business that gets paid by number of trades, that will be more tied to volatility and volumes than it will be asset values. So we're pretty insulated. Rahul, maybe you can add?\nRahul Kanwar: Bill, I think, I would just add that in the businesses where we do have some degree of variability tied to some external driver, we've tried to take a conservative view on those. So Mayank, what's -- I think we do have pretty good visibility into what we're now -- as Bill said earlier, things will get a lot worse and then, okay maybe not, but based on what we've seen so far in the business, we've got pretty good visibility.\nMayank Tandon: That's very helpful. And just one quick one for Patrick. Patrick, could you size the expenses that you laid out? And then how much more levers do you have if you were to have to pull them in the case of, again, a more prolonged downturn that goes beyond early 2021? Thank you.\nPatrick Pedonti: Well, I think it ranges to the three scenarios. But I think it's somewhere between $75 million and $50 million of expenses that we took out from our original projections for the year.\nMayank Tandon: Got it.\nPatrick Pedonti: We're also benefiting from LIBOR being down significantly this quarter. Now we've assumed in our plan, the LIBOR rate for the 12-month LIBOR. But LIBOR has dropped significantly from the first quarter so that's helping us out, too, on the interest rate line item.\nMayank Tandon: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader.\nJackson Ader: Great. Thanks. It's Jackson Ader from JPMorgan on. Bill, the question that I have is on large deals. I understand that things are being delayed either fund launches or large outsourcing deals getting delayed. But do you see any risk in the more time these deals are delayed, maybe they get modified to the downside, either purchasing fewer products or maybe moving less assets over to SS&C?\nBill Stone: You know, Jackson, I really think it's going to be the opposite of that. If you go back to Madoff and other things that really kind of rocked the investment services outsourcing business. You know, people wanted independence. People wanted strong internal controls. People wanted businesses that were run by experts in these things. So like these are not banking businesses, these are accounting businesses, right? They're systems businesses, so they're systems and accounting businesses. It's really doing accounting with systems.And all three people that you're talking to here are accountants by training. And I think that we understand what the 23,000 people we have. What they do for a living in somewhat of an expert fashion. So our ability to move quickly and with confidence is greatly enhanced, right?We're used to ASC 606 or FAS 91 or FAS 52 or EITF 99-20 or some other arcane accounting rule and reporting rule that regulators and taxing authorities are very intense about. So I think clients look around and they start saying, well, we better get somebody that's really steeped in these things and I think we'll be a significant beneficiary of that.\nJackson Ader: Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. And then the follow-up question, you took out a little bit more debt from the revolver in this particular quarter. As we look at some of these -- some of the time lines of recovery, how should we be -- may be thinking about either levels of debt either to the upside or maybe pace of paydown?\nBill Stone: Well, I think in all three scenarios, I think the one with the most impact will be recoveries in 2021. We still expect $1.25 billion in operating cash flow. So we have, obviously, plenty of money to pay for our CapEx and our interest expense. And so when you look at the $800 million that we can do with -- from a capital allocation standpoint, my guess is that a vast majority of that will go to pay down debt. And obviously, we like good acquisitions. I think if we take the acquisitions that we have done over the last year, we're getting really good businesses at reasonable prices. There hasn't been any reasonableness in this marketplace for a couple of years and interest rates are at historical low.So SS&C in general would be prowling and looking for something to feed the pack. And I think that with interest rates where they are and the capabilities where we are and the number of people that may not want to operate companies anymore, I mean, these things are very difficult for entrepreneurs and even for private equity firms that had great gains and now see their gains get spiced. So we're there. We have the capital. We have the expertise. We have the management capability, and so we're optimistic where we are.\nJackson Ader: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have another question from the line of Ashish Sabadra.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick question. If I missed it, could you give any kind of guidance or color on how we should think about the growth in the second quarter?\nBill Stone: No.\nPatrick Pedonti: We have not.\nAshish Sabadra: Okay. And then just maybe a quick question on the margins. Patrick, you provided some color on the cost takeout, but we're seeing some margin pressure here historically. The company has always a bit like exceeded the expectations on margins. Are there opportunities for potentially for more cost takeouts and on the margin front?\nPatrick Pedonti: Well, I think -- go ahead, Bill.\nBill Stone: Go ahead, Patrick. No, go ahead.\nPatrick Pedonti: Yes. We did announce some staff reductions that we did in the first quarter, so we've got those cost savings built in. Under this plan, we'll reduce costs, variable costs, an additional amount, and then we continue to bring our -- bring DSTs contractor, India workforce into in-house workforce, and that will save us some additional funds. So, in the assumptions we've included a significant amount of other additional cost reductions while this business runs at a lower revenue.\nBill Stone: And remember, almost all of our costs are variable. So the flexibility we have -- and what COVID-19 has kind of proved to be is, do you need to spend all the millions that you spend now on travel and entertainment, which we spend millions monthly? And do you need to go to all the various conferences that are now being done virtually? So that -- I mean, the cost structure of a lot of the American business, I think, is going to change. And for people who like profits, it's going to change in a positive way.\nAshish Sabadra: Yes. That's very helpful, Bill and Patrick. Congrats once again on a solid quarter, and it's good to see the resilience of the revenues even in a global pandemic. So thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of James Faucette.\nJonathan Lee: Hey. This is Jonathan Lee on for James from Morgan Stanley. First question, you mentioned minimal disruption in your prepared remarks. Can you talk through some of the disruption that you did see and whether you think that will be a headwind during the rest of the year?\nBill Stone: Well, I mean, I think the only thing that we really had that were at all disruptive or -- when we shipped everybody home in India, some of the remote areas in and around Gurgaon and Mumbai and Hyderabad and Pune. They didn't have as good a telecom infrastructure, so we upgraded lots of routers, and make sure that we gave them the best possible speed. And we also shipped out thousands of laptops to people in India to make sure they had up-to-date equipment to work on.Our guys, Anthony Caiafa's team and all the team, the IT team in India did an outstanding job, and they continue to do an outstanding job. But those were the major points of any disruption. I mean I've talked to any number of senior people at our clients, and the comments are first, great and thank you, and that your people in India, your people here in Australia or the U.K. have all done a real nice job for us, and we really appreciate it.So in general, in our business, that's not the kind of calls you get and that's not the kind of comments, right? I mean we're the back office dudes, how come something is not reconciled yet, so I -- but I think that's pretty high grade.\nJonathan Lee: Got it. Thanks, Bill. And as a follow-up, you touched on pricing earlier, are there any customers asking for pricing concessions?\nBill Stone: I don't know that we have specifics on people asking for pricing concessions. I can tell you that we don't have people asking for pricing increases.\nRahul Kanwar: Yes. And I'd just add to that, Bill, we really haven't seen any systemic demands for price reductions or things like that. It's really been business as usual.\nBill Stone: When there's turmoil like this, like real turmoil, you're not sitting there asking about price. You're asking about stitches, if somebody knows how to sew. So I think that who knows over the next multiple quarters, whether or not that comes into focus? But right now, we need to get our stuff done. And we're having trouble enough in our own internal operations. Thank God, we have you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm.\nAlex Kramm: Hello again. Just a couple of follow-ups. There was one earlier question on the kind of sensitivities in your business outside of some of the things that you've outlined. I wonder if you can be a little bit more specific and actually provide a little bit more, I guess, quantitative item.So for example would be very interested in how much Eze contributed from the higher trading volumes that you saw. You've updated us on market sensitivity in the past. Maybe you can give us an update there and maybe also some other businesses that you've acquired since then like, for example, the ALPS business, I think, has some market sensitivity.And then maybe any other items around Intralinks and how much of the M&A business may be more, I guess, transactional. So I know those were four things. If you can think about a few others, it would be really great to dimensionalize those things that could still move one way or another in your guidance this year.\nBill Stone: Yes. Alex, I think you just kind of go through those businesses. I would tell you that the amount of variability you're talking about is in the $20 million range or maybe $25 million. And then Intralinks, you're not having as much as you might think. I mean, it's been pretty impressive that Intralinks has been the backbone for one of the largest banks in the country to deliver the Payroll Protection Program for the U.S. government.So that's been a really great help for that business, and they have a strong business. And obviously, M&A is not quite what it was, but it's also not dead. So we think we'll be in a strong position as that comes back.The other businesses, we're conservative about it and we manage for cash flow and earnings, and we also like revenue growth. So I think in other businesses, you have -- without companies really going out of business or if you were managing $2 billion and now you manage $50 million, okay that's tantamount to about going out of business.Well, now our revenues will get impacted. But I don't think in general that we have, hey, it was $250 million a quarter and now it's $172 million. That's not -- it's the same thing, right? You may not get as big a bonus this year at UBS. My guess is your tax accountant will charge you the same.\nAlex Kramm: That's pretty sure.\nBill Stone: Yes. That's the nature of our business. And if he wants to raise your fee 5%, tells me, you say, okay. So I don't think it's not as volatile as it sometimes looks to people on the outside.\nAlex Kramm: All right. And then maybe just last one for me. Just going back on the M&A, it sounds like your appetite is strong as ever, and you mentioned that $5.8 billion number in your prepared remarks, I think, in terms of, I guess, capacity. I mean, I assume it's the max capacity, but is -- how comfortable are you going even that high? Or where would you feel comfortable?And in terms of deal sizes, are there deals out there that could become attractive if there's a forced seller and that's --or is it more a bunch of like little things that you're seeing out there?\nBill Stone: Well, remember, I mean, if we use that $5.8 billion, we're going to get some EBITDA, right? We're not going to spend $5.8 billion and get 0 EBITDA, right? So we need to factor that in. And then secondly, when there's some smart guy out in Omaha who says, when everyone's scared, be greedy.So right now, a lot of people scared and interest rates are at historical lows, and it looks like markets are -- fixed income markets are -- if not wide open are certainly open. And so there's opportunity to do things. And you want to be wise about it. We're going to pick up a $200 million in revenue over the year and we're getting that, at least reasonable prices. So you don't want to pull in your horns and hide in your house when the hunting is the best.\nAlex Kramm: Understood. Thanks again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin.\nMatt Roswell: Yes. Good evening. It's actually Matt Roswell sitting in for Dan. Two really quick questions, I guess, the first part, did you give the organic revenue growth in the alternative channel?\nPatrick Pedonti: For the first quarter?\nMatt Roswell: Yes. For the first quarter.\nPatrick Pedonti: Yes, it was -- for the first quarter, it was 8.2%.\nMatt Roswell: Okay. And then why the stock component of the acquisition that you announced today, is there anything to read into that?\nBill Stone: I don't think so. I mean, everyone is liquidity crazy, so we're just a little crazy. So it's not very much money. We get to include a portion of restricted stock. And I think the sellers were -- we're happy to have our stocks. So there's a little upside for them, I hope. And as we go forward, hopefully, that works out better for them. And it's a really good asset, and we're excited about it.\nMatt Roswell: Okay. And if I could end with sort of a really big question. What you're seeing now when you go out and talk to clients, do you think it's a deferral of demand or a disruption of that demand?\nBill Stone: I think that most people that are at senior levels of companies more look at it as, if this too shall pass, no different than 9/11, no different than the stock market crash of 1987, no different than the Russian bond crisis, no different than a lot of different things. Obviously, this is different, right? It's the whole world at once. And so there's reduction of economic activity everywhere, but it's the same thing. There's an awful lot of smart people in the world and there's an awful lot of smart people in finance, and they start looking for opportunities.So as much as large-scale launches are going to slow down, there's a bunch of distressed and credit funds that are launching all over the place. And you've probably seen that most of the debt offerings that are out there are all oversubscribed and being upsized. So, when people have talked about a world awash in money, they weren't kidding.And then with the Fed and all the other central banks around the world, basically turning the spigots on, I think that there's going to be plenty of money for restructurings and plenty of money for other things where people see real opportunity. And I think SS&C will be a beneficiary.\nMatt Roswell: Okay. Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Bill Stone for further remarks.\nBill Stone: Thank you. And thanks, everybody, and stay safe and stay healthy, and we look forward to talking to you at the end of the next quarter. Good night.\nOperator: And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Stone",
            "content": "Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I hope you and yours are safe and healthy at home. I'll discuss our results for the quarter and walk through our assumptions for the remainder of the year as we navigate this COVID-19 world. Our results for the first quarter are $1.178 billion or if $1,178 million in adjusted revenues, up 2.4% and $1.03 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 13.2%.Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $463.5 million, and our adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin was 39.3%, up 80 basis points from Q1 last year. Q1 organic revenue growth adjusted for DST terminations prior to the close of that acquisition was 2.7%. This was driven by strong performance in our alternative fund administration business with over 8% growth.Business was strong through February. In March, social distancing and work from home pushed some license sales into Q2. Q1 2020 net cash from operating activities came in at $147,700,000 up $10.3 million from Q1 2019.Our secured net leverage ratio was 2.67 times, and our total net leverage ratio was 3.74 times. Term restrictions, as you know, on our debt are light with only a 6.75 times max secured net leverage being relevant, with three plus turns of leverage that are available to us represents $5.8 billion in available room.We are living in unprecedented times. We have taken prudent steps and carefully review contingency plans covering personnel business operations and client delivery. We have validated they operate as intended. SS&C moved swiftly to protect our employees, and 99% of our global workforce is now remote. Overall, we have had minimal disruption in client service and client satisfaction remains high.We have seen an uptick in interest for outsourcing services for our clients to create a more resilient and efficient operation. One example is the SS&C ALPS customer asking us to take on their settlement processing during the height of the crisis as they were challenged with work from home.Our Eze Software client service saw a 50% spike in client inquiries. Given the unprecedented volume increases, SS&C products performed and our service level remained high. The team worked long hours and continued to deliver outstanding service. SS&C Health has deployed our AI-based Vidado technology to state and local government to scan handwritten documents and forms.Due to the uncertainty surrounding with local pandemic, we are withdrawing our 2020 guidance. We are providing possible revenue, margin and cash flow scenarios, based on different assumptions. These scenarios are our best estimates given current economic climate. Please refer to slides five and six of our earnings results slides posted on our IR website.In our Q3 revenue scenario, that means that the economy recovers in Q3, we expect revenues of $4.65 billion or a little over $50 million less than our previous guidance. In this scenario, we expect to have 30.5% EBITDA margins and $1.145 billion operating cash flow for the year. If we don't recover until Q4, we expect revenues of $4.6 billion or a little over $100 million less than our previous guidance.In this scenario, we expect to have $38.2 million EBITDA margins and $1.125 billion in operating cash flow. Finally, if we don't see economic recovery until Q1 2021, we expect 2020 revenues of $4.55 billion or about $220 million less than our previous guidance. We'll have 37.8% EBITDA margins and about $1.1 billion in operating cash flow.I'll now turn the call over to Rahul, to discuss the revenue impacts in more depth. So Patrick fairly drops. So the first scenario assumes that economic conditions start improving in the third quarter 2020. Under this assumption, we expect approximately the following results: adjusted revenue of $4.65 billion, adjusted net income of $1.077 billion, diluted shares of 269.5 million and operating cash flow of $1.145 billion. The second scenario assumes that economic conditions start improving in the fourth quarter of 2020.Under this assumption, we expect approximately the following results, adjusted revenue of $4.6 billion, adjusted net income of $1.05 billion, diluted shares of 268.5 million and operating cash flow of $1.125 billion.The third scenario assumes that the economic conditions don't start improving until 2021. And under this assumption, we expect approximately the following results; adjusted revenues of $4.55 billion, adjusted net income of $1.025 billion; diluted shares of 267.5 million and operating cash flow of $1.1 billion.Patrick will now turn it over to me for final comments. You can pass up on the thanks, Patrick. But thanks, Patrick. We are all adjusting to this new normal, and we are evaluating our operations, customer service and productivity on an ongoing basis. We are a strong company in these trying times to reiterate the resiliency of SS&C's business model. We reported $373.7 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31st, and we expect to generate at least $1 billion in operating cash flow for the year. Our capital allocation strategy will remain the same, and we will prioritize debt paydown and allocate capital towards high quality acquisitions in a methodically opportunistic manner.As we begin to open the call for questions, I want to reiterate, SS&C is a strong company with a highly educated and productive workforce, which stands at 23,000 strong. SS&C markets and sells its products and services to a worldwide client base of over 18,000 and a total addressable market in the hundreds of billions.SS&C is a nimble and innovative company with little or -- who, with little or no disruption, we redeployed 99% of our workforce to work-from-home. Since our IPO on March 31, 2010, SS&C has annually compounded its adjusted revenue, revenue per share and cash flow by 34%, 27% and 38%, respectively.I will now open it up for questions Well, I mean, obviously, Alex, you hit the nail on the head. If everybody goes out of business, it won't be 96%. But so far, what we have seen is very little shutting out the doors. We have seen more where it's not as quick to launch. But as you saw in Q1, we had 8% growth in the fund administration business, and I don't think you think that most of the major banks or most of the major insurance companies or mutual fund complexes are going to fold.So you're really looking at the alternative space, and we've seen really no change in private equity. And our hedge fund business has shown remarkable strength, and I think it will continue. And I think this may be a catalyst to SS&C's growth, not a -- not short-term, it's not going to be -- but three, four, five quarters out, it could certainly be a -- we need an administrator that this is all they do. And they focus on it and they're resilient, and they have experts, and it's all the way up to the top of the house. So, I don't know if you have anything, Rahul, to add. Well, we -- as we spoke on the last two calls, I mean, we have implemented a lot of this. So it's behind us now, Alex. That doesn't mean it was 100% behind us, but I'm guessing it was maybe probably in the 60%, 70%, 75% range, maybe. So it's not really nearly as front and center as it was. And then we'll revisit, obviously, again in December. And depending on what's transpired between now and December, we'll see whether or not maybe a modest increase is sustainable. Well, I think I'll comment and then maybe Rahul can comment, but what I would say is that, Andrew, is that the scenarios you're trying to do is to give you -- we're not all looking at the COVID pandemic as being an accelerator in our businesses, unless maybe your Gilead or some other pharmaceutical company. The rest of us are trying to navigate the rapid. And so yes, the scenarios that you see us delivering to you are an expectation that we don't get the fund launches we expected. People are hesitant about large perpetual licenses, which has to get sometimes capital improvements, capital approval from the board. So there's a lot of things like that, large-scale outsourcing mandates when people are in business continuity mode, I think are less likely. And so yes, this is an analysis of what could happen while the world's economy comes back to full strength. Rahul, would you comment? Well, again, I've been talking to a lot of our clients at the most senior levels, and most of them have been quite complementary of our response to this COVID-19 crisis, and I can understand, why? I mean we redeployed 23 -- 22,750 people, and we did it in a week or two, and we have not had disruptions in our service. And I don't know if that's true around the financial services marketplace.So when you can be in a crisis and you can differentiate yourself, then when things start to come back to normal, people say, I never want to go through that again. And where can I turn? And I think we have a chance to be that's shining a light on the hill.We've got to continue to execute, and these are not the easiest of times. And all of us hope that the pandemic goes away, but I don't think we're just going to snap our fingers and it goes away, so we have to be diligent. We have to focus. And I think we have a great team, and I think that's what they've been doing. Well, I'll take a quick crack and let Rahul comment. But Mayank, when you think about the various components of our revenue streams, the per basis point charges that we get from the hedge funds and private equity funds in fund of funds, that has all kinds of buffers in it so depending on the decline in various asset prices or asset values that can have more impact. But we have the volatility like you saw -- in March and has continued through April, that just is more kind of like a sales swinging from side to side. It ultimately does not impact revenue very dramatically.We do tax returns and financial statements and stuff like that, that are all per piece or per year charges. The other recurring revenue we have is in maintenance on our software contracts, and asset values are not impacted -- do not impact. Those are already set fees, and similar, I think, with our maintenance on our term licenses, which is all ASC 606-defined anyway. So almost all of our revenue that is recurring is not impacted. The per piece revenue that we get that, like, on our F6 network or on our data businesses or on some of Eze's business that gets paid by number of trades, that will be more tied to volatility and volumes than it will be asset values. So we're pretty insulated. Rahul, maybe you can add? You know, Jackson, I really think it's going to be the opposite of that. If you go back to Madoff and other things that really kind of rocked the investment services outsourcing business. You know, people wanted independence. People wanted strong internal controls. People wanted businesses that were run by experts in these things. So like these are not banking businesses, these are accounting businesses, right? They're systems businesses, so they're systems and accounting businesses. It's really doing accounting with systems.And all three people that you're talking to here are accountants by training. And I think that we understand what the 23,000 people we have. What they do for a living in somewhat of an expert fashion. So our ability to move quickly and with confidence is greatly enhanced, right?We're used to ASC 606 or FAS 91 or FAS 52 or EITF 99-20 or some other arcane accounting rule and reporting rule that regulators and taxing authorities are very intense about. So I think clients look around and they start saying, well, we better get somebody that's really steeped in these things and I think we'll be a significant beneficiary of that. Well, I think in all three scenarios, I think the one with the most impact will be recoveries in 2021. We still expect $1.25 billion in operating cash flow. So we have, obviously, plenty of money to pay for our CapEx and our interest expense. And so when you look at the $800 million that we can do with -- from a capital allocation standpoint, my guess is that a vast majority of that will go to pay down debt. And obviously, we like good acquisitions. I think if we take the acquisitions that we have done over the last year, we're getting really good businesses at reasonable prices. There hasn't been any reasonableness in this marketplace for a couple of years and interest rates are at historical low.So SS&C in general would be prowling and looking for something to feed the pack. And I think that with interest rates where they are and the capabilities where we are and the number of people that may not want to operate companies anymore, I mean, these things are very difficult for entrepreneurs and even for private equity firms that had great gains and now see their gains get spiced. So we're there. We have the capital. We have the expertise. We have the management capability, and so we're optimistic where we are. No. Go ahead, Patrick. No, go ahead. And remember, almost all of our costs are variable. So the flexibility we have -- and what COVID-19 has kind of proved to be is, do you need to spend all the millions that you spend now on travel and entertainment, which we spend millions monthly? And do you need to go to all the various conferences that are now being done virtually? So that -- I mean, the cost structure of a lot of the American business, I think, is going to change. And for people who like profits, it's going to change in a positive way. Well, I mean, I think the only thing that we really had that were at all disruptive or -- when we shipped everybody home in India, some of the remote areas in and around Gurgaon and Mumbai and Hyderabad and Pune. They didn't have as good a telecom infrastructure, so we upgraded lots of routers, and make sure that we gave them the best possible speed. And we also shipped out thousands of laptops to people in India to make sure they had up-to-date equipment to work on.Our guys, Anthony Caiafa's team and all the team, the IT team in India did an outstanding job, and they continue to do an outstanding job. But those were the major points of any disruption. I mean I've talked to any number of senior people at our clients, and the comments are first, great and thank you, and that your people in India, your people here in Australia or the U.K. have all done a real nice job for us, and we really appreciate it.So in general, in our business, that's not the kind of calls you get and that's not the kind of comments, right? I mean we're the back office dudes, how come something is not reconciled yet, so I -- but I think that's pretty high grade. I don't know that we have specifics on people asking for pricing concessions. I can tell you that we don't have people asking for pricing increases. When there's turmoil like this, like real turmoil, you're not sitting there asking about price. You're asking about stitches, if somebody knows how to sew. So I think that who knows over the next multiple quarters, whether or not that comes into focus? But right now, we need to get our stuff done. And we're having trouble enough in our own internal operations. Thank God, we have you. Yes. Alex, I think you just kind of go through those businesses. I would tell you that the amount of variability you're talking about is in the $20 million range or maybe $25 million. And then Intralinks, you're not having as much as you might think. I mean, it's been pretty impressive that Intralinks has been the backbone for one of the largest banks in the country to deliver the Payroll Protection Program for the U.S. government.So that's been a really great help for that business, and they have a strong business. And obviously, M&A is not quite what it was, but it's also not dead. So we think we'll be in a strong position as that comes back.The other businesses, we're conservative about it and we manage for cash flow and earnings, and we also like revenue growth. So I think in other businesses, you have -- without companies really going out of business or if you were managing $2 billion and now you manage $50 million, okay that's tantamount to about going out of business.Well, now our revenues will get impacted. But I don't think in general that we have, hey, it was $250 million a quarter and now it's $172 million. That's not -- it's the same thing, right? You may not get as big a bonus this year at UBS. My guess is your tax accountant will charge you the same. Yes. That's the nature of our business. And if he wants to raise your fee 5%, tells me, you say, okay. So I don't think it's not as volatile as it sometimes looks to people on the outside. Well, remember, I mean, if we use that $5.8 billion, we're going to get some EBITDA, right? We're not going to spend $5.8 billion and get 0 EBITDA, right? So we need to factor that in. And then secondly, when there's some smart guy out in Omaha who says, when everyone's scared, be greedy.So right now, a lot of people scared and interest rates are at historical lows, and it looks like markets are -- fixed income markets are -- if not wide open are certainly open. And so there's opportunity to do things. And you want to be wise about it. We're going to pick up a $200 million in revenue over the year and we're getting that, at least reasonable prices. So you don't want to pull in your horns and hide in your house when the hunting is the best. I don't think so. I mean, everyone is liquidity crazy, so we're just a little crazy. So it's not very much money. We get to include a portion of restricted stock. And I think the sellers were -- we're happy to have our stocks. So there's a little upside for them, I hope. And as we go forward, hopefully, that works out better for them. And it's a really good asset, and we're excited about it. I think that most people that are at senior levels of companies more look at it as, if this too shall pass, no different than 9/11, no different than the stock market crash of 1987, no different than the Russian bond crisis, no different than a lot of different things. Obviously, this is different, right? It's the whole world at once. And so there's reduction of economic activity everywhere, but it's the same thing. There's an awful lot of smart people in the world and there's an awful lot of smart people in finance, and they start looking for opportunities.So as much as large-scale launches are going to slow down, there's a bunch of distressed and credit funds that are launching all over the place. And you've probably seen that most of the debt offerings that are out there are all oversubscribed and being upsized. So, when people have talked about a world awash in money, they weren't kidding.And then with the Fed and all the other central banks around the world, basically turning the spigots on, I think that there's going to be plenty of money for restructurings and plenty of money for other things where people see real opportunity. And I think SS&C will be a beneficiary. Thank you. And thanks, everybody, and stay safe and stay healthy, and we look forward to talking to you at the end of the next quarter. Good night."

            "content": "Thanks. Our results for the first quarter of 2020 was GAAP revenues of $1,173.6 million, GAAP net income of $99.2 million and EPS of $0.37. Adjusted revenue was $1,178 million, excluding the impact for the adoption of the revenue standard 606 and for acquired deferred revenue adjustment for the DST Intralinks and Algorithmics acquisitions.Overall, we had a strong quarter. Adjusted revenue was up 2.4%. Adjusted operating income increased 5.5%, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.03, a 13.2% increase over Q1 2019.Adjusted revenue in total increased $28 million or 2.4% over Q1 2019. The acquisitions of Investrack, Algorithmics and Captricity contributed $18.1 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $5.5 million or 0.5%. And adjusted organic growth on a constant-currency basis was 2.8%, driven by the strength in the Institutional Investment Management alternatives and Eze businesses.Adjusted operating income was $444.2 million, an increase of $23.3 million or 5.5% from the first quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of $4.8 million on expenses in the quarter. And adjusted operating margins improved from 36.6% in the first quarter of 2019 to 37.7% in the first quarter of 2020.Adjusted consolidated EBITDA, which is defined in Note three in our earnings release, was $463.5 million or 39.3% of adjusted revenue and increased 4.5% over Q1 2019. Net interest expense for the first quarter was $77.4 million and includes $3.5 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID.The average rate in the quarter for our amended credit facility, including the senior notes, was 4.18% compared to 4.77% in the first quarter of 2019. We recorded a GAAP tax provision in the quarter of $24.8 million or 20% of pre-tax income.Adjusted net income was $274 million, and adjusted EPS was $1.03. Adjusted net income excludes $157.6 million of amortization of intangible assets; $22.5 million of stock-based compensation; $9.5 million of purchase accounting adjustment, mostly deferred revenue adjustment and depreciation related to revaluation of assets; $3.5 million of amortization of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID; $2.8 million of loss and extinguishment of debt related to our repricing in the first quarter; $2.3 million of adjustments related to ASC 606 revenue standard; and $0.7 million of equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates; and $48.8 million of non-operating costs, including $31.4 million of severance costs related to staff reductions; $11.3 million loss on mark-to-market adjustment on investments; $6 million of foreign exchange impact. Effective tax rates we used for adjusted net income was 26%.On our cash and cash flow for the quarter, we ended March with approximately $374 million in cash and a net debt position of approximately $7 billion. Operating cash flow for the three months was $147.7 million, a $10.3 million or 7.5% increase compared to the same period of 2019.A few highlights on our -- the quarter, we paid gross debt of $95.9 million, and we borrowed $246 million from our revolver as a precaution to provide near-term liquidity if necessary. We've paid down $2,142 million of debt since we acquired DST.In the quarter, we paid $102.5 million of cash interest compared to $96.4 million in the same period last year. In the quarter, we paid $17.7 million of cash taxes compared to $60.3 million in the same period last year. We will be deferring our tax payments into Q3 as provided by the Cares Act.Accounts receivable, DSO was 52.4 days compared to 49.7 days as of December 2019 and 53.7 days as of March 2019. And we used $26.5 million of cash, or 2.2% of adjusted revenue for capital expenditures, capitalized software, mostly IT and leasehold improvements. In the quarter, we declared a dividend of $31.9 million, an increase from $25.2 million in the same period last year.Our LTM consolidated EBITDA, was $1,873 million as of March and includes about $25 million of acquired EBITDA and cost savings related to our acquisitions. Based on net debt of $1 billion, the total leverage ratio was 3.74 times and secured was 2.67 times.On our view for the year, due to the current unpredictability of market and economic conditions, we're withdrawing our specific guidance and providing three scenarios for the year depending on the timing of the recovery.A few assumptions we've used in our scenario, we've assumed that markets will continue to be volatile, large-scale outsourcing deals and license deals will be impacted, AUA, inflows and outflows in our fund administration business will continue to be volatile and fund launches will be delayed.But as Bill mentioned, we're focusing on client service, and our retention rates continue to be high, and we'll use our most recent retention rates will be assumed in our plans for the year.Foreign currency exchange, we've assumed current levels, and that will impact the business approximately $30 million for the remainder of the year, compared to our original plan. Adjusted -- as a result, adjusted organic growth for the year in the range will be between 0% and negative 2%. We've assumed that interest rates in our term loan facility will be approximately the current 12-month LIBOR plus our current spread, which is 175 bps.On the expense side, we'll manage our expenses during this period by controlling variable expenses and staff hiring, but we'll continue investing in our business for the long-term and capital expenditures will be approximately 2.7% of revenues. On the tax rate, we've assumed for GAAP in the range of 24% to 25%, the tax rate for adjusted earnings to be 26%.[Technical Difficulty] Yes, this is Patrick. So to give you an idea, Innovest was -- they had about $42 million of revenue in 2019. And they're probably -- it's hard to predict, they'll have some impact this year, but they've probably been growing in the high single-digits in revenue. And then Captricity, assuming we close in June 1, and for the remainder of the year were probably around $20 million of revenue. That's Capita. Capita. Captricity is already included. Well, I think it ranges to the three scenarios. But I think it's somewhere between $75 million and $50 million of expenses that we took out from our original projections for the year. We're also benefiting from LIBOR being down significantly this quarter. Now we've assumed in our plan, the LIBOR rate for the 12-month LIBOR. But LIBOR has dropped significantly from the first quarter so that's helping us out, too, on the interest rate line item. We have not. Well, I think -- go ahead, Bill. Yes. We did announce some staff reductions that we did in the first quarter, so we've got those cost savings built in. Under this plan, we'll reduce costs, variable costs, an additional amount, and then we continue to bring our -- bring DSTs contractor, India workforce into in-house workforce, and that will save us some additional funds. So, in the assumptions we've included a significant amount of other additional cost reductions while this business runs at a lower revenue. For the first quarter? Yes, it was -- for the first quarter, it was 8.2%."

            "name": "Rahul Kanwar",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. We have noted at various times that even in the face of significant market volatility, we expect the impact on our fund administration business to be muted, due to fixed fees, minimum thresholds and non-AUA-related revenue drivers. We're pleased to see this hold up in the current environment, while we're expecting our alternatives business will continue to grow through 2020, albeit at the lower end of historical ranges.The reduction is primarily due to delayed launches on new funds, delayed decisions where new customers are not eager to switch from competitors, while in the business continuity mode and some impact from asset level declines. The scenarios for our transfer agency and wealth business assume high client retention but slowdown in new sales and customers delaying large-scale conversions.We also see the negative impact of FX from the British pound and reduced interest earnings on balances. In our trading, software and financial markets businesses, including Eze, our OMS and EMS trading software, we get some incremental benefit from market volatility, which largely offsets an expected reduction in new software sales.At Intralinks, our scenarios assume a decline, in the pipeline of new M&A deals, still current data rooms remain open longer and derive some revenue benefit from the resulting extended usage. We also have some ability to pivot to other applications of the data rooms, such as corporate restructuring efforts.Our software businesses, particularly Advent and institutional and investment management are expected to see reduced growth from our initial guidance, as a result of customers delaying new license purchases, until conditions start to normalize. We continue to see demand in SS&C Health, with some slowdown in purchasing decisions on new mandates.COVID-related medical activities have driven up claims processing, which is offset by a reduction in elective and preventative procedures. A bright spot is Algorithmics, so we expect revenue to be on the high-end of our initial guidance in the 2021 recovery scenario, around $60 million. Algorithmics is a high-quality business with talented management. And we have high expectations.Now we will mention some key deals for Q1 2020. An existing client with a long-standing relationship with DST shows SS&C's retirement outsourcing services, including customer interface development. A managed care provider extended their relationship with SS&C Health, through professional services and technology.The Hong Kong wealth management arm of a multinational bank upgraded its AWD platform. A large New York-based, single-family office chose SS&C's private capital fund services. An existing SS&C GlobeOp fund admin client sought to improve its data model, through SS&C's core SightLine platform and enhance their middle office operations.An existing SS&C GlobeOp fund administration client expanded their relationship to include their real assets funds. A deep understanding of their fund structures and internal processes allowed us to provide a solution quickly. A $4 billion in assets trust firm chose a suite of SS&C Advent products for a family office, including partnership accounting. They were previously contemplating building this in-house.A $600 million AUM bank asset manager based in the Middle East, an existing APX client licensed Syncova and Investrack. A Greenwich, Connecticut-based hedge fund upgraded to the Eze Eclipse cloud platform. The firm was impressed with the analytics capabilities for analysts and portfolio managers to access from a laptop or tablet.I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials. Well, I would just echo what you said, which is we've seen some slowdown in people that were going to start new funds. But with current customers, I think, if anything, what we have seen in the last six to eight weeks is more opportunity where folks are looking at how they've done in this environment and what their business continuity plans are and trying to figure out if they can outsource more activities to us. Sure. I think in terms of the trajectory, in general, what we've assumed is the Q3 recovery scenario assumes that things start to normalize towards the end of Q2. So Q3 is -- we're building our way back up and Q4 is nearly almost as good of a quarter as perhaps we would have anticipated previously. In the Q4 scenario, it's the same thing, but one quarter delayed. So towards the end of Q3, people are getting back to work. And Q4 is better from that going forward. And in 2021, once again, all of these are just timings. In 2021, we're assuming that that really doesn't happen. These things don't start to normalize and people start to buy again at historical levels until the end of the year, so we don't really see the full benefit of that until the first quarter of 2021. Sure. So we had a pretty good sales quarter, particularly at the start of Q1. So there's some -- included in there is, obviously, those assets coming on. The -- we did see market declines in our hedge fund business and in particularly at the end of March, and we are starting to see some recovery there as well. And our private equity business and real assets business continue to have both good sales levels as well as good asset inflows into current funds. No, not really. Bill, I think, I would just add that in the businesses where we do have some degree of variability tied to some external driver, we've tried to take a conservative view on those. So Mayank, what's -- I think we do have pretty good visibility into what we're now -- as Bill said earlier, things will get a lot worse and then, okay maybe not, but based on what we've seen so far in the business, we've got pretty good visibility. Yes. And I'd just add to that, Bill, we really haven't seen any systemic demands for price reductions or things like that. It's really been business as usual."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SS&C Technologies’ Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn today’s call over to Justine Stone, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma’am.\nJustine Stone: Hi, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. I’m Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C Technologies. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Pedonti, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, we need to review the safe harbor statement. Please note that various remarks we make today about future expectations, plans and prospects, including the financial outlook we provide, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and can also be accessed on our website. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of today, February 10, 2021. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. During today’s call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in today’s earnings release which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. In the third quarter of 2021, we entered into a joint venture named DomaniRx LLC, which we are the majority interest holder and primary beneficiary. All earnings figures discussed today, including operating income, EBITDA, net income and EPS are attributable to SS&C based on the ownership interest retained by SS&C. I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stone : Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone, for joining. Our results for the fourth quarter are $1.296 billion in adjusted revenue, up 7.5%; and $1.28 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 13.3%. For the year, adjusted revenue was $5 billion and $589 million, up 8.1% and adjusted diluted EPS was $5.02, up 16.7%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $522.9 million for the quarter and our EBITDA margin was 40.3%. Our fourth quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 6.9% ahead of our expectations, our alternatives that Intralinks businesses continue to drive our top line growth growing at 12.9% and 23%, respectively. As I mentioned in our earnings press release, the pandemic and its impact on the labor force and put pressure on our costs. Much of our R&D efforts are diverted towards automation and efficiency in our services business and these productivity gains just counteract the pressure from higher labor costs. At same time, the great resignation is drawing attention that the highest levels of fund companies causing many to consider third-party administrators. This creates opportunity. We continue to see shifts in talent across the industry. Firms within house operations cannot hire talent fast enough. And our competitors are not able to replace talent or meet the needs of scaling their businesses. We see this phenomenon worldwide and we expect it to be a catalyst for outsourcing services as well as clients being willing to invest in technology. 2021 was a record breaking year for M&A, propelling our Intralinks business to new heights while our execution generated market share gains. Global M&A volumes topped $5 trillion for the first time ever, comfortably eclipsing the previous record of $4.55 trillion. Based on publicly announced deals, we gained 5% market share in the M&A market. Our current forecasts based on the survey of over 300 dealmakers and the majority expected level of M&A activity to increase in 2022. SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of 1.429 billion for the 12 months ended December 31 2021, up 20.6% or $244 million from 2020. We paid down $519.9 million of debt in 2021 and our leverage ratio stands at 1.72 secured and 2.69 total. Our shareholder friendly capital allocation strategy remains a top priority. In 2021, we bought back 6.8 million shares, an average price of 71.74 per share, for a total of $487.9 million. We were restricted from buying backs back in Q4, 2021, due to material nonpublic information related to the group Blue Prism acquisition. In November, the Board approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend payout, now at $0.20 per share. We are still limited to what we can say regarding the Blue Prism acquisition. We’ve made good progress with regulatory approvals and expect to close in Q1 or Q2. For more background on this acquisition and information on our strategic rationale, please refer to our steam document. I will now turn the call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks Bill. Sales execution, market strength and collaboration across our business units have been key drivers to this year’s performance. Our business performed extremely well and we made great progress on new technology, which will set us up for further success. We continue to focus on the innovation and Algorithmics our clients front-office operations can now achieve nanosecond response times for pre-trade deal checks. Algorithmics integration with singularity has led to new wins and increased pipeline. Chorus, our automated workflow solution has released a new workforce optimization tool focused on in-office remote and hybrid management to improve productivity and provide insights. Newly created SS&C Trust Suite combining Black Diamond and  under single contract and commercial model was sold to the first client. On the healthcare front, DomaniRx has been making great strides in building our cloud native API driven claims adjudication platform. Now I will mention some key deals for Q4. A top health insurance company chose singularity outsourcing services for their investment accounting operations. At $8 billion in AUM hedge fund chose a suite of global middle and back office services citing our ownership of technology as a key component to the win. A premier financial services firm chose our mutual fund serve accounting and all serve solution to efficiently scale and grow their new business. A $4.5 billion AUM asset manager based in Kuwait, chose a suite of Advent Geneva products. A $7.5 billion AUM trust company chose a suite of Advent cloud delivery products due to our overall solution for equity and fixed income. In New York based hedge fund, with a firm wide objective to move to the cloud, upgraded their trading operations to Eze Eclipse. The pension and investment arm of one of the Canadian provinces chose to upgrade to our newest investment accounting solution Aloha. A large Malaysian insurer also chose Aloha and our vision reporting solution. I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials.\nPatrick Pedonti: Thank you. Results for the fourth quarter of 2021 were GAAP revenues of $1 billion and $294.2 million, GAAP net income of $250.9 million and diluted EPS of $0.94. Adjusted revenues were $1 billion $296.2 million, including the impact of the adoption of the revenue standard 606 for acquired deferred revenue adjustments or acquisitions. Adjusted revenue was up 7.5%. Adjusted operating income increased 10.6% and adjusted EPS was $1.28, a 13.3 increase over Q4, 2020. Revenue shows strong growth with strength across several product lines including the alternative asset business, advent, apps, brokerage and the Intralinks businesses. Adjusted revenue increased $90.1 million or 7.5% over Q4, 2020. Our acquisitions contributed $10.5 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $0.8 million or 0.1% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue increased on a constant currency basis was 6.9% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $507.5 million, an increase of 48.7 or 10.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Adjusted operating margins increased from 38% in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 39.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by revenue growth and cost controls. Expenses increased 4.2% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $8.6 million expenses and foreign currency increased cost by $0.7 million. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA defined in note three of our earnings release was $522.9 million or 40.3% of adjusted revenue, an increase of $47.1 million or 9.9% from Q4, 2020. Net interest expense for the quarter was $49 million and includes $3.2 million of non-cash, amortized, financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter for our credit facility, including on senior notes was 3.09% compared to 2.99% in the fourth quarter of 2020. A reduction in the debt balance resulted in interest expense decrease of $4.1 million or 8%. Adjusted net income defined in note four of our earnings release was $341.3 million and adjusted EPS of $1.23. And the effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares increase 267 million from 266.5 million in Q3 as a result of an increase in the average share price and option exercises. On our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the fourth quarter with $564 million of cash and cash equivalents and $6 billion of gross debt. SS&C’s net debt as defined in our credit agreement, which includes cash and cash equivalents of $139.5 million held by, DomaniRx LLC was $5.6 billion as of the end of the year. Operating cash flow for 12 months was $1.429 million, a $244 million or 20.6% increase compared to 2020. And for the 12 months ended December 31, for the full year, we allocated proportionally to our free cash flow to both stock buybacks and debt payments. Treasury stock buybacks were $487.9 million for purchases of 6.8 million shares at an average price of $71.74 per share. And that compares to $227.7 million of treasury buybacks in 2020. In July 2021, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to a billion dollars in stock buybacks. We have approximately $837 million remaining on that authorization. Net debt payments were $519.9 million, compared to $738.2 million in 2020. We declared and paid $174 million of common stock dividends as compared to $136.1 million last year, an increase of 27.8%. For the full year, we paid income taxes of $310.4 million and that compares to $244.4 million in 2020. Our accounts receivable DSO was down to 49.5 days compared to 50.8 days as of September 2021, and 48.4 days as of December 2020. Capital expenditures and capitalized software was $136.6 million, just about 2.7% of adjusted revenue compared to $106.4 million in 2020. Spending was predominantly for capitalized software and IT infrastructure. Option exercise proceeds for the year were $197.7 million for 5 million shares compared to $189.7 million for 6.3 million shares last year. Our consolidated EBITDA which are used for our covenant compliance was $2.66 billion and includes $1.3 million of acquired EBITDA and cost saving related to acquisition. And based on that data $5.6 million, our total leverage ratio was 2.69 times and our secured ratio was 1.72 times. On our outlook for the year, I will first cover some high level assumptions. As we’re focusing on client services, we expect retention rates to continue to be in the range of most recent results. Pending acquisitions are not included in our current 2022 guidance. We have assumed foreign currency exchange will be at the current levels. As a result of adjusted organic growth for the year will be in the range of 2% to 6% and adjusted organic growth for Q1 will be in the range of 1.9% to 5.1%. On interest rates, we have assumed for the near term, it will be 30 Day LIBOR plus the spread of 175 bips. In mid-year and the latter part of the year, we’ve assumed that three-month to six-month LIBOR plus the spread. We expect staff costs to increase due to continued wage inflation. And we will manage our expenses during this period by controlling variable expenses to maintain our operating margins and we will continue to invest in our business for capital expenditures of approximately 2.8% of revenue. Now free cash flow, we will continue to allocate both to debt pay down and stock buybacks and we expect the adjusted tax rate to continue to be approximately 26%. So for the first quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.258 billion to $1.298 billion. Adjusted net income in the range of $326 million to $343.5 million and diluted shares in the range of $268.3 million to $267.8 million. For the full year of 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $5.130 billion to $5.330 billion Adjusted net income in the range of $1.375 billion to $1.445 billion and diluted shares in the range of $269.5 million to $267.5 million. And in our operating cash flow, we expect the full year to be in the range of $1.440 billion to $1.510 billion. And I’ll turn it over back to Bill for final comments.\nBill Stone: I’m proud to announce that we have completed our SS&C’s private cloud SOC-1. And we are very close to our SOC-2 on our private cloud which we expect to have within a week. These types of audits require an enormous amount of coordination and commitment. Not only have we delivered on our contractual commitments to customers, but our sales staff is busy showing prospects. We are one of the first companies with a SOC-1 and SOC-2 certified private cloud offering. Stay tuned as we rollout products and services which utilize this hyper secure, robust and lightning fast technology. I’ll now open it up for questions.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from a line of Michael Young with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nMichael Young: Sorry about that. I was having a bit of an issue with my view button as well. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe wanted to start with the commentary about the staff costs increases and trying to offset those with some other cost savings. Just as we kind of look forward to next year with the kind of the revenue guide in-line with current expectations. Should we think of kind of the EBITDA margin as normal, kind of slight expansion year-over-year? Or do you think there will be some pressure on that given kind of some of the dynamics with inflation?\nBill Stone: Well, I mean, we’re not immune. We are in businesses that our employees are highly sought after, and they’re a great team. And the raises and bonuses are going to be larger and more frequent. But, we also are going to have lots of productivity gains and we think that we will be able to stand our margins in the 50 to 75 basis points. And if we get a little tailwind, maybe we’ll do a little better.\nMichael Young: That’s helpful. And maybe just as a follow up, as we kind of think about maybe the business as a whole or specific business lines, how much does kind of inflation play into contract pricing and how much of a tailwind should we be expecting as a part of that next year?\nBill Stone: Well, our customers are like Truist and other sophisticated users of technology, and financial accounting, and investment accounting, and reporting and tax accounting and reporting. So they’re aware. They are aware that our costs increase, and they want to keep the same staff as we have on our clients. And that’s what really gets our people to work hand in glove with our clients. And so, people understand when costs go up, prices have to go up. And I think that is something that we are very cognizant of and we have focused on it for the last two or three years. And I think that nobody likes price increases, people certainly understand.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Bill, I’d like to start with a question about the revenue guidance for next year. It sounds like the adjusted organic growth is going to be in the 2% to 6% range for the full year. Can you put that in the context of Investor Day, where you talked about 4% to 7% longer term? Is it near term headwinds that you’re seeing or clients thinking about delaying projects? How should we think about what we heard at Investor Day a few months ago versus what the guide is currently?\nBill Stone: Well again, we’re trying to maybe be a little conservative, but certainly be realistic, and make sure of it. It’s a pretty uncertain time right now with the speculation on interest rates, the regulatory environment is constantly changing. And when you see as much M&A activity as you do today, lot of times our clients can merge to. So we work to be realistic, and we’ve been able to supply positive lead for a few quarters. And I am hoping that a bunch of business comes in. We have full pipelines, we got great products coming out. So we have some optimism, but we also want to temper that with realism.\nSurinder Thind: That’s helpful. And then, as a follow up to the earlier question about, it sounds like you’re still expecting to be able to expand margins by about 50 to maybe 75 basis points this year. Is there a bridge that you can provide us there in the sense that, obviously there is wage inflation and then, are you able to pass most of that or some of that costs on to clients? Or how should we think about that versus the productivity initiatives at this point? Just trying to get an idea for the balance of how to think about the push pull on margins at this point?\nBill Stone: Well, I mean, again we don’t control inflation and like everybody, we, I think last year hired 5.7 thousand people. So that’s a lot of people and so that’s a lot of training. And that’s a lot of education and that’s a lot of administration. So our costs are going to go up and when it’s inflationary, they’re going to go up more. And we’re going to compete, and we’re going to compete hard. And we’re going to deliver superior service to our clients. And in a period where we believe that a number of our competitors are going to deliver inferior service. And that’s the opportunity and that’s one of the ways in which our rates go up, and our price is firm, our margins are going to go up. And Rahul, you might have something to add.\nRahul Kanwar: Bill, in addition to the productivity and the labor force dynamics that you covered, we still have some opportunities on things like enterprise contracts that are coming up for renewal, and third-party software and discretionary spend. So in addition to obviously making sure that we’ve got highly motivated employees that are continuously innovating and making our processes better, we also keep looking at other areas in which to control costs, and all of those things together ought to result in some margin improvement.\nSurinder Thind: That’s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Company. Your line is open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. Hi, this is John on for Pete. Just quick one. Within fund administration have you guys seen any change in the competitive dynamics over the last year?\nBill Stone: Well, I think if you look at the -- it’s a league tables, you’ll see that APAC is buying everything in sight. And so they’re getting larger and they’ve done a number of acquisitions, they got a couple of them left on the limb to finish I think. But acquisitions are challenging and my guess is, it’s challenging for them. So other than what they have done, I don’t think there has been that much of a difference in our competitive landscape. Would you agree with that Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: I would Bill. I’d also say, if you look at our growth rates, our business is accelerating. So the other change in dynamic is that as we continue to build products and services and get more and more scale, our ability to compete and enhance that win rate, it just gets a little bit better every year. And that’s what we saw this past year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. I know the acquisitions aren’t included in the current 2022 guide. But just wondering, how should we look at the potential contribution of  shares EPS and Hubwise deals?\nPatrick Pedonti: It’s Patrick, I think, why this is fairly small and might be around $8 million in revenue. And no shares might be around $20 million revenue.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it, thank you so much.\nPatrick Pedonti: They’re both not included as we indicated.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I like the slide you have in the investor deck is just organic growth by business. It highlights the good growth in the alternatives business in 2021. So, I was wondering if you could talk about the expectation within the organic growth guidance for alternatives for 2022. And particularly, how you think about potential, we do see market volatility continue, what impact it could have on that business? Thanks.\nPatrick Pedonti: It’s Patrick, I think at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect the fund administration growth, they’re in the high single-digits for 2022. So, continued to be higher than historical.\nBill Stone: And there has been volatility at different times, if you look at the chart of our capital markets, our capital movement indicator that we publish every month, since 2011, I think it’s almost a straight line north. So, I think that the talent in the alternatives business match to the breadth of investments and strategies that that talented group of people have, I think bodes well for the alternatives. We see nothing but increased interest from very large scale fund companies, from very large scale institutions and very large scale sovereign wealth funds and government. So, I see if anything that in our guidance and stuff that are alternatives. Guidance might be the most conservative of all.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. That’s pretty constructive. I appreciate that. And then, just in the fourth quarter and maybe in the first quarter, Omicron have an impact on sales pipeline or deal closing. Just wondering if it might have temporarily slowed things down which might imply some pent-up demand at some point in the first quarter into the second quarter? Thanks.\nBill Stone: Well, like everything, right. Everything is Omicron related. There aren’t any mobile desk anymore, they are all some Omicron or some other COVID derivatives. But I think that 6.9% organic growth offer a pretty good Q4 of 2020, is pretty solid. And I think -- as I think Surinder said before, our four to seven that we talked on our Analyst Day, that’s just the high-end of the four to seven, and we again are focused on organic revenue growth. And even the acquisitions that we’ve done are really, we think are going to be very additive to our product offerings in the scope and capabilities that we’re going to be able to offer across our entire product line.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJackson Ader: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. The first one is on Blue Prism. It’s kind of has a different financial profile and some of the other recent acquisitions that you’ve made. So, just curious any initial thoughts on what the integration or strategy after closing might look like relative to some of the different acquisitions that you’ve made in the past?\nBill Stone: Yes. Yes, we’re really not in any position to comment on Blue Prism. And the London and U.K. takeover board frowns  for us to say anything. So, we think that that should close in Q1 or Q2 and we’ll be happy to set up a call with you at that time.\nJackson Ader: No big deal. I felt like I had to ask. And then the follow-up questions and with retention rates and AUA, both kind of ticking down. I’m curious how much then impact maybe the low retention rates add-on on assets versus maybe market factors?\nBill Stone: Yes. I don’t think -- we’re going to get a little bit of fluctuation with our AUA both with market values. And then also when certain clients launch new funds or even shutdown funds. And I do think we had one sovereign wealth fund with a lot of assets, but very few services. So, the amount of a drop could have been $30 billion, $40 billion, $50 billion, but I don’t think we made very much money on it, because they didn’t take very many service, right? So, we don’t do that as much of a headwind. And I think in first quarter of 2020, we were $2.150 billion and we’re not at $2.17 . I think. So, I think we have a very strong business and it’s getting stronger.\nJackson Ader: Okay. Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nChris Donat: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Bill and Rahul, I just want to follow-up on that last one about the AUA. Just looking at Slide 12, I was a little surprised at the reduction quarter-on-quarter on AUA, and Bill you just made the comment at the sovereign wealth fund. And I know you got a higher mix of fixed income assets and probably equity focused people like me think about. But can you just help me understand the sequential decline. And again, I’m equity biased. So I think about the S&P 500 being up like a 10.5% in the fourth quarter. So, I’m probably looking at the wrong fraction of the benchmark.\nBill Stone: Yes. Again, like I said, we’re going to have some fluctuation in this. But I would say, over time we have really grown our PLA I think the first quarter of 2020. We were at a $1.750 trillion and now we’re up almost $500 billion in two years. And if you looked at the league tables and yes, I think $500 billion, you get to be about fifth, and the league tables, it’s the fifth or sixth. And so, if -- and I think that was up, I mean, Rahul what’s up -- Middle East ?\nRahul Kanwar: Yes, that’s right. So, there is one sort of a one-off in there, we’re just like Bill just said, there is a nearly $50 billion AUA in a single customer that paid us less than a $1 million a year. And so, that’s the -- that I think is the biggest reason. The underlying other metrics on new funds, new business that we have won, performance driven growth, things like that continued to be in line with historical averages.\nChris Donat: Okay, thanks.\nBill Stone: And we would comment a little bit that we have very strong pipelines and we have a very strong salesforce and their executing.\nChris Donat: Okay. Thanks for clarifying that one. And then for Patrick, I would also I’d appreciate the organic growth by business broken now. Just thinking about the software businesses and DST’s financial, are the organic growth rates for 2021 probably the best way to think about growth rates for 2022?\nPatrick Pedonti: I think so. I think the metric changes we’ll see in 2022 is we’re expecting a decline in our healthcare business in 2022. And currently, we expect the growth rate of Intralinks to continue to be double digits, but not as high as 2021. And the vast majority of the other product lines would be pretty similar.\nChris Donat: Okay. Thanks very much, Patrick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks, so much. Well, I wonder if you could just talk into the revenue guidance for 2022. It looks like the range is 2% to 6%. Last year, it looks like the range was about 200 basis points from the low to the high end. Any sense of the puts and takes on what we get it to the low end this year versus the high end and why you widened out the range a little bit?\nPatrick Pedonti: I think the range in 2020 was somewhere around a $180 million and now its $2 million, that will take us how much different that from what I recall.\nKevin McVeigh: Okay. And maybe I --.\nPatrick Pedonti: In absolute terms.\nKevin McVeigh: Okay. Maybe, I may take it up.\nPatrick Pedonti: That’s what I recall, but I can get back to if you want.\nKevin McVeigh: Okay. Maybe follow-up of one.\nPatrick Pedonti: Okay. \nKevin McVeigh: Can you just remind us of the seasonality. I know there’s some year-end works things like that. How did that fall into the first quarter in terms of the filings and things like that. Is there any way to think about what the impact is on the quarter in that?\nBill Stone: Well, there’s a little more tax in financial statement works in the first and second quarters than third and fourth quarters. I think that’s the primary seasonality that we have. Is that right, Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: That’s right, Bill. And the other one is just there tends to be a little bit more license in Q4.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Jonathan on for James. I appreciate the color here. Can you provide an update on sort of the M&A environment from what you’re seeing obviously, you’re weighing on two deals to close? Whether you see any other attractive targets in the market and sort of what assets would you be looking for from a capability or geographic perspective?\nBill Stone: Yes. I think there is a number of properties that are in the market or coming to the market that we will have some interest in. Fintech has kind of reset as far as price is concerned if you look across the horizon. So, a number of fintechs that we’re trying to get public, then get it out and some of the ones that cut up early in the year have kind of come back to just moderate nose bleed levels instead of extreme. So, that gives us a lot more stuff to take a look at. So, at the same time, right, we’re going to push hard to get that organic revenue growth up. And so, the acquisitions have to have a higher hurdle. And we have a lot of people that want to do acquisitions within SS&C, but they recognized that if they don’t have organic revenue growth, we don’t have much capital for their acquisition plan. So, it’s trying to have it disciplined in the process that everybody understands that we always want to back our best businesses.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for that color, Bill. And I want to build on some of the questions that I’ve been already been asked around sort of pricing environment and wage inflation. How do you thinking about the magnitude timing of price increases through the year and just given some of that wage inflation you see in market?\nBill Stone: Yes. I mean -- Jonathan, that’s a great question. And it is one that we’ve given a lot of thought to and we’re trying to figure out different ways in which to make SS&C a great place for work. Make sure that we pay very well and that we’re extremely competitive. And so, on that side that is just what the labor market demands and it’s something that we’re well aware of it. It’s a lot of way that’s running a business. And when your cost go up, if you don’t send your prices up, obviously your margin is going to get hammered. So, we’re not that anxious to getting hammered. So, we’re focusing on those things and working hard with our clients to make sure that when they have issues that they need to have solve that it’s our number they call. So that -- and as you see we came out with a press release, I think a week ago or so and about our treasury management system. And we just did a seminar I think today where we had 277 people lined up or find up to come to our webinar on our new treasury management system. We have another product coming out in a very short order for both GoCentral that we’re really excited about. So, we have a lot of stuff happening. And you got to execute, you got to win. You have to have satisfied clients and you has to be upfront and brutally honest with everybody, so that we can get on with doing the things that are necessary to have a business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Loud and clear. Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes, hey. Hello, everyone. Just on the healthcare comment from earlier, with the decline, hopefully I got this right. But can you flush it out a little bit more, I mean, very recently you’ve sounded super bullish on that business. So, just want to make sure I didn’t miss anything there. And then maybe related, I think you are hoping to get some more partners into the Domani JV. So, maybe any updates there will be great?\nBill Stone: Yes. I mean, we remain very optimistic. We have a number of people that are trying to become partners. And customers, we have knock on wood, have some lot of progress on the development side. And so, we’re optimistic about that. And hopefully, we will have some announcements on healthcare over the next quarter or two that are quite positive. Is that how you would look at it, Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: That’s right, Bill. We were making -- we’re making a really good progress on the new system that we’re building and have lots of great support from our partners.\nAlex Kramm: And in regards to the decline, why this business going to be down this year, remind me please?\nRahul Kanwar: There’s some attrition on the medical claim side. So, Domani is very focused on pharmacy. And on the medical claim side, we have some attrition and some we’ve known about and we’re going to need to overcome that this year.\nAlex Kramm: Yes, okay, thanks. Thanks for the reminder. And then just real quick in terms of capital allocation, not sure if this came up already. But I know obviously got Blue Prism here soon. But outside of that given the cash flow that you’re throwing off, we delivers decently. Like so, should we assume buybacks can continue at a pretty attractive pace or how should we be thinking about the remainder of the cash in excess of any deals?\nBill Stone: Yes. Again, Alex, we’re trying to be as wise as we can be. I would guess given that the term market is still pretty strong. The high yield market not as. So, I would imagine that we will be pretty active in buying back our shares. And we’ll still pay down a good amount of debt. And obviously, we’re not paying down our 2% debts, so we can just refinance it on Blue Prism at 3% or 3.5%. So, we have a hoard of cash that we’ll use in closing these acquisitions. And then -- but we’re still generally like as you saw, we generated almost a quarter of a billion dollars in cash above what we did in 2020. So, at a $1.429 billion you have an awful lot of flexibility and awful lot of optionality.\nAlex Kramm: Very good. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Patrick O’Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nPatrick O’Shaughnessy: Hi, good evening. On the M&A front, do you think getting a regulatory approval for larger acquisitions is going to be incrementally more challenging going forward given the current stance of global regulators. Or would you anticipate likely steering clear from extended antitrust reviews?\nBill Stone: I mean, again -- Patrick, we’re not anxious to have antitrust reviews as you could imagine. At the same time, the more attractive an acquisition is, the more dog-in  we will be to close it. And hopefully that’s the way that we drive success in our M&A activities and well, we’re getting big, right, so we’re not going to be able to hide.\nPatrick O’Shaughnessy: Got it. Okay. And then staying on the regulatory theme, do you guys have any preliminary thoughts on how the SECs proposal to increase disclosure requirements on private fund managers might offer either opportunities or threats to SS&C?\nBill Stone: I think it’s primarily an opportunity to help our clients with additional regulation and we’re optimistic in our ability to do that.\nPatrick O’Shaughnessy: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Stone for closing remarks.\nBill Stone: Thanks everybody. We look forward to talk with you at the end of Q1. And stay healthy and stay safe. And we’ll talk to you in 90 days or so. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone, for joining. Our results for the fourth quarter are $1.296 billion in adjusted revenue, up 7.5%; and $1.28 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 13.3%. For the year, adjusted revenue was $5 billion and $589 million, up 8.1% and adjusted diluted EPS was $5.02, up 16.7%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $522.9 million for the quarter and our EBITDA margin was 40.3%. Our fourth quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 6.9% ahead of our expectations, our alternatives that Intralinks businesses continue to drive our top line growth growing at 12.9% and 23%, respectively. As I mentioned in our earnings press release, the pandemic and its impact on the labor force and put pressure on our costs. Much of our R&D efforts are diverted towards automation and efficiency in our services business and these productivity gains just counteract the pressure from higher labor costs. At same time, the great resignation is drawing attention that the highest levels of fund companies causing many to consider third-party administrators. This creates opportunity. We continue to see shifts in talent across the industry. Firms within house operations cannot hire talent fast enough. And our competitors are not able to replace talent or meet the needs of scaling their businesses. We see this phenomenon worldwide and we expect it to be a catalyst for outsourcing services as well as clients being willing to invest in technology. 2021 was a record breaking year for M&A, propelling our Intralinks business to new heights while our execution generated market share gains. Global M&A volumes topped $5 trillion for the first time ever, comfortably eclipsing the previous record of $4.55 trillion. Based on publicly announced deals, we gained 5% market share in the M&A market. Our current forecasts based on the survey of over 300 dealmakers and the majority expected level of M&A activity to increase in 2022. SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of 1.429 billion for the 12 months ended December 31 2021, up 20.6% or $244 million from 2020. We paid down $519.9 million of debt in 2021 and our leverage ratio stands at 1.72 secured and 2.69 total. Our shareholder friendly capital allocation strategy remains a top priority. In 2021, we bought back 6.8 million shares, an average price of 71.74 per share, for a total of $487.9 million. We were restricted from buying backs back in Q4, 2021, due to material nonpublic information related to the group Blue Prism acquisition. In November, the Board approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend payout, now at $0.20 per share. We are still limited to what we can say regarding the Blue Prism acquisition. We've made good progress with regulatory approvals and expect to close in Q1 or Q2. For more background on this acquisition and information on our strategic rationale, please refer to our steam document. I will now turn the call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail. I'm proud to announce that we have completed our SS&C's private cloud SOC-1. And we are very close to our SOC-2 on our private cloud which we expect to have within a week. These types of audits require an enormous amount of coordination and commitment. Not only have we delivered on our contractual commitments to customers, but our sales staff is busy showing prospects. We are one of the first companies with a SOC-1 and SOC-2 certified private cloud offering. Stay tuned as we rollout products and services which utilize this hyper secure, robust and lightning fast technology. I'll now open it up for questions. Well, I mean, we're not immune. We are in businesses that our employees are highly sought after, and they're a great team. And the raises and bonuses are going to be larger and more frequent. But, we also are going to have lots of productivity gains and we think that we will be able to stand our margins in the 50 to 75 basis points. And if we get a little tailwind, maybe we'll do a little better. Well, our customers are like Truist and other sophisticated users of technology, and financial accounting, and investment accounting, and reporting and tax accounting and reporting. So they're aware. They are aware that our costs increase, and they want to keep the same staff as we have on our clients. And that's what really gets our people to work hand in glove with our clients. And so, people understand when costs go up, prices have to go up. And I think that is something that we are very cognizant of and we have focused on it for the last two or three years. And I think that nobody likes price increases, people certainly understand. Well again, we're trying to maybe be a little conservative, but certainly be realistic, and make sure of it. It's a pretty uncertain time right now with the speculation on interest rates, the regulatory environment is constantly changing. And when you see as much M&A activity as you do today, lot of times our clients can merge to. So we work to be realistic, and we've been able to supply positive lead for a few quarters.

So, we think that that should close in Q1 or Q2 and we'll be happy to set up a call with you at that time. Yes. I don't think -- we're going to get a little bit of fluctuation with our AUA both with market values. And then also when certain clients launch new funds or even shutdown funds. And I do think we had one sovereign wealth fund with a lot of assets, but very few services. So, the amount of a drop could have been $30 billion, $40 billion, $50 billion, but I don't think we made very much money on it, because they didn't take very many service, right? So, we don't do that as much of a headwind. And I think in first quarter of 2020, we were $2.150 billion and we're not at $2.17 . I think. So, I think we have a very strong business and it's getting stronger. Yes. Again, like I said, we're going to have some fluctuation in this. But I would say, over time we have really grown our PLA I think the first quarter of 2020. We were at a $1.750 trillion and now we're up almost $500 billion in two years. And if you looked at the league tables and yes, I think $500 billion, you get to be about fifth, and the league tables, it's the fifth or sixth. And so, if -- and I think that was up, I mean, Rahul what's up -- Middle East ? And we would comment a little bit that we have very strong pipelines and we have a very strong salesforce and their executing. Well, there's a little more tax in financial statement works in the first and second quarters than third and fourth quarters. I think that's the primary seasonality that we have. Is that right, Rahul? Yes. I think there is a number of properties that are in the market or coming to the market that we will have some interest in. Fintech has kind of reset as far as price is concerned if you look across the horizon. So, a number of fintechs that we're trying to get public, then get it out and some of the ones that cut up early in the year have kind of come back to just moderate nose bleed levels instead of extreme. So, that gives us a lot more stuff to take a look at. So, at the same time, right, we're going to push hard to get that organic revenue growth up. And so, the acquisitions have to have a higher hurdle. And we have a lot of people that want to do acquisitions within SS&C, but they recognized that if they don't have organic revenue growth, we don't have much capital for their acquisition plan. So, it's trying to have it disciplined in the process that everybody understands that we always want to back our best businesses. Yes. I mean -- Jonathan, that's a great question. And it is one that we've given a lot of thought to and we're trying to figure out different ways in which to make SS&C a great place for work. Make sure that we pay very well and that we're extremely competitive. And so, on that side that is just what the labor market demands and it's something that we're well aware of it. It's a lot of way that's running a business. And when your cost go up, if you don't send your prices up, obviously your margin is going to get hammered. So, we're not that anxious to getting hammered. So, we're focusing on those things and working hard with our clients to make sure that when they have issues that they need to have solve that it's our number they call. So that -- and as you see we came out with a press release, I think a week ago or so and about our treasury management system. And we just did a seminar I think today where we had 277 people lined up or find up to come to our webinar on our new treasury management system. We have another product coming out in a very short order for both GoCentral that we're really excited about. So, we have a lot of stuff happening. And you got to execute, you got to win. You have to have satisfied clients and you has to be upfront and brutally honest with everybody, so that we can get on with doing the things that are necessary to have a business. Yes. I mean, we remain very optimistic. We have a number of people that are trying to become partners. And customers, we have knock on wood, have some lot of progress on the development side. And so, we're optimistic about that. And hopefully, we will have some announcements on healthcare over the next quarter or two that are quite positive. Is that how you would look at it, Rahul? Yes. Again, Alex, we're trying to be as wise as we can be. I would guess given that the term market is still pretty strong. The high yield market not as. So, I would imagine that we will be pretty active in buying back our shares. And we'll still pay down a good amount of debt. And obviously, we're not paying down our 2% debts, so we can just refinance it on Blue Prism at 3% or 3.5%. So, we have a hoard of cash that we'll use in closing these acquisitions. And then -- but we're still generally like as you saw, we generated almost a quarter of a billion dollars in cash above what we did in 2020. So, at a $1.429 billion you have an awful lot of flexibility and awful lot of optionality. I mean, again -- Patrick, we're not anxious to have antitrust reviews as you could imagine. At the same time, the more attractive an acquisition is, the more dog-in  we will be to close it. And hopefully that's the way that we drive success in our M&A activities and well, we're getting big, right, so we're not going to be able to hide. I think it's primarily an opportunity to help our clients with additional regulation and we're optimistic in our ability to do that. Thanks everybody. We look forward to talk with you at the end of Q1. And stay healthy and stay safe. And we'll talk to you in 90 days or so. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you. Results for the fourth quarter of 2021 were GAAP revenues of $1 billion and $294.2 million, GAAP net income of $250.9 million and diluted EPS of $0.94. Adjusted revenues were $1 billion $296.2 million, including the impact of the adoption of the revenue standard 606 for acquired deferred revenue adjustments or acquisitions. Adjusted revenue was up 7.5%. Adjusted operating income increased 10.6% and adjusted EPS was $1.28, a 13.3 increase over Q4, 2020. Revenue shows strong growth with strength across several product lines including the alternative asset business, advent, apps, brokerage and the Intralinks businesses. Adjusted revenue increased $90.1 million or 7.5% over Q4, 2020. Our acquisitions contributed $10.5 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $0.8 million or 0.1% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue increased on a constant currency basis was 6.9% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $507.5 million, an increase of 48.7 or 10.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Adjusted operating margins increased from 38% in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 39.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by revenue growth and cost controls. Expenses increased 4.2% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $8.6 million expenses and foreign currency increased cost by $0.7 million. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA defined in note three of our earnings release was $522.9 million or 40.3% of adjusted revenue, an increase of $47.1 million or 9.9% from Q4, 2020. Net interest expense for the quarter was $49 million and includes $3.2 million of non-cash, amortized, financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter for our credit facility, including on senior notes was 3.09% compared to 2.99% in the fourth quarter of 2020. A reduction in the debt balance resulted in interest expense decrease of $4.1 million or 8%. Adjusted net income defined in note four of our earnings release was $341.3 million and adjusted EPS of $1.23. And the effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares increase 267 million from 266.5 million in Q3 as a result of an increase in the average share price and option exercises. On our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the fourth quarter with $564 million of cash and cash equivalents and $6 billion of gross debt. SS&C's net debt as defined in our credit agreement, which includes cash and cash equivalents of $139.5 million held by, DomaniRx LLC was $5.6 billion as of the end of the year. Operating cash flow for 12 months was $1.429 million, a $244 million or 20.6% increase compared to 2020. And for the 12 months ended December 31, for the full year, we allocated proportionally to our free cash flow to both stock buybacks and debt payments. Treasury stock buybacks were $487.9 million for purchases of 6.8 million shares at an average price of $71.74 per share. And that compares to $227.7 million of treasury buybacks in 2020. In July 2021, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to a billion dollars in stock buybacks. We have approximately $837 million remaining on that authorization. Net debt payments were $519.9 million, compared to $738.2 million in 2020. We declared and paid $174 million of common stock dividends as compared to $136.1 million last year, an increase of 27.8%. For the full year, we paid income taxes of $310.4 million and that compares to $244.4 million in 2020. Our accounts receivable DSO was down to 49.5 days compared to 50.8 days as of September 2021, and 48.4 days as of December 2020. Capital expenditures and capitalized software was $136.6 million, just about 2.7% of adjusted revenue compared to $106.4 million in 2020. Spending was predominantly for capitalized software and IT infrastructure. Option exercise proceeds for the year were $197.7 million for 5 million shares compared to $189.7 million for 6.3 million shares last year. Our consolidated EBITDA which are used for our covenant compliance was $2.66 billion and includes $1.3 million of acquired EBITDA and cost saving related to acquisition. And based on that data $5.6 million, our total leverage ratio was 2.69 times and our secured ratio was 1.72 times. On our outlook for the year, I will first cover some high level assumptions. As we're focusing on client services, we expect retention rates to continue to be in the range of most recent results. Pending acquisitions are not included in our current 2022 guidance. We have assumed foreign currency exchange will be at the current levels. As a result of adjusted organic growth for the year will be in the range of 2% to 6% and adjusted organic growth for Q1 will be in the range of 1.9% to 5.1%. On interest rates, we have assumed for the near term, it will be 30 Day LIBOR plus the spread of 175 bips. In mid-year and the latter part of the year, we've assumed that three-month to six-month LIBOR plus the spread. We expect staff costs to increase due to continued wage inflation. And we will manage our expenses during this period by controlling variable expenses to maintain our operating margins and we will continue to invest in our business for capital expenditures of approximately 2.8% of revenue. Now free cash flow, we will continue to allocate both to debt pay down and stock buybacks and we expect the adjusted tax rate to continue to be approximately 26%. So for the first quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.258 billion to $1.298 billion. Adjusted net income in the range of $326 million to $343.5 million and diluted shares in the range of $268.3 million to $267.8 million. For the full year of 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $5.130 billion to $5.330 billion Adjusted net income in the range of $1.375 billion to $1.445 billion and diluted shares in the range of $269.5 million to $267.5 million. And in our operating cash flow, we expect the full year to be in the range of $1.440 billion to $1.510 billion. And I'll turn it over back to Bill for final comments. It's Patrick, I think, why this is fairly small and might be around $8 million in revenue. And no shares might be around $20 million revenue. They're both not included as we indicated. It's Patrick, I think at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect the fund administration growth, they're in the high single-digits for 2022. So, continued to be higher than historical. I think so. I think the metric changes we'll see in 2022 is we're expecting a decline in our healthcare business in 2022. And currently, we expect the growth rate of Intralinks to continue to be double digits, but not as high as 2021. And the vast majority of the other product lines would be pretty similar. I think the range in 2020 was somewhere around a $180 million and now its $2 million, that will take us how much different that from what I recall. In absolute terms. That's what I recall, but I can get back to if you want. Okay."

            "content": "Thanks Bill. Sales execution, market strength and collaboration across our business units have been key drivers to this year's performance. Our business performed extremely well and we made great progress on new technology, which will set us up for further success. We continue to focus on the innovation and Algorithmics our clients front-office operations can now achieve nanosecond response times for pre-trade deal checks. Algorithmics integration with singularity has led to new wins and increased pipeline. Chorus, our automated workflow solution has released a new workforce optimization tool focused on in-office remote and hybrid management to improve productivity and provide insights. Newly created SS&C Trust Suite combining Black Diamond and  under single contract and commercial model was sold to the first client. On the healthcare front, DomaniRx has been making great strides in building our cloud native API driven claims adjudication platform. Now I will mention some key deals for Q4. A top health insurance company chose singularity outsourcing services for their investment accounting operations. At $8 billion in AUM hedge fund chose a suite of global middle and back office services citing our ownership of technology as a key component to the win. A premier financial services firm chose our mutual fund serve accounting and all serve solution to efficiently scale and grow their new business. A $4.5 billion AUM asset manager based in Kuwait, chose a suite of Advent Geneva products. A $7.5 billion AUM trust company chose a suite of Advent cloud delivery products due to our overall solution for equity and fixed income. In New York based hedge fund, with a firm wide objective to move to the cloud, upgraded their trading operations to Eze Eclipse. The pension and investment arm of one of the Canadian provinces chose to upgrade to our newest investment accounting solution Aloha. A large Malaysian insurer also chose Aloha and our vision reporting solution. I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials. Bill, in addition to the productivity and the labor force dynamics that you covered, we still have some opportunities on things like enterprise contracts that are coming up for renewal, and third-party software and discretionary spend. So in addition to obviously making sure that we've got highly motivated employees that are continuously innovating and making our processes better, we also keep looking at other areas in which to control costs, and all of those things together ought to result in some margin improvement. I would Bill. I'd also say, if you look at our growth rates, our business is accelerating. So the other change in dynamic is that as we continue to build products and services and get more and more scale, our ability to compete and enhance that win rate, it just gets a little bit better every year. And that's what we saw this past year. Yes, that's right. So, there is one sort of a one-off in there, we're just like Bill just said, there is a nearly $50 billion AUA in a single customer that paid us less than a $1 million a year. And so, that's the -- that I think is the biggest reason. The underlying other metrics on new funds, new business that we have won, performance driven growth, things like that continued to be in line with historical averages. That's right, Bill. And the other one is just there tends to be a little bit more license in Q4. That's right, Bill. We were making -- we're making a really good progress on the new system that we're building and have lots of great support from our partners. There's some attrition on the medical claim side. So, Domani is very focused on pharmacy. And on the medical claim side, we have some attrition and some we've known about and we're going to need to overcome that this year."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. . I would now like to turn the call over to Justine Stone, Investor Relations, for opening remarks. You may proceed.\nJustine Stone: Hi, everyone. Welcome, and thank you for joining us for our Q3 2021 earnings call. I'm Justine Stone, Head of Investor Relations for SS&C. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Pedonti, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, we need to review the safe harbor statement. Please note that various remarks we make today about future expectations, plans and prospects, including the financial outlook we provide, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and can also be accessed on our website. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of today, October 28, 2021. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in today's earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. Also in the third quarter, we entered into a joint venture named DomaniRx LLC, which we -- in which we are the majority interest holder and primary beneficiary. All earnings figures discussed today, including operating income, EBITDA, net income and EPS are attributable to SS&C based on the ownership interest retained by SS&C. I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stone : Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone, for joining. Our results for the third quarter are $1.266 billion in adjusted revenue, up 9.5%; and $1.32 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 20%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $530 million, and we are on track to end the year with over $2 billion in EBITDA. Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin grew to 42.6% in the quarter, up 230 basis points from Q3 2020. Our third quarter adjusted organic revenue was 8.2% as we continue to gain momentum and beat Q2's 7.2% organic revenue. All of our businesses outperformed our expectations and our alternatives, Intralinks and software businesses drove the top line growth. We have accelerated our new business wins and competitive takeaways, while capitalizing on strong markets. The past few quarters highlights SS&C's financial power. Without digesting large acquisitions, we were able to drive strong top line growth organically while improving margins over 200 basis points and growing earnings at 20%. We have maintained our lower cost structure through the pandemic and continue to drive efficiencies through automation. Machine learning, robotics process automation and artificial intelligence capabilities are being implemented across our businesses and products. We are currently rolling out our strategic development enhancement within the hedge fund services portal, whereby we are leveraging various AI principles and concepts to enhance controls, provide greater transparency around NAV anomalies, exceptions and key operational processes. This new product is called . These types of development efforts not only generate revenue, but are margin enhancing. SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $944.8 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2021, up 25% from the same period last year. We repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock in Q3 2021 at an average price of $75.97 per share for $152.9 -- or $162.9 million. At our current valuation, we will continue to aggressively buy back stock. We paid down $317.8 million in debt for the first 9 months of 2021, and our leverage ratio stands at 1.7x secured and 2.96x total leverage. We remain committed to a shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. And now that we are under 3.0x levered, we have increased flexibility to allocate more cash towards buybacks. Our business is running on all cylinders. Our pipelines are strong with increasingly complex global large deals as organizations review their complete operating model and technology stack. Several of our products have met milestones, the most recent being Precision LM exceeding 100 clients. The growth comes as banks and nonbank lenders have increased their investment portfolio's private credit lending activities and exposure to commercial and residential loans. Precision LM added 20 new clients in the last 12 months. We are capitalizing on market trends and recently launched our ESG reporting solutions platform for asset managers to better monitor and report on ESG exposure. Our solution provides accurate and detailed ESG ratings data, which a game changer to help investors understand sustainable investing and ESG exposures. I'll now turn the call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks, Bill. Most of our global offices have reopened, and we're seeing employees attending in increasing numbers on a voluntary basis. We're optimistic that the added opportunities for in-person collaboration, combined with the work anywhere flexibility we're providing to our staff will enhance innovation and execution. Our businesses are benefiting from the global trend towards outsourced technology and services. As firms evaluate their desired post-pandemic operational state, our fund administration, middle office and advent businesses are seeing greater demand. This trend also impacts private market alternatives with firms looking at their operational capability and limited partners assessing the resilience and scalability of the managers they invest with.  Our functional depth continues to grow in lockstep with the steady addition of signed and live clients. Collaboration across SS&C teams, combined with R&D investments have resulted in a new generation of enterprise solutions. These allow asset managers, banks, insurance companies, alternative managers, retirement and wealth management firms and others to look to SS&C as a strategic partner that offers a comprehensive solution set to address several of their requirements. As a result, we're seeing larger deal sizes and greater appreciation for the ways in which we can deliver value to our customers. Now, I will mention some key deals. One of the largest -- world's largest hedge funds and existing middle-office client chose SS&C to run shadow accounting. A managed account platform chose SS&C GlobeOp for fund services, financial statements, bank loan servicing and reconciliation. A $30 billion-plus hedge fund who had been running Axys for over 20 years upgraded to Geneva and Geneva cloud delivery after 3-year valuation. A $10 billion-plus Canadian prime broker added Advent Syncova to their technology stack, citing its scalability. A $50 billion AUA asset manager chose Black Diamond because of our partnership focus. A U.S.-based wealth manager saw the higher level of support and stability and chose a combination of Eze EMS and market trader to replace their current solution. A top U.S. insurance company chose Chorus our latest automated workflow solution. An existing fund administration client expanded their relationship to include retail alternatives, transfer agency, digital investor and Chorus. I'll now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials.\nPatrick Pedonti: Thanks, Rahul. Results for the third quarter 2021 were GAAP revenues of $1,264.4 million, GAAP net income of $184.4 million and diluted EPS of $0.69. Adjusted revenues were $1,266.3 million, including the impact with the adoption of the revenue standard 606 and for acquired deferred revenue adjustments for acquisitions. Adjusted revenue was up 9.5%, adjusted operating income increased 16.8% and adjusted EPS was $1.32, a 20% increase over Q3 2020. Overall, adjusted revenue increased $110.1 million or 9.5% over Q3 2020. Our acquisitions contributed $10 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $10.4 million or 0.9% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue increase on a constant currency basis was 8.2%. We had strength across several product lines, including alternative assets, Advent software, retirement business, ALPS, our brokerage business and the Intralinks business. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $524.1 million, an increase of $75.3 million or 16.8% over the third quarter of 2020. Adjusted operating margins increased 38.8% -- adjusted operating margins increased from 38.8% in Q3 2020 to 41.4% in the third quarter of 2021 or 260 basis points improvement, driven by strong revenue increase and cost controls. Expenses increased 2.2% on a constant currency basis. In addition, acquisitions added $9.6 million of expenses and foreign currency increased costs by $8.4 million. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA, which is defined in Note 3 of our earnings release, was $538.9 million or 42.6% of adjusted revenue and increased $72.6 million or 15.6% from Q3 2020. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA margins increased 230 basis points from the third quarter of 2020. Net interest expense for the third quarter was $50.2 million and includes $3.3 million of noncash amortized financing costs and OID. The average rate in the quarter for our credit facility and our senior notes was 3.1% compared to 3% in the third quarter of 2020. A reduction in our debt balance resulted in interest expense decreasing $4.5 million or 8.2%. During the third quarter, in connection with the legacy DST ERISA matters and associated legal proceedings, we recorded an expense of $43.4 million to other income and expense. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with the resolution of this litigation, the ultimate resolution and any potential exposure related to this matter is somewhat uncertain at this time. We recorded a GAAP tax provision in the quarter of $60.6 million or 24.7% of pretax income, and expect the GAAP tax provision to be approximately 26% for the full year. Adjusted net income was $352.9 million and adjusted EPS was $1.32, and the effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was also 26%. Diluted shares increased to -- decreased from 266.5 million from 267.6 million in the second quarter. The impact of share repurchases was partially offset by an increase in the average share price and option exercises. On the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $351.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.2 billion of gross debt. SS&C's net debt, as defined by our credit agreement, which includes -- excludes any cash and cash equivalents of $138 million held at the DomaniRx JV was $6 billion as of September 30. Cash flow for the 9 months ended September 30 was $944.9 million, $189.8 million or 25% increase compared to the same period in 2020. A couple of highlights for the 9 months. We've purchased treasury stock buybacks of $487.9 million or purchases of 6.8 million shares at an average price of $71.74 per share. In July 2021, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to $1 billion of stock buybacks. The program to date, treasury stock buybacks of $162 million for purchase of 2.1 million shares at an average price of $75.97. Net debt payments were $317.8 million compared to $330 million in the same period of 2020. We declared and paid $122.8 million of common stock dividends, an increase of 22.9% the prior year. In the 9 months, we paid $173.2 million of interest expense compared to $212.7 million in 2020. In income taxes, we've paid $230.8 million compared to $182.5 million in the same period in 2020. Capital expenditures and capitalized software were $96.2 million or 2.6% of year-to-date adjusted revenue compared to $80 million or 2.3% year-to-date in Q3 of 2020. Our LTM EBITDA, which is used for covenant compliance, was $2,019.5 million as of September 2021 and includes $1.8 million of acquired EBITDA and cost savings related to acquisition. And based on a net debt of $6 billion, our total leverage was 2.96x and our secured leverage ratio was 1.97x. On outlook for the fourth quarter, I'll cover a couple of assumptions first. So we'll continue to focus on delivering quality client service, and we expect our retention rates will continue in the range of our most recent results. We'll expect foreign currency exchange to be at approximately current levels. And adjusted organic growth for the year will be in the range of 4.8% to 5.9%. Adjusted organic growth for the fourth quarter will be in the range of 1.1% to 5.3%. Interest rates on our term loan will be approximately the 1-month LIBOR plus the spread, which is currently 175 bps. We expect expenses to increase sequentially due in part to the impact of higher personnel costs as a result of our annual merit increases, which took effect October 1, and we're seeing increased employee benefit costs.  We'll continue to invest in our business long term and capital expenditures will be approximately 2.8%. And we'll continue to allocate free cash flow to both stock buybacks and some debt paydown. But for the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.275 billion. Adjusted net income in the range of $311 million to $334 million. Diluted shares in the range of 266.2 million to 266.7 million. And for the full year, the range for revenue will be $4.988 billion to $5.038 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $1.312 billion to $1.335 billion and diluted shares in the range of 266.9 million to 267.4 million. And for the full year, we expect cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.365 billion to $1.385 billion. And now I'll turn it over back to Bill for final comments.\nBill Stone : Thanks, Patrick. We're proud of the progress we've made this year. All of our businesses are gaining momentum, capitalizing on opportunities and continuously improving. Organic growth was up 8.2%, and we expect around 5.5% for the full year. Hopefully, we can surprise you positively. Alternative assets under administration increased another 80 billion in Q3 for a total increase of 480 billion since the first quarter of 2020. We now have 2.2 trillion in assets under administration, and we’re hundreds of billions ahead of our next competitor.  Our EBITDA margins were up 230 basis points. And we’re operating at our highest margins since the large acquisitions we made in 2018. We have a number of strong leaders and an abundance of opportunity, which we will showcase on November 10 Virtual Analyst Day. Please see our events on our Investor Relations webpage to register and reach out to Justine for additional information.  I'll now open it for questions.\nOperator: . Your first question comes from Surinder Thind of Jefferies.\nSurinder Thind: Congratulations on the quarter, gentlemen. My first question is related to just the margin profile. There was a significant increase in the margins quarter-over-quarter. And then we had a similar increase last quarter. On the call, you talked a little bit about automation being one of the drivers. Is there any additional color that you can provide in terms of what might be a normalized level? When I look at the gross margins for your software services-enabled business, it seems that's where you're realizing most of the savings.\nBill Stone: Well, I'll give a little crack and then Rahul and Patrick, you guys can chime in. But since the pandemic, we're not leasing near as much space as we did in the end of 2020, and I believe that will continue into 2022. And we also have had less aggressive hiring than we have had in the past, not that we aren't hiring, we are, but we have probably had some pickup because of the number of people we had versus what we had expected. So I think those are 2 big things. And I think that our pricing discipline has helped us, and I believe it will continue. Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: Bill, I agree with all of that. And I think the things that I would add are: we've also had an opportunity to spend a fair amount of energy on R&D. So Bill talked about machine learning and some of the other things we're doing, and that has resulted in productivity, right? And we expect those productivity gains to continue.\nSurinder Thind: So just to clarify, is the current level of margins that you're generating in the neighborhood of what we should expect on a go-forward basis, subject to any kind of seasonality?\nBill Stone: I think that's right. I mean, again, right, it's -- we've always been around 40, and I think the latest 42.6, and so I would say it's going to be somewhere between 40 and 44. And it will fluctuate based on investments we make. And we tend not to be particularly aggressive about capitalizing software and stuff like that, so I think we will continue to not be particularly aggressive on that. And so I would think that our margins will depend on some of the ability to -- which we have proven that we can close big deals, but -- and we have proven that we can get them live, but the difference between getting them live in, say, the third quarter and getting them live in the fourth quarter can often impact margin in the 10 basis point to 20 basis point range.\nSurinder Thind: That's helpful. And as my follow-up, Bill, in terms of just the capital allocation strategy now that you're kind of below the 3x leverage ratio, you talked about having additional flexibility. If we were to translate that into practically, what does that mean? Is that you're going to primarily now focus on share repurchases at this point? Or is there -- you're willing to take leverage down further? Is there kind of a level that you're not willing to go below when it comes to leverage? Just any color you can provide there in terms of why you wait for the right acquisition.\nBill Stone: Yes. Surinder, if you look at the -- if you look at our -- what we expect in cash flow, which is around $1.350 billion, I think and I think that share counts Patrick quoted were 266 million, 267 million, you're talking about $5 a share in cash. And so obviously, on a finance basis, buying back shares is a lot better than paying off 2% debt. Now at the same time, we would like to deploy that $4 billion we have in 2% debt to faster-growing assets and obviously, with better margins. And so we're constantly on the lookout to try to do that. And I would tell you that primarily our lookout right now is that we have a lot of faith in our development teams, but we have a lot of excitement around DomaniRx. We think that things like  and other things that we are bringing out are indicative of our development capability. And I would say that we will continue to drive cash towards those things. But I think, on the surface, we would probably be a little more aggressive in stock buybacks than we would be in debt repayment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Young of Truist Securities.\nMichael Young: Wanted to ask kind of a follow-up on the margin profile question and just think about it in the context of some of the macro drivers, mainly inflation. Net-net, does that kind of help you guys on the pricing side and being able to push pricing higher more so than it impacts on the cost side? Any thoughts there would be helpful.\nBill Stone: I think that's a great question. I think that, obviously, inflationary times and all of your organizations are similar issues with the increasing wages, which I'm not -- I hope to pay our people more, so -- and I know that our clients like to have continuity with the talented people that we have on their accounts. So I think they also understand that there will have to be some revenue adjustments to them, some price increases. So net-net, I think you're right, we might be able to get 50 basis points, maybe 100 basis points more on the revenue side than on the expense side. But I wouldn't say it's going to be -- I mean, if inflation goes wild, and that's a lot different. But if inflation stays 2%, 3%, 4%, then I think it will be -- could be a little bit of a tailwind, but it's not going to be massive.\nMichael Young: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a second just on kind of general sales pipeline as we're kind of getting back to normal, maybe post pandemic more in-person sales ability, et cetera. Are you seeing strength or opportunities to land kind of larger deals? Or any update there just kind of on pipeline and progress there?\nBill Stone: Yes. I believe we are. We're also engaging at higher and higher levels in organizations. And we have a number of very successful lift-outs that we have done that we are going to turn it into a pitch book on how we could maybe take some of your people as well as these accounting processes and reporting processes, risk processes, compliance processes and other things that we do exceptionally well and try to be able to really streamline these large financial institutions, middle and back offices. And also, obviously, we have front to back, so we can do trading and compliance and risk and ESG and other things. And so we're pretty optimistic about our opportunity to continue to go upscale.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Schmidt of Citi.\nAndrew Schmidt: First, I just want to dig into the third quarter organic revenue growth performance. Really nice to see the acceleration in growth. Do you talk about just the factors that drove that acceleration in the second quarter, the third quarter? Patrick, I know you mentioned strength in a few products, but if we could dig into that a little bit more, that would be helpful. And then based on the momentum you have in the third quarter, just how you're thinking about the fourth quarter setup from an organic growth perspective based on those factors? Because it does seem like you have some pretty good momentum here. So just curious to get your thoughts around third quarter, and then how those factors relate to the fourth quarter performance.\nBill Stone: Well, again, we do believe we have some momentum. And again, as we said in our remarks as well as in our press release, our software businesses, Advent, in particular, and our fund administration businesses as well as our Intralinks businesses have been particularly strong, and we would expect all 3 of those to continue that strong pattern. And I think that again, as we add the tens of billions of dollars to our or AUA, those revenues start to flow into our financial statements, and obviously, that's some tailwind as well. Rahul, could you add to that?\nRahul Kanwar: No, I think I'd echo all of that. I'd also say that some of what we've done in the last 18 months-or-so is really fostered this collaboration within SS&C, where our products and services are much more integrated and our teams are much more integrated when they go talk to large asset managers or large banks or whatever prospects they might have. And that's resulted in the opportunities that we have in front of us, have larger ticket sizes. And sometimes they take a little longer to sell, but if you have enough of them, that's pretty additive to the revenue process. And we think that, that helps us drive sustainable growth.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. That's helpful. And not to front-run the Analyst Day, but it does seem like the comments on the margin front are pretty constructive in terms of your runway there based on both scale and the efficiency initiatives. And then on the top line, it seems like based on your comments, Rahul, that you have pretty good visibility based on some of the -- or I should say, better visibility based on some of the investments you've made. Is providing an intermediate or longer-term outlook based on those factors something you might consider just to help people think about the longer-term algorithm for the business?\nBill Stone: Yes. I believe that we're constantly studying how we deliver information to all of you. And I think over the next quarter or 2, we will start being a little more granular and try to give you a little bit longer viewpoint of where we think things are going to be, and I think that might be well received by the analyst and investing community.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Heckmann of D.A. Davidson.\nPeter Heckmann: I just wanted to follow up on fund administration. The company continues to gain share. Can you talk a little bit about where you're gaining share? And kind of how you're gaining share? Is it primarily from the smaller and mid-tier fund administrators? Or is there a mix of funds outsourcing for the first time? And what other dynamics should we be thinking about? I know there's some transition going on in, I think, the domicile of Malta, don't know if that's going to require any changes in your business. But really what -- how does this continue to win new contracts and continue to gather AUA?\nBill Stone: Well, I believe we're somewhat, by far, the most innovative fund administrator in the world. And we use our own software in our fund administration business as do 40 other fund administrators. But we're always on the current release, and we're always pushing the envelope. So the kinds of products like , we will be the first to adopt and the first to demonstrate and it will create excitement. And then often, larger financial institutions have more difficulty installing releases in large-scale systems. And so sometimes they get behind on a few releases, and they don't do the training like we do the training, and there's a whole series of things that we do. And we have a very strong sales force, very capable. And increasingly, our marketing is more targeted, and our audience is more interested because of the breadth and depth of what we deliver. Can you add to that, Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: So that covers a lot of ground. I think maybe a couple of other things. On some of the types of things that we're seeing that are additive are new funds for sure, but also in particularly in the private markets business with private equity and real estate, we've said now for several quarters, if not years, that the larger funds are embracing outsourcing. They just happen to be doing it at their own pace. And as Bill just pointed out, as we get bigger and we make more investments than we get more recognized out in the marketplace, that pace of change for them and the rate at which they're able to embrace our services is just accelerating. So I think we're seeing acceptance, greater acceptance in the larger players. We continue to be very, very strong in the start-ups. And then we have a large and prestigious client base that continues to raise assets and add new funds and all of those things work together.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up. Has there been much change in pricing on a net basis? And you would think as the more illiquid assets and the more complex assets might help raise the overall, but can you comment on how pricing has trended in the last couple of years?\nRahul Kanwar: Pricing has been pretty stable with the thing that changes the baseline is we have more products and services to sell into any individual manager that we're speaking with. So overall deal size is larger, but the prices for kind of the same kinds of services is pretty comparable to what it was.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mayank Tandon of Needham & Company.\nMayank Tandon: Bill, just given your comments around demand, and it sounds like decision-making also is improving. I was just curious, as you look out into '22 and beyond, and maybe you'll talk about this at the Analyst Day, but just wondering, is the trend line growth for SS&C potentially better? What I mean by that is, I think in the past, you've talked about say, mid-single-digit organic growth and then supplement that with M&A. But obviously, you're growing a little bit faster right now. Is that sustainable? Or do you think growth reverts that to trend as you look out a little bit longer term?\nBill Stone: Well, Mayank, we like the current trend. Going back to previous seasons doesn't enthrall us. But as I've said before, when we deployed $8.4 billion in capital in 2018, we got something like $2.9 million in -- $2.9 billion in revenue and probably close to $1 billion in EBITDA. If you try to do that in 2021, who knows how much you would have to pay. And so we feel pretty good about when we gathered assets and the discipline that we have shown. And again, trying to -- we still like to make money, and we want everybody to also understand that we're good citizens in all of our communities, and we pay well and all those things. But our earnings are $1.33, $1.64, $1.94 to something like $2.92, $3.83, and last year, we did $4.30 and now we're saying we're going to do somewhere around very close to $5. And so I think that focus is going to stay the same. I think our opportunity to grow faster is because of the breadth and depth of what we're offering. And then the size of our current client base, in particular, it's the largest hedge funds, the biggest banks, the biggest mutual fund companies, the most complex issuers. As I say, if you want to double your capacity in a server, you pull out 1 wire and stick in another wire. You want to do derivative mortgage-backed securities on a retrospective or prospective basis, you better get deep into an accounting book, right? And so I think the complexity of the world, the complexity investing world to drive for increasing information across a number of different analytics isn't going to change. All of you are insatiable. So all we have to do is make sure that what we deliver to you is stuff that you want. And I think as long as we do that and keep our size and our strength and our expertise, I think the future does look bright for us.\nMayank Tandon: Right. There seems to be plenty of runway, no question. Bill, as a quick follow-up on the health. I don't think I caught anything in terms of an update on the health business. Any updates on that in terms of positioning? Competition, how that's faring in maybe your longer-term thoughts on how core that is to your business? Versus maybe -- I know you've talked about in the past potentially looking at it as part of the core, but just curious on what the latest is on the health side.\nBill Stone: Well, I mean, we announced DomaniRx, I think, in the last quarter, and that's capitalized with $1 billion. And PBM is a pretty hot area, pharmacy benefit management. And in particular, the capabilities of your technology, and we have a really bright team that are building out our new platform on for Domani. And we have obviously some pretty sophisticated partners with us with Anthem and Humana, and we expect others to convene with us, large-scale, sophisticated health care providers and health care commands. And we believe that it is a very big opportunity for us. And how you ultimately monetize that, Mayank, I think it's still in the formative stages. We're now our nose to the grindstone and getting the product done and getting excitement adding new customers. And I think the health care business will perform well over the next several years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jackson Ader of JPMorgan.\nJackson Ader: The first one, so State Street bought Brown Brothers or the accounting and fund administration piece. And I was just curious whether you had any comments on that? That seems like it would be right up your alley, SS&C's alley, I should say. And $3.5 billion wouldn't have topped your former largest deals. I'm just curious your thoughts on the deal and whether you guys were also interested?\nBill Stone: We would have been. I think that, that was maybe baked already. And so both of them are good clients, and we wish them well. And hopefully, there's not a large financial institution that wants to get out of the fund administration business, they hopefully create a little bit more of an option.\nJackson Ader: Yes. Okay. Understood. And then Bill, you mentioned one of the things that helps -- I think you mentioned that one thing that helps margins is big go-lives that happened to fall into a particular quarter. Was there anything in this third quarter that may be pulled forward from the fourth quarter that would explain the organic revenue growth decel as we look out to 4Q?\nBill Stone: Well, I think, again, we want to make sure we don't get ahead of ourselves. We don't get over our skis. And if there's going to be a surprise, we prefer it to be positive. So we have been circumspect on how aggressive to be on guidance. And I think it has, at least over the last few quarters, has served us well. And I think as our sales and marketing organizations get increasingly sophisticated, our ability to really have a higher growth rate and feel very comfortable by hitting those. I think we will be emerging for you. And I think that right now, we have a pipeline that's bigger than we've ever had. Pipeline is nice, but that didn't account for revenue. You've got to close that pipeline. And again, we have a really strong sales force and we're pretty excited about what we can do. All right.\nOperator: Okay. Your next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.\nJonathan Lee: This is Jonathan on for James. And there's been a flurry of capital markets activity around the higher growth assets in the investment management solutions space. And with that in mind, I think you touched on this earlier, how are you thinking about your acquisition strategy around growth-oriented assets? What are you seeing in the market? What types of assets are you looking for?\nBill Stone: Less expensive ones than there are in the market right now. So when you start looking at 10x and 12x revenue, it becomes for -- the math, it becomes pretty tough. And so particularly when you have as talented development teams as we have. So the trade-off is we don't really want to have the elapsed time and risk of developing software if we could buy some of that functionality at only a moderately ridiculous price. But when it's a completely ridiculous price, then we get a little more circumspect. So I think we like the wealth management sector. We like regtech. We think insurtech looks pretty good. We will almost always be in the bidding for front administration businesses. So those things. And we also think that we have a growing and strong presence in Asia that we would like to buttress as well.\nJonathan Lee: And you mentioned development teams and the skill sets that you have there. So on the topic of hiring, are you seeing any headwinds as it relates to finding and hiring that talent for those development teams given the constrained talent environment?\nBill Stone: Yes. So what we have figured out is to pay people more.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Donat of Piper Sandler.\nChristopher Donat: Wanted to just ask another one on the category of fourth quarter guidance and revenue. Just because the revenue guidance is down 3% or up -- a range of down 3% to up 1% from the third quarter. And just can you remind us what the swing factors can be in your revenue besides the timing of onboarding? How much like services work you can have or other factors that can affect the revenue recognition quarter-to-quarter, especially with your 96.5% revenue retention level, you're in a pretty predictable world?\nBill Stone: Well, I think that's a good question, too. I would say that the 2 things that come to my mind is the fourth quarter is usually our biggest license revenue quarter. And in general, licenses are a little more difficult to predict than recurring revenue increases. And the second thing is that the fourth quarter is not a particularly long and not a particularly strong quarter for adjacent services in our fund administration businesses like tax work and other things like financial statements, almost all of that work comes in the first quarter and second quarter. So those are a couple of things, and Rahul probably has some other comments.\nRahul Kanwar: I think those are -- you hit the big ones. It's the seasonality of the special services that we do in fund administration. It's -- it tends to be a bigger license quarter. And I think, sequentially, the difference between the midpoint of our guidance for Q4 and our actual for Q3 is something like $15 million, right? So we're not really that far off and I think well ahead of anything we've said for Q4 during the course of the year.\nChristopher Donat: Okay. Got it. And then, Rahul, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. I thought you said you had a $30 billion hedge fund client that was running Axys for 20 years, is that right? And how many other clients are out there running Advent legacy Axys software, or did I hear it wrong?\nRahul Kanwar: No, you heard it right. And that's a great question, right? So there exists, within that client base, opportunities like that. And I think that opportunity resulted in a sort of a 10x revenue pickup, right, and lots of value to that particular customer. But we have others where these -- some of these products that have been around for a while are very functional and people really like them. But invariably, they start investing in things or have new requirements and they need to upgrade, and we've got a natural upgrade path. And when that happens, it can be pretty positive for them and for us from a revenue standpoint.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: So as tableaus kind of touched on earlier, but there's been a couple of recent IPOs of firms that compete against SS&C in certain areas, and those competitors are pitched as cloud native or they're SaaS-based. Curious about how comfortable you are with your competitive positioning, particularly on the software side of the business?\nBill Stone: Yes, that's a great question, Patrick. I think that we are very competitive on the software side, in particular, to just name a few products would be our Singularity platform, our Geneva platform or Eze Eclipse platform or our Intralinks platforms, Precision LM, those are all best-in-class. And I think relative to, say,  or , I think, this quarter, we added $110 million in revenue, which is about half of Clearwater's annual revenue. And I think it's more than maybe double what  does. So competitively, I think they have some good technologies at both of those companies. But when they get into bigger and bigger companies, they're going to find that being able to do syndicated bank loans, interest rate derivatives, compliance and risk and other functional requirements, I think is going to really start to tip the scale towards us. Plus we have a new product called Aloha that has IBOR and all kinds of other unique features in it. So we're pretty proud of our development teams, and we're looking to step on the gas on the sales and marketing.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: And then -- so you guys have obviously been pretty aggressive on the share repurchase front over the last several quarters. But like on a year basis, your fully diluted share count is essentially flat. As the impact of the repurchases has been offset by a lot of dilution, stock-based compensation-related dilution. So obviously, there's variables at play in terms of your capital allocation opportunities and the stock share price. But at a high level, would you expect to start making a bigger dent in your diluted share count going forward?\nBill Stone: Well, again, I think the answer to that is yes, although I think that our -- one of the stated goals of our Board and our comp committee is to make sure we have adequate equity awards for our staff, and so that's a balancing act. And I think that it's -- we go from a few years back, having $250 million in authorization, then a $750 million in authorization, now we have $1 billion. And I think that, yes, we would like to make a bigger dent in that. And I think we will continue to be quite aggressive when it comes to buying back stock. We're just waiting, Patrick. We're $5 billion in revenue now. I mean, 3 years ago, we were $3 billion in revenue -- so $3.5 million, so things take time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jackson Ader of JPMorgan.\nJackson Ader: Patrick, do we have -- could we get the organic revenue growth by segment fund administration, as Intralinks, et cetera?\nPatrick Pedonti: Yes, sure. In Q3, so the fund administration business was up, I think, 14.8% organically in the quarter. Intralinks was up 23.5% in the quarter. Our DST Financial Services segment was up 3.7%. And then our core software business plus some other of the smaller products, but mostly Advent in our institutional businesses in this segment, it was up 6.9% in the quarter.\nJackson Ader: Okay. Awesome. Just a quick follow-up on that Intralinks number. How much of that was driven by M&A activity in the market that might be outside of your control like more market factors versus like SS&C's own execution?\nBill Stone: We're really proud of our team's execution. They're gaining market share. And I believe they're innovating, and we're very pleased with all the aspects of that team.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the floor back over to Bill Stone for any additional or closing remarks.\nBill Stone: Again, thanks, everybody, for being on this call, and we look forward to talking to you after the fourth quarter. And please stay safe, and we'll see you next quarter. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Bill Stone",
            "content": "Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone, for joining. Our results for the third quarter are $1.266 billion in adjusted revenue, up 9.5%; and $1.32 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 20%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $530 million, and we are on track to end the year with over $2 billion in EBITDA. Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin grew to 42.6% in the quarter, up 230 basis points from Q3 2020. Our third quarter adjusted organic revenue was 8.2% as we continue to gain momentum and beat Q2's 7.2% organic revenue. All of our businesses outperformed our expectations and our alternatives, Intralinks and software businesses drove the top line growth. We have accelerated our new business wins and competitive takeaways, while capitalizing on strong markets. The past few quarters highlights SS&C's financial power. Without digesting large acquisitions, we were able to drive strong top line growth organically while improving margins over 200 basis points and growing earnings at 20%. We have maintained our lower cost structure through the pandemic and continue to drive efficiencies through automation. Machine learning, robotics process automation and artificial intelligence capabilities are being implemented across our businesses and products. We are currently rolling out our strategic development enhancement within the hedge fund services portal, whereby we are leveraging various AI principles and concepts to enhance controls, provide greater transparency around NAV anomalies, exceptions and key operational processes. This new product is called . These types of development efforts not only generate revenue, but are margin enhancing. SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $944.8 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2021, up 25% from the same period last year. We repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock in Q3 2021 at an average price of $75.97 per share for $152.9 -- or $162.9 million. At our current valuation, we will continue to aggressively buy back stock. We paid down $317.8 million in debt for the first 9 months of 2021, and our leverage ratio stands at 1.7x secured and 2.96x total leverage. We remain committed to a shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. And now that we are under 3.0x levered, we have increased flexibility to allocate more cash towards buybacks. Our business is running on all cylinders. Our pipelines are strong with increasingly complex global large deals as organizations review their complete operating model and technology stack. Several of our products have met milestones, the most recent being Precision LM exceeding 100 clients. The growth comes as banks and nonbank lenders have increased their investment portfolio's private credit lending activities and exposure to commercial and residential loans. Precision LM added 20 new clients in the last 12 months. We are capitalizing on market trends and recently launched our ESG reporting solutions platform for asset managers to better monitor and report on ESG exposure. Our solution provides accurate and detailed ESG ratings data, which a game changer to help investors understand sustainable investing and ESG exposures. I'll now turn the call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Patrick. We're proud of the progress we've made this year. All of our businesses are gaining momentum, capitalizing on opportunities and continuously improving. Organic growth was up 8.2%, and we expect around 5.5% for the full year. Hopefully, we can surprise you positively. Alternative assets under administration increased another 80 billion in Q3 for a total increase of 480 billion since the first quarter of 2020. We now have 2.2 trillion in assets under administration, and we're hundreds of billions ahead of our next competitor.  Our EBITDA margins were up 230 basis points. And we're operating at our highest margins since the large acquisitions we made in 2018. We have a number of strong leaders and an abundance of opportunity, which we will showcase on November 10 Virtual Analyst Day. Please see our events on our Investor Relations webpage to register and reach out to Justine for additional information.  I'll now open it for questions. Well, I'll give a little crack and then Rahul and Patrick, you guys can chime in. But since the pandemic, we're not leasing near as much space as we did in the end of 2020, and I believe that will continue into 2022. And we also have had less aggressive hiring than we have had in the past, not that we aren't hiring, we are, but we have probably had some pickup because of the number of people we had versus what we had expected. So I think those are 2 big things. And I think that our pricing discipline has helped us, and I believe it will continue. Rahul? I think that's right. I mean, again, right, it's -- we've always been around 40, and I think the latest 42.6, and so I would say it's going to be somewhere between 40 and 44. And it will fluctuate based on investments we make. And we tend not to be particularly aggressive about capitalizing software and stuff like that, so I think we will continue to not be particularly aggressive on that. And so I would think that our margins will depend on some of the ability to -- which we have proven that we can close big deals, but -- and we have proven that we can get them live, but the difference between getting them live in, say, the third quarter and getting them live in the fourth quarter can often impact margin in the 10 basis point to 20 basis point range. Yes. Surinder, if you look at the -- if you look at our -- what we expect in cash flow, which is around $1.350 billion, I think and I think that share counts Patrick quoted were 266 million, 267 million, you're talking about $5 a share in cash. And so obviously, on a finance basis, buying back shares is a lot better than paying off 2% debt. Now at the same time, we would like to deploy that $4 billion we have in 2% debt to faster-growing assets and obviously, with better margins. And so we're constantly on the lookout to try to do that. And I would tell you that primarily our lookout right now is that we have a lot of faith in our development teams, but we have a lot of excitement around DomaniRx. We think that things like  and other things that we are bringing out are indicative of our development capability. And I would say that we will continue to drive cash towards those things. But I think, on the surface, we would probably be a little more aggressive in stock buybacks than we would be in debt repayment. I think that's a great question. I think that, obviously, inflationary times and all of your organizations are similar issues with the increasing wages, which I'm not -- I hope to pay our people more, so -- and I know that our clients like to have continuity with the talented people that we have on their accounts. So I think they also understand that there will have to be some revenue adjustments to them, some price increases. So net-net, I think you're right, we might be able to get 50 basis points, maybe 100 basis points more on the revenue side than on the expense side. But I wouldn't say it's going to be -- I mean, if inflation goes wild, and that's a lot different. But if inflation stays 2%, 3%, 4%, then I think it will be -- could be a little bit of a tailwind, but it's not going to be massive. Yes. I believe we are. We're also engaging at higher and higher levels in organizations. And we have a number of very successful lift-outs that we have done that we are going to turn it into a pitch book on how we could maybe take some of your people as well as these accounting processes and reporting processes, risk processes, compliance processes and other things that we do exceptionally well and try to be able to really streamline these large financial institutions, middle and back offices. And also, obviously, we have front to back, so we can do trading and compliance and risk and ESG and other things. And so we're pretty optimistic about our opportunity to continue to go upscale. Well, again, we do believe we have some momentum. And again, as we said in our remarks as well as in our press release, our software businesses, Advent, in particular, and our fund administration businesses as well as our Intralinks businesses have been particularly strong, and we would expect all 3 of those to continue that strong pattern. And I think that again, as we add the tens of billions of dollars to our or AUA, those revenues start to flow into our financial statements, and obviously, that's some tailwind as well. Rahul, could you add to that? Yes. I believe that we're constantly studying how we deliver information to all of you. And I think over the next quarter or 2, we will start being a little more granular and try to give you a little bit longer viewpoint of where we think things are going to be, and I think that might be well received by the analyst and investing community. Well, I believe we're somewhat, by far, the most innovative fund administrator in the world. And we use our own software in our fund administration business as do 40 other fund administrators. But we're always on the current release, and we're always pushing the envelope. So the kinds of products like , we will be the first to adopt and the first to demonstrate and it will create excitement. And then often, larger financial institutions have more difficulty installing releases in large-scale systems. And so sometimes they get behind on a few releases, and they don't do the training like we do the training, and there's a whole series of things that we do. And we have a very strong sales force, very capable. And increasingly, our marketing is more targeted, and our audience is more interested because of the breadth and depth of what we deliver. Can you add to that, Rahul? Well, Mayank, we like the current trend. Going back to previous seasons doesn't enthrall us. But as I've said before, when we deployed $8.4 billion in capital in 2018, we got something like $2.9 million in -- $2.9 billion in revenue and probably close to $1 billion in EBITDA. If you try to do that in 2021, who knows how much you would have to pay. And so we feel pretty good about when we gathered assets and the discipline that we have shown. And again, trying to -- we still like to make money, and we want everybody to also understand that we're good citizens in all of our communities, and we pay well and all those things. But our earnings are $1.33, $1.64, $1.94 to something like $2.92, $3.83, and last year, we did $4.30 and now we're saying we're going to do somewhere around very close to $5. And so I think that focus is going to stay the same. I think our opportunity to grow faster is because of the breadth and depth of what we're offering. And then the size of our current client base, in particular, it's the largest hedge funds, the biggest banks, the biggest mutual fund companies, the most complex issuers. As I say, if you want to double your capacity in a server, you pull out 1 wire and stick in another wire. You want to do derivative mortgage-backed securities on a retrospective or prospective basis, you better get deep into an accounting book, right? And so I think the complexity of the world, the complexity investing world to drive for increasing information across a number of different analytics isn't going to change. All of you are insatiable. So all we have to do is make sure that what we deliver to you is stuff that you want. And I think as long as we do that and keep our size and our strength and our expertise, I think the future does look bright for us. Well, I mean, we announced DomaniRx, I think, in the last quarter, and that's capitalized with $1 billion. And PBM is a pretty hot area, pharmacy benefit management. And in particular, the capabilities of your technology, and we have a really bright team that are building out our new platform on for Domani. And we have obviously some pretty sophisticated partners with us with Anthem and Humana, and we expect others to convene with us, large-scale, sophisticated health care providers and health care commands. And we believe that it is a very big opportunity for us. And how you ultimately monetize that, Mayank, I think it's still in the formative stages. We're now our nose to the grindstone and getting the product done and getting excitement adding new customers. And I think the health care business will perform well over the next several years. We would have been. I think that, that was maybe baked already. And so both of them are good clients, and we wish them well. And hopefully, there's not a large financial institution that wants to get out of the fund administration business, they hopefully create a little bit more of an option. Well, I think, again, we want to make sure we don't get ahead of ourselves. We don't get over our skis. And if there's going to be a surprise, we prefer it to be positive. So we have been circumspect on how aggressive to be on guidance. And I think it has, at least over the last few quarters, has served us well. And I think as our sales and marketing organizations get increasingly sophisticated, our ability to really have a higher growth rate and feel very comfortable by hitting those. I think we will be emerging for you. And I think that right now, we have a pipeline that's bigger than we've ever had. Pipeline is nice, but that didn't account for revenue. You've got to close that pipeline. And again, we have a really strong sales force and we're pretty excited about what we can do. All right. Less expensive ones than there are in the market right now. So when you start looking at 10x and 12x revenue, it becomes for -- the math, it becomes pretty tough. And so particularly when you have as talented development teams as we have. So the trade-off is we don't really want to have the elapsed time and risk of developing software if we could buy some of that functionality at only a moderately ridiculous price. But when it's a completely ridiculous price, then we get a little more circumspect. So I think we like the wealth management sector. We like regtech. We think insurtech looks pretty good. We will almost always be in the bidding for front administration businesses. So those things. And we also think that we have a growing and strong presence in Asia that we would like to buttress as well. Yes. So what we have figured out is to pay people more. Well, I think that's a good question, too. I would say that the 2 things that come to my mind is the fourth quarter is usually our biggest license revenue quarter. And in general, licenses are a little more difficult to predict than recurring revenue increases. And the second thing is that the fourth quarter is not a particularly long and not a particularly strong quarter for adjacent services in our fund administration businesses like tax work and other things like financial statements, almost all of that work comes in the first quarter and second quarter. So those are a couple of things, and Rahul probably has some other comments. Yes, that's a great question, Patrick. I think that we are very competitive on the software side, in particular, to just name a few products would be our Singularity platform, our Geneva platform or Eze Eclipse platform or our Intralinks platforms, Precision LM, those are all best-in-class. And I think relative to, say,  or , I think, this quarter, we added $110 million in revenue, which is about half of Clearwater's annual revenue. And I think it's more than maybe double what  does. So competitively, I think they have some good technologies at both of those companies. But when they get into bigger and bigger companies, they're going to find that being able to do syndicated bank loans, interest rate derivatives, compliance and risk and other functional requirements, I think is going to really start to tip the scale towards us. Plus we have a new product called Aloha that has IBOR and all kinds of other unique features in it. So we're pretty proud of our development teams, and we're looking to step on the gas on the sales and marketing. Well, again, I think the answer to that is yes, although I think that our -- one of the stated goals of our Board and our comp committee is to make sure we have adequate equity awards for our staff, and so that's a balancing act. And I think that it's -- we go from a few years back, having $250 million in authorization, then a $750 million in authorization, now we have $1 billion. And I think that, yes, we would like to make a bigger dent in that. And I think we will continue to be quite aggressive when it comes to buying back stock. We're just waiting, Patrick. We're $5 billion in revenue now. I mean, 3 years ago, we were $3 billion in revenue -- so $3.5 million, so things take time. We're really proud of our team's execution. They're gaining market share. And I believe they're innovating, and we're very pleased with all the aspects of that team. Again, thanks, everybody, for being on this call, and we look forward to talking to you after the fourth quarter. And please stay safe, and we'll see you next quarter. Thanks a lot."

            "content": "Thanks, Rahul. Results for the third quarter 2021 were GAAP revenues of $1,264.4 million, GAAP net income of $184.4 million and diluted EPS of $0.69. Adjusted revenues were $1,266.3 million, including the impact with the adoption of the revenue standard 606 and for acquired deferred revenue adjustments for acquisitions. Adjusted revenue was up 9.5%, adjusted operating income increased 16.8% and adjusted EPS was $1.32, a 20% increase over Q3 2020. Overall, adjusted revenue increased $110.1 million or 9.5% over Q3 2020. Our acquisitions contributed $10 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $10.4 million or 0.9% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue increase on a constant currency basis was 8.2%. We had strength across several product lines, including alternative assets, Advent software, retirement business, ALPS, our brokerage business and the Intralinks business. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $524.1 million, an increase of $75.3 million or 16.8% over the third quarter of 2020. Adjusted operating margins increased 38.8% -- adjusted operating margins increased from 38.8% in Q3 2020 to 41.4% in the third quarter of 2021 or 260 basis points improvement, driven by strong revenue increase and cost controls. Expenses increased 2.2% on a constant currency basis. In addition, acquisitions added $9.6 million of expenses and foreign currency increased costs by $8.4 million. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA, which is defined in Note 3 of our earnings release, was $538.9 million or 42.6% of adjusted revenue and increased $72.6 million or 15.6% from Q3 2020. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA margins increased 230 basis points from the third quarter of 2020. Net interest expense for the third quarter was $50.2 million and includes $3.3 million of noncash amortized financing costs and OID. The average rate in the quarter for our credit facility and our senior notes was 3.1% compared to 3% in the third quarter of 2020. A reduction in our debt balance resulted in interest expense decreasing $4.5 million or 8.2%. During the third quarter, in connection with the legacy DST ERISA matters and associated legal proceedings, we recorded an expense of $43.4 million to other income and expense. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with the resolution of this litigation, the ultimate resolution and any potential exposure related to this matter is somewhat uncertain at this time. We recorded a GAAP tax provision in the quarter of $60.6 million or 24.7% of pretax income, and expect the GAAP tax provision to be approximately 26% for the full year. Adjusted net income was $352.9 million and adjusted EPS was $1.32, and the effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was also 26%. Diluted shares increased to -- decreased from 266.5 million from 267.6 million in the second quarter. The impact of share repurchases was partially offset by an increase in the average share price and option exercises. On the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $351.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.2 billion of gross debt. SS&C's net debt, as defined by our credit agreement, which includes -- excludes any cash and cash equivalents of $138 million held at the DomaniRx JV was $6 billion as of September 30. Cash flow for the 9 months ended September 30 was $944.9 million, $189.8 million or 25% increase compared to the same period in 2020. A couple of highlights for the 9 months. We've purchased treasury stock buybacks of $487.9 million or purchases of 6.8 million shares at an average price of $71.74 per share. In July 2021, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to $1 billion of stock buybacks. The program to date, treasury stock buybacks of $162 million for purchase of 2.1 million shares at an average price of $75.97. Net debt payments were $317.8 million compared to $330 million in the same period of 2020. We declared and paid $122.8 million of common stock dividends, an increase of 22.9% the prior year. In the 9 months, we paid $173.2 million of interest expense compared to $212.7 million in 2020. In income taxes, we've paid $230.8 million compared to $182.5 million in the same period in 2020. Capital expenditures and capitalized software were $96.2 million or 2.6% of year-to-date adjusted revenue compared to $80 million or 2.3% year-to-date in Q3 of 2020. Our LTM EBITDA, which is used for covenant compliance, was $2,019.5 million as of September 2021 and includes $1.8 million of acquired EBITDA and cost savings related to acquisition. And based on a net debt of $6 billion, our total leverage was 2.96x and our secured leverage ratio was 1.97x. On outlook for the fourth quarter, I'll cover a couple of assumptions first. So we'll continue to focus on delivering quality client service, and we expect our retention rates will continue in the range of our most recent results. We'll expect foreign currency exchange to be at approximately current levels. And adjusted organic growth for the year will be in the range of 4.8% to 5.9%. Adjusted organic growth for the fourth quarter will be in the range of 1.1% to 5.3%. Interest rates on our term loan will be approximately the 1-month LIBOR plus the spread, which is currently 175 bps. We expect expenses to increase sequentially due in part to the impact of higher personnel costs as a result of our annual merit increases, which took effect October 1, and we're seeing increased employee benefit costs.  We'll continue to invest in our business long term and capital expenditures will be approximately 2.8%. And we'll continue to allocate free cash flow to both stock buybacks and some debt paydown. But for the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.275 billion. Adjusted net income in the range of $311 million to $334 million. Diluted shares in the range of 266.2 million to 266.7 million. And for the full year, the range for revenue will be $4.988 billion to $5.038 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $1.312 billion to $1.335 billion and diluted shares in the range of 266.9 million to 267.4 million. And for the full year, we expect cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.365 billion to $1.385 billion. And now I'll turn it over back to Bill for final comments. Yes, sure. In Q3, so the fund administration business was up, I think, 14.8% organically in the quarter. Intralinks was up 23.5% in the quarter. Our DST Financial Services segment was up 3.7%. And then our core software business plus some other of the smaller products, but mostly Advent in our institutional businesses in this segment, it was up 6.9% in the quarter."

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Most of our global offices have reopened, and we're seeing employees attending in increasing numbers on a voluntary basis. We're optimistic that the added opportunities for in-person collaboration, combined with the work anywhere flexibility we're providing to our staff will enhance innovation and execution. Our businesses are benefiting from the global trend towards outsourced technology and services. As firms evaluate their desired post-pandemic operational state, our fund administration, middle office and advent businesses are seeing greater demand. This trend also impacts private market alternatives with firms looking at their operational capability and limited partners assessing the resilience and scalability of the managers they invest with.  Our functional depth continues to grow in lockstep with the steady addition of signed and live clients. Collaboration across SS&C teams, combined with R&D investments have resulted in a new generation of enterprise solutions. These allow asset managers, banks, insurance companies, alternative managers, retirement and wealth management firms and others to look to SS&C as a strategic partner that offers a comprehensive solution set to address several of their requirements. As a result, we're seeing larger deal sizes and greater appreciation for the ways in which we can deliver value to our customers. Now, I will mention some key deals. One of the largest -- world's largest hedge funds and existing middle-office client chose SS&C to run shadow accounting. A managed account platform chose SS&C GlobeOp for fund services, financial statements, bank loan servicing and reconciliation. A $30 billion-plus hedge fund who had been running Axys for over 20 years upgraded to Geneva and Geneva cloud delivery after 3-year valuation. A $10 billion-plus Canadian prime broker added Advent Syncova to their technology stack, citing its scalability. A $50 billion AUA asset manager chose Black Diamond because of our partnership focus. A U.S.-based wealth manager saw the higher level of support and stability and chose a combination of Eze EMS and market trader to replace their current solution. A top U.S. insurance company chose Chorus our latest automated workflow solution. An existing fund administration client expanded their relationship to include retail alternatives, transfer agency, digital investor and Chorus. I'll now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials. Bill, I agree with all of that. And I think the things that I would add are: we've also had an opportunity to spend a fair amount of energy on R&D. So Bill talked about machine learning and some of the other things we're doing, and that has resulted in productivity, right? And we expect those productivity gains to continue. No, I think I'd echo all of that. I'd also say that some of what we've done in the last 18 months-or-so is really fostered this collaboration within SS&C, where our products and services are much more integrated and our teams are much more integrated when they go talk to large asset managers or large banks or whatever prospects they might have. And that's resulted in the opportunities that we have in front of us, have larger ticket sizes. And sometimes they take a little longer to sell, but if you have enough of them, that's pretty additive to the revenue process. And we think that, that helps us drive sustainable growth. So that covers a lot of ground. I think maybe a couple of other things. On some of the types of things that we're seeing that are additive are new funds for sure, but also in particularly in the private markets business with private equity and real estate, we've said now for several quarters, if not years, that the larger funds are embracing outsourcing. They just happen to be doing it at their own pace. And as Bill just pointed out, as we get bigger and we make more investments than we get more recognized out in the marketplace, that pace of change for them and the rate at which they're able to embrace our services is just accelerating. So I think we're seeing acceptance, greater acceptance in the larger players. We continue to be very, very strong in the start-ups. And then we have a large and prestigious client base that continues to raise assets and add new funds and all of those things work together. Pricing has been pretty stable with the thing that changes the baseline is we have more products and services to sell into any individual manager that we're speaking with. So overall deal size is larger, but the prices for kind of the same kinds of services is pretty comparable to what it was. I think those are -- you hit the big ones. It's the seasonality of the special services that we do in fund administration. It's -- it tends to be a bigger license quarter. And I think, sequentially, the difference between the midpoint of our guidance for Q4 and our actual for Q3 is something like $15 million, right? So we're not really that far off and I think well ahead of anything we've said for Q4 during the course of the year. No, you heard it right. And that's a great question, right? So there exists, within that client base, opportunities like that. And I think that opportunity resulted in a sort of a 10x revenue pickup, right, and lots of value to that particular customer. But we have others where these -- some of these products that have been around for a while are very functional and people really like them. But invariably, they start investing in things or have new requirements and they need to upgrade, and we've got a natural upgrade path. And when that happens, it can be pretty positive for them and for us from a revenue standpoint."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. . Please be advised that today's conference will be recorded. . Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Justine Stone, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nJustine Stone: Hi everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I am Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C Technologies. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer and Patrick Pedonti, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, we need to review the Safe Harbor statement.\nBill Stone: Thanks Justine and thanks everyone for joining. Our results for the first  quarter are $1.261 billion in adjusted revenue, up 10.5% and $1.24 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 19.2%. We surpassed $500 million in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter for the first time coming in at $511 million. For the six months, our adjusted consolidated EBITDA was over $1 billion. Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin grew to 40.5% for the quarter. Our second quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 7.2%. This is the highest organic revenue growth quarter in several years. All of our businesses outperformed their expectations. In our alternatives, Intralinks SS&C health and DST Financial businesses drove strong topline growth. SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $562 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 even though we paid $144 million in cash taxes versus $35 million in 2020. We repurchased two million shares of common stock in Q2 2021 at an average price of $73.44 per share for $143.6 million. We paid down $183.1 million in debt for the first six months in 2021 and our leverage ratio continues to come down. At the end of Q2, our secured net leverage ratio was 2.09 times and our total net leverage ratio was at 3.1 times consolidated EBTIDA. We remain fully committed to a shareholder friendly capital allocation strategy.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks Bill. We had a strong quarter, driven by broad based performance across our business. We continue to benefit from an increasing recognition by customers and prospects of the breadth and depth of our solutions and expertise. The changes we have made to our organization structure, business leadership and sales management and our continued focus on innovation and delivery are having a positive impact. Our fund administration business is seeing increased fundraising momentum across strategies and a robust pipeline of existing and new clients. The expertise, customer focus and dedication of our professional teams combined with market-leading technology and solutions are unique assets that help us outperform in the context of a healthy fundraising and new launch environment. During the quarter, we combined our real assets and private equity groups to the newly launched SS&C GlobeOp Private Markets Group under the leadership of the Bhagesh Malde. He is well-positioned to help our fast growing private equity and real assets customers with their operational accounting and technology needs.\nPatrick Pedonti: Thank you. Results for the second quarter of 2021 were GAAP revenues of $1.259 billon, GAAP net income of $189.8 million and diluted EPS of $0.71. Adjusted revenues were $1.261 billion. Adjusted revenue was up 10.5%, adjusted operating income increased 15.3% and adjusted diluted EPS were $1.24, a 19.2% increase over Q2 2020. Overall, adjusted revenue increased $120.2 million. Our acquisitions contributed $17.8 million. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $26.4 million or 2.3% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue increased on a constant currency basis was 7.2%. We had strength across several product lines including alternative assets, Advent, our retirement services, global investor distribution, our ALPS asset management business, healthcare and insurance business. This was offset by weakness in the ALS business due to lower trading volumes. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $495.8 million, an increase of $65.7 million or 15.3% from the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted operating margins increased from 37.7% in the second quarter of 2020 to 39.3% in the second quarter of 2021. This was driven by cost controls and expense controls. Expenses increased 2.5% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $14.9 million in expenses and foreign currency increased costs by $21.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $511.1 million or 40.5% of adjusted revenue and increased $62.7 million or 14% from Q2 to 2020. Net interest expense for the quarter was $51 million and includes $3.3 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID. The interest rate in the quarter for our amended credit facility including the senior notes was 3.02% compared to 3.19% in the second quarter of 2020 and resulted in interest expense decrease of $9.5 million.\nBill Stone: Thanks Patrick. And I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication and hard work they put in each and every day. We are working with various parts of our organization to ensure a productive return to the office policy. We expect to begin our transition this fall. We appreciate you, our shareholders and we remain steadfast in our mission to be the finest technology and service provider to the global financial services industry and the United States healthcare industry. We grew organically 7.2%. We have added $400 billion to our alternatives platform in 18 months. We generated over $1 billion in adjusted consolidated EBITDA in six months. And we announced DomaniRx, our new platform joint venture. I will now open it up for questions.\nOperator: . Your first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hi. Good evening everyone. Just maybe on the healthcare side, I guess this maybe a chance to flesh out the new JV in a little bit more detail. So maybe first of all, can you just tell us how the healthcare business did this quarter? And then maybe describe the path of how this JV is going to impact your existing healthcare business in terms of the growth outlook? How it should accelerate over the next few years? So a little bit more color so we can kind of complete the picture a little bit more. Thanks.\nBill Stone: Sure. So our healthcare business grew approximately about 10%, right, Patrick?\nPatrick Pedonti: 12%. And then if you adjust for the pre-acquisition termination, it was 18%.\nBill Stone: So you know, Alex, we think this is a very transaction processing and information delivery business and we think we are past that. So we are excited about the opportunity. We think we have really top flight minority partners with us, joint venture partners. And as we said in our remarks today or in the press release, there is 4.5 billion prescriptions filled in United States annually and we process approximately about 400 million to 500 million ourselves. So we think it's a big opportunity to get a larger and larger market share. We think new technology is going to change the experience for the individual customer and then also for the payer provider and I think getting that information back to those places with some sense of real time processing, I think, will allow them to make better decisions and then create a more enlightened kind of healthcare industry and then also provide us with great growth opportunities. And I think that's what we are looking forward to, is to be able to really go from 400 million to 500 million in the number of claims that we process to well in excess of a billion.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe just secondarily, just any quick comments on M&A? It's been quiet. You have obviously looked at a lot of assets. It sounds like there's something in the capital market space that may be on the block. So I know you always look. But curious about your current appetite and how you think the pricing environment is looking right now.?\nBill Stone: Well, we always look and we bid. And sometimes we get outbid. And when we get outbid, we think people overpay. And so that's kind of our view of it. There's a lot of things for sale right now. Prices are still nose-bleed levels. And when you add $400 billion in assets to our platform in 18 months, that creates a lot of revenue. And it creates a lot of opportunity for additional revenue. And I have said on this call many times that if we do big acquisitions, it's going to take a lot of management time and in our estimation, that management time when it's focused on organic revenue growth, organic revenue growth builds up. And I think Q2 is another example of that.\nAlex Kramm: Fair enough Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Pete Heckmann of Davidson. Your line is open.\nPete Heckmann: Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the fund administration business. Very notable year-over-year growth and as you point out great asset accumulation in the last 18 months. If I am tracking that correctly, AUA was up about 19% year-over-year. What would you estimate would be the growth of the market, the underlying market, in that same time period? I am trying to figure out how much you share and how much is just a higher allocations to alternative assets?\nBill Stone: I think, Rahul, you would be the probably maybe the best taking a shot at that.\nRahul Kanwar: I think what I would say is, we don't really have and there isn't a lot of great data on the underlying market and how fast it's growing. But what is pretty indicative to us is how we are doing in terms of competitive takeaways, right. And if you kind of look at our AUA mix and the $400 billion and kind of where it comes from, et cetera, there's a pretty big portion of it that comes from competitors. I mentioned in my remarks $30 billion fund that were taken from somebody else in the market. So that would suggest that in addition to the lift we are getting just because the market is getting better, people are recognizing our technology investment and our staff and some of the leadership we put in place and some of the changes we made like combining private equity and real assets and things like that and that's having an impact.\nPete Heckmann: Yes. That's great. And then I heard you mention Intralinks as one of the things that contributed organic growth in the quarter. But I guess my suspicion is do good M&A activity and all the stack IPOs out there that that business could put maybe midteens or higher type growth. Is that on the right track?\nBill Stone: Yes. The analytics business grew about 18% in the quarter.\nPete Heckmann: Great.\nBill Stone: And they are at about 14% year-to-date.\nPete Heckmann: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. I will get back with in the queue. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Andrew Schmidt from Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I can see the step-up in growth here. I wanted to ask, I think last couple of questions, it's pretty clear that the volume-based revenues are stepping up pretty significantly. But on the deal closing and sales cycle side, could you talk about your observations in the second quarter? It seems like things are improving. But would love to hear your thoughts on sales cycle in terms of just appetite for closing deals versus maybe the prior quarter?\nBill Stone: Well, I think that we have a pretty full pipelines and we are getting an awful lot of enquiries into us from all over the world. Particularly, the Far East has been quite active. And then again, right, all the central bank are flooding the world with money. And so now it's time to make hay. and I think we have increasingly strong sales force and increasingly strong management of that sales force. And so I think we are reaping the benefits of the investments that we have made in order to increase our revenue growth.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. And then, this quarter we have seen a number of product launches and sort of technology revamps, some of it on the legacy DST side. Has anything changed about the approach to product development, technology development, things like that? I would imagine part of it is sort of the management restructure on the DST side. But just curious if anything has changed in terms of your approach to organic technology development, things of that nature?\nBill Stone: Well, again, we have hired a number of people and obviously technology in 2021 is a lot different than technology was even when we bought DST which would closed in April 2018. So we are adding like microservices and artificial intelligence and robotic process automation and machine learning. And we are also, we are in a hurry. SS&C is in a hurry. In a hurry, it doesn't mean you can snap your fingers and in one day or even one quarter and sometimes even in one year that you can change everything without taking so much risk that you are going to break the egg. So you have got to be a little bit wise. And as I said, right, we just passed $500 million in EBITDA in a quarter first time ever and $1 billion in the first six months, first time ever. So I think we are increasing the cadence in our software development capabilities and I think that's why you are seeing a number of new products come out with a lot of requested features and functions that our clients and prospects have been asking for. Rahul, do you have anything to add to that?\nRahul Kanwar: So I think the only other thing I would add is, just coming back to that restructure point, I think focusing our business in a very methodical way on kind of the end-markets that they serve and making sure our technology teams are lined up against those end-markets and are really paying attention to what those customers want means that the pace of development is faster, right. So it's things we have always done. We would like to think we are doing it with a little more focus and intensity.\nAndrew Schmidt: Perfect. Exactly what I was getting at. Thanks Rahul, Bill. I appreciate the comments.\nOperator: . Your next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJackson Ader: Great. Thank you. My first question is actually back on the joint venture, the healthcare joint venture. I am curious about the new platform and maybe with existing customers. Will this be additive to the business that you have with existing customers? Or will it basically be more of a replacement from existing solutions to a newer platform over the next four or five years as this thing gets ramped up?\nBill Stone: I think that our business philosophy forever has been to have a flexible delivery model. So there's going to be different customers that want this delivered to them through the JV and there going to be others that are going to want us to deliver this through SS&C Health. We think, in general, this is going to be a pretty nice tailwind to our growth in the healthcare business. And I don't know if current SS&C Health customers will want to going to the JV or want to remain with us. So obviously, we are talking to all of them and trying to give them the option that they want. But it's pretty new and everybody's pretty excited about it and we are optimistic that revenue growth will increase markedly.\nJackson Ader: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then Rahul, you mentioned I think in one of the deals that you ran through that one of the Advent signings happen to be in the cloud. And I was just curious, one, can we get a reset on where your customers and investors' preferences are at the moment in terms of and really I guess this relates to the last question as well on the healthcare joint venture. But where are people's heads in terms of their preference for the cloud versus more on-premise deployment?\nRahul Kanwar: Yes. And I think this is just building on what Bill just said, right. What we are trying to do is, is be flexible on delivery, right and making sure that whether they want to deploy on-premise and on-premise increasingly is on-premise with a cloud provider that they have themselves or a public cloud or whatever the case may be or they want to buy it through us and have us run it on our private cloud which we think is purpose-built for our application. So it has several benefits. But I would say that the majority of new deals, one way or another, are going on some kind of cloud type and that's really what we are doing our development on as well.\nJackson Ader: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Hi Bill. Hi Rahul. A high level question from my perspective in terms of just strategy and where the firm is. When I kind of look back over the past year or year-and-a-half, we think about the management changes that have kind of occurred. We look at the recent reorganization you did around DST in terms of the strategy there. Can you talk about how you feel about positioning right now and could the evolution of how you kind of got into here to decide that this is the right approach at this point? And is it kind of, shall we expect more changes that you guys are thinking about or are you guys pretty comfortable where we are at this point and the ability to kind of hit ultimately those milestones and targets that you guys are reaching for?\nBill Stone: Well, Surinder, that's a great question and that's also pretty much a crystal ball question, right. I think that SS&C is constantly changing and it's constantly changing because our customers are constantly changing it. If you look at what Jefferies did five or 10 years ago compared to what Jefferies does today, it's a way different firm. And a lot of the hedge funds that we deal with now are in all kinds of different strategies and all kinds of different asset classes. Some are looking for permanent capital. Some are having long only strategies. Same thing with our large insurance companies that are now, I am sure you saw that the deal between Blackstone and AIG, $50 billion. It's going to be $100 billion. And so you have to have people that are nimble enough to take advantage of what's in the marketplace and you have to have people that have enough of a risk appetite to take some chances. And when you are going through executive managers, that's what we are looking for. We are looking for people that have deep subject matter expertise and personality that is inclusive and is open and then also that we take prudent risks. And if you don't take any risks, it's very difficult to grow. So I think we are very comfortable with where we are today. But I don't know where the world's going to be in three months or six months or nine months. I read things that other people apparently really know. I just don't think those people are the brightest people on earth.\nSurinder Thind: Very good, Bill. And then I am going to ask you one more crystal ball question here. Can you talk a little bit about geography and how you guys are thinking about Europe? Obviously, there's more of a global approach by the firm at this point. But just it seems like Europe is generally consistently lagged the U. S. It's always been a bit more headwind past couple of years. How are you thinking about the evolution there of the marketplace versus North America?\nBill Stone: We think there's a lot of opportunity in Europe. There's a lot of assets and there's a much slower adoption toward large scale outsourcing than there has been here in the U.S. But we have won some nice mandates. We think we are going to win some one mandates. And there's large geographies in Europe where we don't have a particularly large presence that we think we can. And again, we want do it in a prudent way and be able to make sure that we have the knowledge, skills and abilities to really capitalize. And I think we have a number of initiatives going on in countries like Germany and France and Italy and Spain and we have a pretty big presence in the U.K. So I think we are reasonably comfortable with our footprint there. And I think we are in execution mode.\nSurinder Thind: Great. That's it for me, Bill. Thank you.\nOperator: . We have a follow-up question from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hello again. I just wanted to follow up with a couple of numbers questions. I don't think you mentioned the alternatives organic growth number. It would be great to have that. And then I guess secondarily also DST financial, if you could disclose that and maybe expand a little bit on the selling environment for that business? And any other business lines you want to give us an update in terms of growth rates for the quarter? Thanks.\nPatrick Pedonti: Yes. Alex, I will give you the numbers. So on the alternatives business, it grew 12% in the quarter and now we are at 9.3% year-to-date. On DST, the financial services part of that business grew 4.5% in the quarter and is at 2.2% year-to-date.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. And any other ones like Advent or the software businesses? Sorry.\nPatrick Pedonti: Yes. Sure. The overall software business, both institutional and Advent, some of our other smaller software business, grew 3.8% in the quarter.\nAlex Kramm: All right. That should be it for me. Thanks again.\nOperator: . Speakers, I am not seeing any questions in the queue. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Bill Stone for closing remarks.\nBill Stone: Again, thanks everybody for being on the call and we look forward to talking to you probably towards the end of October. Thanks again. Stay safe. Stay healthy. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Justine and thanks everyone for joining. Our results for the first  quarter are $1.261 billion in adjusted revenue, up 10.5% and $1.24 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 19.2%. We surpassed $500 million in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter for the first time coming in at $511 million. For the six months, our adjusted consolidated EBITDA was over $1 billion. Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin grew to 40.5% for the quarter. Our second quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 7.2%. This is the highest organic revenue growth quarter in several years. All of our businesses outperformed their expectations. In our alternatives, Intralinks SS&C health and DST Financial businesses drove strong topline growth. SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $562 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 even though we paid $144 million in cash taxes versus $35 million in 2020. We repurchased two million shares of common stock in Q2 2021 at an average price of $73.44 per share for $143.6 million. We paid down $183.1 million in debt for the first six months in 2021 and our leverage ratio continues to come down. At the end of Q2, our secured net leverage ratio was 2.09 times and our total net leverage ratio was at 3.1 times consolidated EBTIDA. We remain fully committed to a shareholder friendly capital allocation strategy. Thanks Patrick. And I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication and hard work they put in each and every day. We are working with various parts of our organization to ensure a productive return to the office policy. We expect to begin our transition this fall. We appreciate you, our shareholders and we remain steadfast in our mission to be the finest technology and service provider to the global financial services industry and the United States healthcare industry. We grew organically 7.2%. We have added $400 billion to our alternatives platform in 18 months. We generated over $1 billion in adjusted consolidated EBITDA in six months. And we announced DomaniRx, our new platform joint venture. I will now open it up for questions. Sure. So our healthcare business grew approximately about 10%, right, Patrick? So you know, Alex, we think this is a very transaction processing and information delivery business and we think we are past that. So we are excited about the opportunity. We think we have really top flight minority partners with us, joint venture partners. And as we said in our remarks today or in the press release, there is 4.5 billion prescriptions filled in United States annually and we process approximately about 400 million to 500 million ourselves. So we think it's a big opportunity to get a larger and larger market share. We think new technology is going to change the experience for the individual customer and then also for the payer provider and I think getting that information back to those places with some sense of real time processing, I think, will allow them to make better decisions and then create a more enlightened kind of healthcare industry and then also provide us with great growth opportunities. And I think that's what we are looking forward to, is to be able to really go from 400 million to 500 million in the number of claims that we process to well in excess of a billion. Well, we always look and we bid. And sometimes we get outbid. And when we get outbid, we think people overpay. And so that's kind of our view of it. There's a lot of things for sale right now. Prices are still nose-bleed levels. And when you add $400 billion in assets to our platform in 18 months, that creates a lot of revenue. And it creates a lot of opportunity for additional revenue. And I have said on this call many times that if we do big acquisitions, it's going to take a lot of management time and in our estimation, that management time when it's focused on organic revenue growth, organic revenue growth builds up. And I think Q2 is another example of that. I think, Rahul, you would be the probably maybe the best taking a shot at that. Yes. The analytics business grew about 18% in the quarter. And they are at about 14% year-to-date. Well, I think that we have a pretty full pipelines and we are getting an awful lot of enquiries into us from all over the world.

Adjusted revenues were $1.261 billion. Adjusted revenue was up 10.5%, adjusted operating income increased 15.3% and adjusted diluted EPS were $1.24, a 19.2% increase over Q2 2020. Overall, adjusted revenue increased $120.2 million. Our acquisitions contributed $17.8 million. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $26.4 million or 2.3% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue increased on a constant currency basis was 7.2%. We had strength across several product lines including alternative assets, Advent, our retirement services, global investor distribution, our ALPS asset management business, healthcare and insurance business. This was offset by weakness in the ALS business due to lower trading volumes. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $495.8 million, an increase of $65.7 million or 15.3% from the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted operating margins increased from 37.7% in the second quarter of 2020 to 39.3% in the second quarter of 2021. This was driven by cost controls and expense controls. Expenses increased 2.5% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $14.9 million in expenses and foreign currency increased costs by $21.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $511.1 million or 40.5% of adjusted revenue and increased $62.7 million or 14% from Q2 to 2020. Net interest expense for the quarter was $51 million and includes $3.3 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID. The interest rate in the quarter for our amended credit facility including the senior notes was 3.02% compared to 3.19% in the second quarter of 2020 and resulted in interest expense decrease of $9.5 million. 12%. And then if you adjust for the pre-acquisition termination, it was 18%. Yes. Alex, I will give you the numbers. So on the alternatives business, it grew 12% in the quarter and now we are at 9.3% year-to-date. On DST, the financial services part of that business grew 4.5% in the quarter and is at 2.2% year-to-date. Yes. Sure.

            "content": "Thanks Bill. We had a strong quarter, driven by broad based performance across our business. We continue to benefit from an increasing recognition by customers and prospects of the breadth and depth of our solutions and expertise. The changes we have made to our organization structure, business leadership and sales management and our continued focus on innovation and delivery are having a positive impact. Our fund administration business is seeing increased fundraising momentum across strategies and a robust pipeline of existing and new clients. The expertise, customer focus and dedication of our professional teams combined with market-leading technology and solutions are unique assets that help us outperform in the context of a healthy fundraising and new launch environment. During the quarter, we combined our real assets and private equity groups to the newly launched SS&C GlobeOp Private Markets Group under the leadership of the Bhagesh Malde. He is well-positioned to help our fast growing private equity and real assets customers with their operational accounting and technology needs. I think what I would say is, we don't really have and there isn't a lot of great data on the underlying market and how fast it's growing.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please note, that today's call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mrs. Justine Stone. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nJustine Stone: Hi, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for our Q1 2021 earnings call. I'm Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Pedonti, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, we need to review the Safe Harbor statement.\nBill Stone: Thanks everyone for joining. Our results for the first quarter are $1.235 billion in adjusted revenue, up 4.9% and $1.18 in adjusted earnings per share, up 14.6%. Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $491.9 million for the quarter, and our adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin was 39.8%. Our first quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 2.9%, strengthening our Alternatives business, Intralinks and our software businesses contribute to this growth surpassing our own expectations; DST and PST came in at 0.1% growth for both financial services and healthcare. Operating cash flow was $185.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, up 25.7%. We brought back 2.7 million shares of common stock in Q1 2021 at an average price of $67.50 per share, $481.4 million. Our secured net leverage ratio now stands at 2.29 times, and our total net leverage ratio is at 3.35 times. We continued our focus on organic revenue growth and we're beginning to see some positive trends. We are growing our sales force and building new revenue generating products and services. We continue to make product improvements and new technologies across our business.  In SS&C Health, our digital capabilities continue to grow in partnership with our customers, and expert user experience designed to pilot the SS&C digital experience platform launched in early Q2 2021, with the platform expanding to over 2 million members by early Q4 2020. This represents an exciting opportunity for our customers to unify their digital solutions or by the single member experience aligning to member and market expectations.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks, Bill. We had a strong quarter with a broad-based lift in revenue, both year-over-year and sequentially. Interlinks had robust growth as the M&A market is off to a brisk start and economic stimulus continues. Increased carve-outs and restructuring, and overall economic activity driving acquisitions contributed to  accounts and win rates remain high. In our Alternatives business, the number of qualified prospects has returned to pre-COVID levels, and there is increased fundraising momentum across strategies. Our existing clients are growing organically through new fund launches and performance, and we continue to win new clients at healthy levels. We ended the quarter with over $2 trillion in assets under administration for the first time, a significant milestone. Our software business performed well, outsourced technology trends across wealth asset management and alternatives remain strong. Customers increasingly demand the ability to select and configure their operating model, including both, software applications and outsourced services. Our capabilities are proving to be a valuable differentiator as one indicator over 90% of SS&C advance Q1 new sales included hosting or other operational services. Managed service offerings for our Geneva and it's applications continue to get traction in the marketplace.\nPatrick Pedonti: Thanks. Results for the first quarter of 2021 were GAAP revenues of $1,233.4 million. GAAP net income was $174.9 million and diluted EPS of $0.65. Adjusted revenues were $1,235.4 million, including the impact of the adoption of the revenue standard 606 and for the acquired deferred revenue adjustments for acquisitions. Adjusted revenue was up 4.9%, adjusted operating income increased 7.1%, and adjusted EPS was $1.18, a 14.6% increase over Q1 2020. Adjusted revenue increased $57.4 million. Our acquisitions contributed $18.6 million in the quarter, foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $16.1 million or 1.4%, adjusted organic revenue increased on a constant currency basis by 2.9% driven by strength in the Alternatives Fund Administration, Advent and Intralinks products. These were offset by weakness in the institutional asset management, healthcare and the NS  products. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $475.8 million, an increase of $31.6 million or 7.1% from the first quarter of 2020. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $13.2 million on expenses in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins increased from 37.7% in the first quarter of 2020 to 38.5% in the first quarter of 2021, driven by cost controls, expenses increased 3.5% on a constant currency basis, acquisitions added $6.3 million, and foreign currency increased costs by $13.2 million. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $491.9 million or 39.8% of adjusted revenue, an increase of $28.4 million from Q1 2020. \nBill Stone: Thanks, Patrick. With almost $500 million in an adjusted consolidated EBITDA for the quarter exceeding $2 trillion in assets under administration in our Alternatives business, adjusted revenue growth of almost 3% , and reducing our security and total leverage ratios to $2.2 million and 3.35 times, we have built a powerful franchise. The franchise continue to add talent and opportunities as we embark on a new post-COVID world. I will now open for questions.\nOperator: We will now take questions.  And our first question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC.\nDan Perlin: Good evening, everyone and great start to the year. So, Bill, I just wanted to drill down a little bit; it sounds like maybe client budgets are starting to come back in the growth mode, you'd get called out Alternatives, maybe the impact of pre-COVID levels and new fundraising and Intralinks. I'm just wondering, as you're having those conversations today with clients, where do we stand in terms of the real demand environment? What the current pipeline look like for you guys? I mean, obviously, we see your guidance which seems pretty reasonable but I'm just also wondering kind of the tonal difference that you're having with clients today versus maybe a quarter or two ago?\nBill Stone: Well, Dan, I think what you're seeing across the world is is that, you know, the world's opening up and knock on wood that we can continue to do that. The different governments, whether it's the EU or United States or all of the North American and Asia is pumping money into the economies. And that's giving investment managers confidence as their fund flows start to fill their coffers, and that makes them either launch new funds, get into new investment types or new strategies and that reflects in the increased demand we're seeing and also we've increased the size of our sales force and we continue to train, and that is proving to be pretty effective. And so we're cautiously optimistic, no one can really predict what the pandemic is going to do next; hopefully, it's going to fade off into the sunset, but we don't have a perfect crystal ball on that. But I would say that's the primary drivers of our of our demand increase.\nDan Perlin: Yes, that's good. And the follow-up is on this new kind of division that you guys launched, this Intelligent Automation Solutions, where it sounds like you're trying to help clients with their digital transformations. That -- I guess I'm wondering that sounds like, not so much a deviation from your historical product forward business but it does sound like it might be broader in around consulting and maybe some other IT kind of functions. So I'm wondering two things; one, do you think that that's opening up the funnel for new opportunities that you guys are going to be able to bring in? And then secondly, is there a product roadmap that needs to go along with that in order to be successful there? Thanks.\nBill Stone: Well, we're pretty excited about adding Gautam and his experience and expertise. And then being able to make our bundles increasingly more user-friendly and more powerful. So we're excited about our opportunities, we think we have lots of exciting technology, and we think that we're increasingly becoming more adept at binding our different products together, which gives our clients more comfort as they grow and expand and want to have fewer suppliers and rely heavily on that. Rahul, would you agree with that comment?\nRahul Kanwar: Bill, I would. And I would just add to the second part of the question that, there already is a fair amount of IP within SS&C that relates to intelligent automation, whether it's our AWD product or various initiatives we have across the company on natural language processing and artificial intelligence. And Gautam and his team are charged with pulling those together, as Bill said, to make sure that they are knitted together in the right way for a particular use case or a particular application in a given industry, as well as build new product, but we have a pretty good foundation.\nDan Perlin: Great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jeffries.\nSurinder Thind: Good afternoon, and congratulations on the quarter. My first question is regarding the guidance; can you break down the outlook for organic growth amongst the various segments for the full year? Meaning as Intralinks, DST and then SS&C core.\nBill Stone: Yes, I think in general, we expect our Alternative business to grow in the 4% to 7% range, we expect Intralinks to be a little bit better than that, then our software businesses, 1% to 2%. And we're striving hard to make -- to keep DST in positive; so 0% to 1%. And we think we have the pipelines and capabilities to hit those numbers and that's what we're striving for, as does a lot better when there is more volatility in the market, and obviously, recently volatility has picked up which will help DS business. Rahul, do you have other points you'd like to make?\nRahul Kanwar: No Bill, I think you've covered it. And I would just say, and we saw this in Q1; we are seeing pretty good lift across our business, right, so it is pretty broad-based, so we're pretty optimistic about what happens in Q2 to Q4.\nSurinder Thind: That's helpful. And then, as a quick follow-up; can you maybe -- is there any color that you can provide on the Schwab transaction and their switching away from DST to BNY Mellon for the transfers of their  business? And what kind of an impact that might have on you guys?\nBill Stone: We don't expect that to have much of an impact on our overall business, the, revenue side of that was not particularly large. And you know, sometimes some of these -- some of the big custodians are under tremendous pressure, and so we are -- we're holding our own and bringing out new technology and moving a lot faster, and we're not going to always win, that's -- Schwab did acquisitions, and they're going to bring in new technologies that were used by the acquisitions candidates that they acquired. So, no way this is going to happen occasionally, and Schwab's still a great customer of ours and we have a lot of respect for them, and we're not going anywhere; we'll be there and we were pretty optimistic about what we're building and how we're delivering it.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlex Kramm: Good evening, everyone. Can you maybe just talk about pricing in the quarter, maybe across the board? But then also on the hedge fund administration sides, you've been talking about this for a couple years now that you're trying to get a little bit more; so anything you can share on the quarter will be helpful?\nBill Stone: Rahul, you won't take that?\nRahul Kanwar: Sure. Alex, you know, I think as we've said previously, the -- we've developed a pretty good process now where, once a year we go back to these customers and we talk to them about the contracts, particularly ones that are coming up on renewal; and to seek generally a modest increase that's in line with what happens to our costs. So we're in that process and have been in that process for three or four months now. And there really hasn't been much to report other than nobody's happy to get approached about a price increase, but we've had good constructive dialogue, there really has not been any fallout out of that process, and we think that our mission, which was to be able to have that conversation and deliver a lot of value to go with that, we're doing that. So it's gone well; like I said, it's pretty modest overall. And we -- but we expect to be able to keep doing it on an annual basis over the long-term.\nAlex Kramm: Okay, fair enough. And then maybe just turning back to the quarter, I think you mentioned DST but can you break out maybe some of the other businesses, like the Alternative business growth for the quarter, but then also, Intralinks and Eze , I don't think you mentioned it. So anything you can share in terms of how the growth came together for the quarter? Sorry, if I missed it.\nBill Stone: The Alternatives this past -- we feel, the alternative business grew 6.7% in the quarter, Intralinks was 10%. And as Bill mentioned, DS business had lot lower volumes and was down 3% for the quarter. And the DST business combined, health and financial services, was essentially flat on an adjusted basis.\nAlex Kramm: All right, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Schmidt with Citi.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hey Bill, Rahul, Patrick; hope you're doing well. Thanks for taking my questions. So question on DST, I think you mentioned last quarter financial services for the year on organic basis expected to be low-single, healthcare maybe slightly down. Any update to the growth trajectory of DST this year? And then, any commentary on how the pipeline is specifically shifting up for DST versus the other parts of the business will be helpful. Thank you.\nBill Stone: Well, again, we've done lots of changes in DST and we're pretty focused on it. We have some really good pipeline business in there, and I think that it's the execution part of it, right, you have to win, and then you have to convert. So we won a number of large mandates, and -- you know, in the third and fourth quarter last year in our retirement services business, and -- that revenue is -- we'll build throughout 2021. And that will get reasonably significant lift off DST, and then we . I mean, that's the challenge to this. But we do think we're bringing out some really exciting new digital technologies and capabilities. And I think it's -- ultimately, you have to have superior products and superior services. When you have that, then then the ability to train your sales force and win the deals I think it was -- becomes increasingly positive. Is that your take up, Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: It is Bill. And, you know, the DST financial business; we're thinking as planned for the year, low single digits, probably 2.5% or so organic growth, and the health business, 1.3%. So the average of those two things is kind of a little over 2%, that's what's in our plan right now.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. That's super helpful. I appreciate the technology commentary, that's great to hear. I guess just as a follow-up, just switching gears to institutional asset management market. Obviously, we saw the announcement of large asset manager switching to front to back investment servicing platform. Are you seeing more demand or more conversation amongst the larger traditional asset managers just to overhaul their tech infrastructure? Obviously, we've been talking about this for a number of years but it does seem like some things are starting to break loose, at least -- obviously, can we share your commentary there on that market?\nBill Stone: Well, we are bringing out a number of new products and services and focused in that area. You know, the large scale asset managers, it's a multi-year process for that. And the new technologies, right, the RPA, the AI, the ML, the natural language processing; those things are increasingly sophisticated and increasingly powerful. And managers are looking at what they have today, and then how they transition to newer technologies and to streamline their operations. And infrastructure costs; so we think increasingly, that will get adopted and you know, it's -- you know, COVID kind of put up a difficult thing to rip out your infrastructure and bring new. At the same time, it created an awful lot of review and analysis. But now I think that that's going to change, and we're planning on being at the forefront.\nAndrew Schmidt: Makes sense. Let's hope we're getting to that stage. Thanks a lot, Bill. I appreciate the comments.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Rayna Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nRayna Kumar: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us your thoughts on the current outlook for large license deals? So now that vaccine is becoming more prevalent in the U.S., are you -- do you think you're going to start to do more face-to-face meetings to close up some of these larger deals that you spoke about on the fourth quarter earnings call?\nBill Stone: Well, you know, as Rahul spoke earlier, Rayna, that he -- you know, the thing you're seeing now is increasingly infrastructure bundles with large licenses, so that -- you know, the technology aspects of maintaining current code, right, so releases have to go in and has to be handled, and it has to be done in a very professional way; that's our expertise. You know, often it's not these large scale managers that are very expert in using the applications, but not necessarily as expert in maintaining them, upgrading them, planning for those things. And so -- you know, we think that bundling capability is giving us a little more running room. We think that the large license sales, I think, are not going to be as robust as they were 10 years ago because there's more options for people, and I think they will adopt some of those options that make their entire infrastructure easier to manage. Do you approve that, Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: I do. And we've seen -- as Bill just mentioned, we've seen that strength in our Advent business, and we're starting to see more of those conversations in our institutional investment management business.\nRayna Kumar: That's extremely helpful. And just on the DST business, a clarification question. Did you say DST for the full year could be up 0% to 1% organically or 2%? And what gives you confidence that DST will continue to improve in 2021 versus what we saw in 2020? Thank you.\nBill Stone: Yes. I think I said 0% to 1% but Rahul, correct me. And I think -- I think we're shooting at combined around 2%. And you know, I mean we have -- we have opportunities, I mean, tremendous opportunities. You know, opportunities only translate into financial statements when contracts get signed, right. So, we are executing on large scale deals; hopefully over the next couple of quarters, it will come to fruition and we'll be able to share with you. But we're cautiously optimistic that the big things are going to happen for us, and we've been working hard to make sure that happens. And at the same time, continue to drive earnings, drive cash flow, and increase shareholder value, that's our job. Rahul, you have any more on that?\nRahul Kanwar: Bill, I don't. We are -- you know, we're also -- we've got reasonably good visibility, at least in the current quarter and all that out. So, that's also part of where the confidence comes from.\nRayna Kumar: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Thanks very much. I wanted to touch on quickly acquisitions during the course of the core, Rahul had kind of mentioned, that you might be looking a little bit more tweaking your M&A strategy a little bit, and it seems like, the mainstream may fit the criteria you outlined. And should we expect acquisition similar to this going forward in terms of price you're willing to pay growth rates, etcetera?\nBill Stone: Well, I think the answer for that is yes. You know, I -- you know, James, if you can tell us about what's the high end of this -- like there is not a lot of money chasing things. And we have a lot of confidence in our development teams and our sales organization, and we believe we can build almost anything; so the question becomes, is, where do you allocate your capital? And we want to allocate it what we'll give our shareholders as the best risk adjusted return. So, maybe these things that are selling at 20 times revenue; you know, maybe they are going to be moon-shots . But you've been at this long enough, 20 times revenue, that's a big number.  So you've got to be -- you've got to do your due diligence, you've got to know how you're going to make that pay off. And so, I would say, yes, of course what we have to raise our prices to get good assets because good assets are selling for higher price. But we're still disciplined; like I said, we did almost $500 million in adjusted consolidated EBITDA, and that gives us a lot of flexibility. And as Patrick said, we're expecting somewhere around $1.003 billion  in free cash flow. So we can use that to do lots of things, and we plan on doing lots of things. And so I think this is a good question and there is no specific answer other than certainly, if you're going to be in the M&A game, you're going to pay more now than you did 5 or 10 years ago.\nJames Faucette: Yes, for sure. And I think the tweaks certainly makes sense. I wish I could tell you though, Bill, how high or how long it goes on. But I guess associated with that, it seems like there's been some recent focus on Australia given Link Group and Mainstream; is that a coincidence? Or is there something attractive about the Australian market that you're looking to gain exposure to? I'm just trying to get a little bit of insight into if there is anything specific there that we should be paying attention now -- attention to in that region of the world?\nBill Stone: Well, I think Australia has a strong economy and they have -- you know, their superannuation fund concepts and distribution to their populace  is, what they sort of -- they call it the \"wall of money\" I think and -- you know, when you have that and you have you have upwards 30 million people that are certainly in the top decile of the world's wealth. As far as full populations go, I think it's an attractive market, right; and they have -- no, it's English speaking, it's common law practices, primarily contractual processes similar to the UK and the U.S. and Canada, and so it -- that makes it pretty attractive, and makes what we do pretty transparent to them. And I think that's why we see the  Australian plus there were things that were for sale. So it's something that we try to take advantage of no matter where it is in the world.\nJames Faucette: Yes, good. Thanks for that, Bill.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Donat with Piper Sandler.\nChristopher Donat: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. It's Chris Donat. In terms of your second quarter guidance, just wondering about the -- looks like about a 2% decrease from the first quarter in terms of adjusted revenue? How should we think about that? Is that -- was that sort of coming off a strong quarter from Intralinks? Or were other -- was other revenue pulled forward in other sources? Or just help us understand what's the quarter-on-quarter change in revenue?\nBill Stone: Rahul, you want to take that?\nRahul Kanwar: Sure. I think the biggest thing there is, we do have some seasonality in our business, couple of the areas. For example, in our alternatives business, we do a lot of year-end financial statements and tax work. In our transfer agency and invest businesses, we do some regulatory filings and reporting to investors that occur around the year-end process. And so there is pockets like that, where there is just more work that gets concentrated in Q1 than Q2, and that's primarily the difference.\nChristopher Donat: Okay, got it. That makes sense. And then, you already touched on this a little bit, but I just want to make sure I'm understanding what's going on with the new Intelligent Automation Solutions Group. Is that separate from singularity or is there some overlap or where are we with singularity? And, there is a lot of themes here with machine learning and robotic process automation, which seemed like they overlap between the two.\nBill Stone: Well, I think they do, right. I mean, Singularity is an investment analytics, accounting and reporting solution; and then our Intelligent Automation workflow product, AWD, would be integrated with that in order to be able to use all the singularities capabilities, and be able to put in a very sophisticated workflow process. So it is all related but it's the bundling of those things I think that gives us the powerful markets.\nChristopher Donat: Okay, thanks, Bill.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jackson Ader with JPMorgan.\nJackson Ader: Great, thanks for taking our questions. First one is on win rate, and I was just curious, if in either the Eze business or fund administration, whether you were seeing any kind of different win rates for maybe new fund launches versus your win rates with existing funds that are just putting out current RFP?\nBill Stone: I think our historical win rates and our current win rates are pretty similar, we might have a little momentum now. But you know, we are pretty powerful force and that's why we had $74 billion in our funds business. And we have consistently been a big force in new fund launches that win , and I think that will continue. Do you have any more colorful, Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: Bill, I agree. I think it is pretty consistent with the past and we are -- as our business gets stronger, and we continue to build products and services, it is strengthening. And that part of the market, the new phone launch market, has always been really attractive to us, and many of our long-term clients and big clients started out in that process, and that continues to be a place where we have a good number of wins.\nJackson Ader: Okay. And my follow-up is on, just two quick ones on the Mainstream acquisition. First is, you know, is there anything structural about that business that would kind of, keep it from being able to get to that SS&C operating margin kind of target level? And then, also, if Memory Series, Advent, when you acquired them had, like, teens or maybe 20% of the business came from international markets; so I was curious if there is any kind of either retail or RIA potential cross-sell with Advent moving into a new market? Thanks.\nBill Stone: Well, we don't think there is anything structural at Mainstream, and we think it's good business, we think we can add a lot of help  in sales and marketing. And then obviously, we're going to save some money on overhead costs; so we should be able to drive margins up. And as far as Advent's concerned, I think internationally Black Diamond we acquired with Advent, and that's a big RIA. I think we're upto 1700  or so RIA going into Black Diamond, and that continues to be a nice growth area for us. And we like that space, of course, everybody likes that space. So finding tucking acquisitions is, it's expensive, and you got to be cognizant of that expense. And then, also, what's the time to market if we decided to build and we have to make sure that we're wise about which opposed  to the things we do.\nJackson Ader: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the conference back over to Bill Stone for final remarks.\nBill Stone: Well, again, we appreciate all of you; and hopefully, you know, we're -- we're off to the races over here, alright. Ducky Derby is coming up in a week or two, and I look forward to talking to you at the end of the second quarter. Thanks.",

            "content": "Thanks everyone for joining. Our results for the first quarter are $1.235 billion in adjusted revenue, up 4.9% and $1.18 in adjusted earnings per share, up 14.6%. Our adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $491.9 million for the quarter, and our adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin was 39.8%. Our first quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 2.9%, strengthening our Alternatives business, Intralinks and our software businesses contribute to this growth surpassing our own expectations; DST and PST came in at 0.1% growth for both financial services and healthcare. Operating cash flow was $185.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, up 25.7%. We brought back 2.7 million shares of common stock in Q1 2021 at an average price of $67.50 per share, $481.4 million. Our secured net leverage ratio now stands at 2.29 times, and our total net leverage ratio is at 3.35 times. We continued our focus on organic revenue growth and we're beginning to see some positive trends. We are growing our sales force and building new revenue generating products and services. We continue to make product improvements and new technologies across our business.  In SS&C Health, our digital capabilities continue to grow in partnership with our customers, and expert user experience designed to pilot the SS&C digital experience platform launched in early Q2 2021, with the platform expanding to over 2 million members by early Q4 2020. This represents an exciting opportunity for our customers to unify their digital solutions or by the single member experience aligning to member and market expectations. Thanks, Patrick. With almost $500 million in an adjusted consolidated EBITDA for the quarter exceeding $2 trillion in assets under administration in our Alternatives business, adjusted revenue growth of almost 3% , and reducing our security and total leverage ratios to $2.2 million and 3.35 times, we have built a powerful franchise. The franchise continue to add talent and opportunities as we embark on a new post-COVID world. I will now open for questions. Well, Dan, I think what you're seeing across the world is is that, you know, the world's opening up and knock on wood that we can continue to do that. The different governments, whether it's the EU or United States or all of the North American and Asia is pumping money into the economies.

Rahul, would you agree with that comment? Yes, I think in general, we expect our Alternative business to grow in the 4% to 7% range, we expect Intralinks to be a little bit better than that, then our software businesses, 1% to 2%.

So it is all related but it's the bundling of those things I think that gives us the powerful markets. I think our historical win rates and our current win rates are pretty similar, we might have a little momentum now. But you know, we are pretty powerful force and that's why we had $74 billion in our funds business. And we have consistently been a big force in new fund launches that win , and I think that will continue. Do you have any more colorful, Rahul? Well, we don't think there is anything structural at Mainstream, and we think it's good business, we think we can add a lot of help  in sales and marketing. And then obviously, we're going to save some money on overhead costs; so we should be able to drive margins up. And as far as Advent's concerned, I think internationally Black Diamond we acquired with Advent, and that's a big RIA. I think we're upto 1700  or so RIA going into Black Diamond, and that continues to be a nice growth area for us. And we like that space, of course, everybody likes that space. So finding tucking acquisitions is, it's expensive, and you got to be cognizant of that expense. And then, also, what's the time to market if we decided to build and we have to make sure that we're wise about which opposed  to the things we do. Well, again, we appreciate all of you; and hopefully, you know, we're -- we're off to the races over here, alright. Ducky Derby is coming up in a week or two, and I look forward to talking to you at the end of the second quarter. Thanks."

Adjusted revenues were $1,235.4 million, including the impact of the adoption of the revenue standard 606 and for the acquired deferred revenue adjustments for acquisitions. Adjusted revenue was up 4.9%, adjusted operating income increased 7.1%, and adjusted EPS was $1.18, a 14.6% increase over Q1 2020. Adjusted revenue increased $57.4 million. Our acquisitions contributed $18.6 million in the quarter, foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $16.1 million or 1.4%, adjusted organic revenue increased on a constant currency basis by 2.9% driven by strength in the Alternatives Fund Administration, Advent and Intralinks products. These were offset by weakness in the institutional asset management, healthcare and the NS  products. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $475.8 million, an increase of $31.6 million or 7.1% from the first quarter of 2020. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $13.2 million on expenses in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins increased from 37.7% in the first quarter of 2020 to 38.5% in the first quarter of 2021, driven by cost controls, expenses increased 3.5% on a constant currency basis, acquisitions added $6.3 million, and foreign currency increased costs by $13.2 million. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $491.9 million or 39.8% of adjusted revenue, an increase of $28.4 million from Q1 2020."

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. We had a strong quarter with a broad-based lift in revenue, both year-over-year and sequentially. Interlinks had robust growth as the M&A market is off to a brisk start and economic stimulus continues. Increased carve-outs and restructuring, and overall economic activity driving acquisitions contributed to  accounts and win rates remain high. In our Alternatives business, the number of qualified prospects has returned to pre-COVID levels, and there is increased fundraising momentum across strategies. Our existing clients are growing organically through new fund launches and performance, and we continue to win new clients at healthy levels. We ended the quarter with over $2 trillion in assets under administration for the first time, a significant milestone. Our software business performed well, outsourced technology trends across wealth asset management and alternatives remain strong. Customers increasingly demand the ability to select and configure their operating model, including both, software applications and outsourced services. Our capabilities are proving to be a valuable differentiator as one indicator over 90% of SS&C advance Q1 new sales included hosting or other operational services. Managed service offerings for our Geneva and it's applications continue to get traction in the marketplace. Bill, I would. And I would just add to the second part of the question that, there already is a fair amount of IP within SS&C that relates to intelligent automation, whether it's our AWD product or various initiatives we have across the company on natural language processing and artificial intelligence. And Gautam and his team are charged with pulling those together, as Bill said, to make sure that they are knitted together in the right way for a particular use case or a particular application in a given industry, as well as build new product, but we have a pretty good foundation. No Bill, I think you've covered it. And I would just say, and we saw this in Q1; we are seeing pretty good lift across our business, right, so it is pretty broad-based, so we're pretty optimistic about what happens in Q2 to Q4. Sure. Alex, you know, I think as we've said previously, the -- we've developed a pretty good process now where, once a year we go back to these customers and we talk to them about the contracts, particularly ones that are coming up on renewal; and to seek generally a modest increase that's in line with what happens to our costs. So we're in that process and have been in that process for three or four months now. And there really hasn't been much to report other than nobody's happy to get approached about a price increase, but we've had good constructive dialogue, there really has not been any fallout out of that process, and we think that our mission, which was to be able to have that conversation and deliver a lot of value to go with that, we're doing that. So it's gone well; like I said, it's pretty modest overall. And we -- but we expect to be able to keep doing it on an annual basis over the long-term. It is Bill. And, you know, the DST financial business; we're thinking as planned for the year, low single digits, probably 2.5% or so organic growth, and the health business, 1.3%. So the average of those two things is kind of a little over 2%, that's what's in our plan right now. I do. And we've seen -- as Bill just mentioned, we've seen that strength in our Advent business, and we're starting to see more of those conversations in our institutional investment management business. Bill, I don't. We are -- you know, we're also -- we've got reasonably good visibility, at least in the current quarter and all that out. So, that's also part of where the confidence comes from. Sure. I think the biggest thing there is, we do have some seasonality in our business, couple of the areas. For example, in our alternatives business, we do a lot of year-end financial statements and tax work. In our transfer agency and invest businesses, we do some regulatory filings and reporting to investors that occur around the year-end process. And so there is pockets like that, where there is just more work that gets concentrated in Q1 than Q2, and that's primarily the difference. Bill, I agree. I think it is pretty consistent with the past and we are -- as our business gets stronger, and we continue to build products and services, it is strengthening. And that part of the market, the new phone launch market, has always been really attractive to us, and many of our long-term clients and big clients started out in that process, and that continues to be a place where we have a good number of wins."

After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today’s call over to Justine Stone, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJustine Stone: Hi, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. I am Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C Technologies. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Pedonti, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, we need to review the safe harbor statement.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in today’s earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stone: Thanks, Justine, and thanks everyone for joining. Our results for the fourth quarter of $1.339 million in adjusted revenue, up 3.3% and our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.16, down 4 -- 9.4%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $518.6 million, third highest in our history, and our EBITDA margin was 38.7%. Our fourth quarter adjusted organic revenue was flat in line with our expectations. For the year, total organic growth was 2%, while our Financial Services organic growth, which is 94% of our revenue was 3.7%. 2022 was a challenging operating environment for SS&C, but we are pleased that with the revenue performance from our software businesses, including Advent, Investment and Institutional Management and as -- and the resiliency of our Alternative Fund Administration and Intralinks business. In 2022, SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $1.134 billion, including $67 million in deal related expenses. We paid down $166 million in debt in Q4, bringing our consolidated net leverage ratio to 3.4 times and our net secured leverage ratio to 2.4 times, sorry, 2.4 times consolidated EBITDA. This past January, as we were in our quarterly blackout three of our stock buybacks, we paid down debt an additional $101 million. In Q4, we bought back 1.8 million shares from $90.7 million at an average price of $50.14. For the year, we had stock buybacks of $476 million, for purchases of 7.8 million shares at an average price of $61.01. We will continue to allocate about 50% of our cash flow to stock buybacks and about 50% to debt pay down. In December, we acquired Complete Financial Ops, a specialized Colorado-based fund administrator that focuses on private equity and family offices. CFO Fund Services will augment SS&C’s capabilities in servicing venture capital and family office funds and CFO clients will enjoy the same outstanding service backed by SS&C size, scale and comprehensive solutions. We remain methodically opportunistic in our acquisition strategy, valuations have come down more in line with our disciplined strategy and we are evaluating several opportunities. We remain very bullish on our Blue Prism acquisition and we are wrapping our digital workers deployment throughout our business. I will now turn it over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks, Bill. Q4 results demonstrate the strength of our business amidst a challenging operating environment and highlight our ability to drive margins despite inflationary pressures. We exited 2022 with 38.7% EBITDA margin, up 330 basis points from the low point in Q2. Cost controls, facilities reduction and productivity improvements enabled this quick turnaround. While labor markets remain volatile, we believe Blue Prism’s intelligent automation technology will be an important means to harnessing the productivity of our workforce in 2023 and beyond. As a business unit, Blue Prism continues to grow nicely and exited 2022 with 20% EBITDA margins. We continue to see opportunity in the private credit market, where we are investing in a highly scalable offering combining the strengths of Advent Software products and GlobeOp Services capabilities. A key component will be the build-out of a robust data platform that integrates multiple SS&C technologies, including Geneva, TNR, Precision LM and others. Private credit represents the latest example of SS&C developing technology, expertise and services to address the needs of a very specialized and complex set of fund managers. This is a strategy we have employed effectively and repeatedly as we have built the world’s largest alternatives administration business. I will mention some key deals for Q4. Three existing SS&C clients upgraded to our newest platform, Aloha. We currently have over 30 clients live on Aloha. A $13 billion asset manager partnered with SS&C for fund accounting and reporting functions on their real assets portfolio, this partnership includes lifting out 60 employees in Texas. One of DST’s largest clients expanded their relationship to include more transfer agency operations. A Canadian alternative asset manager chose SS&C for a suite of private equity administration services, including regulatory reporting, treasury services and investor vision citing their need for Canadian and international expertise, as well as scale for future growth. A $75 billion hedge fund chose Geneva for its superior functionality around loan processing and accounting. A Hong Kong-based asset manager chose EMS/OMS as they needed greater asset class coverage, flexibility, third-party integration and compliance functionality. Mine Super managing $12 billion in assets on behalf of 55,000 members became SS&C’s first Australian superannuation client. The partnership will deliver superior digital experiences for members, driving greater member engagement and stronger retirement outcomes. I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials.\nPatrick Pedonti: Thanks. The results for the fourth quarter 2022 were GAAP revenues of $1.338 billion, GAAP net income of $207.5 million and diluted EPS of $0.81. Adjusted revenues were $1.391 billion. Adjusted revenue was up 3.3% and adjusted operating income decreased 1.1% and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.16, a 9.4% decrease from Q4 2021. Overall, adjusted revenue increased $42.9 million or 3.3% from Q4 2021. Our acquisitions contributed $72.5 million. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $28.7 million or 2.2% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue was flat on a constant currency basis. We had strength in several product lines, including Alternatives, Institutional and Investment Management and the Intralinks business. That strength was impacted by weakness in our GIDS transfer agency business and Healthcare businesses. Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $502.1 million, a decrease of $5.4 million or 1.1% from Q4 2021. Adjusted operating margins were 37.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $39.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding acquisitions, expenses increased 2.6% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $56.7 million in expenses and foreign currency decreased cost by $27.9 million. Our cost structure has been impacted by wage inflation and higher staffing to support our business. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA defined in note three of our earnings release, was $518.6 million or 38.7% of adjusted revenue, a decrease of $4.3 million or 0.8% from Q4 2021. Net interest expense for the quarter was $104.9 million and includes $3.7 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter for our amended credit facility including the senior notes was 5.64%, compared to 3.09% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income was $296.6 million and adjusted EPS of $1.16, and the effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares decreased to $256.4 million from $260.9 million in Q3. Share repurchases and the lower average stock price during the quarter led to the decrease. Fourth quarter -- in the fourth quarter of 2022, we reported GAAP fair value, unrealized gains totaling $68.8 million for investments we made in 2020 and 2021. These gains are excluded from our adjusted financial results. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $440 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $7.1 billion of gross debt. SS&C net debt, which excludes the cash of $134 million at DomaniRx was $6.8 billion as of December 31st. Operating cash flow for the 12 months ended December 2022 was $1.134 billion. It includes the impact of $67 million of Blue Prism post-acquisition transaction costs. Adjusted for the transaction costs, cash flow was $1.21 billion or a decrease of $227 million or 15.9% compared to 2021. Cash flow was impacted by higher interest rates, lower EBITDA, and an increase in receivables, DSO. During the three months ended December 31st, we paid down $166 million of debt and purchased $90.7 million of stock buyback. Highlights for 12 months on the cash flow, we paid $1.36 billion for acquisitions, including Blue Prism, Hubwise, MineralWare, O’Shares and Tier1 and Complete Financial Ops net of cash acquired. Treasury stock buybacks totaled $476 million. We purchase a 7.8 million shares at an average price of $61.01, compared to $487.9 million of treasury stock buyback in 2021. In July, the Board authorized the new stock purchase program up to $1 billion. Program to-date, stock buybacks totaled $305 million for purchases of 5.5 million shares at an average price of $55.78. For the year, we declared and paid dividends of $203 million, compared to $174 million last year, an increase of 16.7%. In 2022, we paid interest of $298 million, compared to $192.5 million in 2021. Income taxes paid this year totaled $281 million, compared to $310 million in 2021. Our accounts receivable DSO was 52.3 days as of December 2022 and that compares to $51.8 million as of September 2022 and 49.5% as of December 2021. Capital expenditures and capitalized software totaled $208 million or 3.9% of adjusted revenue, compared to approximately $137 million in 2021. The spending is predominantly for capitalized software and IT infrastructure. Our LTM consolidated EBITDA, which we use for covenant compliance was $2.010 billion as of December 2022. And based on the net debt of $6.8 billion, our total leverage was 3.4 times and our secured leverage was 2.4 times as of December 31st. On outlook for 2023, I will cover a few assumptions first. We will continue to focus on client services, and we expect our retention rates to continue a range of most recent results. We have assumed foreign currency exchange at the year end 2022 levels. As a result, adjusted organic growth for the year will be between 2% and 6%, and adjusted organic growth for Q1 will be in the range of negative 0.5% and to positive 2.5%. We have assumed interest rates will average approximately 6.35% for the year for our credit facility and senior notes. We expect staff productivity to improve by approximately 5% and we will manage expenses during this period by controlling variable costs to improve our operating margins in the rate of 50 basis points to 150 basis points compared to 2022. We will continue investing in our business long-term in the areas of capital expenditures, product development and sales and marketing. And we will continue allocating free cash flow to both to pay down debt and buy back stock and we have assumed that the tax rate will be approximately 26%. So for the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.332 billion to $1.372 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $282 million to $299 million and diluted shares in the range of $156 million to $157 million. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $5.45 billion $5.655 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $1.190 billion to $1.285 billion and diluted shares in the range of $455 million to $258.5 million. And for the full year, we expect cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.375 billion. Now I will turn it over to Bill for final comments.\nBill Stone: Thanks, Patrick. 2023’s improved operating environment will present more of our growth opportunities for SS&C. We look forward to capitalizing on these opportunities and delivering superior results to our shareholders. I will now open it up to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. I’d like to start with a question or two around productivity. Can you maybe talk a little bit about just the digital workers and kind of the efficiencies that you are seeing there? So when you give metrics such as there’s 180 digital workers, does that replace a certain amount of employee hours or how should we think about that and maybe just the kind of the targets that you have for the full year that you laid out relative to last quarter?\nBill Stone: Yeah. We expect on average conservatively that a digital worker will probably save us $50,000 per digital worker deployed. We are not replacing personnel on a one-for-one basis with digital workers. What we are doing is allowing ourselves to hire less and get more productivity through the deployment of digital workers and then also perhaps not to have -- to hire for some of the attrition. So we look at this as a win-win for our employees, the digital worker tends to take over repetitive tasks, which gives our employees a more interesting job. And then it also is obviously a cost savings and efficiency process for us and we would hope to deploy, I believe, somewhere around 1,500 to -- I think, 1,350 to 2,700 digital workers in 2023.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then in terms of just what that means for the expense line item, the comment around a 5% improvement in productivity. Also -- so in terms of when we think about the revenue guide, does that mean expenses should be relatively flat year-over-year, just in absolute terms?\nBill Stone: I think I guess what it implies, and I think, obviously, we have to manage and we are subject to every other just as every other company depending on what inflation is and what’s happening in the labor markets. But other than that, the productivity we expect out of the deployment of digital workers should offset some of the expenses that we would paid for higher salaries and other expenses.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then just one quick follow-up, in terms of the commentary around the M&A, any additional color that you can provide there in terms of the types of opportunities you are looking at or the scale of opportunities, any color there would be helpful?\nBill Stone: Yeah. We see a number of dislocations in the fintech space. So there’s going to be opportunities both large and small. And as always, SS&C is a disciplined acquirer, we are also somewhat of a reasonably voracious acquirer when prices are in our disciplined strategy and that’s not 10 times revenue. So we think that the market is moving to where we are, we think that we have lots of productivity opportunities and we think we will be a good home for different types of ops companies we could acquire.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. Good evening. Yeah. Hey. Good evening, everyone. Just to follow up on the, I guess, cost and margin question. I think Patrick specifically said 50-basis-point to 150-basis-point margin expansion. Maybe I didn’t hear that right, but if that’s the case.\nPatrick Pedonti: That’s correct.\nAlex Kramm: I guess --yeah. So I think it gets you in EBITDA terms to around 39% at the midpoint. Is the cadence of that and I guess we came back into the first quarter, but can you maybe just lay out any sort of seasonality or also if you are taking measures still this year? Is that a glide higher with revenue growth or how should we be thinking about the cadence of margins if you think about the four quarters?\nBill Stone: Yeah. I think we will have had Blue Prism for a year in the middle of March and we are rapidly deploying digital workers. But the ramp up will be obviously higher as each quarter goes and the savings that we will incur will be heavily weighted probably to Q3 and Q4, just as the use of those digital workers will be full time in those quarters and less so as much in Q1.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. Fair enough. And then flipping to the revenue side, I think, 2% to 6% organic, that’s an acceleration clearly from where we were in 2022. So, I mean, anything to point out, any puts and takes, but in particular, I mean, Healthcare obviously, was a big detractor in 2022. So is this now all in the run rate or is it actually a little bit more bleeding or should that business actually start growing again? And then since you just mentioned Blue Prism, I think, last quarter you actually gave the growth rates and now that it’s flipping organic, it would be very helpful to see how the business is doing on an external perspective. So any other comments on organic would be helpful? Thanks.\nBill Stone: Yeah. Well, again, I think, we have -- go ahead, Patrick.\nPatrick Pedonti: Well, just to answer a few of your questions. I think, Blue Prism turns organic in mid-March, right, of 2023. But if you calculate the revenue growth this past year organically, I think, they have averaged in the mid-teens, maybe a little bit higher and they were about 13% in Q4 and we expect them to be around mid-teens in 2023.\nAlex Kramm: And then on the Healthcare side, sorry, again, since that was the biggest area of weakness, is that behind us?\nPatrick Pedonti: I think the -- on the Healthcare side, there will be a little bit of reduction in the revenue reduce. So I think they were down about 20% in 2022 and might be down about 10% in 2023, especially in the first half of the year with the comparables.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. So is that still new client losses and should we just expect that, that business doesn’t really grow organically until DomaniRx really kicks in or is it just a holding pattern that clients are in or how are you thinking about Healthcare in general, what’s going on under the hood?\nBill Stone: Well, we send a lot of things in health…\nPatrick Pedonti: I think there…\nBill Stone: …in Healthcare and I think that we have a lot of opportunity. The question is, obviously, is you have to hit those Healthcare systems on renewal dates. So we are cautiously optimistic that Domani is progressing well and we have some talented people working on that and I think that there is not gigantic optimism for 2023, but we think there’s a pretty good ramp we can get to in 2024.\nAlex Kramm: Excellent. Thank you very much guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt with William Blair.\nJeff Schmitt: Hi. Thank you. Alternative organic growth is holding up fairly well, 4.5% in the quarter. But it looks like private market is growing in the high-teens. So I presume the hedge fund business is it negative growth and maybe if you could speak to the disparity in growth in those two businesses.\nBill Stone: Rahul, you want to take that?\nRahul Kanwar: Sure. I actually think the hedge fund business is slightly positive. You are correct that it’s not -- it’s nowhere near the private markets growth. But we are probably assuming in 2023 and our plan, 2% to 3% growth in the hedge fund side of it and mid-teens or higher in the private markets and that’s what kind of makes the sum of the two. I would say in commentary and specific on the hedge fund side is our sales performance continues to be strong. I think we have continued to see demand for middle office services and some of the additional modules and things that we have rolled out, including GoCentral. We are obviously not benefiting from a ton of inflows in hedge funds now. But as that turns around, we think we will be well positioned because we are taking market share, and in the meantime, the private markets and private credit businesses continue to become bigger parts of this, and so move the growth algorithm higher.\nJeff Schmitt: Okay. And then a question on the Healthcare business, it seems like it’s the medical business that is sort of you are downsizing and I think that’s a lower margin business relative to the pharmacy. But I guess my question is, with that sort of going down, is it big enough, is it having a positive impact on overall margins or how big is the margin disparity there I guess?\nBill Stone: But I think Healthcare runs in the high 20s and the rest of the business is running in the high 30s. Is that about right, Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: That’s about right, Bill.\nBill Stone: So and it’s about -- I guess about $280 million, $90 million business. So it’s still a substantial business with substantial opportunity and I just think it’s execution and attention, and I think we are putting execution and attention into that space.\nJeff Schmitt: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson.\nPeter Heckmann: Hey. Good evening. I had just a couple of follow-ups. There were a couple of larger customers that we talked about through last year. Can you talk about when you expect them to go live this year and then in terms of the couple of lift outs, you talked about the one in Texas, make sure if you talk about the others. But when we should see some of the bigger customers in the conversion backlog hitting and starting to contribute to organic?\nBill Stone: Yeah. A number of them we think are in the first quarter at the end, I think, primarily in March. Then we have a number of other ones that we would expect to be in the second quarter, and then hopefully, we will be able to with everything that started off and had been signed and closed in 2022 that we would be able to pretty much have them live by the end of the third quarter. So there’s still substantial amount of sold revenue that we have not recognized yet. And I don’t know, Rahul, if you have any more comment on that.\nRahul Kanwar: No. Bill, I think, that’s exactly right. It’s throughout the course of the year, some in Q1 and Q2, and we get pretty close to full towards the latter half of the year.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. And then I think you covered it in part, but I guess, how would you characterize the environment for new business in the fourth quarter, was it basically in line with your expectations, better or worse? And then how do you find customers kind of decision making, their willingness to make decisions here in the first half of 2023, given some of the uncertainties?\nBill Stone: Well, I think, Pete, that’s right on, right? I mean it’s -- I think there’s people that need to get efficiency. As Rahul said earlier, there’s an awful lot of opportunities in middle office and I think there’s a lot of pressure on our customers to get more efficient. And I think they are finding that maintaining software systems and large staffs of operations and accounting people is not necessarily their core competencies and that’s really our opportunity. And we think we are taking advantage of it and we believe we have the best sales force and that they are executing at a pretty high level.\nPeter Heckmann: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hey, guys. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. It kind of just drill down on organic growth. This has been asked a few different ways. But if you could just talk about your visibility in terms of the acceleration in growth as your progresses, part of it is obviously Blue Prism coming to the mix and then some of it is go-lives, which you have a pretty good sense, perhaps even a better sense now that implementation resources are a little bit more stable. But maybe talk through if there’s any other drivers we should think about in terms of your confidence for achieving the organic growth outlook for this year? And then anything about just embedded macro assumptions goes back to other questions that have been asked, but any other color there would be helpful? Thank you.\nBill Stone: Yeah. We have been implementing price increases over the last couple of years and that’s beginning to bring fruition to us and we would hope that those price increases start to approach 2% overall for the whole business and so that gives us some confidence and some lift. And we continue to bring out new systems and new services and successful new products like Aloha and Singularity and GoCentral are all positive things that drive the business forward and packages of products of ours that we sell like our trust system, combined with our wealth management product Diamond has been pretty effective and we think it will continue to be.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. That’s helpful. And then, last year, obviously, the labor pressure, there were some pressure on implementation time lines and things like that. Has that now stabilized in terms of client implementation time frames and where you are seeing the retention with the implementation workforce, anything to call out there? Thanks a lot.\nBill Stone: Well, we all work here. So we are focusing on it and we have talented people that have hired more talented people and that group of people is focused on it and we are executing in an increasingly higher level. But these are big complex implementations and you have -- still have some work from home issues and other things that cause collaboration to be a little bit more difficult and stretch out some time lines. But I would say that we are optimistic that we are getting increasingly better, and then hopefully, those results will start showing up in our quarterly financials.\nAndrew Schmidt: Perfect. Thank you very much, Bill.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Hey. So again nice acceleration on the organic growth in 2023. Beyond Blue Prism, is there any way to disaggregate kind of the components that get to the 2% to 6% in terms of some of that Blue Prism, some of that’s pricing, some of its retention, is there any way to maybe just ring fence those numbers a little bit?\nBill Stone: Well, I think we have talked about it. I think you got to allocate it probably to four buckets and you can put 1% to 2% to 3% in each one of the buckets. But I think it is price increases, it’s new business sold, it’s clearing the backlog and its new products and services that we are bringing to the market. So we are saying 2% to 6% and we would love to guide you to just 6%, but we want to be cautiously optimistic. And there’s still a lot of things happening in the world, whether it’s the war in Ukraine, it’s inflation in the United States, it’s labor issues here in the United States, there’s weakness in Europe and in the U.K. and so you heard a lot of things and we are trying to give you as much color as we can without trying to act like we have a crystal ball because we do not.\nKevin McVeigh: That’s helpful, Bill. And then maybe just -- it sounds like Blue Prism, you exited 2022 at 20% EBITDA, any sense of how that should scale over the course of 2023?\nBill Stone: I think we have said over the last year that we would expect Blue Prism to increase their margins in the 500 basis points to 1,000 basis points in 2023. And I will ask Rahul to add more color than that…\nRahul Kanwar: Yeah. Yeah.\nBill Stone: …but I think that’s right.\nRahul Kanwar: No. I agree with that, Bill. I think the goal for us at the end of 2023 would be to exit about a 30% margin. So that’s the, obviously, the upper end of what Bill just said.\nKevin McVeigh: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist Securities.\nTerry Tillman: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I guess the first one, Patrick, for you in terms of, I was trying to write this information on -- at a fast pace, but I may have missed some of it. The 3.7% organic growth for Financial Services, was that 4Q or the full year?\nPatrick Pedonti: I think that was a full year.\nTerry Tillman: Could you tell me, Patrick, or give me a sense how it was in 4Q?\nPatrick Pedonti: I have so -- I’d have to look it up. Let me look it up if you have got another question.\nTerry Tillman: I do. Okay. Thanks for that. Hey, Bill. Nice to talk to you again. I was curious about the private credit opportunity. You all called that out in the prepared remarks. Is there anything you could share with us in terms of important technology milestones in 2023 and what about selling? And could this start to become a monetizable setting in a meaningful way in 2023 and just what’s that market like…\nBill Stone: Yeah.\nTerry Tillman: … from just a size or a scale perspective?\nBill Stone: Well, welcome back, Terry, we haven’t heard from you in a while.\nTerry Tillman: Thank you.\nBill Stone: Welcome the Truist. And I would just say that, private credit is really -- you look around the world and you have companies like Apollo that has $550 billion under management and they also own the fee with another $330 billion. And you know the other large scale private equity firms and the deal is getting done like the -- I think the recent deal out of Emerson Electric or somebody where Blackstone did completely private spin out of a big division and I just think the private markets are becoming to rival the public market. So there’s a lot of stuff that we have done and Rahul talked about it in his remarks about signing a bunch of our pieces of technology together and really distancing ourselves from our competitors with what our capabilities are. And I think that’s why you see that growing as nicely as it is and I think that there’s a number of funds better pivoting towards private credit and other private fund type investments, and I think, that’s going to continue. Does that help.\nTerry Tillman: Yeah. Got it. And maybe just one more -- yeah. It did. I had Patrick off on a goose chase.\nPatrick Pedonti: I got the number for you, Terry. So the number for…\nTerry Tillman: Okay.\nPatrick Pedonti: …Q4 for the Financial Services, excluding Healthcare, organic growth of 1.3%.\nTerry Tillman: Wonderful. Okay. Thank you all very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you so much. You guys -- Bill you mentioned that you are seeing -- you want to be acquisitive and you are seeing some dislocations in the fintech space. I am wondering if you can talk about a little how you are thinking about potential structure of those deals financially, especially since the cost of capital now is obviously higher than has been at least pre-pandemic, et cetera. Just wondering if that changes the way that you have to approach those deals, what kind of companies you can look for and what would be a targeted structure for you there?\nBill Stone: Yeah. I think I -- I think that there’s still money to be had out there and I don’t think that you have to get to cute with the structures and we like to have a capital structure that is pretty easy to understand. And we have operated under quite a bit higher interest rates than what we are seeing today, even though interest rates today are quite a bit higher than they have been for the last five years to 10 years. And so I don’t think that we would structure them very different. We might have a partner or we might have a large scale private fund or large scale pension be a big supplier of credit to us or even some equity. We give it at the right price, which was not…\nJames Faucette: Got it.\nBill Stone: … where we are now.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Okay. That’s really helpful. And then you mentioned that you felt like you were taking some share in the hedge fund space. Is this as, and I guess, kind of what I am looking at is one of your primary competitors, at least in the hedge fund launches has been going through some management transitions. How much of an opportunity is that presented and has that been chance for Eze Eclipse to grab some share in business?\nBill Stone: Well, we think we have very stuck pipelines. The question is, is obviously closing them, and as you well know, right, when the markets are as choppy as they have been for the last couple of quarters, you don’t have nearly as many fund launches as you have had in the past. So we are cautiously optimistic that we can ramp our Eclipse product and then also tie in even with our fund administration capabilities. And so, yeah, we are optimistic about that, and yeah, that’s just one other fintech company that has a few challenges.\nJames Faucette: Great. Hey. I appreciate that color, Bill. Thanks.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Stone.\nBill Stone: Yeah. We really appreciate everybody getting on the call today. I would like to recommend that you recognize that the $518 million in adjusted EBITDA is the third largest in our history, which is 36 years. So we are pretty proud of that, we think we are doing the right things, we are thinking that we are keeping our nose the grindstone and getting stuff done, and I appreciate people that work with us and make things happen. And we are optimistic that when we talk to you at the end of Q1 that hopefully we have a positive story to tell. Thanks again.\nOperator: This concludes today’s call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Justine, and thanks everyone for joining. Our results for the fourth quarter of $1.339 million in adjusted revenue, up 3.3% and our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.16, down 4 -- 9.4%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $518.6 million, third highest in our history, and our EBITDA margin was 38.7%. Our fourth quarter adjusted organic revenue was flat in line with our expectations. For the year, total organic growth was 2%, while our Financial Services organic growth, which is 94% of our revenue was 3.7%. 2022 was a challenging operating environment for SS&C, but we are pleased that with the revenue performance from our software businesses, including Advent, Investment and Institutional Management and as -- and the resiliency of our Alternative Fund Administration and Intralinks business. In 2022, SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $1.134 billion, including $67 million in deal related expenses. We paid down $166 million in debt in Q4, bringing our consolidated net leverage ratio to 3.4 times and our net secured leverage ratio to 2.4 times, sorry, 2.4 times consolidated EBITDA. This past January, as we were in our quarterly blackout three of our stock buybacks, we paid down debt an additional $101 million. In Q4, we bought back 1.8 million shares from $90.7 million at an average price of $50.14. For the year, we had stock buybacks of $476 million, for purchases of 7.8 million shares at an average price of $61.01. We will continue to allocate about 50% of our cash flow to stock buybacks and about 50% to debt pay down. In December, we acquired Complete Financial Ops, a specialized Colorado-based fund administrator that focuses on private equity and family offices. CFO Fund Services will augment SS&C's capabilities in servicing venture capital and family office funds and CFO clients will enjoy the same outstanding service backed by SS&C size, scale and comprehensive solutions. We remain methodically opportunistic in our acquisition strategy, valuations have come down more in line with our disciplined strategy and we are evaluating several opportunities. We remain very bullish on our Blue Prism acquisition and we are wrapping our digital workers deployment throughout our business. I will now turn it over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Patrick. 2023's improved operating environment will present more of our growth opportunities for SS&C. We look forward to capitalizing on these opportunities and delivering superior results to our shareholders. I will now open it up to questions. Yeah. We expect on average conservatively that a digital worker will probably save us $50,000 per digital worker deployed. We are not replacing personnel on a one-for-one basis with digital workers. What we are doing is allowing ourselves to hire less and get more productivity through the deployment of digital workers and then also perhaps not to have -- to hire for some of the attrition. So we look at this as a win-win for our employees, the digital worker tends to take over repetitive tasks, which gives our employees a more interesting job. And then it also is obviously a cost savings and efficiency process for us and we would hope to deploy, I believe, somewhere around 1,500 to -- I think, 1,350 to 2,700 digital workers in 2023. I think I guess what it implies, and I think, obviously, we have to manage and we are subject to every other just as every other company depending on what inflation is and what's happening in the labor markets. But other than that, the productivity we expect out of the deployment of digital workers should offset some of the expenses that we would paid for higher salaries and other expenses. Yeah. We see a number of dislocations in the fintech space. So there's going to be opportunities both large and small. And as always, SS&C is a disciplined acquirer, we are also somewhat of a reasonably voracious acquirer when prices are in our disciplined strategy and that's not 10 times revenue. So we think that the market is moving to where we are, we think that we have lots of productivity opportunities and we think we will be a good home for different types of ops companies we could acquire. Yeah. I think we will have had Blue Prism for a year in the middle of March and we are rapidly deploying digital workers. But the ramp up will be obviously higher as each quarter goes and the savings that we will incur will be heavily weighted probably to Q3 and Q4, just as the use of those digital workers will be full time in those quarters and less so as much in Q1. Yeah. Well, again, I think, we have -- go ahead, Patrick. Well, we send a lot of things in health... ...in Healthcare and I think that we have a lot of opportunity. The question is, obviously, is you have to hit those Healthcare systems on renewal dates. So we are cautiously optimistic that Domani is progressing well and we have some talented people working on that and I think that there is not gigantic optimism for 2023, but we think there's a pretty good ramp we can get to in 2024. Rahul, you want to take that? But I think Healthcare runs in the high 20s and the rest of the business is running in the high 30s. Is that about right, Rahul? So and it's about -- I guess about $280 million, $90 million business. So it's still a substantial business with substantial opportunity and I just think it's execution and attention, and I think we are putting execution and attention into that space. Yeah. A number of them we think are in the first quarter at the end, I think, primarily in March. Then we have a number of other ones that we would expect to be in the second quarter, and then hopefully, we will be able to with everything that started off and had been signed and closed in 2022 that we would be able to pretty much have them live by the end of the third quarter. So there's still substantial amount of sold revenue that we have not recognized yet. And I don't know, Rahul, if you have any more comment on that. Well, I think, Pete, that's right on, right? I mean it's -- I think there's people that need to get efficiency. As Rahul said earlier, there's an awful lot of opportunities in middle office and I think there's a lot of pressure on our customers to get more efficient. And I think they are finding that maintaining software systems and large staffs of operations and accounting people is not necessarily their core competencies and that's really our opportunity. And we think we are taking advantage of it and we believe we have the best sales force and that they are executing at a pretty high level. Yeah. We have been implementing price increases over the last couple of years and that's beginning to bring fruition to us and we would hope that those price increases start to approach 2% overall for the whole business and so that gives us some confidence and some lift. And we continue to bring out new systems and new services and successful new products like Aloha and Singularity and GoCentral are all positive things that drive the business forward and packages of products of ours that we sell like our trust system, combined with our wealth management product Diamond has been pretty effective and we think it will continue to be.

Adjusted revenues were $1.391 billion. Adjusted revenue was up 3.3% and adjusted operating income decreased 1.1% and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.16, a 9.4% decrease from Q4 2021. Overall, adjusted revenue increased $42.9 million or 3.3% from Q4 2021. Our acquisitions contributed $72.5 million. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $28.7 million or 2.2% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue was flat on a constant currency basis. We had strength in several product lines, including Alternatives, Institutional and Investment Management and the Intralinks business. That strength was impacted by weakness in our GIDS transfer agency business and Healthcare businesses. Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $502.1 million, a decrease of $5.4 million or 1.1% from Q4 2021. Adjusted operating margins were 37.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $39.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding acquisitions, expenses increased 2.6% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $56.7 million in expenses and foreign currency decreased cost by $27.9 million. Our cost structure has been impacted by wage inflation and higher staffing to support our business. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA defined in note three of our earnings release, was $518.6 million or 38.7% of adjusted revenue, a decrease of $4.3 million or 0.8% from Q4 2021. Net interest expense for the quarter was $104.9 million and includes $3.7 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter for our amended credit facility including the senior notes was 5.64%, compared to 3.09% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income was $296.6 million and adjusted EPS of $1.16, and the effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares decreased to $256.4 million from $260.9 million in Q3. Share repurchases and the lower average stock price during the quarter led to the decrease. Fourth quarter -- in the fourth quarter of 2022, we reported GAAP fair value, unrealized gains totaling $68.8 million for investments we made in 2020 and 2021. These gains are excluded from our adjusted financial results. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $440 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $7.1 billion of gross debt. SS&C net debt, which excludes the cash of $134 million at DomaniRx was $6.8 billion as of December 31st. Operating cash flow for the 12 months ended December 2022 was $1.134 billion. It includes the impact of $67 million of Blue Prism post-acquisition transaction costs. Adjusted for the transaction costs, cash flow was $1.21 billion or a decrease of $227 million or 15.9% compared to 2021. Cash flow was impacted by higher interest rates, lower EBITDA, and an increase in receivables, DSO. During the three months ended December 31st, we paid down $166 million of debt and purchased $90.7 million of stock buyback. Highlights for 12 months on the cash flow, we paid $1.36 billion for acquisitions, including Blue Prism, Hubwise, MineralWare, O'Shares and Tier1 and Complete Financial Ops net of cash acquired. Treasury stock buybacks totaled $476 million. We purchase a 7.8 million shares at an average price of $61.01, compared to $487.9 million of treasury stock buyback in 2021. In July, the Board authorized the new stock purchase program up to $1 billion. Program to-date, stock buybacks totaled $305 million for purchases of 5.5 million shares at an average price of $55.78. For the year, we declared and paid dividends of $203 million, compared to $174 million last year, an increase of 16.7%. In 2022, we paid interest of $298 million, compared to $192.5 million in 2021. Income taxes paid this year totaled $281 million, compared to $310 million in 2021. Our accounts receivable DSO was 52.3 days as of December 2022 and that compares to $51.8 million as of September 2022 and 49.5% as of December 2021. Capital expenditures and capitalized software totaled $208 million or 3.9% of adjusted revenue, compared to approximately $137 million in 2021. The spending is predominantly for capitalized software and IT infrastructure. Our LTM consolidated EBITDA, which we use for covenant compliance was $2.010 billion as of December 2022. And based on the net debt of $6.8 billion, our total leverage was 3.4 times and our secured leverage was 2.4 times as of December 31st. On outlook for 2023, I will cover a few assumptions first. We will continue to focus on client services, and we expect our retention rates to continue a range of most recent results. We have assumed foreign currency exchange at the year end 2022 levels. As a result, adjusted organic growth for the year will be between 2% and 6%, and adjusted organic growth for Q1 will be in the range of negative 0.5% and to positive 2.5%. We have assumed interest rates will average approximately 6.35% for the year for our credit facility and senior notes. We expect staff productivity to improve by approximately 5% and we will manage expenses during this period by controlling variable costs to improve our operating margins in the rate of 50 basis points to 150 basis points compared to 2022. We will continue investing in our business long-term in the areas of capital expenditures, product development and sales and marketing. And we will continue allocating free cash flow to both to pay down debt and buy back stock and we have assumed that the tax rate will be approximately 26%. So for the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.332 billion to $1.372 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $282 million to $299 million and diluted shares in the range of $156 million to $157 million. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $5.45 billion $5.655 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $1.190 billion to $1.285 billion and diluted shares in the range of $455 million to $258.5 million. And for the full year, we expect cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.375 billion. Now I will turn it over to Bill for final comments. That's correct. Well, just to answer a few of your questions. I think, Blue Prism turns organic in mid-March, right, of 2023. But if you calculate the revenue growth this past year organically, I think, they have averaged in the mid-teens, maybe a little bit higher and they were about 13% in Q4 and we expect them to be around mid-teens in 2023. I think the -- on the Healthcare side, there will be a little bit of reduction in the revenue reduce. So I think they were down about 20% in 2022 and might be down about 10% in 2023, especially in the first half of the year with the comparables. I think there... I think that was a full year. I have so -- I'd have to look it up. Let me look it up if you have got another question. I got the number for you, Terry. So the number for... ...Q4 for the Financial Services, excluding Healthcare, organic growth of 1.3%."

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Q4 results demonstrate the strength of our business amidst a challenging operating environment and highlight our ability to drive margins despite inflationary pressures. We exited 2022 with 38.7% EBITDA margin, up 330 basis points from the low point in Q2. Cost controls, facilities reduction and productivity improvements enabled this quick turnaround. While labor markets remain volatile, we believe Blue Prism's intelligent automation technology will be an important means to harnessing the productivity of our workforce in 2023 and beyond. As a business unit, Blue Prism continues to grow nicely and exited 2022 with 20% EBITDA margins. We continue to see opportunity in the private credit market, where we are investing in a highly scalable offering combining the strengths of Advent Software products and GlobeOp Services capabilities. A key component will be the build-out of a robust data platform that integrates multiple SS&C technologies, including Geneva, TNR, Precision LM and others. Private credit represents the latest example of SS&C developing technology, expertise and services to address the needs of a very specialized and complex set of fund managers. This is a strategy we have employed effectively and repeatedly as we have built the world's largest alternatives administration business. I will mention some key deals for Q4. Three existing SS&C clients upgraded to our newest platform, Aloha. We currently have over 30 clients live on Aloha. A $13 billion asset manager partnered with SS&C for fund accounting and reporting functions on their real assets portfolio, this partnership includes lifting out 60 employees in Texas. One of DST's largest clients expanded their relationship to include more transfer agency operations. A Canadian alternative asset manager chose SS&C for a suite of private equity administration services, including regulatory reporting, treasury services and investor vision citing their need for Canadian and international expertise, as well as scale for future growth. A $75 billion hedge fund chose Geneva for its superior functionality around loan processing and accounting. A Hong Kong-based asset manager chose EMS/OMS as they needed greater asset class coverage, flexibility, third-party integration and compliance functionality. Mine Super managing $12 billion in assets on behalf of 55,000 members became SS&C's first Australian superannuation client. The partnership will deliver superior digital experiences for members, driving greater member engagement and stronger retirement outcomes. I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials. Sure. I actually think the hedge fund business is slightly positive. You are correct that it's not -- it's nowhere near the private markets growth. But we are probably assuming in 2023 and our plan, 2% to 3% growth in the hedge fund side of it and mid-teens or higher in the private markets and that's what kind of makes the sum of the two. I would say in commentary and specific on the hedge fund side is our sales performance continues to be strong. I think we have continued to see demand for middle office services and some of the additional modules and things that we have rolled out, including GoCentral. We are obviously not benefiting from a ton of inflows in hedge funds now. But as that turns around, we think we will be well positioned because we are taking market share, and in the meantime, the private markets and private credit businesses continue to become bigger parts of this, and so move the growth algorithm higher. That's about right, Bill. No. Bill, I think, that's exactly right. It's throughout the course of the year, some in Q1 and Q2, and we get pretty close to full towards the latter half of the year. Yeah. Yeah. No. I agree with that, Bill. I think the goal for us at the end of 2023 would be to exit about a 30% margin. So that's the, obviously, the upper end of what Bill just said."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SS&C Technologies Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Justine Stone, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nJustine Stone: Hi, everyone. Welcome, and thank you for joining us for our Q3 2022 earnings call. I’m Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C Technologies. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Pedonti, our Chief Financial Officer.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in today’s earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stone: Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone, for joining. Our results for the third quarter are $1.322 billion in adjusted revenue, up 4.4% and up 7.5% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.15, down 12.9%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $502 million for the quarter. Our EBITDA margin was 38%. Our third quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 1.6%, and we saw strong growth in our software businesses, including Advent, and Institutional and Investment Management as well as Private Markets, fund administration, and Retirement Solutions. Ex the impact of our health care business, our Q3 2022 organic growth in financial services, which is 94% of our revenue, was 3.3%. SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $764.6 million for the nine-months ended 9/30. We paid down $55.6 million in debt in Q3, and our consolidated net leverage ratio now stands at 3.51, and our net secured leverage ratio was 2.52 consolidated EBITDA. In Q3, we bought back 3.7 million shares for $214.5 million at an average price of $57.62. We have bought back 6 million shares to date in 2022. We are currently planning on allocating 50% of our cash flow to stock buybacks and 50% to debt paydown. In August, we closed a small acquisition, Tier1 Financial, and are now working to integrate with our existing customer relationship management offering. We will create one of the largest financial-services-focused CRM systems in the marketplace with capabilities that are applicable to nearly all of our 20,000 clients. We continue to see revenue headwinds from the weaker economic backdrop and negative foreign exchange. Impacts from the equity markets are seen in our hedge and ALPS businesses, and a slower M&A market has impacted our Intralinks business. Our assets under administration came in at $2.2 trillion, down from Q2 and flat year-to-date. This is compared to a $271 billion increase in AUA in 2021. However, we believe hiring and cost pressures on our client - that our clients face are catalysts to increased outsourcing. As firms globally continue their modernization efforts, we have unique opportunities to assist in staff augmentation, automation and record-keeping solutions. Our Q3 2022 EBITDA margin was 38%, and we are on track to exit 2022 at near our corporate average margins of 40%. We have already seen large successes implementing Blue Prism’s digital workers throughout our organization. We have, for instance, validated 1,200 monthly client statement using digital workers, replacing over 40 hours of manual checking. We expect to have over 100 digital workers deployed by the end of the year and over 10x this number in 2023. In an era of high labor costs, Blue Prism will prove to be a very smart acquisition. On a constant currency basis, Blue Prism grew revenue at 16% in Q3. Our clients and prospects remain engaged. At the beginning of October, SS&C posted our first Deliver client conference in Orlando, Florida since 2019. We hosted over 1,000 people, and feedback has been very positive. We look forward to next year’s SS&C Deliver in Austin, Texas. I will now turn the call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks, Bill. Our business continues to display resilience despite some impact from FX, primarily the British pound, reduced M&A deal volumes and volatility in the overall economic environment. Our plans to grow despite these issues are centered around new product launches, amplified sales and marketing campaigns, and continuing our focus on customer satisfaction and delivery. In our fund administration business, a significant growth initiative is to enhance the offering for hybrid and credit funds, leveraging the full software capabilities of Advent products in partnership with GlobeOp’s strong fund services capabilities. In Intralinks, we launched Deal Services, which enables our customers to stay focused on the execution of their M&A deals, while we take on labor-intensive tasks such as redaction as a service and reporting as a service. These offerings have already proven to be a differentiator for us, helping to drive recent wins. We saw strength in our software business this quarter. Aloha, our newest platform and institutional investment management, has had some early success. Eight new clients signed in Q3 to bring our total Aloha client base to 29 clients, about 1/3 of which are new logos to SS&C. In September, we appointed Bhagesh Malde to lead the consolidated SS&C GlobeOp business, including private markets, hedge and insurance outsourcing. We continue to see a convergence between hedge and private markets. Bhagesh has delivered strong revenue growth and built an excellent leadership team in our real assets and private markets business over the past five-years, and we are confident he will lead the combined GlobeOp business in the next phase of its growth. We are starting to gain traction with our rollout of Blue Prism internally and across our client base. Within our outsourcing and service businesses, we view Blue Prism as a significant competitive differentiator, as widespread applications that will generate accuracy and timeliness benefits for our client base and free up our talented staff to focus on higher level and analytical roles and accelerate their career growth. We are targeting having digital workers to be 5% to 10% of our overall employee base by the end of 2023. We expect a savings of approximately $50,000 annually for each such role that we migrate to Blue Prism. Now I will mention some key deals for Q3. A wealth manager with 260,000 accounts chose Black Diamond to offer best-in-class solution to their end clients and large employee base. An existing fund services client expanded their relationship with SS&C to include additional funds and loan servicing on their private book. A large real estate manager based in Singapore and New York chose SS&C’s middle-office capabilities due to our real estate expertise and global operating model. An existing PORTIA client upgraded to our new Aloha solution, noting the enhanced fixed income functionality. A large transfer agency client selected SS&C for their web modernization project. A large financial services group in Africa chose SS&C for its best-of-breed technology and BPO capabilities, including AWD, Percana policy administration and Blue Prism RPA. We are providing an end-to-end solution to administer a broad range of multi-asset, multi-region product types for their individual retail investors. I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials.\nPatrick Pedonti: Thank you. Results for the third quarter of 2022 were GAAP revenues of $1.321 billion, GAAP net income of $160 million and diluted GAAP EPS of $0.61. Revenues were $1.322 million. Adjusted revenue was up 4.4%. Adjusted operating income decreased 4.3%, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.15, a 12.9% decrease from Q3 2021. Overall, adjusted revenue increased $55.7 million or 4.4% over the third quarter of 2021. Our acquisitions contributed $68.2 million in revenue. Foreign exchange had unfavorable impact of $32.7 million or 2.6% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue increase on a constant currency basis was 1.6%. We had strength across several product lines, including alternatives, Advent, Institutional and Investment Management, and the Intralinks business. That strength was impacted by weakness in our GIDS transfer agency business and the health care business. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $486.1 million, a decrease of $38 million or 7.3% from Q3 2021. Adjusted operating margins were 36.8% in the third quarter compared to 41.1% in the third quarter of 2021. Expenses overall increased 9.2% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $53.1 million expenses, and foreign currency decreased costs by $27.6 million. Our cost structure has been impacted by wage inflation and higher staffing to support our business, but we have improved operating margins sequentially from 34.2% in the second quarter of 2021 to 36.8% in the third quarter as we managed our cost structure. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $501.7 million or 38% of adjusted revenue, a decrease of $30.9 million from Q2 2021. Interest expense for the third quarter of 2022 was $86 million and includes $3.7 million of noncash amortized financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter for our credit facility and the senior notes was 4.55% compared to 3.12% in the third quarter of 2021. The increase in the interest rates contributed an increase of $26.6 million in interest expense in the quarter, and the higher average debt balance related to the financing of the Blue Prism acquisition added $8.6 million in interest. Our recorded GAAP tax provision for the quarter was $53.4 million, 25% of pretax. Adjusted net income, which is defined in note 4, was $298.8 million and adjusted EPS was $1.15, and the effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares decreased to 260.9 million from 263.9 million in Q2. Share repurchases and lower average stock price during the quarter led to the decrease. On the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $401 million of cash and cash equivalents and $7.3 billion of gross debt. SS&C’s net debt defined per our credit agreement, which excludes the cash of $151.6 million held at DomaniRx, was $7 billion as of September 30. Operating cash flow for the nine-months ended September was $764.6 million, a $180.3 million or 19% decrease compared to the same period in 2021. Operating cash flows were impacted by transaction expenses associated with the Blue Prism acquisition of approximately $67 million, which includes amounts paid by Blue Prism in the post-acquisition period. In addition, it was impacted by the quarterly bonus that we initiated this year in Q3 of approximately $29 million. Interest paid in this period was $223.4 million compared to $173.2 million in the same period of 2021. In the nine-months, we paid $211.5 million in taxes compared to $230.8 million in 2021. Our accounts receivable DSO improved to 51.7 days from 55.9 days as of June 2022. On investing and financing cash flows, we have paid about $1.629 billion for acquisitions, including Blue Prism, Hubwise, MineralWare, O’Shares and Tier1; capital expenditures and capitalized software of $158 million or 4% of adjusted revenue. The spending was predominantly for capitalized software and IT infrastructure. In addition, we received a distribution of $66.2 million from 1 of our joint venture partners. During the 3 months ended September 30, we paid down net debt of $55.6 million, and we bought back in the quarter $214.5 million - we spent $214.5 million for 3.7 million shares at an average price of $57.62. And year-to-date, we have declared and paid a dividend of $153 million to our common stock shareholders as compared to $122.8 million last year, an increase of 19.9%. On outlook for the fourth quarter, on assumptions, we are continuing to focus on client service. We expect our retention - client retention rates to continue in the same range as most recent results. We have assumed foreign currency exchange at approximately the current levels, and that will result in a negative impact of approximately $37 million on revenue growth in the fourth quarter. On adjusted organic revenue growth for the year, we expect 1.6% to 4.6%. On adjusted organic growth for the fourth quarter, we expect to be in the range of minus 1.9% to positive 1.9%. On interest rates, we have assumed average rates of about 5.5% in the fourth quarter, and that compares to 4.55% we had in the third quarter of 2022. We will continue to manage expenses during this period by controlling variable expenses and maintaining, improving our operating margins. We expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 26% on an adjusted basis. So for the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $1.305 billion to $1.355 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $285.3 million to $307.5 million and diluted shares in the range of 255 million to 257 million. And for the full year, we expect cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.145 billion. And I will turn it over back to Bill for final comments.\nBill Stone: Thanks, Patrick. SS&C continues to be a highly profitable cash-generating enterprise. We continue to win large-scale world-renowned businesses, and we are constantly improving our processes. Sales development, marketing and management are all improving. We hope to show you with improved financial performance in upcoming quarters. I will now open it up to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt from Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I just want to start off with the fourth quarter organic growth assumptions. If you could just unpack that and perhaps break down the major assumptions by business, I think that would be helpful. And then I know it is a little bit early to talk about 2023, but it does sound like there is some optimistic commentary in terms of client engagement and pipeline, et cetera. Obviously, the macro remains uncertain, but just wondering if there is a framework that we can use to start thinking about 2023 based on what you see today.\nBill Stone: Well, I can get into some of the detail, and maybe Patrick and Rahul can comment after. But we expect that similar to Q3 that we will have some significant strength in our software businesses. We have brought out a number of new products. Rahul talked about Aloha. I think Singularity is up to about 60 clients. Geneva continues to be very strong. And we have a lot of software that we have built over the past year, and we are excited about some of those opportunities. So I think our technology offerings are going to be well received. And in the fund administration business, we continue to win large mandates. We have lots of opportunities. Obviously, the real revenue growth is when we get these clients live, so that will be in Q4, Q1, Q2. So I think fund administration businesses and services businesses, both in private markets as well as well as hedge funds, will also be pretty strong. And in insurance as well, we think that is got opportunities. So I think we have a lot of things that are moving in a positive direction. Obviously, the British pound is at historic lows, and we are not expecting it to have any giant rebounds or anything. But at the same time, it is probably good likelihood that it won’t stay at historic lows. And so interest rates are going to do what interest rates do, and we should have more than adequate cash flow to pay down a bunch of debt and buy back stock. So I don’t know if you have any comment, Rahul.\nRahul Kanwar: I think the only added thing I would have is that the underlying business or the fundamentals that we look at, whether it is how many deals we have in the pipeline or how many wins we have and our path to innovation and rollout of new products, all remain pretty strong. Clearly, the economic backdrop, the FX rates, M&A volumes, things like that are impacting us right now. And so 2023 - to your question on the framework for 2023, that will really just depend on how much that rebounds. But the things that we control, we actually feel are going reasonably well.\nAndrew Schmidt: Alright. Thank you Bill, thank you Rahul. I appreciate the comments.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open.\nAlexander Kramm: Just actually wanted to follow up on your comments you made about fund admin just now. Sounds like you are relatively bullish still. But if I look at the AUA over the last few quarters, I think you mentioned, in the prepared remarks, has been flat or even down, and you see the alternatives growth come down at the same time. If I just eyeball how those trends in AUA have been, it almost looks like the fund admin business could go negative in the fourth quarter. So just wondering where your positive commentary is coming from, if this is more of a 2023 outlook or if I’m missing something on the 4Q because, as I said, it seems like that business is decelerating right now given the market backdrop.\nBill Stone: Well, I think, Alex, that we are still doing pretty well with takeaways, and we are doing pretty well with starting major fund complexes. And we think some of that revenue will start flowing through in Q4 and all throughout 2023. And we would say, particularly in private credit and some other strategies, that it is quite strong. And we don’t see - I mean, hey, if the market falls net of 500 points or something or 5,000 points, okay. But other than that, I think that - I think they are talking about October being the best October in about 20-years in the equities markets. And those kinds of things give us some tailwind. Just like when they fall, it gives us some headwind. But I think we are pretty optimistic about our fund administration business, and we think that Rahul is a very - not Rahul, but Bhagesh is a very talented executive, and he’s already moving to streamline some of the stuff we do. And our sales force is really starting to sell bundles of our products and broad scale solutions. Rahul probably has a comment on that, too.\nRahul Kanwar: Yes. I think on the changes in AUA, just - we talk about frequently how that doesn’t exactly correlate to what we expect from revenue outlook. There is some impact, but it is weakly correlated, so point taken that AUA is not going up. But - and if you look at our historical range on fund administration growth, it is somewhere between 4% and 8%, 9%. And so when we have tough markets like this, we expect to be at the lower end of that range, but I wouldn’t expect us to get negative unless there was a dramatic change in macroeconomic outlook.\nAlexander Kramm: Okay. No, that is great. And then just quickly as a follow-up, I think on previous calls, you have talked about how the labor market has driven some implementation challenges. I think it was primarily on DST. So just maybe an update how - if those are gone through, if it is easier to implement or if there is still challenges, I guess the question is what is the backlog like. And is that going to help DST or other businesses where that is been an impact?\nBill Stone: Alex, that is a great question. And we have a very large backlog of sold businesses that we are in the midst of implementations. And just, for instance, 1 client that pays us up several hundred thousand dollars a month. But when they go live, which we hope happens in the next five or six months, that moves from several hundred thousand to several million. So you can imagine that we are pretty focused. But we can be as focused as we want to be, but we really have to get these clients live and get into a steady state of them using our products and services on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis. And I think we are quite focused on that.\nAlexander Kramm: Sorry, but has it been improving or still some challenges?\nBill Stone: It is improving, but it is never improving fast enough if you know what I mean. So the rapidity is the key. And I would say we are getting better. And I would say we need to get better faster. So I think that that is - but these are very large organizations. It is complex implementations, and you are doing it while they are still operating. Sometimes, they are operating. Sometimes, they are doing acquisitions. Sometimes, they are doing divestitures. And all of that adds to the complexity of these implementations. And - but we think we have a great team. We think we have great opportunities. It is execution.\nAlexander Kramm: Fair enough. Thanks again guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nPeter Heckmann: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you give us today an update on the development work on DomaniRx? And how are you feeling about the timetable for the first quarter conversion?\nBill Stone: Well, I think that DomaniRx remains a very large system. And we are trying to make sure that we are really aligning our deliveries around the times when these large health plans and - are making decisions on new providers. So that is a work in process, but we are certainly focused on DomaniRx. Rahul, do you have a deeper comment?\nRahul Kanwar: Bill, I don’t. I think that is right.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. And then just on the kind of the legacy SS&C investment management software that - I think you said it was up 16%. Now I guess I would assume that most of that business is coming on at subscription. But were there some larger licenses in there that would have affected that number?\nBill Stone: Yes. We sold a few on-prem, good-sized licenses. And even sometimes the - even though we may host it, they may still do all the work. So it is not a business process outsourcing service. So yes, we sold and we have a refreshed group of technology that we think has some link to the - to its acceptance in the market. So we are doing quite well against our competitors, and we believe that will continue.\nPeter Heckmann: Alright, that is helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt from William Blair. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Schmitt: Hi good afternoon everyone. This just seems like the type of environment where you can really kind of push through pricing increases that you couldn’t typically get. What type of pricing increases are you getting in the fund administration business? And are there other businesses where you are getting sort of material increases relative to historic levels?\nBill Stone: I think we have had a program to get some price increases, and that is worked pretty well. And I think it is - the price increases are more substantial than they have been over the last probably even five-years as, obviously, inflation has gone up and people recognize that they want to keep the same team. We have very talented people, and they want to keep the same team. So the conversation, while no one likes to have their prices increased, they understand that to keep these talented people and continue to deliver service at a very high level, there is going to be some price increases. And we have had, I would say, pretty good success with that.\nJeffrey Schmitt: Okay. And then on the EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter, I think you said it was 260 basis points from the prior quarter. You pointed out a couple of drivers of that, utilizing Blue Prism, reducing the real estate footprint. How much did they drive that increase? I mean could we get sort of the components of that?\nBill Stone: Right. I think what we said was 260 basis points. And I would say that the management of the variable expenses was probably 100 to 120 of those 260 basis points. And probably, the real estate footprint maybe another - what do you think, Patrick, 40, 50 basis points maybe?\nPatrickPedonti: Yes. Probably around $5 million in the quarter, $5 million to $7 million.\nBill Stone: And then there is a variety of other things that we have done about - we buy lots of services from lots of different people, and we have gotten some help with more volume but at a less rate. I think those are the major components.\nPatrick Pedonti: And I think also, Blue Prism operating margins improved in the quarter.\nJeffrey Schmitt: Okay. How big of an impact was that? Or is it still small at this point?\nPatrick Pedonti: I think they were up over 10% operating margin, so it was pretty significant in the quarter sequentially.\nJeffrey Schmitt: That is great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks so much. I don’t know if this would be for Bill or Rahul. But any sense of - given some of the volatility, any changes in the competitive dynamics of the business and I wonder if you could give us just an update on kind of Blue Prism in terms of go to market, how that is been helping from a competitive perspective.\nBill Stone: Well, I think competitively, we believe we are in a very strong position, and we continue to have takeaways. We continue to have outreach from the industry coming to us. And we think that that is going to continue. The breadth and depth of our offering, we believe, is unmatched. So we think that that is a very strong position to be in. And then the addition of Blue Prism has really been a demonstrable way that people can use digital workers for things like statement verification, reconciliation and a whole host of other things. And as Rahul said, it is - we hope we come out of 2023 with between 5% and 10% of our workforce being digital workers. And I think that that is a significant number of people.\nKevin McVeigh: And then just following up on that, is that helping, Bill, internally in terms of managing some of the cost pressure that you saw earlier in the year? We have seen a little bit of benefit from Blue Prism and then the environment overall. Is that starting to help on the cost side in terms of - it just feels like labor is maybe not as tight as it was earlier this year. Is that fair?\nBill Stone: I think it is fair. It is still tight, though and it is going to be a while before labor is not in an ascendancy. I think that in most of the people’s businesses that are on this call, there is pressures on various - whether it is investment banking fees or other types of fees that - and you see that happening where there are significant cuts around large-scale financial institutions. And that generally puts more talented labor in the workforce. And we are getting a lot of great resumes. And our ability to really deploy Blue Prism is something that allows us to put people into higher level analytical positions that give them career paths that are, we think, pretty exciting.\nKevin McVeigh: Very helpful. Thanks Bill.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: I want to go back to Jeff’s question on pricing, et cetera. I think you have mentioned that as a function of your pricing review, you have enabled more automatic escalators, at least in more contracts. And I guess recognizing that those are mainly in the licensing business, is that comment really directed at new customer signings or have you been able to go further and include some of those escalators in contracts that don’t - that didn’t previously have them? And should that ultimately result in more consistent pricing changes in future periods?\nBill Stone: Rahul, maybe you can get a few [Technical Difficulty].\nRahul Kanwar: Sure. Yes. So I think it is both, where we are obviously making that a standard in new customer contracts. But as part of the conversation with current customers that did not have escalators in their contract, we are both agreeing to updated price levels at the present and also sort of having this regimen of CPI or something indexed to a cost of living type adjustment built into the contract. And that also has - to Bill’s point, nobody really wants to talk about these things, but they understand where we are coming from. And so that is gone reasonably well. And it does make for, as you point out, a more automatic and consistent process going forward.\nJames Faucette: And I guess just as a quick follow-up, and then I will pose my second question as - at the same time. But does that mean that - like we should start to see some of that benefit in future periods or is it still too nascent to think about that impacting next year, is kind of the follow-up there. And then my second question was just on the - we always ask about M&A environment. You guys historically have done a great job adding value and - through acquisitions. And we have started to see some of the venture capital funding amounts come down. So I’m just wondering if you are seeing some falling and incremental opportunities there yet.\nBill Stone: Well, I think the M&A market is active. I think there is - you are seeing some major software deals being announced over the last few weeks, and - but prices are still pretty firm. And I think that the clearing call for organic growth is something that we have put a lot of focus on and have a lot of new products and services that we think will drive significant revenue for us. And then the same thing with the pricing. I think that stuff builds, and I think it will continue to build throughout 2023. And hopefully, we would be able to point to specifics of several percentage increases in the overall revenue streams on different services and products that are - that is caused by price increases.\nJames Faucette: That is great context, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick O’Shaughnessy from Raymond James.\nPatrick O’Shaughnessy: Hey good afternoon. So by my math, your full year organic constant currency revenue growth outlook moved about 10 basis points lower versus last quarter’s guidance. If I have that right, does that then imply that most of the revision lower to the full year revenue and EPS guide was just a function of FX?\nBill Stone: I think we think that is a yes.\nPatrick Pedonti: There is some FX impact, but I think the midpoint of our full year revenue guide is about 2% right now. And I think at the end of the third quarter, we were at about 3.2%. Some of that is organic reduction. And probably, I would say maybe $20 million is FX from some of the guidance we gave at the end of the second quarter.\nPatrick O’Shaughnessy: Okay. I thought I heard earlier on the call, you said the range for the full year organic constant currency was 1.6% to 4.6%. Did I mishear that?\nPatrick Pedonti: Yes, I think so. I think the midpoint is around 2%.\nPatrick O’Shaughnessy: Okay. And I can go back to the transcript after the call and look up what you said earlier. And then I guess maybe a question about capital allocation. Bill, you touched on - clearly, the focus is on organic growth. But also just from an accretion standpoint given where the share price is, repurchases are pretty accretive given where interest rates are. Debt reduction is pretty accretive. Does that kind of change your thinking versus M&A relative to where maybe you have kind of been thinking historically?\nBill Stone: Obviously, Patrick, you understand that process probably as well as anybody. And that is way more art than it is science. Particularly when interest rates are going up and we view our stock as undervalued, you get kind of a - anything you do is pretty positive. But interest rates at 5.5% compared to stock price at $50, the stock price at $50 is quite a bit financially better. But we still like acquisitions. We like the talent we get. We like the ability to drive margins up. We like to get the new technology, the new services, the talent. And so I don’t think that the overall philosophy is much different. It is just that the magnitude that you can do and the impact - as you said, both are accretive, but share buybacks are quite a bit more, I think, than debt paydown. But people would prefer we drive our leverage ratio to below 3, and that is something that we are focused on. And I think, again, we moved our EBITDA margins up, I think, 260 basis points. And people wondered if our margins were permanently back based on Q2. And our view is that we have a lot of levers in this business. Blue Prism, even what Rahul said, is 5% to 10% of our workers. Now you calculate those numbers out, and you are talking about tens of millions. And so we are - and we are trying to be conservative. So I think there is a lot of opportunity for us. And even with our 38% margin, which we would like it to be higher, it still stacks up pretty well against most of our competitors.\nPatrick O’Shaughnessy: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon from Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nKyle Peterson: Good evening guys. It is actually Kyle Peterson on for Mayank. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess to kind of frame the 2023 question another way, it seems like you guys are pretty confident on - in the margin trajectory. So thinking about next year, like is there any reason that with Blue Prism integrated, that you guys can’t get back to kind of historical EBITDA margins that you guys have operated, like outside of like a black swan event or anything like that?\nBill Stone: Yes, we think better.\nKyle Peterson: Okay. I like to hear that. So yes, just a follow-up, just I know - at least some of your past acquisitions, you guys have sometimes come across some noncore assets that might not have perfectly fit with your portfolio. Are there anything left on the balance sheet from - whether it is Blue Prism or anything else that you guys might be able to monetize and use to either pay down debt or buy back your own stock at these levels?\nBill Stone: We got a few buildings for sale if you are interested. And we have some other assets on our balance sheet.\nKyle Peterson: Well, I will contact my broker. Maybe we can work something out.\nBill Stone: We have several cities. Yes. And we have some other assets on our balance sheet that - but nothing particularly significant that is going to make $100 million or anything like that.\nKyle Peterson: Okay, understood. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Can you maybe dig a little bit deeper into the trends within DST Financial Services?\nBill Stone: Yes. I think that DST Financial Services, particularly that we have a pretty big U.K. business, and so a lot of the headwinds in the - with the British pound and...\nSurinder Thind: The targets.\nBill Stone: Are we still talking about DST Financial Services?\nSurinder Thind: Yes.\nBill Stone: Yes. So a large component of that business is in the U.K. And I think that we still have lots of opportunities there. We have spent a lot of money, and we think we have improved our products and our service levels. But I think it is still a competitive business, and I think that we have a chance to continue to improve that business. And I think we have a stronger sales force in there and that we are doing some smart things. And I think we will continue to do that. Rahul, do you have anything else to add to that?\nRahul Kanwar: Well, the other components of DST Financial Services, the retirement business, we have been, for the last 12 or so months, working on a couple of big customers that were getting much closer to that go-live situation, and we expect to see growth in those businesses as a result. Brokerage remains pretty strong. And we are encouraged by the fact that we are seeing more and more deals coming out of DST Financial Services that are sort of cross-sell enterprise-type deals, where we are selling multiple of our products and services, including Advent and fund services and other things, which is really what we had hoped would happen. And so there is a lot of positive despite kind of some macro trends.\nSurinder Thind: Understood. And then in terms of just a follow-up, maybe any additional color in terms of just - you have talked about digital workers maybe getting to 5% to 10%, potentially 50,000 in savings for each digital worker. Now are you thinking about that in terms of reinventing existing processes? Is it primarily intended to be savings from future workers? Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics? Obviously, you have kind of given some idea of where 2023 might end up but just what the longer-term outlook for that might be.\nBill Stone: Well, I think if you go back to the rationale of why we bought Blue Prism is we believe we have the strongest group of experts in the industry. And it is the functional experts married to the high-powered technology and technologists in Blue Prism that allows us to build smarter and smarter digital workers that can do increasingly sophisticated work. That is why you have the optimism that you hear here. We do literally thousands and thousands of reconciliations and hundreds of thousands of limited partner statements and other things that are - can be quite manually intensive. And the more that we can build expert digital workers to take an awful lot of that tedious and time-consuming work off of our workforce, the more we can get increasingly better and drive margin because we don’t have to have as many people in that - in those kinds of roles.\nSurinder Thind: That is helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Bill Stone, I turn the call back over to you.\nBill Stone: Again, we appreciate everybody being on here. And obviously, we prefer to grow and - but we also did smart things, I think, about protecting our workforce, making sure that we are extremely competitive on talent acquisition and talent retention as well as client acquisition and client retention. So we are going to focus on that, and we are going to deliver on that. And we think that will play well for everybody. So thanks again, and we look forward to talking to you after the end of the year. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone, for joining. Our results for the third quarter are $1.322 billion in adjusted revenue, up 4.4% and up 7.5% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.15, down 12.9%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $502 million for the quarter. Our EBITDA margin was 38%. Our third quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 1.6%, and we saw strong growth in our software businesses, including Advent, and Institutional and Investment Management as well as Private Markets, fund administration, and Retirement Solutions. Ex the impact of our health care business, our Q3 2022 organic growth in financial services, which is 94% of our revenue, was 3.3%. SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $764.6 million for the nine-months ended 9/30. We paid down $55.6 million in debt in Q3, and our consolidated net leverage ratio now stands at 3.51, and our net secured leverage ratio was 2.52 consolidated EBITDA. In Q3, we bought back 3.7 million shares for $214.5 million at an average price of $57.62. We have bought back 6 million shares to date in 2022. We are currently planning on allocating 50% of our cash flow to stock buybacks and 50% to debt paydown. In August, we closed a small acquisition, Tier1 Financial, and are now working to integrate with our existing customer relationship management offering. We will create one of the largest financial-services-focused CRM systems in the marketplace with capabilities that are applicable to nearly all of our 20,000 clients. We continue to see revenue headwinds from the weaker economic backdrop and negative foreign exchange. Impacts from the equity markets are seen in our hedge and ALPS businesses, and a slower M&A market has impacted our Intralinks business. Our assets under administration came in at $2.2 trillion, down from Q2 and flat year-to-date. This is compared to a $271 billion increase in AUA in 2021. However, we believe hiring and cost pressures on our client - that our clients face are catalysts to increased outsourcing. As firms globally continue their modernization efforts, we have unique opportunities to assist in staff augmentation, automation and record-keeping solutions. Our Q3 2022 EBITDA margin was 38%, and we are on track to exit 2022 at near our corporate average margins of 40%. We have already seen large successes implementing Blue Prism's digital workers throughout our organization. We have, for instance, validated 1,200 monthly client statement using digital workers, replacing over 40 hours of manual checking. We expect to have over 100 digital workers deployed by the end of the year and over 10x this number in 2023. In an era of high labor costs, Blue Prism will prove to be a very smart acquisition. On a constant currency basis, Blue Prism grew revenue at 16% in Q3. Our clients and prospects remain engaged. At the beginning of October, SS&C posted our first Deliver client conference in Orlando, Florida since 2019. We hosted over 1,000 people, and feedback has been very positive. We look forward to next year's SS&C Deliver in Austin, Texas. I will now turn the call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Patrick. SS&C continues to be a highly profitable cash-generating enterprise. We continue to win large-scale world-renowned businesses, and we are constantly improving our processes. Sales development, marketing and management are all improving. We hope to show you with improved financial performance in upcoming quarters. I will now open it up to questions. Well, I can get into some of the detail, and maybe Patrick and Rahul can comment after. But we expect that similar to Q3 that we will have some significant strength in our software businesses. We have brought out a number of new products. Rahul talked about Aloha. I think Singularity is up to about 60 clients. Geneva continues to be very strong. And we have a lot of software that we have built over the past year, and we are excited about some of those opportunities. So I think our technology offerings are going to be well received. And in the fund administration business, we continue to win large mandates. We have lots of opportunities. Obviously, the real revenue growth is when we get these clients live, so that will be in Q4, Q1, Q2. So I think fund administration businesses and services businesses, both in private markets as well as well as hedge funds, will also be pretty strong. And in insurance as well, we think that is got opportunities. So I think we have a lot of things that are moving in a positive direction. Obviously, the British pound is at historic lows, and we are not expecting it to have any giant rebounds or anything. But at the same time, it is probably good likelihood that it won't stay at historic lows. And so interest rates are going to do what interest rates do, and we should have more than adequate cash flow to pay down a bunch of debt and buy back stock. So I don't know if you have any comment, Rahul. Well, I think, Alex, that we are still doing pretty well with takeaways, and we are doing pretty well with starting major fund complexes. And we think some of that revenue will start flowing through in Q4 and all throughout 2023. And we would say, particularly in private credit and some other strategies, that it is quite strong. And we don't see - I mean, hey, if the market falls net of 500 points or something or 5,000 points, okay. But other than that, I think that - I think they are talking about October being the best October in about 20-years in the equities markets. And those kinds of things give us some tailwind. Just like when they fall, it gives us some headwind. But I think we are pretty optimistic about our fund administration business, and we think that Rahul is a very - not Rahul, but Bhagesh is a very talented executive, and he's already moving to streamline some of the stuff we do. And our sales force is really starting to sell bundles of our products and broad scale solutions. Rahul probably has a comment on that, too. Alex, that is a great question. And we have a very large backlog of sold businesses that we are in the midst of implementations. And just, for instance, 1 client that pays us up several hundred thousand dollars a month. But when they go live, which we hope happens in the next five or six months, that moves from several hundred thousand to several million. So you can imagine that we are pretty focused. But we can be as focused as we want to be, but we really have to get these clients live and get into a steady state of them using our products and services on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis. And I think we are quite focused on that. It is improving, but it is never improving fast enough if you know what I mean. So the rapidity is the key. And I would say we are getting better. And I would say we need to get better faster. So I think that that is - but these are very large organizations. It is complex implementations, and you are doing it while they are still operating. Sometimes, they are operating. Sometimes, they are doing acquisitions. Sometimes, they are doing divestitures. And all of that adds to the complexity of these implementations. And - but we think we have a great team. We think we have great opportunities. It is execution. Well, I think that DomaniRx remains a very large system. And we are trying to make sure that we are really aligning our deliveries around the times when these large health plans and - are making decisions on new providers. So that is a work in process, but we are certainly focused on DomaniRx. Rahul, do you have a deeper comment? Yes. We sold a few on-prem, good-sized licenses. And even sometimes the - even though we may host it, they may still do all the work. So it is not a business process outsourcing service. So yes, we sold and we have a refreshed group of technology that we think has some link to the - to its acceptance in the market. So we are doing quite well against our competitors, and we believe that will continue. I think we have had a program to get some price increases, and that is worked pretty well. And I think it is - the price increases are more substantial than they have been over the last probably even five-years as, obviously, inflation has gone up and people recognize that they want to keep the same team. We have very talented people, and they want to keep the same team. So the conversation, while no one likes to have their prices increased, they understand that to keep these talented people and continue to deliver service at a very high level, there is going to be some price increases. And we have had, I would say, pretty good success with that. Right. I think what we said was 260 basis points. And I would say that the management of the variable expenses was probably 100 to 120 of those 260 basis points. And probably, the real estate footprint maybe another - what do you think, Patrick, 40, 50 basis points maybe? And then there is a variety of other things that we have done about - we buy lots of services from lots of different people, and we have gotten some help with more volume but at a less rate. I think those are the major components. Well, I think competitively, we believe we are in a very strong position, and we continue to have takeaways. We continue to have outreach from the industry coming to us. And we think that that is going to continue. The breadth and depth of our offering, we believe, is unmatched. So we think that that is a very strong position to be in. And then the addition of Blue Prism has really been a demonstrable way that people can use digital workers for things like statement verification, reconciliation and a whole host of other things. And as Rahul said, it is - we hope we come out of 2023 with between 5% and 10% of our workforce being digital workers. And I think that that is a significant number of people. I think it is fair. It is still tight, though and it is going to be a while before labor is not in an ascendancy. I think that in most of the people's businesses that are on this call, there is pressures on various - whether it is investment banking fees or other types of fees that - and you see that happening where there are significant cuts around large-scale financial institutions. And that generally puts more talented labor in the workforce. And we are getting a lot of great resumes. And our ability to really deploy Blue Prism is something that allows us to put people into higher level analytical positions that give them career paths that are, we think, pretty exciting. Rahul, maybe you can get a few [Technical Difficulty]. Well, I think the M&A market is active. I think there is - you are seeing some major software deals being announced over the last few weeks, and - but prices are still pretty firm. And I think that the clearing call for organic growth is something that we have put a lot of focus on and have a lot of new products and services that we think will drive significant revenue for us. And then the same thing with the pricing. I think that stuff builds, and I think it will continue to build throughout 2023. And hopefully, we would be able to point to specifics of several percentage increases in the overall revenue streams on different services and products that are - that is caused by price increases. I think we think that is a yes. Obviously, Patrick, you understand that process probably as well as anybody. And that is way more art than it is science. Particularly when interest rates are going up and we view our stock as undervalued, you get kind of a - anything you do is pretty positive. But interest rates at 5.5% compared to stock price at $50, the stock price at $50 is quite a bit financially better. But we still like acquisitions. We like the talent we get. We like the ability to drive margins up. We like to get the new technology, the new services, the talent. And so I don't think that the overall philosophy is much different.

But people would prefer we drive our leverage ratio to below 3, and that is something that we are focused on. And I think, again, we moved our EBITDA margins up, I think, 260 basis points.

And even with our 38% margin, which we would like it to be higher, it still stacks up pretty well against most of our competitors. Yes, we think better. We got a few buildings for sale if you are interested. And we have some other assets on our balance sheet. We have several cities. Yes. And we have some other assets on our balance sheet that - but nothing particularly significant that is going to make $100 million or anything like that. Yes. I think that DST Financial Services, particularly that we have a pretty big U.K. business, and so a lot of the headwinds in the - with the British pound and... Are we still talking about DST Financial Services? Yes. So a large component of that business is in the U.K. And I think that we still have lots of opportunities there. We have spent a lot of money, and we think we have improved our products and our service levels. But I think it is still a competitive business, and I think that we have a chance to continue to improve that business. And I think we have a stronger sales force in there and that we are doing some smart things. And I think we will continue to do that. Rahul, do you have anything else to add to that?

            "content": "Thank you. Results for the third quarter of 2022 were GAAP revenues of $1.321 billion, GAAP net income of $160 million and diluted GAAP EPS of $0.61. Revenues were $1.322 million. Adjusted revenue was up 4.4%. Adjusted operating income decreased 4.3%, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.15, a 12.9% decrease from Q3 2021. Overall, adjusted revenue increased $55.7 million or 4.4% over the third quarter of 2021. Our acquisitions contributed $68.2 million in revenue. Foreign exchange had unfavorable impact of $32.7 million or 2.6% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue increase on a constant currency basis was 1.6%. We had strength across several product lines, including alternatives, Advent, Institutional and Investment Management, and the Intralinks business. That strength was impacted by weakness in our GIDS transfer agency business and the health care business. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $486.1 million, a decrease of $38 million or 7.3% from Q3 2021. Adjusted operating margins were 36.8% in the third quarter compared to 41.1% in the third quarter of 2021. Expenses overall increased 9.2% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $53.1 million expenses, and foreign currency decreased costs by $27.6 million. Our cost structure has been impacted by wage inflation and higher staffing to support our business, but we have improved operating margins sequentially from 34.2% in the second quarter of 2021 to 36.8% in the third quarter as we managed our cost structure. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $501.7 million or 38% of adjusted revenue, a decrease of $30.9 million from Q2 2021. Interest expense for the third quarter of 2022 was $86 million and includes $3.7 million of noncash amortized financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter for our credit facility and the senior notes was 4.55% compared to 3.12% in the third quarter of 2021. The increase in the interest rates contributed an increase of $26.6 million in interest expense in the quarter, and the higher average debt balance related to the financing of the Blue Prism acquisition added $8.6 million in interest. Our recorded GAAP tax provision for the quarter was $53.4 million, 25% of pretax. Adjusted net income, which is defined in note 4, was $298.8 million and adjusted EPS was $1.15, and the effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares decreased to 260.9 million from 263.9 million in Q2. Share repurchases and lower average stock price during the quarter led to the decrease. On the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $401 million of cash and cash equivalents and $7.3 billion of gross debt. SS&C's net debt defined per our credit agreement, which excludes the cash of $151.6 million held at DomaniRx, was $7 billion as of September 30. Operating cash flow for the nine-months ended September was $764.6 million, a $180.3 million or 19% decrease compared to the same period in 2021. Operating cash flows were impacted by transaction expenses associated with the Blue Prism acquisition of approximately $67 million, which includes amounts paid by Blue Prism in the post-acquisition period. In addition, it was impacted by the quarterly bonus that we initiated this year in Q3 of approximately $29 million. Interest paid in this period was $223.4 million compared to $173.2 million in the same period of 2021. In the nine-months, we paid $211.5 million in taxes compared to $230.8 million in 2021. Our accounts receivable DSO improved to 51.7 days from 55.9 days as of June 2022. On investing and financing cash flows, we have paid about $1.629 billion for acquisitions, including Blue Prism, Hubwise, MineralWare, O'Shares and Tier1; capital expenditures and capitalized software of $158 million or 4% of adjusted revenue. The spending was predominantly for capitalized software and IT infrastructure. In addition, we received a distribution of $66.2 million from 1 of our joint venture partners. During the 3 months ended September 30, we paid down net debt of $55.6 million, and we bought back in the quarter $214.5 million - we spent $214.5 million for 3.7 million shares at an average price of $57.62. And year-to-date, we have declared and paid a dividend of $153 million to our common stock shareholders as compared to $122.8 million last year, an increase of 19.9%. On outlook for the fourth quarter, on assumptions, we are continuing to focus on client service. We expect our retention - client retention rates to continue in the same range as most recent results. We have assumed foreign currency exchange at approximately the current levels, and that will result in a negative impact of approximately $37 million on revenue growth in the fourth quarter. On adjusted organic revenue growth for the year, we expect 1.6% to 4.6%. On adjusted organic growth for the fourth quarter, we expect to be in the range of minus 1.9% to positive 1.9%. On interest rates, we have assumed average rates of about 5.5% in the fourth quarter, and that compares to 4.55% we had in the third quarter of 2022. We will continue to manage expenses during this period by controlling variable expenses and maintaining, improving our operating margins. We expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 26% on an adjusted basis. So for the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $1.305 billion to $1.355 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $285.3 million to $307.5 million and diluted shares in the range of 255 million to 257 million. And for the full year, we expect cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.145 billion. And I will turn it over back to Bill for final comments. And I think also, Blue Prism operating margins improved in the quarter. I think they were up over 10% operating margin, so it was pretty significant in the quarter sequentially. There is some FX impact, but I think the midpoint of our full year revenue guide is about 2% right now. And I think at the end of the third quarter, we were at about 3.2%. Some of that is organic reduction. And probably, I would say maybe $20 million is FX from some of the guidance we gave at the end of the second quarter. Yes, I think so. I think the midpoint is around 2%."

            "name": "Rahul Kanwar",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Our business continues to display resilience despite some impact from FX, primarily the British pound, reduced M&A deal volumes and volatility in the overall economic environment. Our plans to grow despite these issues are centered around new product launches, amplified sales and marketing campaigns, and continuing our focus on customer satisfaction and delivery. In our fund administration business, a significant growth initiative is to enhance the offering for hybrid and credit funds, leveraging the full software capabilities of Advent products in partnership with GlobeOp's strong fund services capabilities. In Intralinks, we launched Deal Services, which enables our customers to stay focused on the execution of their M&A deals, while we take on labor-intensive tasks such as redaction as a service and reporting as a service. These offerings have already proven to be a differentiator for us, helping to drive recent wins. We saw strength in our software business this quarter. Aloha, our newest platform and institutional investment management, has had some early success. Eight new clients signed in Q3 to bring our total Aloha client base to 29 clients, about 1/3 of which are new logos to SS&C. In September, we appointed Bhagesh Malde to lead the consolidated SS&C GlobeOp business, including private markets, hedge and insurance outsourcing. We continue to see a convergence between hedge and private markets. Bhagesh has delivered strong revenue growth and built an excellent leadership team in our real assets and private markets business over the past five-years, and we are confident he will lead the combined GlobeOp business in the next phase of its growth. We are starting to gain traction with our rollout of Blue Prism internally and across our client base. Within our outsourcing and service businesses, we view Blue Prism as a significant competitive differentiator, as widespread applications that will generate accuracy and timeliness benefits for our client base and free up our talented staff to focus on higher level and analytical roles and accelerate their career growth. We are targeting having digital workers to be 5% to 10% of our overall employee base by the end of 2023. We expect a savings of approximately $50,000 annually for each such role that we migrate to Blue Prism. Now I will mention some key deals for Q3. A wealth manager with 260,000 accounts chose Black Diamond to offer best-in-class solution to their end clients and large employee base. An existing fund services client expanded their relationship with SS&C to include additional funds and loan servicing on their private book. A large real estate manager based in Singapore and New York chose SS&C's middle-office capabilities due to our real estate expertise and global operating model. An existing PORTIA client upgraded to our new Aloha solution, noting the enhanced fixed income functionality. A large transfer agency client selected SS&C for their web modernization project. A large financial services group in Africa chose SS&C for its best-of-breed technology and BPO capabilities, including AWD, Percana policy administration and Blue Prism RPA. We are providing an end-to-end solution to administer a broad range of multi-asset, multi-region product types for their individual retail investors. I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials. I think the only added thing I would have is that the underlying business or the fundamentals that we look at, whether it is how many deals we have in the pipeline or how many wins we have and our path to innovation and rollout of new products, all remain pretty strong. Clearly, the economic backdrop, the FX rates, M&A volumes, things like that are impacting us right now. And so 2023 - to your question on the framework for 2023, that will really just depend on how much that rebounds. But the things that we control, we actually feel are going reasonably well. Yes. I think on the changes in AUA, just - we talk about frequently how that doesn't exactly correlate to what we expect from revenue outlook. There is some impact, but it is weakly correlated, so point taken that AUA is not going up. But - and if you look at our historical range on fund administration growth, it is somewhere between 4% and 8%, 9%. And so when we have tough markets like this, we expect to be at the lower end of that range, but I wouldn't expect us to get negative unless there was a dramatic change in macroeconomic outlook. Bill, I don't. I think that is right. Sure. Yes. So I think it is both, where we are obviously making that a standard in new customer contracts. But as part of the conversation with current customers that did not have escalators in their contract, we are both agreeing to updated price levels at the present and also sort of having this regimen of CPI or something indexed to a cost of living type adjustment built into the contract. And that also has - to Bill's point, nobody really wants to talk about these things, but they understand where we are coming from. And so that is gone reasonably well. And it does make for, as you point out, a more automatic and consistent process going forward. Well, the other components of DST Financial Services, the retirement business, we have been, for the last 12 or so months, working on a couple of big customers that were getting much closer to that go-live situation, and we expect to see growth in those businesses as a result. Brokerage remains pretty strong. And we are encouraged by the fact that we are seeing more and more deals coming out of DST Financial Services that are sort of cross-sell enterprise-type deals, where we are selling multiple of our products and services, including Advent and fund services and other things, which is really what we had hoped would happen. And so there is a lot of positive despite kind of some macro trends."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SS&C Technologies Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.  It is now my pleasure to turn todayâs call over to Justine Stone, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJustine Stone: Hi, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for our Q2 2022 earnings call. Iâm Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C Technologies. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Pedonti, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, letâs review the safe harbor statement. Please note that various remarks we make today about future expectations, plans and prospects, including financial outlook we provide, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and can also be accessed on our website. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of today July 27, 2022. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. During todayâs call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in todayâs earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. In the third quarter 2021, we entered into a joint venture named DomaniRx LLC, which we are the more majority interest holder and primary beneficiary. All earnings figures discussed today, including operating income, EBITDA, net income and EPS are attributable to SS&C based on the ownership interest retained by SS&C. I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stone: Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone, for joining. Our results for the first quarter are $1.33 billion and adjusted revenue, up 5.5% and $1.10 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, down 11%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $464.3 million for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 35.4%. Continued elevated labor prices, higher-than-expected interest rates, FX headwinds and a weaker economic backdrop, put pressure on our results versus our expectations. Our first quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 2.2%. Our Alternatives, Intralinks and Advent businesses continued to be the growth leaders. Ex the impact of our health care business, our Q2 â22 organic growth in Financial Services about 94% of our revenue was up 4.4%. SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $446.5 million for the 6 months ended June 30. We were restricted from buying back stock in Q2 â22 due to some M&A discussions, which have ended and we paid down $234.7 million in debt. Our consolidated net leverage ratio now stands at 3.45, and our secured net -- our net secured leverage ratio was 2.48x consolidated EBITDA and our goal is to reduce leverage to 3 or less. Overall, our business is seeing more headwinds than we initially expected, especially compared to â21. We believe there are 3 main challenges affecting our revenue growth, the weakness in the health care business, while somewhat expected as we invest in DomaniRx, which will continue to be 100 to 200 basis headwind to total company organic growth. We have a lot of faith in Domani and what it can deliver in 2023 and beyond, and development is currently on target for broad scale release on 1/1/â24. Second, the full  M&A market is affecting Intralinks by about $20 million from our original plan. Theyâre still growing close to 15% and has -- still has excellent margins. And despite the dip in DOY, total deal value, Intralinks continues to gain market share and expect to continue to grow in about the 15% level. Lastly, the Financial Services business has taken the brunt of the FX impact. As many of you know, the dollar has been unprecedentedly strong and we expect an additional $28 million in FX headwinds in the second half. On the expense side, our labor costs remain elevated, but there are signs of this plateauing. We communicated bonuses in the second round of merit increases in March and April, which has curbed some of the attrition, along with our employee focus initiatives, which we have highlighted in our slide deck. Weâll be tightly controlling our cost for the remainder of the year. Real estate reductions, IT spending and implementing Blue Prismâs digital workers throughout our operations will drive our margins back up to historical levels exiting the year. Iâll now turn it over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks, Bill. Our business remains resilient in the face of macroeconomic challenges that manifested in Q2. As you noted, Bill, foreign exchange headwinds impacted our international business with the largest impact to our European agency and wealth revenue streams. Intralinks is also seeing some muting in the demand environment due to a reduction in M&A volumes, but grew 14.2% in Q2. The Alternatives business demonstrated our long-standing thesis that diversification among fund types, asset classes and our commercial models gives us a strong hedge against market pressures. The Alternatives business grew nicely despite some impact to new fund launches and fund inflows. GoCentral continues to roll out new functionality, enabling more efficiencies in daily processing and NABs and providing an important market differentiator in our sales process. We now have 69 clients on GoCentral in production, totaling 1,500 funds with an approximate AUM of over $300 billion. As in our Financial Markets business had a strong quarter in the wake of market volatility and are well positioned to take advantage of shifting investment strategies given the breadth of our product offering. DomaniRx joint venture also notes continues to make progress. The new cloud-based system can now successfully execute a financial cycle, and we have completed the initial build and configuration of the API gateway and developer portal. We have accelerated our go-to-market plans and DomaniRx can now be delivered in the modular fashion sold as individual products, including finance, drug management and communications hub for existing SS&C health clients and prospects starting in Q4 2022. SS&C private markets grew 15% in the second quarter despite a slowdown in fundraising following several years of elevated activity. Prospects and clients and private markets are more than ever looking to partner with key service providers that can drive efficiencies utilizing technology, expertise and data. Private credit and hybrid funds are a particularly attractive subsegment. We continue to innovate in this space incorporating Geneva and other leading technologies and have multiple large private credit deals in the pipeline. Now I will mention some key deals for Q2. A $42 billion AUM hedge fund, an existing Geneva user chose SS&Câs tax optimizer to replace a big floor accounting firm solution. An existing retirement client extended their TRAC-4 account record-keeping services with SS&C to service a recently acquired business, an existing GIDS client added SS&C event center services, a large customer added our transfer agency services for retail alternatives for their nontraded real estate investment trust. An existing customer extended their Silvan, Porsche and Recon licenses to a newly acquired division, significantly improving their workflow. An investment manager in Australia is seeking to transform its operating model to gain operational efficiency and provide improved services shows SS&Câs Aloha due to its advanced technology and our global wealth expertise. A large U.S. insurer chose SS&Câs Singularity after a multiyear sales process. The Dutch private equity firm launching a registered investment fund for the first time chose SS&C for interval fund services and retail all transfer agency services. I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials.\nPatrick Pedonti: Thank you. Results for the second quarter were GAAP revenues of $1,328.7 billion, GAAP net income of $110.6 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.42. Adjusted revenues were $1,330 million, including the impact of the adoption of revenue standard 606 and for acquired deferred revenue adjustments for the acquisition. Adjusted net income was $289.6 million. Adjusted revenue was up 5.5%. Adjusted operating income decreased 8.2% and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.10, an 11.3% decrease over Q2 2021. Adjusted revenue increased $69 million or 5.5% in Q2. Our acquisitions contributed $65.6 million. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $24 million or 1.9% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue increased on a constant currency basis was 2.2%. We had strength across several product lines, including Alternatives, Intralinks, Ads and the Advent businesses. Ad strength was impacted by weakness in our GIDS transfer agency business and health care businesses. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $455.3 million, a decrease of $40.5 million or 8.2% in the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted operating margins were 34.2% in the second quarter of â22 compared to 39.3% in the second quarter of 2021. Expenses increased 8.1% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $67.8 million in expenses and foreign currency decreased costs by $20.6 million. Our cost structure was impacted by wage inflation, high recruiting costs, and higher staff to support our businesses. Net interest expense for the second quarter was $67.7 million and includes $3.9 million of noncash amortized financing costs and OID. The average rate in the quarter, including the senior notes was 3.45% compared to 3.02% in the second quarter of 2021. We recorded a GAAP tax provision of $45.2 million or 29.1% of pretax income. Adjusted net income, as defined in Note 4 in the earnings release was $289.6 million and adjusted EPS was $1.10. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares decreased to $263.9 million from $267.6 million in Q1. The impact of option exercises was offset by the decrease in the average share price during the quarter. On our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the second quarter with $438.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $7.4 million of gross debt. Net debt has defined our credit agreement, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $148.3 million held by DomaniRx was $7.1 billion as of June 30. Operating cash flow in the 6 months ended June 30 was $447.5 million, a $114.8 million decrease compared to the same period in 2021. During the 3 months ended June 30, we paid down $234.7 million of debt. Operating cash flows were down as a result of several factors, including payment of transaction expenses associated with the Blue Prism acquisition of approximately $67 million, which includes amounts paid by Blue Prism in the post-acquisition period and our operating activities compared to last year. Overall, for acquisitions year-to-date, weâve paid $1.597 billion, that includes Blue Prism, Hubwise, OâShares and MineralWare and that number is net of cash acquired. Treasury stock buybacks were $170.9 million for purchase of 2.3 million shares in the 6 months. We did not buy any shares in the second quarter of 2022. In the 6 months, weâve declared and paid $102.4 million of common stock to adds as compared to $82.1 million last year, an increase of 24.6%. Total interest paid in the quarter was $112.6 million, and that compares to $97.8 million in 2021. In the 6 months this year, weâve paid $156.5 million of income taxes compared to $144.2 million in the same period last year. Our accounts receivable DSO ticked up a little in the quarter up to 55.9 days compared to 52.7 days as of March 2022. Capital expenditures and capitalized software were totaled $85.9 million or 3.3% of adjusted revenue. Spending was predominantly for capitalized software and IT infrastructure. In our LTM consolidated EBITDA that we use for covenant compliance was $2.456 billion as of June. And based on a net debt of $7.1 million, our total leverage ratio was 3.45x and secured leverage 2.48x as of June 30. On outlook for the remainder of the year, a couple of -- Iâll go through a couple of assumptions. We have assumed that foreign currency exchange will be at current levels for the remainder of the year. Weâve assumed average interest rates will increase 100 bps in the third quarter, an additional 50 bps in the fourth quarter. We expect to reduce our cost structure through staff reductions, productivity improvement, facility reduction and controlling variable expenses to improve our operating margins. And weâll continue to invest in our business in the long term with capital expenditures and cap software of approximately 3.4%. On cash flow, we will focus on improving our working capital requirements to generate cash. In addition, we are recapitalizing one of our real estate joint ventures to generate approximately $70 million of cash distribution. I would also assume weâll continue to allocate free cash flow to both debt and stock buyback and weâll use a tax rate of 26% on an adjusted basis. So for the third quarter of 2022, we expect revenues in the range of $1.324 billion to $1.364 billion. That will result in adjusted organic growth in the range of 1.6% to 4.8%. Adjusted net income in the range of $302 million to $318 million, and diluted shares in the range of $263.2 million, $262.7 million. For the full year of 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $5.320 billion to $5.406 billion. Adjusted organic growth in the range of 0.6% to 4.8%, adjusted net income in the range of $1.256 billion to $1.297 billion and diluted shares in the range of $264.6 million to $263.6 million. And on operating cash flow for the full year, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $1.180 billion to $1.220 billion. And Iâll turn it over to Bill for final comments. Thank you.\nBill Stone: Thanks, Patrick. We appreciate your continued interest in SS&C, and we believe weâre on the right track to deliver stronger revenue growth and a more digitized workforce, which will be a lower expense base. Our Deliver Conference is the first week in October, and we hope to see you in Orlando. Iâll now open it up to questions.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS Financial.\nAlex Kramm: There was a comment in the deck, I think, around like stepping up conversations on pricing with your clients. So just hoping that you can flesh this out a little bit more. And in particular, maybe remind us what you thought at the beginning of the year, pricing could add and how maybe those fresh discussions could maybe change that number? And then most importantly, is that already reflected in your updated organic growth guide? Or could that be incremental to what you just laid out?\nBill Stone: Well, I think, Alex, that we have incorporated some price increases into our guidance and we are implementing as we speak and we have implemented. And I think we have CPI  most of our license maintenance and obviously, CPI is quite a bit higher than it was over the last few years. And then also, weâve had individual businesses raising prices throughout. And I think Rahul might have a few numbers on that.\nRahul Kanwar: Yes. I think where we have CPI, obviously, weâre in the range of -- itâs CPI plus 3, CPI plus 4 and some of those numbers look like anywhere between 7% and 10%. Weâre also doing -- going back to customers as weâve talked about with price increases, where contracts are renewing or where just in the context of the inflationary environment makes sense. And in general, I would say weâre targeting 5 to 7 or higher percentage increases. Now this is an ongoing conversation and in some cases, weâll end up a little better. And in some cases, weâll end up a little bit worse. And as Bill noted, some of that has already been reflected in the future forecast.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe just quick one. You mentioned no buybacks this quarter because of M&A discussions. Maybe anything to flesh out there in general? Maybe what kind of areas youâve been looking at? And then just to clarify, was that to buy something? Or are you actually looking to maybe divest some businesses, if you can be that specific.\nBill Stone: Yes. Well, it really -- we donât really comment on what weâre buying or selling, Alex. But we look at our portfolio all the time. And weâre pretty interested in being able to bolster our private markets business. Weâre excited about some of the new stuff weâre doing in TAC. And we continue to look at unique asset classes that we think our clients may be moving more strongly into. So we have a variety of different conversations going on at any one time. And I think we thought that there was a pretty good chance that something would happen, and thatâs why we felt like we had material nonpublic information, so we didnât trade our stock. But those conversations have ended. And I would guess that we will be active in Q3 in stock buybacks.\nAlex Kramm: Sounds good. Just thought Iâd go check if there was more to disclose.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson.\nPeter Heckmann: Bill, can you comment on what do you think is the bottom in terms of year-over-year growth in health care? Are we seeing it this quarter? Is that -- are the client losses fully reflected?\nBill Stone: Well, I think that as we start showing some of the modules of DomaniRx, we will start getting kind of a reversal of trend. And thatâs why we have such a focus on that. For health care to be down the 24% it was, we had some more attrition than we really didnât expect. But again, itâs 6% of our revenue or so. And so while -- hey, we donât like reductions in revenue in anything, but weâre pretty optimistic that weâre spending a lot of money. Thereâs a lot of interest in that health care business and there has been ever since we bought DST. So I think we have a lot of optionality when it comes to health care. And to date, we have felt like owning it is a lot better than divesting it.\nPeter Heckmann: Got it. Got it. And if we thought about the health care business without the attrition, can you give us an idea of how revenue would look just based on the underlying metrics? Would this be -- I mean, is attrition the main issue here? Or is there also an issue around number of prescriptions processed or claims or covered lives?\nBill Stone: Yes. I think that the biggest driver is the number of claims we adjudicate and pay. And thatâs probably the biggest driver on the revenue. And weâre probably -- weâve been up close to $500 million range, and weâre probably down in the $380 million, $390 million. But with Domani, we expect a large uptick in that. As always, thereâs a lot of regulation of PBMs and fees that they charge and different states have different rules. And so weâre constantly monitoring that and being able to comply with new rules all the time. And in general, they are not -- the new rules are not revenue enhanced. So we deal with that regulatory environment as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi.\nAndrew Schmidt: I wanted to dig in a little bit on the DST Financial Services. And I know you partially mentioned this, but if you could just talk a little bit more in depth to what drove the step down in organic growth in the second quarter. And then based on implementation and sales pipeline, how youâre thinking about growth in this business in the back half and into next year?\nBill Stone: Well, we have very robust pipelines, and we have a reasonably strong backlog of projects that weâre implementing now that should get -- give us some lift. I think the challenge on some of this is these are very large organizations and the implementations are sometimes drawn out. And again, theyâre still our customers, and we support them all the way through the process. But sometimes, the rev rec gets delayed. I would say that we think that the ability for us to deploy digital workers throughout our business is to help us both in our sales pipeline development as well in our -- in reducing the rate of increase of personnel. So we think we have identified several hundred FTEs that these digital workers are going to be able to be substituted for. So instead of hiring another 350, we think weâre going to be able to deploy digital workers in order to satisfy those needs. And these are in like reconciliations, break resolution and different things, compliance with Blue Sky laws and so forth and so on. So weâre very optimistic about our margin rebounding back to our historical levels. And like I said, weâve had some FX headwinds. Weâve had labor becoming dominant and therefore, having way higher wage rates than has been the norm over the last 5 or 10 years. And even with all of this, we run at 35% margin. So we have an excellent business that I think over the next number of quarters will just be more excellent.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. I appreciate the detailed response. And then this is a related question, but I recall last quarter, the retention issues were having an impact on implementation. And it seems like that was starting to get smoothed out. But if you could just give us an update in terms of where weâre at in terms of just stabilizing just the workforce and the implementation time lines across the business, that would be helpful.\nBill Stone: Well, itâs not the hemorrhage that it was in the -- towards the back half of the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter. Itâs not quite that. Obviously, youâve seen slowdowns in a lot of the major companies in their hiring and also a number of them that have announced cutbacks, those kinds of things tend to give people pause, right? You donât really want to switch jobs and then be subject to a risk. People also like working for us because we are profitable, and we do realize our biggest asset is our people. And so weâve done a number of things, and you can see some of it in  that we put together. But weâre really optimistic about what Blue Prism is going to be able to do for us. I was on a call with a prospect today on Blue Prism. And I think it -- again, SS&C is making big investments, big investment in this business because we believe accounting is not going away. We donât think tax returns are going away or financial statements are going away or any of the other of the mission-critical things we do are going away. So these are 3 core to the Sky, but weâll be at still about $5.3 billion or so in revenue at the end of this year, maybe better. And I donât think that weâre anywhere near what we can be, and weâre expecting us to execute better. But the first thing you got to do is you got to maintain your workforce and you got to focus on customer service. And so thatâs what weâve been doing. We have spent tremendous amounts of money on our selling and marketing and R&D. I think R&D is up about 18%. I think our sales and marketing is up about 40%. So I think we are spending the money. I think weâre spending it wisely and we expect it to pay dividends.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick OâShaughnessy with Raymond James.\nPatrick OâShaughnessy: So you guys -- your presentation notes that youâre committed to reducing your debt in a rising interest rate environment. But on the call today, you also indicated that you look to be active in the share repurchase market. How do you think about balancing those priorities right now?\nBill Stone: Carefully, right? So weâll look at it depending on how much cash we generate. But I would guess that weâll probably -- right now, I think our forecast has this at about 50-50. 50% debt reduction, 50% stock buybacks. But that could fluctuate as much as 15%. So it could be 65-35. It just depends on what happens with either market.\nPatrick OâShaughnessy: Got it. Thatâs helpful. And Patrick, maybe a question for you. Do you have a general rule of thumb for how much a given change in FX would impact the companyâs EBITDA or EPS?\nPatrick Pedonti: For the second quarter?\nPatrick OâShaughnessy: Just in general, but I mean, in the second quarter, if you have that, but just in general, dollars.\nPatrick Pedonti: Yes. I mean in the second quarter, the impact of the EPS was probably somewhere around $0.01 to $0.015 negative to EPS. And I would suspect itâd be -- based on where current exchange rates are today, itâd be pretty similar in the third quarter and fourth quarter.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: Itâs Michael on for James. I just wanted to hit on the sort of like the hedge fund backdrop quickly. Obviously, weâve seen the number of launches slowing but youâve also seen the size of those launches also decreasing. So just anecdotally, how are you sort of performing in the blue-chip launches? Whatâs your share capture and sort of how are you thinking about hedge funds in general in this current environment?\nBill Stone: Do you want to take that, Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: Sure. I think what weâre seeing is what we tend to see in periods of market volatility and when people come into pressure, which is more viewed as the leader in the fund administration space and in the hedge fund space as well as private equity. And so we actually tend to perform better in terms of market share in these kinds of environments. We saw that in the financial crisis in â08, â09, and weâre seeing that again. So as you know, there arenât as many new launches. And the ones that are arenât as large, but most of our revenue capture is new clients and conversions and takeaways as opposed to new launches, which take generally some period of time before they become material to us. And so that process is going pretty well, and weâre winning our share of whatâs out there in the marketplace. And if anything strengthening and we expect that as things turn around, that will be pretty positive for us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And then just quickly, I saw on the deck that youâre also looking at headcount in Blue Prism specifically. Can you just comment on the nature of those potential headcount reductions? Is that sort of back-office staff? Is it quota-carrying sales reps? How should we think about that?\nBill Stone: Yes, we almost never cut back on  salespeople. I think this is much more on, as you combine these companies, right, thereâs a number of functions that are duplicative. And so weâre moving relatively quickly on being able to reduce that headcount, whether thatâs in legal, finance, IT and other support organizations. But weâre excited about what we have with Blue Prism and what our opportunities are.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Donat with Piper Sandler.\nChris Donat: Bill, I wanted to ask another question on the price increases youâre putting in related to inflation and other things. Iâm just curious if you can give us some color on the receptivity from your clients. I would imagine, given the market conditions, they have very little appetite for the price increases, but they recognize the inflation side of it for you. Just wondering how theyâre reacting to it. Is it grudgingly or with a lot of pushback? Just some color would be helpful.\nBill Stone: Yes. I mean you kind of characterized it. Nobody particularly likes to have price increases. At the same time, they want their current team to be well paid and well respected. So -- and they realize that thatâs not for free. And so I think that -- this is an industry that is populated by big boys and girls, and weâre certainly not mega tech companies that walk in and say, 25% more, take or leave it. Thatâs not our MO. And so they know that weâre really just passing on the inflation thatâs hitting us. And our guess is, is that theyâre trying to pass on expense increases that they have. So itâs a natural cycle, and you do it with as much sensitivity as you can and with a little bit of determination and persistence. So I think itâs going pretty well, and I think our people understand that these are the things that are going to kind of maintain our bonus structure and our ability to compensate well.\nChris Donat: Okay. And then for my follow-up, wanted to see if Iâm connecting things correctly here. Youâve got the cost controls and reducing your real estate footprint. Separately, youâve got under HR initiatives, the hybrid work and youâve made some comments about having some employee attrition, but I think, you said you think itâs plateauing. Is the hybrid work initiative and the real estate footprint, are those related issues? Are they really separate?\nBill Stone: Well, if people donât come into the office, which they donât, I would say theyâre related, right? So we donât need real estate footprint that we have, and weâre doing much more of a hoteling concept rather than everybody having their office or their own space. So thatâs just changed the way we work, and weâre trying to be as flexible as we can be as long as we can maintain customer service and be able to hit our deliverables and meet our growth targets. But yes, for sure, theyâre related.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Is there any way to think about, maybe this is for Patrick, what the cost controls, what the impact is on the guidance -- the revised guidance, I guess, maybe start there? And is that fully in it? Or any way to think about how that comes in over the course of the year?\nPatrick Pedonti: Yes. I think if you look at the baseline costs for Q2, weâve got in the back half of the year about $50 million in cost reductions, of which you think about $25 million have already been completed. And then the rest is mostly reducing -- continuing to reduce facilities and productivity improvement with the Blue Prism product and then holding back as much as possible on other discretionary spending.\nKevin McVeigh: Thatâs helpful. And then it looks like the revenue retention and the AUA really kind of hung in there despite the market volatility. Anything to call out there?\nBill Stone: Iâm sorry, can you repeat that?\nKevin McVeigh: Bill, it looks like the revenue retention rates improved from Q1 to Q2. And then the AUA was actually flat sequentially despite the market volatility. Anything to call out amongst clients, just anything in particular that drove that?\nBill Stone: I think what Rahul said earlier about in these kind of tumultuous times, people like quality. We think thatâs going to help us over the next couple of years. Thereâs been an awful lot of acquisitions in the fund services space and extremely high prices paid and SS&C has not been much of a participant in that. We think thatâs going to put some of our competitors under immense strain and we think weâll be a beneficiary of that. And that shields up in our AUA as well.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt with William Blair.\nJeff Schmitt: On Blue Prism, it sounds like itâs performing better out of the gate than you expected. Yes, and maybe I missed it, but do you have an update on your revenue growth in EBITDA margin projections for that company? I think you were expecting like 15% to 20% top line and then you thought you can get the 30% to 40% margins by maybe, it was, 2024 exit. Is that still the case or do you see any change to that?\nBill Stone: Yes. I think in the second quarter, Blue Prism grew right at 17%. That was maybe about what we expected, maybe a little bit better. And I think they kind of -- a couple of million dollars in operating losses. We expect them to move to profitability in the second half of this year and probably end the year at about 10%. We think next year, theyâd be up to about 25% and then around 40% in 2024, which are our corporate averages, and weâre pretty optimistic. And weâre really optimistic about what itâs going to do for our own business besides all the customers weâre going to be able to really help.\nJeff Schmitt: Right, right. Thatâs helpful. And on the health care business, if the client loss is there, are those mainly for the medical claims part of the business, not the pharmacy claims? Iâm just curious how big of a difference sort of the margins are in those 2 businesses. Like how much -- just trying to get a sense on how much EBITDA youâre losing if thatâs sort of the medical claims business thatâs -- that youâre losing there.\nBill Stone: Yes. The business as a whole still remains profitable, pretty profitable, actually. And we are -- as we have had some attrition in our client base, weâve had some attrition in our workforce. So weâre trying to maintain that kind of profitability ratio. And obviously, the DomaniRx is $1 billion of  and our 2 partners. And so we remain pretty optimistic because thatâs a pretty big bet for us. And at least what we see in the marketplace today, thereâs not going to be a competitor to DomaniRx when we come out of the gate. And thatâs what gives us the optimism, right? I mean weâre not in general -- weâre a bunch of accountants and systems people, right? So in general, weâre pretty silver when it comes to those kinds of things. And we donât just take fires. We like to place pretty strategic bets that we expect great returns on.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Stone.\nBill Stone: Again, we appreciate all of the interest that all of you show. And obviously, we hope to improve upon our results. And as I said, right, weâve had a lot of headwinds in the second quarter and we still came out with about 35% EBITDA margins. And we look forward to talking to you at the end of October, and we hope to see all of you in Orlando. Thanks again. Bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes todayâs conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Stone",
            "content": "Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone, for joining. Our results for the first quarter are $1.33 billion and adjusted revenue, up 5.5% and $1.10 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, down 11%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $464.3 million for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 35.4%. Continued elevated labor prices, higher-than-expected interest rates, FX headwinds and a weaker economic backdrop, put pressure on our results versus our expectations. Our first quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 2.2%. Our Alternatives, Intralinks and Advent businesses continued to be the growth leaders. Ex the impact of our health care business, our Q2 â22 organic growth in Financial Services about 94% of our revenue was up 4.4%. SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $446.5 million for the 6 months ended June 30. We were restricted from buying back stock in Q2 â22 due to some M&A discussions, which have ended and we paid down $234.7 million in debt. Our consolidated net leverage ratio now stands at 3.45, and our secured net -- our net secured leverage ratio was 2.48x consolidated EBITDA and our goal is to reduce leverage to 3 or less. Overall, our business is seeing more headwinds than we initially expected, especially compared to â21. We believe there are 3 main challenges affecting our revenue growth, the weakness in the health care business, while somewhat expected as we invest in DomaniRx, which will continue to be 100 to 200 basis headwind to total company organic growth. We have a lot of faith in Domani and what it can deliver in 2023 and beyond, and development is currently on target for broad scale release on 1/1/â24. Second, the full  M&A market is affecting Intralinks by about $20 million from our original plan. Theyâre still growing close to 15% and has -- still has excellent margins. And despite the dip in DOY, total deal value, Intralinks continues to gain market share and expect to continue to grow in about the 15% level. Lastly, the Financial Services business has taken the brunt of the FX impact. As many of you know, the dollar has been unprecedentedly strong and we expect an additional $28 million in FX headwinds in the second half. On the expense side, our labor costs remain elevated, but there are signs of this plateauing. We communicated bonuses in the second round of merit increases in March and April, which has curbed some of the attrition, along with our employee focus initiatives, which we have highlighted in our slide deck. Weâll be tightly controlling our cost for the remainder of the year. Real estate reductions, IT spending and implementing Blue Prismâs digital workers throughout our operations will drive our margins back up to historical levels exiting the year. Iâll now turn it over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Patrick. We appreciate your continued interest in SS&C, and we believe weâre on the right track to deliver stronger revenue growth and a more digitized workforce, which will be a lower expense base. Our Deliver Conference is the first week in October, and we hope to see you in Orlando. Iâll now open it up to questions. Well, I think, Alex, that we have incorporated some price increases into our guidance and we are implementing as we speak and we have implemented. And I think we have CPI  most of our license maintenance and obviously, CPI is quite a bit higher than it was over the last few years. And then also, weâve had individual businesses raising prices throughout. And I think Rahul might have a few numbers on that. Yes. Well, it really -- we donât really comment on what weâre buying or selling, Alex. But we look at our portfolio all the time. And weâre pretty interested in being able to bolster our private markets business. Weâre excited about some of the new stuff weâre doing in TAC. And we continue to look at unique asset classes that we think our clients may be moving more strongly into. So we have a variety of different conversations going on at any one time. And I think we thought that there was a pretty good chance that something would happen, and thatâs why we felt like we had material nonpublic information, so we didnât trade our stock. But those conversations have ended. And I would guess that we will be active in Q3 in stock buybacks. Well, I think that as we start showing some of the modules of DomaniRx, we will start getting kind of a reversal of trend. And thatâs why we have such a focus on that. For health care to be down the 24% it was, we had some more attrition than we really didnât expect. But again, itâs 6% of our revenue or so. And so while -- hey, we donât like reductions in revenue in anything, but weâre pretty optimistic that weâre spending a lot of money. Thereâs a lot of interest in that health care business and there has been ever since we bought DST. So I think we have a lot of optionality when it comes to health care. And to date, we have felt like owning it is a lot better than divesting it. Yes. I think that the biggest driver is the number of claims we adjudicate and pay. And thatâs probably the biggest driver on the revenue. And weâre probably -- weâve been up close to $500 million range, and weâre probably down in the $380 million, $390 million. But with Domani, we expect a large uptick in that. As always, thereâs a lot of regulation of PBMs and fees that they charge and different states have different rules. And so weâre constantly monitoring that and being able to comply with new rules all the time. And in general, they are not -- the new rules are not revenue enhanced. So we deal with that regulatory environment as well. Well, we have very robust pipelines, and we have a reasonably strong backlog of projects that weâre implementing now that should get -- give us some lift. I think the challenge on some of this is these are very large organizations and the implementations are sometimes drawn out. And again, theyâre still our customers, and we support them all the way through the process. But sometimes, the rev rec gets delayed. I would say that we think that the ability for us to deploy digital workers throughout our business is to help us both in our sales pipeline development as well in our -- in reducing the rate of increase of personnel. So we think we have identified several hundred FTEs that these digital workers are going to be able to be substituted for. So instead of hiring another 350, we think weâre going to be able to deploy digital workers in order to satisfy those needs. And these are in like reconciliations, break resolution and different things, compliance with Blue Sky laws and so forth and so on. So weâre very optimistic about our margin rebounding back to our historical levels. And like I said, weâve had some FX headwinds. Weâve had labor becoming dominant and therefore, having way higher wage rates than has been the norm over the last 5 or 10 years. And even with all of this, we run at 35% margin. So we have an excellent business that I think over the next number of quarters will just be more excellent. Well, itâs not the hemorrhage that it was in the -- towards the back half of the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter. Itâs not quite that. Obviously, youâve seen slowdowns in a lot of the major companies in their hiring and also a number of them that have announced cutbacks, those kinds of things tend to give people pause, right? You donât really want to switch jobs and then be subject to a risk. People also like working for us because we are profitable, and we do realize our biggest asset is our people. And so weâve done a number of things, and you can see some of it in  that we put together. But weâre really optimistic about what Blue Prism is going to be able to do for us. I was on a call with a prospect today on Blue Prism. And I think it -- again, SS&C is making big investments, big investment in this business because we believe accounting is not going away. We donât think tax returns are going away or financial statements are going away or any of the other of the mission-critical things we do are going away. So these are 3 core to the Sky, but weâll be at still about $5.3 billion or so in revenue at the end of this year, maybe better. And I donât think that weâre anywhere near what we can be, and weâre expecting us to execute better. But the first thing you got to do is you got to maintain your workforce and you got to focus on customer service. And so thatâs what weâve been doing. We have spent tremendous amounts of money on our selling and marketing and R&D. I think R&D is up about 18%. I think our sales and marketing is up about 40%. So I think we are spending the money. I think weâre spending it wisely and we expect it to pay dividends. Carefully, right? So weâll look at it depending on how much cash we generate. But I would guess that weâll probably -- right now, I think our forecast has this at about 50-50. 50% debt reduction, 50% stock buybacks. But that could fluctuate as much as 15%. So it could be 65-35. It just depends on what happens with either market.\nPatrick OâShaughnessy: Got it. Thatâs helpful. And Patrick, maybe a question for you. Do you have a general rule of thumb for how much a given change in FX would impact the companyâs EBITDA or EPS? Do you want to take that, Rahul? Yes, we almost never cut back on  salespeople. I think this is much more on, as you combine these companies, right, thereâs a number of functions that are duplicative. And so weâre moving relatively quickly on being able to reduce that headcount, whether thatâs in legal, finance, IT and other support organizations. But weâre excited about what we have with Blue Prism and what our opportunities are. Yes. I mean you kind of characterized it. Nobody particularly likes to have price increases. At the same time, they want their current team to be well paid and well respected. So -- and they realize that thatâs not for free. And so I think that -- this is an industry that is populated by big boys and girls, and weâre certainly not mega tech companies that walk in and say, 25% more, take or leave it. Thatâs not our MO. And so they know that weâre really just passing on the inflation thatâs hitting us. And our guess is, is that theyâre trying to pass on expense increases that they have. So itâs a natural cycle, and you do it with as much sensitivity as you can and with a little bit of determination and persistence. So I think itâs going pretty well, and I think our people understand that these are the things that are going to kind of maintain our bonus structure and our ability to compensate well. Well, if people donât come into the office, which they donât, I would say theyâre related, right? So we donât need real estate footprint that we have, and weâre doing much more of a hoteling concept rather than everybody having their office or their own space. So thatâs just changed the way we work, and weâre trying to be as flexible as we can be as long as we can maintain customer service and be able to hit our deliverables and meet our growth targets. But yes, for sure, theyâre related. Iâm sorry, can you repeat that? I think what Rahul said earlier about in these kind of tumultuous times, people like quality. We think thatâs going to help us over the next couple of years. Thereâs been an awful lot of acquisitions in the fund services space and extremely high prices paid and SS&C has not been much of a participant in that.

And I think they kind of -- a couple of million dollars in operating losses. We expect them to move to profitability in the second half of this year and probably end the year at about 10%. We think next year, theyâd be up to about 25% and then around 40% in 2024, which are our corporate averages, and weâre pretty optimistic. And weâre really optimistic about what itâs going to do for our own business besides all the customers weâre going to be able to really help. Yes.

            "content": "Thank you. Results for the second quarter were GAAP revenues of $1,328.7 billion, GAAP net income of $110.6 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.42. Adjusted revenues were $1,330 million, including the impact of the adoption of revenue standard 606 and for acquired deferred revenue adjustments for the acquisition. Adjusted net income was $289.6 million. Adjusted revenue was up 5.5%. Adjusted operating income decreased 8.2% and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.10, an 11.3% decrease over Q2 2021. Adjusted revenue increased $69 million or 5.5% in Q2. Our acquisitions contributed $65.6 million. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $24 million or 1.9% in the quarter. Adjusted organic revenue increased on a constant currency basis was 2.2%. We had strength across several product lines, including Alternatives, Intralinks, Ads and the Advent businesses. Ad strength was impacted by weakness in our GIDS transfer agency business and health care businesses. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $455.3 million, a decrease of $40.5 million or 8.2% in the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted operating margins were 34.2% in the second quarter of â22 compared to 39.3% in the second quarter of 2021. Expenses increased 8.1% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $67.8 million in expenses and foreign currency decreased costs by $20.6 million. Our cost structure was impacted by wage inflation, high recruiting costs, and higher staff to support our businesses. Net interest expense for the second quarter was $67.7 million and includes $3.9 million of noncash amortized financing costs and OID. The average rate in the quarter, including the senior notes was 3.45% compared to 3.02% in the second quarter of 2021. We recorded a GAAP tax provision of $45.2 million or 29.1% of pretax income. Adjusted net income, as defined in Note 4 in the earnings release was $289.6 million and adjusted EPS was $1.10. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares decreased to $263.9 million from $267.6 million in Q1. The impact of option exercises was offset by the decrease in the average share price during the quarter. On our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the second quarter with $438.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $7.4 million of gross debt. Net debt has defined our credit agreement, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $148.3 million held by DomaniRx was $7.1 billion as of June 30. Operating cash flow in the 6 months ended June 30 was $447.5 million, a $114.8 million decrease compared to the same period in 2021. During the 3 months ended June 30, we paid down $234.7 million of debt. Operating cash flows were down as a result of several factors, including payment of transaction expenses associated with the Blue Prism acquisition of approximately $67 million, which includes amounts paid by Blue Prism in the post-acquisition period and our operating activities compared to last year. Overall, for acquisitions year-to-date, weâve paid $1.597 billion, that includes Blue Prism, Hubwise, OâShares and MineralWare and that number is net of cash acquired. Treasury stock buybacks were $170.9 million for purchase of 2.3 million shares in the 6 months. We did not buy any shares in the second quarter of 2022. In the 6 months, weâve declared and paid $102.4 million of common stock to adds as compared to $82.1 million last year, an increase of 24.6%. Total interest paid in the quarter was $112.6 million, and that compares to $97.8 million in 2021. In the 6 months this year, weâve paid $156.5 million of income taxes compared to $144.2 million in the same period last year. Our accounts receivable DSO ticked up a little in the quarter up to 55.9 days compared to 52.7 days as of March 2022. Capital expenditures and capitalized software were totaled $85.9 million or 3.3% of adjusted revenue. Spending was predominantly for capitalized software and IT infrastructure. In our LTM consolidated EBITDA that we use for covenant compliance was $2.456 billion as of June. And based on a net debt of $7.1 million, our total leverage ratio was 3.45x and secured leverage 2.48x as of June 30. On outlook for the remainder of the year, a couple of -- Iâll go through a couple of assumptions. We have assumed that foreign currency exchange will be at current levels for the remainder of the year. Weâve assumed average interest rates will increase 100 bps in the third quarter, an additional 50 bps in the fourth quarter. We expect to reduce our cost structure through staff reductions, productivity improvement, facility reduction and controlling variable expenses to improve our operating margins. And weâll continue to invest in our business in the long term with capital expenditures and cap software of approximately 3.4%. On cash flow, we will focus on improving our working capital requirements to generate cash. In addition, we are recapitalizing one of our real estate joint ventures to generate approximately $70 million of cash distribution. I would also assume weâll continue to allocate free cash flow to both debt and stock buyback and weâll use a tax rate of 26% on an adjusted basis. So for the third quarter of 2022, we expect revenues in the range of $1.324 billion to $1.364 billion. That will result in adjusted organic growth in the range of 1.6% to 4.8%. Adjusted net income in the range of $302 million to $318 million, and diluted shares in the range of $263.2 million, $262.7 million. For the full year of 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $5.320 billion to $5.406 billion. Adjusted organic growth in the range of 0.6% to 4.8%, adjusted net income in the range of $1.256 billion to $1.297 billion and diluted shares in the range of $264.6 million to $263.6 million. And on operating cash flow for the full year, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $1.180 billion to $1.220 billion. And Iâll turn it over to Bill for final comments. Thank you. For the second quarter?\nPatrick OâShaughnessy: Just in general, but I mean, in the second quarter, if you have that, but just in general, dollars. Yes. I mean in the second quarter, the impact of the EPS was probably somewhere around $0.01 to $0.015 negative to EPS. And I would suspect itâd be -- based on where current exchange rates are today, itâd be pretty similar in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Yes. I think if you look at the baseline costs for Q2, weâve got in the back half of the year about $50 million in cost reductions, of which you think about $25 million have already been completed. And then the rest is mostly reducing -- continuing to reduce facilities and productivity improvement with the Blue Prism product and then holding back as much as possible on other discretionary spending."

            "name": "Rahul Kanwar",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Our business remains resilient in the face of macroeconomic challenges that manifested in Q2. As you noted, Bill, foreign exchange headwinds impacted our international business with the largest impact to our European agency and wealth revenue streams. Intralinks is also seeing some muting in the demand environment due to a reduction in M&A volumes, but grew 14.2% in Q2. The Alternatives business demonstrated our long-standing thesis that diversification among fund types, asset classes and our commercial models gives us a strong hedge against market pressures. The Alternatives business grew nicely despite some impact to new fund launches and fund inflows. GoCentral continues to roll out new functionality, enabling more efficiencies in daily processing and NABs and providing an important market differentiator in our sales process. We now have 69 clients on GoCentral in production, totaling 1,500 funds with an approximate AUM of over $300 billion. As in our Financial Markets business had a strong quarter in the wake of market volatility and are well positioned to take advantage of shifting investment strategies given the breadth of our product offering. DomaniRx joint venture also notes continues to make progress. The new cloud-based system can now successfully execute a financial cycle, and we have completed the initial build and configuration of the API gateway and developer portal. We have accelerated our go-to-market plans and DomaniRx can now be delivered in the modular fashion sold as individual products, including finance, drug management and communications hub for existing SS&C health clients and prospects starting in Q4 2022. SS&C private markets grew 15% in the second quarter despite a slowdown in fundraising following several years of elevated activity. Prospects and clients and private markets are more than ever looking to partner with key service providers that can drive efficiencies utilizing technology, expertise and data. Private credit and hybrid funds are a particularly attractive subsegment. We continue to innovate in this space incorporating Geneva and other leading technologies and have multiple large private credit deals in the pipeline. Now I will mention some key deals for Q2. A $42 billion AUM hedge fund, an existing Geneva user chose SS&Câs tax optimizer to replace a big floor accounting firm solution. An existing retirement client extended their TRAC-4 account record-keeping services with SS&C to service a recently acquired business, an existing GIDS client added SS&C event center services, a large customer added our transfer agency services for retail alternatives for their nontraded real estate investment trust. An existing customer extended their Silvan, Porsche and Recon licenses to a newly acquired division, significantly improving their workflow. An investment manager in Australia is seeking to transform its operating model to gain operational efficiency and provide improved services shows SS&Câs Aloha due to its advanced technology and our global wealth expertise. A large U.S. insurer chose SS&Câs Singularity after a multiyear sales process. The Dutch private equity firm launching a registered investment fund for the first time chose SS&C for interval fund services and retail all transfer agency services. I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials. Yes. I think where we have CPI, obviously, weâre in the range of -- itâs CPI plus 3, CPI plus 4 and some of those numbers look like anywhere between 7% and 10%. Weâre also doing -- going back to customers as weâve talked about with price increases, where contracts are renewing or where just in the context of the inflationary environment makes sense. And in general, I would say weâre targeting 5 to 7 or higher percentage increases. Now this is an ongoing conversation and in some cases, weâll end up a little better. And in some cases, weâll end up a little bit worse. And as Bill noted, some of that has already been reflected in the future forecast. Sure. I think what weâre seeing is what we tend to see in periods of market volatility and when people come into pressure, which is more viewed as the leader in the fund administration space and in the hedge fund space as well as private equity. And so we actually tend to perform better in terms of market share in these kinds of environments. We saw that in the financial crisis in â08, â09, and weâre seeing that again. So as you know, there arenât as many new launches. And the ones that are arenât as large, but most of our revenue capture is new clients and conversions and takeaways as opposed to new launches, which take generally some period of time before they become material to us. And so that process is going pretty well, and weâre winning our share of whatâs out there in the marketplace. And if anything strengthening and we expect that as things turn around, that will be pretty positive for us."

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and can also be accessed on our website. 01:30 These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of today, April 28, 2022. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in today's earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. Also in the third quarter 2021, we entered into a joint venture named DomaniRx, LLC, which we are the majority interest holder and primary beneficiary. All earnings figures discussed today, including operating income, EBITDA, net income and EPS are attributable to SS&C based on the ownership interest retained by SS&C. 02:27 I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stone: 02:31 Thanks everyone for joining. Our results for the first quarter were $1,296 million and adjusted revenue, up 4.9% and $1.25 and adjusted diluted earnings per share up 5.9%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $514.9 million for the quarter, the highest first quarter in our 35-year history. Our EBITDA margin was 39.8%. 02:58 Our first quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 4.3%, our alternatives Intralinks, and Advent businesses were the growth leaders for the quarter. Ex the impact of our healthcare business, our Q1 2022 organic growth in financial service, which is over 90% of our revenue was 5.9%. SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $183.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. In the quarter, we bought back 2.3 million shares in the average price of $75.22, per share for an total of $170.9 million. We also use cash on help -- on hand to help fund the acquisition of Blue Prism and Hubwise, which both closed in March. Our consolidated net leverage ratio now stands at 3.48 and our net secured leverage ratio is 2.51. We expect to reduce our gross leverage to 3.0 by the end of the year, while remaining active with our share repurchase program. 04:01 These are exceptional numbers given the global uncertainty and resultant hesitancy of our customers. We're excited to add Blue Prism team and their automation capabilities in the SS&C's -- Blue Prism will continue growing revenues at 15% to 20% with the potential to accelerate with its successful cross sale initiatives. We estimate the enterprise grade intelligent automation market to be in excess of $150 billion based off McKenzie's estimate 30% of all roles can be automated. 04:33 Companies across the world can due to struggle with labor market, and we are in a great position to capitalize on this disruption. Currently Blue Prism like most fast growing new technology companies is operating at a loss. Through revenue growth and cost controls we expect 15% to 20% EBITDA margin exiting 2023 and 30% to 40% EBITDA margin exiting 2024. 4:57 I'll now turn the call over to Rahul discuss the quarter in more detail.\nRahul Kanwar: 05:02 Thanks, Bill. We had a good quarter across the board, led by strong performance from Advent, Intralinks and alternatives fund administration. The Alternatives business continues to strengthen for market driven gains and internal development efforts, investor allocations to hedge funds are at all time highs and assets under administration continue to grow despite market volatility. We remain focused on extending the depth and breadth of our technological capabilities. GoCentral and Treasury Management Solutions, both launched this quarter have generated significant interest already. GoCentral utilizing AI and RPA Technology throughout will contribute to our win rates going forward, as well as advancing the automation journey across all client operations. 05:46 Our private markets, and Advent teams have been closely partnering to enhance a holistic Operating and Technology model and support of hybrid in credit funds. This new offering marries Geneva’s core technology capabilities and private markets administration services in a manner that offers clients flexible delivery models. In Q2, we expect to close our first combined deal and have several large prospects in the pipeline targeted for later this year. 06:13 Intralinks remain strong in both M&A and alternatives coming off of 2022s record breaking M&A environment. We continue to take market share and anticipate steady continuation of deal volume for the remainder of the year. As expected healthcare revenue declined 15.5% in the quarter, we're investing heavily in DomaniRx and we continue to move towards the development of a cloud native, API-driven claims adjudication platform based off the best experience of ourselves and the other two founding partners. With the upcoming launch of DomaniRx and the interest due to this new technology has generated, we expect a strong recovery in 2023. 06:53 Now, I will mention some key deals for Q1. A 5 billion broker dealer chose Black Diamond, due to our superior service and support model over competitors, as well as our trading and rebalancing functionality, an existing  client a top U.S. mutual fund expanded their relationship with our event center solution. One of our largest mutual fund clients expanded their transfer agency BPO services. A 14 billion hedge fund an existing Geneva client chose our as  in Fixed Link solutions, they viewed as in Geneva both as Tier 1 platforms and found the two together to be an extremely powerful solution. 07:31 A $1 billion AUA real assets fund chose us suite of SS&C private market services, including investor tax and fund services, because of our expertise and various asset types and fund structures. 07:43 I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials.\nPatrick Pedonti: 07:47 Thank you. The results for the first quarter were GAAP revenues of $1,295 million, GAAP net income $172.1 million and diluted GAAP EPS of $0.64. On an adjusted basis, revenue was $1,296 million, including the impact of the adoption of the revenue standard 606 and for deferred revenue adjustments for prior acquisitions. 08:18 Adjusted revenue was up 4.9%, adjusted operating income attributable to SS&C increased 4.8% and adjusted EPS was $1.25, a 5.9% increase over Q1 2021. Overall, adjusted revenues increased $60.8 million, a 4.9% in Q1, our acquisitions contributed $17.4 million. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $8.7 million or 0.7% in the quarter. 08:53 Adjusted organic revenue increased on a constant currency basis was 4.3%. We had strength across several product lines, including alternatives, Intralinks and the Advent businesses. Adjusted operating income the first quarter was $498.7 million, an increase of $22.9 million or 4.8% during the first quarter of ‘21 09:20 Adjusted operating margins were flat at 38.5% in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2021. Expenses increased 1.7% on a constant currency basis, and acquisitions added $17.6 million in expenses and foreign currency decreased costs by $7.8 million. Consolidated EBITDA, which is defined in Note 3 in our earnings release was $514.9 million or 39.7% of revenue, an increase of $23 million or 4.7% from Q1 2021. 10:02 Net interest expense for the quarter was $49.3 million, and includes $2.6 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID. The average rate in the quarter for our credit facility and senior notes was 3.11%, compared to 3.01% in the first quarter of ’21. We recorded a GAAP tax provision of $63.5 million or 27% of pre-tax income. 10:33 Adjusted net income is defined in Note 4 for earnings release was $334.4 million and adjusted EPS was $1.25. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares increased to 267.6 million from 267 in Q4 ’21. The impact of option exercises and increase in the average share price partially offset by share repurchases. 11:09 On the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the first quarter with 558 million of cash and cash equivalents and 7.6 billion of gross debt. SS&C's net debt defined in our credit agreement excludes cash and cash equivalents of $145 million held at the DomaniRx JV. 11:33 So the net was -- the net debt was $7.2 billion as of March 31. Operating cash flow for the three months ended March was $183.5 million, $2.2 million decrease, compared to the same period in 2021. A couple of highlights in the first quarter, our net borrowings $1,583 million, compared to net borrowings of $70 million in 2021 period. 12:06 In the quarter we paid $1,553 million for the Blue Prism and Hubwise acquisition net of cash acquired. To fund the Hubwise acquisition we borrowed two incremental loans for a total of $1,530 million that mature in March 2029 and bear interest at sulfur (ph) plus 2.25% with a 50 bps sulfur floor. 12:36 Treasury stock buybacks were $170.9 million for purchases of 2.3 million shares at an average price of $75.22. And in July 2021, the Board authorized, up to 1 billion of stock buybacks in the program to-date treasury stock buybacks totaled $333.7 million repurchase of 4.4 million shares. In the quarter we declared and paid a $51.1 million common stock dividend, an increase of 24% from last year. We paid income taxes of $42 million, compared to $42.5 million in the first quarter of ’21. 13:25 Our accounts receivable DSO uptick a little bit in the quarter, up to 52.7 days, compared to 49.5 days as of December 2021. Capital expenditures and capitalized software were $35.6 million or approximately 2.7% of adjusted revenue and the spending was predominantly for internal use capitalized software and our IT infrastructure. 13:55 On an LTM consolidated -- our LTM consolidated EBITDA we used for covenant compliance was $2,063.5 million as of March 2022. Based on a new debt -- based on a net debt of $7.2 billion total leverage ratio was $3.48 and our secured leverage ratio was $2.51. 14:23 An outlook for the remainder of the year, I’ll first cover a few assumptions we've made, we'll continue focusing on our client service and our retention rates -- client retention rates will continue to be in the range of most recent results. We have assumed foreign currency exchange will be at current levels for the remainder of the year and that will impact revenue negatively by approximately $43 million in Q3 through Q4. 14:56 Our recent acquisitions of Blue Prism and Hubwise will contribute approximately $203 million of revenue for the remainder of the year. And on that basis adjusted organic growth for the year will be in the range 2.4% to 5.6%, and adjusted organic growth in Q2 in the range of 1.7% to 4.8%. 15:21 On interest rates, we have assumed that near-term LIBOR will be about 70 bps and the spread on our credit agreement is 175 bps and 225 bps on the new facility, we put in place for Blue Prism acquisition. And we expect LIBOR rates to increase approximately 100 bps, through the rest of the year. This will impact our expected interest cost by about $0.06, compared to previous guidance. 16:00 Blue Prism will impact EPS -- the dilution of about $0.09 for the year, including the impact of the new debt facility. We expect that staff costs to increase to the continued wage inflation and impact Q2 operating results. We will manage our expenses in the second half of the year by controlling variable expenses and maintaining our operating margins. We'll continue to use our free cash flow to pay both pay down debt and stock buybacks. And we have assumed a tax rate of 26% and adjusted basis for the year. 16:44 So in summary, for the second quarter of 2022, we expect revenue range of $1,328 million to $1,368 million, diluted shares in the range of $267.2 million to $266.7 million and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.13 to $1.19. For the full-year ’22, we expect revenue in the range of $5,350 million to $5,510 million, diluted shares in the range of $268 million to $266.4 million and adjusted EPS in the range of $4.99 to $5.21. Now we expect cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1,315 to $1,375 million. 17:37 And I’ll turn it over back to Bill for final comments.\nBill Stone: 17:48 Thanks, Patrick, and as Patrick just mentioned, we're guiding organic revenue growth of 4% for the year and reducing our EPS guidance due to the dilution from Blue Prism and the interest rate increases. The start 2022 has been a challenging environment for our clients. Uncertainty and instability in the world and the labor force have made our clients and prospects more hesitant to sign deals. This uncertainty can also be a catalyst for change. 18:15 The need for operational stability from a reliable trusted provider. We are aggressively investing in our sales force and R&D efforts to capture this opportunity. GoCentral singularity  a low high treasury management and others are rolling out now. Cost will be controlled through reduced incremental hiring, utilizing AI and automation, including Blue Prism digital workers, to accomplish this and a reduction in our global real estate footprint. 18:45 And I'll now open it up for questions.\nOperator: 18:51 Thank you.  We'll take our first question from Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlex Kramm: 19:12 Yes, hey good evening everyone. Maybe just starting on the DST side here growth of 0.9% in the quarter decels quarter-over-quarter, I heard you on the selling environment and obviously it's a lot of uncertainty in the world. But I would also say that coming into this year, we still had traditional asset managers, I think do very well on the back off multi-year highs and equity markets, et cetera. So I think your customer base is actually doing fairly well. So just wondering what in particular you're seeing at DST and in this environment if we can see that growth rate kind of tick up again in that business? Thanks.\nBill Stone: 19:59 Well, I'll give a shot Alex and I have Rahul comment that we continue to roll out additional capabilities in our DST businesses and we have lots of large opportunities and it comes down to not only close in those opportunities, but also then giving those clients live. So there is a bunch of pent up revenue, then hopefully we will start to roll into those financial statements in the second half of 2022. But there are large scale organizations and while we have teams working on it, we also rely on the clients to help us in that process and these uncertainties are not helping them move more quickly. And then, Rahul do you have any other color?\nRahul Kanwar: Well I -- the one thing I'd add also is these are -- these customers are some of our biggest customers across the company. So the DST relationships are strategic for us and they frequently buy from us in other areas, including Alternatives, Advent and others and obviously that's not reflected in the DST Financial Services line, but it does speak to the value of the relationship.\nAlex Kramm: 21:22 Fair point. Thank you for that. And then maybe just on the margin real quick, clearly margins flat year-over-year, I think last quarter you already talked about some inflationary pressure, I think you brought this up again today. So just wondering are things a little bit tougher than you expect this given the big resignation that everybody talks about or and how you -- how do you think it's going to continue to impact or how are you going to navigate that environment?\nBill Stone: 21:55 Well, I think that, that's a great question, Alex, and we are instituting all kinds of things to improve our retention and be able to create an environment where we are a employer of choice. But that there is wage inflation and that, you know, the overall power has really moved from capital to labor and while I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I think for the short-term adjusting your sights on going for price increases and being able to move inflationary costs through to the revenue side, I think is what we're working on and being sensitive to our employees and making sure that we remain a employer of choice. Q - Alex Kramm 22:59 All right, great. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you.\nOperator: 23:04  and we'll take our next question from Andrew Schmidt with Citi.\nAndrew Schmidt: 23:11 Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Good to see the resiliency here. First, I just had a question on Blue Prism, just back to the envelope it looks like there should be approaching 100% or 1% a point accretive on a pro forma basis, we think about just total growth. Just want to make sure I have that correct? And then if you could talk a little bit about just the opportunity to plug Blue Prism into the SS&C direct sales force, because it seems like that's one of the big river in opportunity just timeframe and process there, that would be helpful. Thanks a lot.\nBill Stone: 23:51 Rahul, you want to take that?\nRahul Kanwar: 23:54 Yes, so maybe Patrick can comment on the first one on the accretive, Bill and -- yes.\nPatrick Pedonti: 24:02 I think your question was around revenue, right? How much does that add to revenue growth?\nAndrew Schmidt: 24:06 Yes, right. On a pro forma basis, yes.\nPatrick Pedonti: 24:11 Yes, so I think what we have in our financials for this year and our forecast is the first quarter had about $10.8 million and that just represents a half a month and then for the remainder of the year, I think we're estimating somewhere around $196 million of revenue for the second, third and fourth quarters.\nAndrew Schmidt: 24:39 Right, I guess --\nRahul Kanwar: 24:40 And then I think to the second, yes sorry.\nAndrew Schmidt: 24:41 Yes, I was going to say, I guess the question is more around just combined company growth rate, it seems like it should obviously is accretive, but the growth, but it seems like it should be approaching that kind of 100 basis point accretion when obviously when we have this in the base 2023. Just want to make sure that's the right ballpark?\nBill Stone: You know, if you think about it right, it's roughly we're getting $200 million in 10-months, right. So let's call it $230 million or something like that and add the 20% growth rate that's $46 million, which would be pretty close to 1%. So that's how we will think about it as well.\nAndrew Schmidt: 25:28 Great. Perfect, thank you for that.\nRahul Kanwar: 25:32 And then I think to the second part of the question. Yes, so the second part of the question, we're actually pretty excited about the opportunity, we obviously have 18,000 clients most of whom I’d say virtually all of them are candidates to have greater automation and they have digital workers right? So that cross-sell component is pretty important to us. We also have a wealth of direct applications ourselves whether in our outsourcing business we were performing many of the past that folks would look to have digital workers do. So we're working hard and our teams are working hard on coming up with applications for, if you're a hedge fund, or an insurance company here is something we might be able to do for you using this technology. And rolling that out, we think will be pretty powerful. So that's all underway.\nAndrew Schmidt: 26:22 Perfect. Appreciate that. And then when we think about just the core business Intralinks from a growth perspective was a real surprise in my perspective given the M&A volumes out there. It seems like a lot of that is due to share gain. Maybe you could talk a little about just the drivers there and how you see that playing out for the full-year from a growth perspective. Thanks.\nRahul Kanwar: 26:49 We have a great business in Intralinks and they continue to find pockets of growth throughout their client base and new clients, and they've done a lot of things with help them the alternatives industry with portals and other things and along those lines information delivery and then obviously they continue to be very strong in the VVR market and M&A in general. So we expect similar growth for the rest of the year.\nAndrew Schmidt: 27:31 Perfect. Thanks Bill, Rahul, Patrick, appreciate the comments.\nOperator: 27:36 We'll take our next from Peter Heckmann with Davidson. Q - Peter Heckmann 27:42 Thanks for taking the question. Can you just remind us of some of the dynamics in the health business. The decline in revenue, the timing of any customer losses and whether that would be fully reflected in the run rate number for the first quarter. And then just remind us how the JV works, yes, if I remember correctly, you want a majority so you're consolidating that with revenue and then have a minority interest coming out. But from your comments it sounds like we're going to start to see that joint venture start to ramp. Would that be from new customers or increased volumes or both?\nBill Stone: 28:23 Yes, so the money is 80% owned by us and 10% owned by each of our partners, and that's right on how we do the accounting on that. We have a lot of interest into money and the platform that we're building is pretty much on track. We hope to roll that out to one of our partners on the 1st of January ‘23 and then the second one on 1st January ‘24, but we also have tremendous interest and others coming in as customers into  as partners. So, we expect revenue to ramp nicely in 2023 through the next five or 10 years. And so we're excited about it. We think it's the first really cloud-based claims adjudication process in the PBM world and we're excited about where we are.\nPeter Heckmann: 29:28 Got it, got it. And then just as regards just the decline in revenue this quarter. Can you remind me and I -- was that a loss of one large customer, or was it an aggregate of several? And if you could just remind me when that actual deconversion happened, if that happened January 1?\nBill Stone: 29:50 Yes, it happened January 1.\nRahul Kanwar: 29:53 And several right, so and that's a total of about 70 million to 80 million and one of them represents about half.\nPeter Heckmann: 30:07 Got it, okay. And then do you think on the own shares acquisition, do you feel like that should close by the end of the summer?\nRahul Kanwar: 30:17 I think scheduled right now little unpredictable, because there is some approval requirements. But I think it's scheduled for the end of June.\nPeter Heckmann: 30:28 Okay. I appreciate it.\nOperator: 30:32 And we'll take our next question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJonathan: 30:38 Hey, this is Jonathan on for James. Thanks for taking the questions. So you had alluded to driving price increases to offset wage inflation. And if I think back to the Analyst Day from last year you talked about, call it 100 basis points of a pricing uplift to drive growth. How are these or price increasing -- price increased conversations going with customers and is that enough to sort of offset the magnitude wage inflation that you're seeing?\nBill Stone: 31:10 Well, I mean, I think it's a process and I think the process is well underway and obviously inflation has ticked up now most month after month since the last five or six months, and so you know, we're planning on raising our prices to be able to cover our increased costs and I think our customers understand, but what's happening across the board for almost all of the vendors. And we're no different and we have a very talented labor force and we're going to make sure that we take care of them and continue to be a very strong and trusted partner.\nJonathan: 31:58 Got it. And a follow-up on the RPA opportunity. How are you thinking about the head count or the magnitude of investment required service the broader RPA platform that you have inclusive of Blue Prism?\nBill Stone: 32:13 Well, we -- again we have a large development organization, we have many, many talented RPA developers, as well as AI and NLP and machine learning. So we have a big staff and Blue Prism complemented great. So we think that in general, we're going to be able to deploy 100s of digital workers and hopefully over the next two or three years, 1,000s of them, which will allow us to grow and not to had the headcount likely would have, if we didn't have such technologies. And I think that's the whole -- holy grail of doing this acquisition is to bring that high power technology that allows you to switch to digital workers for human workers, I mean, it doesn't replace human workers per se in total, but it's certainly augment them in a very, very strong way.\nJonathan: 33:18 Appreciate the color, Bill. Thank you.\nOperator: 33:22 We'll take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: 33:27 Great, thanks so much. Is there any way to think about what the potential revenue opportunity is across your existing client base for Blue Prism? I think we were muted -- obviously 18,000 clients. You know over time -- is there any way to think about what the revenue contribution can be, you know, again across the existing client base?\nBill Stone: 33:55 Rahul, you want to take that?\nRahul Kanwar: 33:57 Yes, sure, Bill, thanks. So it's a huge market, right. And as a multiple of the 200 and change that Blue Prism does, we anticipate that just in our current client base, we probably have 3, 4, 5 times debt amount opportunity and some of the consultants out there are representing this as a $150 billion or more market right and potentially as much as 30% of -- as Bill noted of all the line jobs that are done lend themselves to this kind of technology. So we're just trying we're obviously -- we're mindful off the size of the market. And at the same time, we have to focus on specific things that we can do better than anybody else and Blue Prism already has a number of those in the customers that they have deployed and we're working with them on building out additional use cases and applications.\nKevin McVeigh: 34:52 It's helpful. And then it seems like the revenue retention was up 90 basis points sequentially. Historically, there has been a little seasonality should it state that 96 or how should we think about the revenue retention, I think you said stay around that level. Is that right, I just wanted to confirm that?\nBill Stone: 35:12  around that.\nKevin McVeigh: 35:16 Okay, great. Thank you.\nPatrick Pedonti: 35:18 In the historical range, I assume, over the last couple of years.\nKevin McVeigh: 35:22 Thank you, Patrick.\nOperator: 35:26 All right. We'll take our next question from Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlex Kramm: 35:31 Oh, that was quick, hello again. And just had a couple of follow-ups here, one on the interest expense. Thanks, Patrick for the color in terms of the rising interest rate environment, et cetera. Maybe to make it even easier for some of us, can you actually give us the kind of dollar amounts of interest expense that you expect for the next three quarters as you bake in that rate increase?\nPatrick Pedonti: 35:57 Sure. I think -- including the new debt on Blue Prism, I think, which is about $36 million or $37 million for the year. We talked about to $250 million this year in total.\nAlex Kramm: 36:25 Okay and -- yes in terms of the ramp, I guess it's -- I guess I don't know if you have any assumptions you want to share given that --\nPatrick Pedonti: 36:34 No, I would say, I mean -- yes, I think right now, you know, the average interest rate on our original facility is probably around 2.45% and the new facility is 50 basis points higher than that, because of the spread. And then I would say it goes up another 50 basis points in Q3 and another 50 basis in Q4.\nAlex Kramm: 37:08 Super helpful. Thanks for that. And then just as we think about capital deployment here are you assuming basically mostly pay off debt given the rising interest rate environment or do you still think there is appetite for buybacks as we step through the year. And then, yes, and that's it. And then, sorry, just one last quick one, stock-based comp increased quarter-over-quarter. Is that a good -- any reasons why the big step up I think that was the second highest in a company history and is that a good run rate to think about for now?\nBill Stone: 37:52 Well, Alex, I think it would be -- I'll take part of this, Patrick then turn it to you. Yes, I think we're going to aggressively buy back our stock, we still see it as a financially a quite a bit more effective than buying and paying down debt. Although you know if interest rates continue to rise, then we'll revisit that. But right now, you know, we're going to generate $5 a share in cash and restructuring that 70 bucks or so $69 and plus we pay a 1.2% dividend. I think and so I think economically, it makes a lot more sense to buy back stock. But rising interest rates could change -- for sure. We have tried to move a lot of the cash bonus programs into more equity bonus programs and have them as a complement to the cash and as cash be less of that most of the driver of the bonus program. So I would think that the equity stock-based compensation is probably pretty close to where it will be going forward. And I think that again it's tough labor market out there and we're going to do everything we can in order to reduce attrition as much as we can. And I think we've done a pretty good jump to-date.\nAlex Kramm: 39:22 All right. Helpful. Thanks again.\nOperator: 39:26 We'll take our next question from Chris Donat with Piper Sandler.\nChris Donat: 39:32 Hey, good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions. I had one for Rahul on the alternatives business and it shows the 10.7% growth in alternatives in the first quarter in your slide deck. And then the -- with the private markets growing over 18%, I'm just curious if you can comment on what's driving that strength in private markets. What you see for competition and is this a lot of in-house opportunities shifting to SS&C?\nRahul Kanwar: 40:06 Sure, I think it's a little bit off all of that, but mostly it's a continuation of a trend where folks that had in-house operations as they start new funds. They use us or somebody like us and we would say that the investment that we have made in technology and process over less decade or so is market differentiating. So we have a really strong business, we’re the biggest provider of private market and that's more private equity and real assets funds in the world. And the capability keeps getting better. 40:42 So we're a natural place for many of these funds to come to and it is a combination of these are hard asset classes, particularly in the private lending, private credit and private equity, as well as real assets, so because they’re hard asset classes, there’s a lot of new launches and then there is transfers of internal. So all of that leads to, I think a growth trend that is both positive and we think sustainable.\nChris Donat: 41:07 Okay, got it. And then Bill, just on the health care business your optimism for the future. For this year for that, what's the best way for those us on the outside to track progress there, is that something we'll see a flurry of press releases or will we need to wait till second quarter results or third quarter results. Just how should we try to keep an eye on that one and progress you're making?\nBill Stone: 41:35 Yes, I think as we sign new customers, new partners, we would have press releases. But you know, people who are kicking the tires on the technology and want to make sure that, that we're going to deliver on our milestones and knock on wood, we've done a pretty good job so far. So I think, more to come and I think that these are large scale healthcare organizations, and so there are large chunks of revenue and I think we’ll prove to have been wise to have gone down this path.\nChris Donat: 42:19 Okay, thank you.\nOperator: 42:22 And we'll take our next question from Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Q - Andrew Schmidt 42:28 Hey guys, thanks for taking my follow-ups here. I wanted to ask about the opportunity implement the Blue Prism digital workforce across see client operations. Is there any way to size or think about that opportunity from a productivity perspective? And then, is that included in the Blue Prism margin ramp or is this a separate opportunity? Thanks.\nBill Stone: 42:55 Yes, we would view it as a separate opportunity. I think Blue Prism has a lot of running room and being able to market its products, I have two our client base and then the productivity increases that we get inside SS&C, I think well, really inner to the business units where they deploy Blue Prism. So that was one of the strategic reasons for doing it and I think it's going to be something that really, really strengthens our business.\nAndrew Schmidt: 43:31 That's helpful. Thank you, Bill. And then just on the margin for the year just taking out Blue Prism has that outlook changed at all relative to the prior outlook perhaps contemplating some of the incremental wage and cost pressure? And then how do you feel about just cost being stable from this point forward, just from a -- because obviously we've seen some volatility in some big tick up, so curious if there is more to come more your comfort level there? Thanks a lot.\nBill Stone: 44:06 Yes, I mean we obviously don't have a crystal ball either, so depending on what happens in the marketplace, we're going to have to react and react in a way that is competitiveness. Right now we think we have done the right things and we have to rearrange some of our compensation policies and we're trying to make sure that we're sensitive to our talented workforce. And right now we think we're in reasonable shape, but no rather than have one bonus at the paid the first quarter after the year we're going to spread out some of that bonus, so that we pay part of it in Q2, parts of it in Q3. And then majority of it in the first quarter of ’23. So there's a number of changes that we're making and hopefully being well received by our workforce and that they know that their foremost in our mind and they're our biggest asset. So given the aren’t any more changes in interest rate serve our inflation don't keep going off the charts. I think we're in reasonable shape.\nAndrew Schmidt: 45:28 Got it. Thank you very much, Bill. I appreciate it.\nOperator: 45:32 Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: 45:37 Hey, good afternoon. Question about Blue Prism, how do you guys mechanically cross-sell Blue Prism to your client base. Is it the legacy SS&C salespeople who have is going to added to their  is the team based approach with the legacy Blue Prism people or how is that going to work?\nBill Stone: 45:57 Well, it’s both. Obviously, we're training our current sales force and getting some use cases, right. So you have to have like a digital worker that's called reconciliation or digital work of this call verifier some other -- where we take an expert and they work with an engineer and they create a digital worker and that has a rules-based repetitive capability that, that we then deploy. And so we have to have the use cases, we have to train our sales forces. What that use cases is and we have to kind of use both Blue Prism personnel, as well as our own. But we're pretty optimistic about it and it's something that everybody is interested in, so salespeople like sell stuff, whether he buy wants to buy. So I think we feel pretty strongly that the adoption will be, will be -- swifter than usual, I think.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: 47:04 Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then a question for Patrick your full-year adjusted net income outlook decreased by, I believe, its $48 million at the midpoint relative to your previous outlook. But the operating cash flow outlook decreased by $130 million at the midpoint. What's driving that differential?\nPatrick Pedonti: 47:24 There’s a couple of things that are driving the differential, one is I think Bill mentioned that we are now going to institute for some employees a quarterly bonus, so instead of having an annual bonus for this year in the first quarter of ’23, we’re going to make some payments this year, so that's affecting cash flow, succeed $80 million and then there were about $20 million or $25 million of deal costs related to Blue Prism acquisition and financing that are hitting the cash flow.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: 48:02 Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: 48:08 And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Bill Stone for any additional or closing remarks.\nBill Stone: 48:16 Well, again, we appreciate you all being on the call today and we look forward to executing over the next several months and talking to you at the end of the second quarter. Thanks a lot. Bye.\nOperator: 48:31 And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "02:31 Thanks everyone for joining. Our results for the first quarter were $1,296 million and adjusted revenue, up 4.9% and $1.25 and adjusted diluted earnings per share up 5.9%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $514.9 million for the quarter, the highest first quarter in our 35-year history. Our EBITDA margin was 39.8%. 02:58 Our first quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 4.3%, our alternatives Intralinks, and Advent businesses were the growth leaders for the quarter. Ex the impact of our healthcare business, our Q1 2022 organic growth in financial service, which is over 90% of our revenue was 5.9%. SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $183.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. In the quarter, we bought back 2.3 million shares in the average price of $75.22, per share for an total of $170.9 million. We also use cash on help -- on hand to help fund the acquisition of Blue Prism and Hubwise, which both closed in March. Our consolidated net leverage ratio now stands at 3.48 and our net secured leverage ratio is 2.51. We expect to reduce our gross leverage to 3.0 by the end of the year, while remaining active with our share repurchase program. 04:01 These are exceptional numbers given the global uncertainty and resultant hesitancy of our customers. We're excited to add Blue Prism team and their automation capabilities in the SS&C's -- Blue Prism will continue growing revenues at 15% to 20% with the potential to accelerate with its successful cross sale initiatives. We estimate the enterprise grade intelligent automation market to be in excess of $150 billion based off McKenzie's estimate 30% of all roles can be automated. 04:33 Companies across the world can due to struggle with labor market, and we are in a great position to capitalize on this disruption. Currently Blue Prism like most fast growing new technology companies is operating at a loss. Through revenue growth and cost controls we expect 15% to 20% EBITDA margin exiting 2023 and 30% to 40% EBITDA margin exiting 2024. 4:57 I'll now turn the call over to Rahul discuss the quarter in more detail. 17:48 Thanks, Patrick, and as Patrick just mentioned, we're guiding organic revenue growth of 4% for the year and reducing our EPS guidance due to the dilution from Blue Prism and the interest rate increases. The start 2022 has been a challenging environment for our clients. Uncertainty and instability in the world and the labor force have made our clients and prospects more hesitant to sign deals. This uncertainty can also be a catalyst for change. 18:15 The need for operational stability from a reliable trusted provider. We are aggressively investing in our sales force and R&D efforts to capture this opportunity. GoCentral singularity  a low high treasury management and others are rolling out now. Cost will be controlled through reduced incremental hiring, utilizing AI and automation, including Blue Prism digital workers, to accomplish this and a reduction in our global real estate footprint. 18:45 And I'll now open it up for questions. 19:59 Well, I'll give a shot Alex and I have Rahul comment that we continue to roll out additional capabilities in our DST businesses and we have lots of large opportunities and it comes down to not only close in those opportunities, but also then giving those clients live. So there is a bunch of pent up revenue, then hopefully we will start to roll into those financial statements in the second half of 2022. But there are large scale organizations and while we have teams working on it, we also rely on the clients to help us in that process and these uncertainties are not helping them move more quickly. And then, Rahul do you have any other color? 21:55 Well, I think that, that's a great question, Alex, and we are instituting all kinds of things to improve our retention and be able to create an environment where we are a employer of choice. But that there is wage inflation and that, you know, the overall power has really moved from capital to labor and while I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I think for the short-term adjusting your sights on going for price increases and being able to move inflationary costs through to the revenue side, I think is what we're working on and being sensitive to our employees and making sure that we remain a employer of choice. Q - Alex Kramm 22:59 All right, great. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you. 23:51 Rahul, you want to take that? You know, if you think about it right, it's roughly we're getting $200 million in 10-months, right. So let's call it $230 million or something like that and add the 20% growth rate that's $46 million, which would be pretty close to 1%. So that's how we will think about it as well. 28:23 Yes, so the money is 80% owned by us and 10% owned by each of our partners, and that's right on how we do the accounting on that. We have a lot of interest into money and the platform that we're building is pretty much on track. We hope to roll that out to one of our partners on the 1st of January ‘23 and then the second one on 1st January ‘24, but we also have tremendous interest and others coming in as customers into  as partners. So, we expect revenue to ramp nicely in 2023 through the next five or 10 years. And so we're excited about it. We think it's the first really cloud-based claims adjudication process in the PBM world and we're excited about where we are. 29:50 Yes, it happened January 1. 31:10 Well, I mean, I think it's a process and I think the process is well underway and obviously inflation has ticked up now most month after month since the last five or six months, and so you know, we're planning on raising our prices to be able to cover our increased costs and I think our customers understand, but what's happening across the board for almost all of the vendors. And we're no different and we have a very talented labor force and we're going to make sure that we take care of them and continue to be a very strong and trusted partner. 32:13 Well, we -- again we have a large development organization, we have many, many talented RPA developers, as well as AI and NLP and machine learning. So we have a big staff and Blue Prism complemented great. So we think that in general, we're going to be able to deploy 100s of digital workers and hopefully over the next two or three years, 1,000s of them, which will allow us to grow and not to had the headcount likely would have, if we didn't have such technologies. And I think that's the whole -- holy grail of doing this acquisition is to bring that high power technology that allows you to switch to digital workers for human workers, I mean, it doesn't replace human workers per se in total, but it's certainly augment them in a very, very strong way. 33:55 Rahul, you want to take that? 35:12  around that. 37:52 Well, Alex, I think it would be -- I'll take part of this, Patrick then turn it to you. Yes, I think we're going to aggressively buy back our stock, we still see it as a financially a quite a bit more effective than buying and paying down debt. Although you know if interest rates continue to rise, then we'll revisit that. But right now, you know, we're going to generate $5 a share in cash and restructuring that 70 bucks or so $69 and plus we pay a 1.2% dividend. I think and so I think economically, it makes a lot more sense to buy back stock. But rising interest rates could change -- for sure. We have tried to move a lot of the cash bonus programs into more equity bonus programs and have them as a complement to the cash and as cash be less of that most of the driver of the bonus program. So I would think that the equity stock-based compensation is probably pretty close to where it will be going forward. And I think that again it's tough labor market out there and we're going to do everything we can in order to reduce attrition as much as we can. And I think we've done a pretty good jump to-date. 41:35 Yes, I think as we sign new customers, new partners, we would have press releases. But you know, people who are kicking the tires on the technology and want to make sure that, that we're going to deliver on our milestones and knock on wood, we've done a pretty good job so far. So I think, more to come and I think that these are large scale healthcare organizations, and so there are large chunks of revenue and I think we'll prove to have been wise to have gone down this path. 42:55 Yes, we would view it as a separate opportunity.

So that was one of the strategic reasons for doing it and I think it's going to be something that really, really strengthens our business. 44:06 Yes, I mean we obviously don't have a crystal ball either, so depending on what happens in the marketplace, we're going to have to react and react in a way that is competitiveness. Right now we think we have done the right things and we have to rearrange some of our compensation policies and we're trying to make sure that we're sensitive to our talented workforce.

            "content": "07:47 Thank you. The results for the first quarter were GAAP revenues of $1,295 million, GAAP net income $172.1 million and diluted GAAP EPS of $0.64. On an adjusted basis, revenue was $1,296 million, including the impact of the adoption of the revenue standard 606 and for deferred revenue adjustments for prior acquisitions. 08:18 Adjusted revenue was up 4.9%, adjusted operating income attributable to SS&C increased 4.8% and adjusted EPS was $1.25, a 5.9% increase over Q1 2021. Overall, adjusted revenues increased $60.8 million, a 4.9% in Q1, our acquisitions contributed $17.4 million. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $8.7 million or 0.7% in the quarter. 08:53 Adjusted organic revenue increased on a constant currency basis was 4.3%. We had strength across several product lines, including alternatives, Intralinks and the Advent businesses. Adjusted operating income the first quarter was $498.7 million, an increase of $22.9 million or 4.8% during the first quarter of ‘21 09:20 Adjusted operating margins were flat at 38.5% in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2021. Expenses increased 1.7% on a constant currency basis, and acquisitions added $17.6 million in expenses and foreign currency decreased costs by $7.8 million. Consolidated EBITDA, which is defined in Note 3 in our earnings release was $514.9 million or 39.7% of revenue, an increase of $23 million or 4.7% from Q1 2021. 10:02 Net interest expense for the quarter was $49.3 million, and includes $2.6 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID. The average rate in the quarter for our credit facility and senior notes was 3.11%, compared to 3.01% in the first quarter of '21. We recorded a GAAP tax provision of $63.5 million or 27% of pre-tax income. 10:33 Adjusted net income is defined in Note 4 for earnings release was $334.4 million and adjusted EPS was $1.25. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares increased to 267.6 million from 267 in Q4 '21. The impact of option exercises and increase in the average share price partially offset by share repurchases. 11:09 On the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the first quarter with 558 million of cash and cash equivalents and 7.6 billion of gross debt. SS&C's net debt defined in our credit agreement excludes cash and cash equivalents of $145 million held at the DomaniRx JV. 11:33 So the net was -- the net debt was $7.2 billion as of March 31. Operating cash flow for the three months ended March was $183.5 million, $2.2 million decrease, compared to the same period in 2021. A couple of highlights in the first quarter, our net borrowings $1,583 million, compared to net borrowings of $70 million in 2021 period. 12:06 In the quarter we paid $1,553 million for the Blue Prism and Hubwise acquisition net of cash acquired. To fund the Hubwise acquisition we borrowed two incremental loans for a total of $1,530 million that mature in March 2029 and bear interest at sulfur (ph) plus 2.25% with a 50 bps sulfur floor. 12:36 Treasury stock buybacks were $170.9 million for purchases of 2.3 million shares at an average price of $75.22. And in July 2021, the Board authorized, up to 1 billion of stock buybacks in the program to-date treasury stock buybacks totaled $333.7 million repurchase of 4.4 million shares. In the quarter we declared and paid a $51.1 million common stock dividend, an increase of 24% from last year. We paid income taxes of $42 million, compared to $42.5 million in the first quarter of '21. 13:25 Our accounts receivable DSO uptick a little bit in the quarter, up to 52.7 days, compared to 49.5 days as of December 2021. Capital expenditures and capitalized software were $35.6 million or approximately 2.7% of adjusted revenue and the spending was predominantly for internal use capitalized software and our IT infrastructure. 13:55 On an LTM consolidated -- our LTM consolidated EBITDA we used for covenant compliance was $2,063.5 million as of March 2022. Based on a new debt -- based on a net debt of $7.2 billion total leverage ratio was $3.48 and our secured leverage ratio was $2.51. 14:23 An outlook for the remainder of the year, I'll first cover a few assumptions we've made, we'll continue focusing on our client service and our retention rates -- client retention rates will continue to be in the range of most recent results. We have assumed foreign currency exchange will be at current levels for the remainder of the year and that will impact revenue negatively by approximately $43 million in Q3 through Q4. 14:56 Our recent acquisitions of Blue Prism and Hubwise will contribute approximately $203 million of revenue for the remainder of the year. And on that basis adjusted organic growth for the year will be in the range 2.4% to 5.6%, and adjusted organic growth in Q2 in the range of 1.7% to 4.8%. 15:21 On interest rates, we have assumed that near-term LIBOR will be about 70 bps and the spread on our credit agreement is 175 bps and 225 bps on the new facility, we put in place for Blue Prism acquisition. And we expect LIBOR rates to increase approximately 100 bps, through the rest of the year. This will impact our expected interest cost by about $0.06, compared to previous guidance. 16:00 Blue Prism will impact EPS -- the dilution of about $0.09 for the year, including the impact of the new debt facility. We expect that staff costs to increase to the continued wage inflation and impact Q2 operating results. We will manage our expenses in the second half of the year by controlling variable expenses and maintaining our operating margins. We'll continue to use our free cash flow to pay both pay down debt and stock buybacks. And we have assumed a tax rate of 26% and adjusted basis for the year. 16:44 So in summary, for the second quarter of 2022, we expect revenue range of $1,328 million to $1,368 million, diluted shares in the range of $267.2 million to $266.7 million and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.13 to $1.19. For the full-year '22, we expect revenue in the range of $5,350 million to $5,510 million, diluted shares in the range of $268 million to $266.4 million and adjusted EPS in the range of $4.99 to $5.21. Now we expect cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1,315 to $1,375 million. 17:37 And I'll turn it over back to Bill for final comments. 24:02 I think your question was around revenue, right? How much does that add to revenue growth? 24:11 Yes, so I think what we have in our financials for this year and our forecast is the first quarter had about $10.8 million and that just represents a half a month and then for the remainder of the year, I think we're estimating somewhere around $196 million of revenue for the second, third and fourth quarters. 35:18 In the historical range, I assume, over the last couple of years. 35:57 Sure. I think -- including the new debt on Blue Prism, I think, which is about $36 million or $37 million for the year. We talked about to $250 million this year in total. 36:34 No, I would say, I mean -- yes, I think right now, you know, the average interest rate on our original facility is probably around 2.45% and the new facility is 50 basis points higher than that, because of the spread. And then I would say it goes up another 50 basis points in Q3 and another 50 basis in Q4. 47:24 There's a couple of things that are driving the differential, one is I think Bill mentioned that we are now going to institute for some employees a quarterly bonus, so instead of having an annual bonus for this year in the first quarter of '23, we're going to make some payments this year, so that's affecting cash flow, succeed $80 million and then there were about $20 million or $25 million of deal costs related to Blue Prism acquisition and financing that are hitting the cash flow."

            "name": "Rahul Kanwar",
            "content": "05:02 Thanks, Bill. We had a good quarter across the board, led by strong performance from Advent, Intralinks and alternatives fund administration. The Alternatives business continues to strengthen for market driven gains and internal development efforts, investor allocations to hedge funds are at all time highs and assets under administration continue to grow despite market volatility. We remain focused on extending the depth and breadth of our technological capabilities. GoCentral and Treasury Management Solutions, both launched this quarter have generated significant interest already. GoCentral utilizing AI and RPA Technology throughout will contribute to our win rates going forward, as well as advancing the automation journey across all client operations. 05:46 Our private markets, and Advent teams have been closely partnering to enhance a holistic Operating and Technology model and support of hybrid in credit funds. This new offering marries Geneva's core technology capabilities and private markets administration services in a manner that offers clients flexible delivery models. In Q2, we expect to close our first combined deal and have several large prospects in the pipeline targeted for later this year. 06:13 Intralinks remain strong in both M&A and alternatives coming off of 2022s record breaking M&A environment. We continue to take market share and anticipate steady continuation of deal volume for the remainder of the year. As expected healthcare revenue declined 15.5% in the quarter, we're investing heavily in DomaniRx and we continue to move towards the development of a cloud native, API-driven claims adjudication platform based off the best experience of ourselves and the other two founding partners. With the upcoming launch of DomaniRx and the interest due to this new technology has generated, we expect a strong recovery in 2023. 06:53 Now, I will mention some key deals for Q1. A 5 billion broker dealer chose Black Diamond, due to our superior service and support model over competitors, as well as our trading and rebalancing functionality, an existing  client a top U.S. mutual fund expanded their relationship with our event center solution. One of our largest mutual fund clients expanded their transfer agency BPO services. A 14 billion hedge fund an existing Geneva client chose our as  in Fixed Link solutions, they viewed as in Geneva both as Tier 1 platforms and found the two together to be an extremely powerful solution. 07:31 A $1 billion AUA real assets fund chose us suite of SS&C private market services, including investor tax and fund services, because of our expertise and various asset types and fund structures. 07:43 I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials. Well I -- the one thing I'd add also is these are -- these customers are some of our biggest customers across the company. So the DST relationships are strategic for us and they frequently buy from us in other areas, including Alternatives, Advent and others and obviously that's not reflected in the DST Financial Services line, but it does speak to the value of the relationship. 23:54 Yes, so maybe Patrick can comment on the first one on the accretive, Bill and -- yes. 24:40 And then I think to the second, yes sorry. 25:32 And then I think to the second part of the question. Yes, so the second part of the question, we're actually pretty excited about the opportunity, we obviously have 18,000 clients most of whom I'd say virtually all of them are candidates to have greater automation and they have digital workers right? So that cross-sell component is pretty important to us. We also have a wealth of direct applications ourselves whether in our outsourcing business we were performing many of the past that folks would look to have digital workers do. So we're working hard and our teams are working hard on coming up with applications for, if you're a hedge fund, or an insurance company here is something we might be able to do for you using this technology. And rolling that out, we think will be pretty powerful. So that's all underway. 26:49 We have a great business in Intralinks and they continue to find pockets of growth throughout their client base and new clients, and they've done a lot of things with help them the alternatives industry with portals and other things and along those lines information delivery and then obviously they continue to be very strong in the VVR market and M&A in general. So we expect similar growth for the rest of the year. 29:53 And several right, so and that's a total of about 70 million to 80 million and one of them represents about half. 30:17 I think scheduled right now little unpredictable, because there is some approval requirements. But I think it's scheduled for the end of June. 33:57 Yes, sure, Bill, thanks. So it's a huge market, right. And as a multiple of the 200 and change that Blue Prism does, we anticipate that just in our current client base, we probably have 3, 4, 5 times debt amount opportunity and some of the consultants out there are representing this as a $150 billion or more market right and potentially as much as 30% of -- as Bill noted of all the line jobs that are done lend themselves to this kind of technology. So we're just trying we're obviously -- we're mindful off the size of the market. And at the same time, we have to focus on specific things that we can do better than anybody else and Blue Prism already has a number of those in the customers that they have deployed and we're working with them on building out additional use cases and applications. 40:06 Sure, I think it's a little bit off all of that, but mostly it's a continuation of a trend where folks that had in-house operations as they start new funds. They use us or somebody like us and we would say that the investment that we have made in technology and process over less decade or so is market differentiating. So we have a really strong business, we're the biggest provider of private market and that's more private equity and real assets funds in the world. And the capability keeps getting better. 40:42 So we're a natural place for many of these funds to come to and it is a combination of these are hard asset classes, particularly in the private lending, private credit and private equity, as well as real assets, so because they're hard asset classes, there's a lot of new launches and then there is transfers of internal. So all of that leads to, I think a growth trend that is both positive and we think sustainable."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SS&C Q4 and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Justine Stone, Investor Relations with SS&C. And with that, Justine, you have the floor.\nJustine Stone: Welcome, and thank you for joining us for our Q4 2023 Earnings Call. I'm Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Schell, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, we need to review the Safe Harbor statement. Please note that various remarks we make today about future expectations, plans and prospects, including the financial outlook we provide, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and can also be accessed on our website. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of today, February 13, 2024. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in today's earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. I will now turn the call over to, Bill.\nWilliam C. Stone: Thanks, Justine, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter results, which are record adjusted revenue of $1.412 billion up 5.5% and our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.26 up 8.6%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $563 million for the quarter, the highest in our history and our EBITDA margin was up to 39.8%. This is a 300 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2023. Our fourth quarter adjusted organic revenue growth was 4.5%. The fourth quarter revenue acceleration was driven by strength in our alternatives, retirement and Intralinks businesses. We also saw acceleration in GIDS, Advent and Eze businesses. Our recurring revenue growth rate for financial services was 6.9%, which includes all software enabled services and maintenance revenue. This is sequential increase from 5.9% in Q3. For the year, total organic growth was 2.8% and financial services recurring revenue growth was 4.9%. Our financial services revenue retention remains over 97% on the last 12-month basis. In 2023, SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $1.215 billion. We paid down $150 million in debt in Q4 2023, bringing our net leverage ratio to 3.05 times and our net secured leverage ratio to 2.1 times. We bought back 2.4 million shares for $131 million at an average price of $54.74 per share. For the year, we have allocated $375 million towards debt pay down and $472 million towards stock buybacks. We anticipate a similar higher focus on share repurchase in 2024. On January 1, DomaniRx, our brand new pharmacy benefits platform, went live with our Phase I drug discount clients. We have processed 15 million claims in January over 10% more than we had originally anticipated for the month of January and our response time of under one second is quite better than industry standard. We project we will process 45 million claims by the end of first quarter. Customers who have migrated have touted the cutover to Domani was frictionless. Our second release of DomaniRx is scheduled for June 1, 2024 and will include full commercial Medicare and Medicaid functionality. We are pleased with the successful launch of DomaniRx, and we look forward to adding new clients in the second half of 2024. We also completed a major retirement system implementation with one of the world's largest insurance companies. Regulatory change has driven a lot of activity around our retirement income solution and rollovers. We look forward to capitalizing on this opportunity. I'll now turn the call over to Rahul, to discuss quarter in more detail.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks, Bill. In Q4, we saw acceleration in revenue and healthy margin expansion. Notably, alternatives grew 7.8%, Intralinks grew 18.6%, and Retirement grew 12.8%. Our EBITDA margin exit rate was 39.8%, a result of higher revenue growth, cost controls and our digital worker initiative. For the year, we obtained approximately 2,000 full-time equivalents in digital worker productivity, which we expect to yield $100 million savings annually. We are optimistic about our ability to continue to drive additional benefit from digital workers and other automation strategies. We're seeing a lot of opportunities across the financial services industry as large firms look for ways to drive down costs within their back office operations while improving their front end technology. These market dynamics can be beneficial for our GIDS, Retirement and Alternative Fund Services businesses. Across the company, we have focused on offering comprehensive solutions to our customers comprised of multiple products and services in an integrated and holistic way. As one example, in 2023, we signed 12 Trust Suite clients, a new platform for banks and trust companies combining back office and regulatory reporting from Innovest, the front office experience of Black Diamond and our CRM capabilities through Salentica. Similarly, the integration of Eze, Eze Eclipse and Advent Geneva has been positively received. We've also signed over 70 new Eclipse clients in 2023, bringing the total number of clients on Eze Eclipse to over 250. We are gaining momentum and have an opportunity to increase market share from here. I will now turn it over to Brian, to run through the financials.\nBrian Schell: Thanks, Rahul. As noted in our press release, our Q4 2023 GAAP results reflect revenues of $1.412 billion net income of $194 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.77. And as Bill, noted earlier in the call, our adjusted revenues hit a record level at $1.412 billion up 5.5%. Adjusted EBITDA also hit a record at $563 million of 8.5% or $44 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.26, an 8.6% increase over Q4 2022. The adjusted revenue increase of $73 million over Q4 2022 was primarily driven by the incremental revenue contributions for Alternative, Intralinks and GIDS. Our acquisitions contributed $4.1 million or approximately 30 basis points. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $11 million or 80 basis points. As a result, adjusted organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis was 4.5%. Our cost structure has been impacted by general inflation, higher personnel costs and increased professional fees compared to 2022. However, by maintaining a cost disciplined approach and the use of digital workers, our core expenses only increased 2% or $17 million excluding acquisitions and on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $5 million and foreign currency added an additional $8 million of expenses. With the combination of our revenue growth outpacing our expense growth, adjusted EBITDA margin of 39.8% reflects both a sequential and year-over-year expansion of 70 basis points and 110 basis points respectively. Net interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $119 million an increase of [$14 million] (ph) from Q4 2022. The average interest rate in the quarter for the amended credit facility including the senior notes was 6.93% compared to 5.64% in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted net income was $317 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.26. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Share repurchase of 2.4 million helped to drive the diluted share count down to 252.1 million from 253.9 million in Q3. While Q4 reflects strong results, our 2023 annual earnings per share reflects a slight decline of $0.04 per share compared to last year. The single biggest contributor to this decline was the impact of the rise in short-term interest rates, increasing the interest expense on our debt by approximately $164 million or nearly $0.47 per share on an after tax basis, assuming a 26% tax rate. SS&C ended the fourth quarter with $432 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.8 billion in gross debt. SS&C's net debt as defined in our credit agreement, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $100 million held at DomaniRx was $6.4 billion as of December 31. Our year-end total leverage ratio was 3.05 times and our secured leverage ratio was 2.1 times. As our term loans B-3, B-4, and B-5, totaling approximately $3.5 billion approach maturity in April of 2025, we anticipate refinancing them in the near-term. Also as previously noted, SS&C generated net cash from operating activity of $1.215 million an increase of 7.1%. The increase reflects the incremental earnings as well as improved working capital management. As we move into 2024 and establishing our guidance, note that we will continue to focus on product innovation and enhancements as well as client service. We assume that retention rates will continue to be in the range of our most recent results. We will also continue to manage our expenses with a cost disciplined approach by controlling and aligning variable expenses to ensure efficiency, rationalizing our real estate footprint, increasing productivity to improve our operating margins to leverage our scale and effectively investing in the business through marketing, sales and R&D to take advantage of future growth opportunities. For the full-year 2024, we have assumed adjusted organic revenue growth in the range of 2.7% to 6.3%, foreign currency exchange rates to be consistent with 2023 levels. Short-term interest rates remained flat through the first half of the year with small declines in the second half of the year. GAAP tax rate of approximately 26% on an adjusted basis, which is unchanged from the prior year. Capital expenditure to be consistent with 2023 at 4.3% to 4.7% of revenues, a continued slight overemphasis to share repurchases similar to how we allocated capital in 2023. As a result, for the full-year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5.668 billion to $5.868 billion. Adjusted net income in the range of $1.221 billion to $1.321 billion interest expense excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount in the range of $438 million to $448 million. Diluted shares in the range of 252.7 million to 255.7 million. Adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.85 to $5.15 and cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.292 billion to $1.392 billion. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.397 billion to $1.437 billion. Adjusted net income in the range of $300 million to $316 million. Interest expense excluding amortization of deferred financing costs original issue discount in the range of $113 million to $115 million, diluted shares in the range of 253.2 million to 254.2 million shares and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.19 to $1.25. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Bill, for final comments.\nWilliam C. Stone: Thanks, Brian. I'd also like to welcome Debra Walton-Ruskin as the newest Director on our Board. Ms. Walton-Ruskin has had an impressive career at the London Stock Exchange Group, Refinitiv, Thomson Reuters and Thomson Financial. Her expertise in fintech, global market, executive sales leadership and financial data fit well with SS&C's strengths and focus. We look forward to collaborating with Debra. We have recently recruited a Senior Executive, Ezra Baylin, who will head up Mergers and Acquisitions. Ezra has the experience and expertise to guide us in our M&A pursuits. Q4 was a good quarter and we look forward to reporting throughout 2024. I now will open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thanks, Bill. [Operator Instructions] Okay. It looks like our first question today comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Dan, please go ahead.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. Good evening. Bill, I wanted to ask you a question, kind of what's embedded in guidance as you think about jumping off point for organic growth, at 3.5% in the first quarter, but then for the full-year, clearly ramping to 4.5%. So, I'm just wondering what kind of connects the dots to that acceleration as you think about your line-of-sight going into the back half of the year?\nWilliam C. Stone: Hi, Dan. Hey, we got a lot of stuff accomplished in the fourth quarter of 2023 and that gives us a lot of confidence going into to ‘24. We kind of said in the remarks about a large insurance company going live on our track system and that's going to drive a lot of revenue. We also completed another large retirement system in 2023 and we've been winning an awful lot of the major hedge fund launches and conversions. So, we have a lot of stuff that we think are in our pipeline, and we think as that rolls through that we will accelerate throughout the year to increase organic revenue growth.\nDan Perlin: That's great. Just a quick follow-up on Alternatives. Again, another strong quarter and you called out private markets continuing to be a key contributor to that. I guess a couple things. Is there a way to kind of contextualize how big that has become embedded in Alternatives, and then in that same vein as private equity continues to move down private credit, are you having, you've seen more success potentially as we think about this year in terms of signing up more within the PE side of the equation? Thank you.\nBrian Schell: Dan, I think the whole fund business, hedge funds and private equity funds, fund-to-funds is about close to $1 billion in revenue. And the private market side, private equity and private credit at OWL is probably pushing $350 million. So, you're getting close to 35%, 40% of our revenue in the funds business coming from private. And as you've seen as well as everyone else has seen, this tremendous amount of money going into private debt, private credit, everything private and they get better returns. So, I mean, I don't think that's going to change and we think we're very well-positioned.\nDan Perlin: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Thanks, Dan. And our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind. Surinder, please go ahead, with Jefferies by the way. Surinder, the floor is yours.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. For the first question, just in terms of as you think about, DomaniRx and as you look ahead through the rest of the year, is there anything within guidance that you've included there? And how should we think about the progression or the uptake of the business as you think about it this year versus next year?\nWilliam C. Stone: Well, I think the rollout was as close to flawless of any of the rollouts we've had, which bodes well for word-of-mouth going across the health industry is pretty vibrant and an awful lot of people talk. And so we have great relationships across all kinds of healthcare organizations. And as we said in my earlier remarks that the 15 million claims that we processed in January, were 10% more than we anticipated, which would be a 1.5 million claims. So, we think there's some embedded growth in there and then we think we're going to add clients throughout the year. And, as we roll out commercial and then Medicaid and then Medicare, it is increasingly going to be imperative on all kinds of claims processors and other healthcare companies to get into new technology, right. You can't run this on spreadsheets and you really can't run this on technologies that are not flexible enough. There's an awful lot of stuff coming out in 2025 on HIPAA and other regulation and I don't think any Inflation Reduction Act and all this stuff. And, I don't think that 40 year old, 50 year old, 60 year old technology is going to save the day. And I think that the brightest minds that are running these big places are going to come to us and recognize that we can streamline their operations, save them a lot of money and we can make a lot of money in the process.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. It sounds like it obviously a positive outlook, but was any of that included within the guidance or is that all upside at this point?\nWilliam C. Stone: Well, I think as far as healthcare is concerned, we were measured. And, we think that if anything, we have upside to that. And we think that -- we're so young as a management team, we have a lot of time in order to really execute on our strategy so that we can really reap the benefit.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then just as a follow-up here, just on the margin part of the story, obviously, great execution. Have you thought about the target for digital workers as the year progresses, and ultimately where you might be able to get to? Obviously, there's always going to be some level that you can do in any given year, but is there another ramp coming at some point, or is it more of a smooth, I'll call it curve in terms of the adoption of the number of digital workers from here on outwards?\nWilliam C. Stone: I would just say that the digital worker initiative at SS&C is a very focused, very managed process and everybody understands that they need to get on board. And then they understand that you don't get on board pretty quick, then you don't have to worry about it. So, we're pretty blunt about those kinds of things and it's been effective for us. And as they embrace it, they kind of go, wow, I should have done this sooner. But those kinds of things are lead the horses to water, right. And I think that's what we've done and we've got a lot of opportunities going forward. The technology keeps getting better. It is capable of more things and as we integrate large language models into the process, it will even get better. So, we're optimistic about where we go from here. And so, we went from I think about 36.8% in the second quarter, and 39.8% in EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. So, we're looking forward to continue to be able to expand our margins and improve our customer service and satisfy more customers.\nSurinder Thind: Excellent. Thank you very much, Bill.\nOperator: All right. Thank you for the question. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Andrew, please go ahead.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hey, Bill, Rahul or Brian, good to speak with you. Thanks for the time. Actually, a good segue from that last question to my question. You mentioned, I think, Bill, the 39.8% EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter, which is a good jumping off point into 2024. Historically, I think the target margin had been 40%. I guess the question is with the efficiencies that you're seeing digital workers, in other areas, is that long-term target now is the ceiling now higher? And what might that look like over the longer term? Thanks a lot.\nWilliam C. Stone: Yes, Andrew. I think we need to define the longer term. So, if you look out over the next couple of years, that we probably have opportunities to increase our margins through the digital worker process, 100 basis points to 200 basis points. Now look, we're going to spend money on a lot of things too. So, the margin is not just driven by the Blue Prism deployment. We're spending money on sales. We're spending money on marketing. We're spending money on a lot of R&D initiatives and we are quite focused on defending our IP. And that's not a cheap process, but it's also that's our lifeblood as a company. And we want people to understand that we don't take it with anything except extreme defense and then it becomes extreme offense. We're very focused. We're very protective of our customers and our employees and our communities. And that means that we have to be very protective of our IP.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. Thank you for that, Bill. And then if I could ask just on license revenues for 2024. Obviously, it's not a huge part of the business, but it can create some volatility as we saw in 2023. What's the expectation for 2024? And I guess there's a broader question about just outlook philosophy and whether that's changed at all in terms of taking a finer point to, let's call it, sales cycles and booking these assumptions like that. I guess, kind of a two part question, license revenues and then just broader kind of outlook philosophy when it comes to organic growth. Thank you, guys. I appreciate the time.\nBrian Schell: Sure. So, I think similar to what Bill said a second ago about healthcare, we're trying to be measured in terms of what's in our guidance on license revenue, so clearly there was some softness in 2023. But at the same time, The pipelines that we have and the deals that we have that are in fairly advanced stages give us a little bit more cheer about 2024 going into ‘24. So, we actually think license ought to do better in ‘24 than it did in ‘23. And I think your second comment or question on the forecasting process. Not so much a change in philosophy. I just think that as we continue to do this, we just get better information and we can make kind of better guesses on what's happening and that's a continuous and ongoing process.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. Thank you very much, guys.\nOperator: Thanks Andrew. [Operator Instructions] And it looks like our next question comes from Alexei Gogolev with JP Morgan. Alexei, go ahead.\nAlexei Gogolev: Thank you, everyone. Hi, Bill. I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate a little bit more on the comments you made around winning major hedge fund launches and conversions. Any additional feedback there? And also if you're sensing any, acceleration in hedge fund end market consolidation that's been going on for some time now, but it sounds like it's been accelerating [YK] (ph).\nWilliam C. Stone: Yes, Alexei, I think if you go back through our press releases and our client wins and stuff. You'll see that an awful lot of the major macro hedge funds are our clients. And for the last several years, an awful lot of the new funds and the hedge funds went into these macro funds. So, we have a concentration on the largest and most complex funds because what that does is make sure that we have the expertise and technology to really support them as they grow and then also as they expand their geographic and asset selection reaches. So, that's what we do. So, I think we had a press release just recently on Hudson Bay. That's a $20 billion hedge fund that we just added to our line-up. And we've got a number of those throughout the world and we are marching both in EMEA and Asia Pac as well as North America. And we spend more money at this than anyone else. So, we think that we're spending it wisely and that will continue to increase our win rates.\nAlexei Gogolev: Perfect. Thank you, Bill. And a quick question to Brian, have you been able to assess the potential implications to your free cash flow from the Tax Relief for Families and Workers Act of 2024 bill. Do you have any visibility where this could take your tax from this bonus depreciation change?\nBrian Schell: So, we haven't done a full assessment at this point. So, it'd be preliminary to give any direction as to, any changes, but obviously, working through, any tax law changes, making sure we have the appropriate positioning. If there's a strategy that we need to take a look at, we'll continue to implement that obviously is not too aggressive, but we think it complies with obviously the appropriate tax laws and tax jurisdictions. So, at this point too early to assess an impact to us.\nWilliam C. Stone: Yes. And we're quite focused on our taxes and we've been able to keep a constant 26% tax rate for the last five or ten years and we'd like to see if we can have that start sloping downward and that might mean that we do different things than we do now. We might move some more of our people to lower tax states. As our clients have moved to places like Florida and North Carolina, Georgia. We might start following with groups that have specific expertise. We already have a large office in Jacksonville and we have some people down in the Miami area. So, we're optimistic that if we get some focus and have some ideas that we'll be able to hopefully, move our tax rate down.\nAlexei Gogolev: Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Brian. Congratulations with great results.\nOperator: Thanks, Alexei. And our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Kevin, please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. And I'll add my congratulations as well. If you think about the organic growth guidance for 2024, it looks like the range is [2.7% to 6.3%] (ph). Any thoughts as to what would get you to the lower end of the range as opposed to the higher end?\nWilliam C. Stone: Well, that's pretty sizable range, Kevin. And I think that we're certainly hoping to beat the low-end. We'd love to beat the high-end. We'd also love to beat the midpoint. So, I don't think that we think that the low end, The 2.8, I think it is the high hurdle, but it's also when you're $5.5 billion in revenue and you want 3% growth and you have about 3% attrition that means you need 6% on $5.5 billion which my early math tells me that it's $330 million worth of sales that we have to do. So, it's not a walk in the park. We've got a talented sales team, we've got talented implementers, we've got talented developers and we have a talented support organization. So, we're cautiously optimistic that we're going to have a really good 2024.\nKevin McVeigh: Sounds like it. And then can you remind us your whoever would be best, just the philosophy on the incremental margin you get from Blue Prism and just the deployment of the bots. How much of that goes to maybe margin as opposed to reinvestment as we think about that going forward?\nBrian Schell: I think we feel pretty good about the investment levels that we already have in our business, whether that's spending on R&D or other things. So, really the productivity enhancements do a couple of things for us. We think they make the customer experience better. We think it gives the employees better jobs and then it does most of it does go straight to the bottom line.\nKevin McVeigh: Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Thank you, Kevin. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James, please go ahead.\nMichael Infante: Hi, everyone. It's Michael Infante on for James. Thanks for taking our questions. Bill, I just wanted to ask on M&A. Clearly, there's capacity here from a leverage perspective, and you called out a senior hire to assist with M&A earlier in the call. What does the deal pipeline look like right now, and what types of assets and geographies that are you targeting?\nWilliam C. Stone: Well, right now, we're only targeting Earth. So, we're going to try to wherever we can on the planet. And as far as types of organizations that we would acquire, we're very interested in expanding fund administration, if we can buy existing businesses and figure out ways to help current clients, maybe improve their businesses by collaborating with us on a lift out or something along those lines. Secondly, we like technology. We think that's the steep corner of our business. That's why you hear me get somewhat passionate about protecting our IP. So, I think our key things on this stuff is to find pockets. So, we just had some seminars and some people out in the Far East. We were in McCall, we were in Hong Kong and pitching a bunch of clients and we have a really nice business in Australia. And I think that there's opportunity. We have a pretty nice business in China too. That's somewhat of, the crapshoot is to whether or not it's going to grow really fast or it's going to stop. But I think it's we have a lot of great clients and we think we provide some good services. So, we think there's opportunity. We think there's a lot of opportunity throughout Europe. We think that we have a number of initiatives that we're executing on and then we're pretty much a pretty big powerhouse here in North America.\nMichael Infante: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just on pricing. In terms of the incremental revenue contemplated in ‘24. How much of it, do you expect to come from price increases, and how does that compare to what you're able to to sort of enact in ‘23? Thanks.\nBrian Schell: I think that the, we feel really good that we have a much more predictable view on this. We've been through a couple of rounds of this over the last couple of years. So, we expect a sort of a similar amount of price lift in ‘24 as we actually achieved in ‘23. And the process for getting it is a lot more laid out now. So, and then that ought to be just a continuous uplift for us in future years as well.\nMichael Infante: Got it. Thanks, Brian. Thanks Bill.\nOperator: All right. Thanks you for your patience, everyone. And, it looks like there are no further questions. So, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Bill Stone for closing remarks. Bill, the floor is yours.\nWilliam C. Stone: Thanks, and thanks, everybody. We appreciate you coming to this call. I know in New York City, it was a little snowy for you and then some of you might have forgotten your galoshes and all that. So, we really appreciate that you came out and we look forward to seeing you sometime in April and talking about where we're going from here. So, thanks again and we're working hard for you. Thanks.\nOperator: Thanks, Bill. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect. Have a great day everyone.",

            "content": "Thanks, Rahul. As noted in our press release, our Q4 2023 GAAP results reflect revenues of $1.412 billion net income of $194 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.77. And as Bill, noted earlier in the call, our adjusted revenues hit a record level at $1.412 billion up 5.5%. Adjusted EBITDA also hit a record at $563 million of 8.5% or $44 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.26, an 8.6% increase over Q4 2022.

SS&C ended the fourth quarter with $432 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.8 billion in gross debt. SS&C's net debt as defined in our credit agreement, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $100 million held at DomaniRx was $6.4 billion as of December 31. Our year-end total leverage ratio was 3.05 times and our secured leverage ratio was 2.1 times. As our term loans B-3, B-4, and B-5, totaling approximately $3.5 billion approach maturity in April of 2025, we anticipate refinancing them in the near-term. Also as previously noted, SS&C generated net cash from operating activity of $1.215 million an increase of 7.1%. The increase reflects the incremental earnings as well as improved working capital management. As we move into 2024 and establishing our guidance, note that we will continue to focus on product innovation and enhancements as well as client service. We assume that retention rates will continue to be in the range of our most recent results. We will also continue to manage our expenses with a cost disciplined approach by controlling and aligning variable expenses to ensure efficiency, rationalizing our real estate footprint, increasing productivity to improve our operating margins to leverage our scale and effectively investing in the business through marketing, sales and R&D to take advantage of future growth opportunities. For the full-year 2024, we have assumed adjusted organic revenue growth in the range of 2.7% to 6.3%, foreign currency exchange rates to be consistent with 2023 levels. Short-term interest rates remained flat through the first half of the year with small declines in the second half of the year. GAAP tax rate of approximately 26% on an adjusted basis, which is unchanged from the prior year. Capital expenditure to be consistent with 2023 at 4.3% to 4.7% of revenues, a continued slight overemphasis to share repurchases similar to how we allocated capital in 2023. As a result, for the full-year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5.668 billion to $5.868 billion. Adjusted net income in the range of $1.221 billion to $1.321 billion interest expense excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount in the range of $438 million to $448 million. Diluted shares in the range of 252.7 million to 255.7 million. Adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.85 to $5.15 and cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.292 billion to $1.392 billion. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.397 billion to $1.437 billion. Adjusted net income in the range of $300 million to $316 million. Interest expense excluding amortization of deferred financing costs original issue discount in the range of $113 million to $115 million, diluted shares in the range of 253.2 million to 254.2 million shares and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.19 to $1.25. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Bill, for final comments. Dan, I think the whole fund business, hedge funds and private equity funds, fund-to-funds is about close to $1 billion in revenue. And the private market side, private equity and private credit at OWL is probably pushing $350 million. So, you're getting close to 35%, 40% of our revenue in the funds business coming from private. And as you've seen as well as everyone else has seen, this tremendous amount of money going into private debt, private credit, everything private and they get better returns. So, I mean, I don't think that's going to change and we think we're very well-positioned. Sure. So, I think similar to what Bill said a second ago about healthcare, we're trying to be measured in terms of what's in our guidance on license revenue, so clearly there was some softness in 2023. But at the same time, The pipelines that we have and the deals that we have that are in fairly advanced stages give us a little bit more cheer about 2024 going into ‘24. So, we actually think license ought to do better in ‘24 than it did in ‘23. And I think your second comment or question on the forecasting process. Not so much a change in philosophy. I just think that as we continue to do this, we just get better information and we can make kind of better guesses on what's happening and that's a continuous and ongoing process. So, we haven't done a full assessment at this point. So, it'd be preliminary to give any direction as to, any changes, but obviously, working through, any tax law changes, making sure we have the appropriate positioning. If there's a strategy that we need to take a look at, we'll continue to implement that obviously is not too aggressive, but we think it complies with obviously the appropriate tax laws and tax jurisdictions. So, at this point too early to assess an impact to us. I think we feel pretty good about the investment levels that we already have in our business, whether that's spending on R&D or other things. So, really the productivity enhancements do a couple of things for us. We think they make the customer experience better. We think it gives the employees better jobs and then it does most of it does go straight to the bottom line. I think that the, we feel really good that we have a much more predictable view on this. We've been through a couple of rounds of this over the last couple of years. So, we expect a sort of a similar amount of price lift in ‘24 as we actually achieved in ‘23. And the process for getting it is a lot more laid out now. So, and then that ought to be just a continuous uplift for us in future years as well."

            "name": "William C. Stone",
            "content": "Thanks, Justine, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter results, which are record adjusted revenue of $1.412 billion up 5.5% and our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.26 up 8.6%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $563 million for the quarter, the highest in our history and our EBITDA margin was up to 39.8%. This is a 300 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2023. Our fourth quarter adjusted organic revenue growth was 4.5%. The fourth quarter revenue acceleration was driven by strength in our alternatives, retirement and Intralinks businesses. We also saw acceleration in GIDS, Advent and Eze businesses. Our recurring revenue growth rate for financial services was 6.9%, which includes all software enabled services and maintenance revenue. This is sequential increase from 5.9% in Q3. For the year, total organic growth was 2.8% and financial services recurring revenue growth was 4.9%. Our financial services revenue retention remains over 97% on the last 12-month basis. In 2023, SS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $1.215 billion. We paid down $150 million in debt in Q4 2023, bringing our net leverage ratio to 3.05 times and our net secured leverage ratio to 2.1 times. We bought back 2.4 million shares for $131 million at an average price of $54.74 per share. For the year, we have allocated $375 million towards debt pay down and $472 million towards stock buybacks. We anticipate a similar higher focus on share repurchase in 2024. On January 1, DomaniRx, our brand new pharmacy benefits platform, went live with our Phase I drug discount clients. We have processed 15 million claims in January over 10% more than we had originally anticipated for the month of January and our response time of under one second is quite better than industry standard. We project we will process 45 million claims by the end of first quarter. Customers who have migrated have touted the cutover to Domani was frictionless. Our second release of DomaniRx is scheduled for June 1, 2024 and will include full commercial Medicare and Medicaid functionality. We are pleased with the successful launch of DomaniRx, and we look forward to adding new clients in the second half of 2024. We also completed a major retirement system implementation with one of the world's largest insurance companies. Regulatory change has driven a lot of activity around our retirement income solution and rollovers. We look forward to capitalizing on this opportunity. I'll now turn the call over to Rahul, to discuss quarter in more detail. Thanks, Brian. I'd also like to welcome Debra Walton-Ruskin as the newest Director on our Board. Ms. Walton-Ruskin has had an impressive career at the London Stock Exchange Group, Refinitiv, Thomson Reuters and Thomson Financial. Her expertise in fintech, global market, executive sales leadership and financial data fit well with SS&C's strengths and focus. We look forward to collaborating with Debra. We have recently recruited a Senior Executive, Ezra Baylin, who will head up Mergers and Acquisitions. Ezra has the experience and expertise to guide us in our M&A pursuits. Q4 was a good quarter and we look forward to reporting throughout 2024. I now will open it up for questions. Hi, Dan. Hey, we got a lot of stuff accomplished in the fourth quarter of 2023 and that gives us a lot of confidence going into to ‘24. We kind of said in the remarks about a large insurance company going live on our track system and that's going to drive a lot of revenue. We also completed another large retirement system in 2023 and we've been winning an awful lot of the major hedge fund launches and conversions. So, we have a lot of stuff that we think are in our pipeline, and we think as that rolls through that we will accelerate throughout the year to increase organic revenue growth. Well, I think the rollout was as close to flawless of any of the rollouts we've had, which bodes well for word-of-mouth going across the health industry is pretty vibrant and an awful lot of people talk. And so we have great relationships across all kinds of healthcare organizations. And as we said in my earlier remarks that the 15 million claims that we processed in January, were 10% more than we anticipated, which would be a 1.5 million claims. So, we think there's some embedded growth in there and then we think we're going to add clients throughout the year. And, as we roll out commercial and then Medicaid and then Medicare, it is increasingly going to be imperative on all kinds of claims processors and other healthcare companies to get into new technology, right. You can't run this on spreadsheets and you really can't run this on technologies that are not flexible enough. There's an awful lot of stuff coming out in 2025 on HIPAA and other regulation and I don't think any Inflation Reduction Act and all this stuff. And, I don't think that 40 year old, 50 year old, 60 year old technology is going to save the day. And I think that the brightest minds that are running these big places are going to come to us and recognize that we can streamline their operations, save them a lot of money and we can make a lot of money in the process. Well, I think as far as healthcare is concerned, we were measured. And, we think that if anything, we have upside to that. And we think that -- we're so young as a management team, we have a lot of time in order to really execute on our strategy so that we can really reap the benefit. I would just say that the digital worker initiative at SS&C is a very focused, very managed process and everybody understands that they need to get on board. And then they understand that you don't get on board pretty quick, then you don't have to worry about it. So, we're pretty blunt about those kinds of things and it's been effective for us. And as they embrace it, they kind of go, wow, I should have done this sooner. But those kinds of things are lead the horses to water, right. And I think that's what we've done and we've got a lot of opportunities going forward. The technology keeps getting better. It is capable of more things and as we integrate large language models into the process, it will even get better. So, we're optimistic about where we go from here. And so, we went from I think about 36.8% in the second quarter, and 39.8% in EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. So, we're looking forward to continue to be able to expand our margins and improve our customer service and satisfy more customers. Yes, Andrew. I think we need to define the longer term. So, if you look out over the next couple of years, that we probably have opportunities to increase our margins through the digital worker process, 100 basis points to 200 basis points. Now look, we're going to spend money on a lot of things too. So, the margin is not just driven by the Blue Prism deployment. We're spending money on sales. We're spending money on marketing. We're spending money on a lot of R&D initiatives and we are quite focused on defending our IP. And that's not a cheap process, but it's also that's our lifeblood as a company. And we want people to understand that we don't take it with anything except extreme defense and then it becomes extreme offense. We're very focused. We're very protective of our customers and our employees and our communities. And that means that we have to be very protective of our IP. Yes, Alexei, I think if you go back through our press releases and our client wins and stuff. You'll see that an awful lot of the major macro hedge funds are our clients. And for the last several years, an awful lot of the new funds and the hedge funds went into these macro funds. So, we have a concentration on the largest and most complex funds because what that does is make sure that we have the expertise and technology to really support them as they grow and then also as they expand their geographic and asset selection reaches. So, that's what we do. So, I think we had a press release just recently on Hudson Bay. That's a $20 billion hedge fund that we just added to our line-up. And we've got a number of those throughout the world and we are marching both in EMEA and Asia Pac as well as North America. And we spend more money at this than anyone else. So, we think that we're spending it wisely and that will continue to increase our win rates. Yes. And we're quite focused on our taxes and we've been able to keep a constant 26% tax rate for the last five or ten years and we'd like to see if we can have that start sloping downward and that might mean that we do different things than we do now. We might move some more of our people to lower tax states. As our clients have moved to places like Florida and North Carolina, Georgia. We might start following with groups that have specific expertise. We already have a large office in Jacksonville and we have some people down in the Miami area. So, we're optimistic that if we get some focus and have some ideas that we'll be able to hopefully, move our tax rate down. Well, that's pretty sizable range, Kevin. And I think that we're certainly hoping to beat the low-end. We'd love to beat the high-end. We'd also love to beat the midpoint. So, I don't think that we think that the low end, The 2.8, I think it is the high hurdle, but it's also when you're $5.5 billion in revenue and you want 3% growth and you have about 3% attrition that means you need 6% on $5.5 billion which my early math tells me that it's $330 million worth of sales that we have to do. So, it's not a walk in the park. We've got a talented sales team, we've got talented implementers, we've got talented developers and we have a talented support organization. So, we're cautiously optimistic that we're going to have a really good 2024. Well, right now, we're only targeting Earth. So, we're going to try to wherever we can on the planet. And as far as types of organizations that we would acquire, we're very interested in expanding fund administration, if we can buy existing businesses and figure out ways to help current clients, maybe improve their businesses by collaborating with us on a lift out or something along those lines. Secondly, we like technology. We think that's the steep corner of our business. That's why you hear me get somewhat passionate about protecting our IP. So, I think our key things on this stuff is to find pockets. So, we just had some seminars and some people out in the Far East. We were in McCall, we were in Hong Kong and pitching a bunch of clients and we have a really nice business in Australia. And I think that there's opportunity. We have a pretty nice business in China too. That's somewhat of, the crapshoot is to whether or not it's going to grow really fast or it's going to stop. But I think it's we have a lot of great clients and we think we provide some good services. So, we think there's opportunity. We think there's a lot of opportunity throughout Europe. We think that we have a number of initiatives that we're executing on and then we're pretty much a pretty big powerhouse here in North America. Thanks, and thanks, everybody. We appreciate you coming to this call. I know in New York City, it was a little snowy for you and then some of you might have forgotten your galoshes and all that. So, we really appreciate that you came out and we look forward to seeing you sometime in April and talking about where we're going from here. So, thanks again and we're working hard for you. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. In Q4, we saw acceleration in revenue and healthy margin expansion. Notably, alternatives grew 7.8%, Intralinks grew 18.6%, and Retirement grew 12.8%. Our EBITDA margin exit rate was 39.8%, a result of higher revenue growth, cost controls and our digital worker initiative. For the year, we obtained approximately 2,000 full-time equivalents in digital worker productivity, which we expect to yield $100 million savings annually. We are optimistic about our ability to continue to drive additional benefit from digital workers and other automation strategies. We're seeing a lot of opportunities across the financial services industry as large firms look for ways to drive down costs within their back office operations while improving their front end technology. These market dynamics can be beneficial for our GIDS, Retirement and Alternative Fund Services businesses. Across the company, we have focused on offering comprehensive solutions to our customers comprised of multiple products and services in an integrated and holistic way. As one example, in 2023, we signed 12 Trust Suite clients, a new platform for banks and trust companies combining back office and regulatory reporting from Innovest, the front office experience of Black Diamond and our CRM capabilities through Salentica. Similarly, the integration of Eze, Eze Eclipse and Advent Geneva has been positively received. We've also signed over 70 new Eclipse clients in 2023, bringing the total number of clients on Eze Eclipse to over 250. We are gaining momentum and have an opportunity to increase market share from here. I will now turn it over to Brian, to run through the financials."

I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Stone: Thanks, Justine, and thanks everyone for joining. Let's all welcome Brian to his first SS&C earnings call. He has been with us for two months and has found his bearings. We're excited about his ideas and intellect he brings to the organization, and I encourage all of you to get to know him. Results for the third quarter are record adjusted revenue of $1,366.7 million, up 3.4% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.17. We also achieved our second-highest adjusted consolidated EBITDA in our history at $533.9 million. Our EBITDA margin was 39.1%, a 230 basis point increase from Q2 2023. Our third quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 2.3%, driven by strength in our alternatives, particularly private markets, Intralinks, Retirement and Blue Prism. Our recurring revenue growth was [amidst] (ph) the license and professional service revenue streams was up over 5%, which we think is an indicator of our underlying business' strength. The Financial Services retention rate for Q3 2023 was 97.3%, the highest level in the SS&C history. SS&C generated cash from operating activities of $826.7 million for the nine months ended September 30th, up 8.1% over the same period last year. In Q3 2023, we bought back 1.7 million shares for $96.9 million at an average price of $55.82. We also raised our common stock quarterly dividend of 20% to $0.24 per share, delivering $156.6 million in total cash return to shareholders in the quarter and $501.9 million year-to-date. SS&C paid down $54.7 million in debt in Q3 2023, bringing our net leverage ratio to 3.18 times consolidated EBITDA, attributable to SS&C. In the near term, we believe SS&C's common stock is undervalued, and we expect to maintain a higher level of stock repurchases versus debt paydown. We've made a lot of progress within the firm while Blue Prism's digital worker deployment. We have a 2,000 full-time equivalent headcount savings year-to-date, which is 7% of our January 1, 2023 employee base. Conservatively at 50,000 per FTE , this is $100 million in run rate savings. So far, the biggest successes have been within our large outsourcing businesses, GIDS, and Alternative Fund Services. One example is a GIDS client asked us to run a campaign to contact over 20,000 customers to clear their small cash balances. We programmed 25 Blue Prism Digital Workers to perform the follow-on processing, saving about $140,000 on contractors that would have been required to process the responses manually. Within Alternatives, operational functions such as manual statement downloads, reconciliation and break investigation and resolution, investor statements in contract notes, and loan closing and compliance have benefited from digital workers. We believe we have just begun to reap the benefits from this initiative. I'll now turn the call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks, Bill. Our core businesses continued to grow nicely with Alternatives, Intralinks, and Retirement accelerating from last quarter. Our Alternatives business grew 8.4% in the quarter, boosted by the strength of our private markets business. We signed a very significant private credit client in Q3 and see opportunities to sustain and accelerate growth for the foreseeable future. Intralinks also accelerated in the quarter, growing over 10% despite M&A deal volume remaining low. The growth can be attributed to increase in contract values, longer due-diligence timelines and more large deals won. We released new tools to help us drive these large deals in contract values. DocuAI uses generative artificial intelligence to proactively deliver document summaries, suggested document classification, document translation and identify potential risks. Intralinks DealVault, a cloud-based storage solution designed for streamlined access to archives and efficient deal data management, recently launched and has attracted interest from corporate clients. In Q3, the largest new Black Diamond sales to date was closed. This client chose the Black Diamond platform to power their newly-launched Wealth Management business created through the acquisition of multiple RIAs and broker-dealers. We continue to invest in R&D and support our customers. We won four awards from Waters Technology, including Best Buy-Side Order Management System, Best Execution Management System, Best Portfolio Management System, and Best Accounting Provider. SS&C Blue Prism was also recognized by Gartner as a leader in the 2023 Magic Quadrant for robotic process automation for the fifth year in a row. We believe these recognitions are indicative of our market-centric approach to R&D. I'll join Bill and the rest of our management team in welcoming Brian to SS&C. And now I'll turn the call over to him to run through the financials.\nBrian Schell: Thanks, Rahul, and thank you, Bill, for those kind remarks. I'd like to start by saying, I'm excited to be part of the SS&C leadership team and looking forward to help build on the strength of SS&C today with the ultimate goal of delivering long-term shareholder value. As noted in our press release, our Q3 2023 GAAP results reflect revenues of $1,365.9 million, net income of $156 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.61. And as Bill noted earlier in the call, our adjusted revenues were $1,366.7 million, up 3.4%. Adjusted operating income increased 6.4% and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.17, a 1.7% increase over Q3 2022. Adjusted revenues increased $44.7 million, or 3.4% over Q3 2022. Our acquisitions contributed $2.4 million or approximately 20 basis points. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $13.2 million or 1%. As a result, adjusted organic revenue growth on a constant-currency basis was 2.3%. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter of 2023 was $517.4 million, an increase of $31.3 million or 6.4% in the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating margins were 37.9% in the third quarter of 2023, as compared to 36.8% in the third quarter of 2022. The 110 basis point margin expansion reflects the positive impact of both revenue growth and disciplined expense management. While our cost structure has been impacted by general inflation, higher personnel costs, and increased professional fees compared to 2022, our core expenses only increased 30 basis points or $2.6 million, excluding acquisitions and on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $2 million in expenses and foreign currency increased costs by $8.4 million. And note that our expenses calculated on a similar basis is down $28.6 million or 3.3% sequentially. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA attributable to SS&C, defined in Note 3 in the earnings release was $533.9 million, or 39.1% of adjusted revenue, an increase of $32.2 million, or 6.4%, from Q3 last year. The 39.1% EBITDA margin reflects both a sequential and year-over-year improvement of 230 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. Net interest expense for the third quarter of 2023 was $117.3 million, an increase of $35.1 million from Q3 2022. The Q3 2023 net interest expense excludes $3.4 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter for the amended credit facility, including the senior notes were 6.87% compared to 4.55% in the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted net income, as defined in Note 4 in the earnings release was $295.9 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.17. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Share repurchases of 1.7 million, drove the diluted share count down to 253.9 million from 255 million in Q2. SS&C ended the third quarter with $447.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.9 billion in gross debt. SS&C's net debt as defined in our credit agreement, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $106.1 million held at DomaniRx LLC, was $6.6 billion as of September 30. Our LTM consolidated EBITDA used for covenant compliance was $2,063.8 million as of September 2023. Based on net debt of approximately $6.6 billion, our total leverage ratio was 3.18 times. Our secured leverage ratio was 2.21 times as of September 30. As we look forward to the fourth quarter and establishing our guidance, note that we will continue to focus on client service and assume that our retention rates will continue to be in the range of our most recent results. We will continue to manage our expenses with a cost-discipline approach by controlling and aligning variable expenses to ensure efficiency, increasing productivity, to improve our operating margins, to leverage our scale, and effectively investing in the business through marketing, sales, and R&D to take advantage of future growth opportunities. Specifically, we have assumed adjusted organic growth for Q4 in the range of 1.8% to 4.8%, resulting in adjusted organic growth for the year in the range of 2.1% to 2.9%. FX rates will be at current levels. Interest rates to remain flat through the end of the year, compared to the ending rate in the third quarter. GAAP tax rate of approximately 26% on an adjusted basis, which is unchanged from prior guidance. Capital expenditures to remain at 3.9% to 4.1% of revenues, which is unchanged from prior guidance, and a more weighted emphasis to share repurchases similar to what we did in Q3. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1,370 million to $1,410 million. Adjusted net income in the range of $305 million to $327 million. Interest expense, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount in the range of $116 million to $119 million, diluted shares in the range of 252 million to 254 million, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1. 21 to $1.29. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5,463.5 million to $5,503.5 million. Adjusted net income in the range of $1,159.9 million to $1,181.9 million. Diluted shares in the range of 254.5 million to 255 million. Adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.55 to $4.64 and cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1,180 million to $1,230 million. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Bill for final comments.\nWilliam Stone: Thanks, Brian. Earlier this week, we hosted nearly 1,000 clients and prospects at our SS&C Deliver Conference in Austin, Texas. Delivering the Future was the theme of the conference, with a big emphasis on the power of AI and robotics process automation. We showcased over 40 solutions across the key market segments we serve, and initial feedback has been positive. I'll now open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Stone. [Operator Instructions] We will got first this afternoon to Dan Perlin at RBC Capital Markets.\nDaniel Perlin: Thanks. Good evening. I just had a question on the revenue retention rates, as we kind of went back and looked at them, I mean, I know it's a modest uptick, it's actually pretty reasonable, but it looks like to be maybe the highest level we've certainly seen back to 2019, maybe ever, quite frankly. So can you just talk about some of the metrics that are driving that and how that might play into your thinking as we go into next year around organic growth? Thanks and I have a follow-up.\nWilliam Stone: You know, Dan, I think the retention rates really reflects the concentration we've put on customer service and making sure that we run these customer satisfaction calls every month and we keep track of them and we're really putting a tremendous amount of emphasis. And we also believe that the ability for us to cross-sell and up-sell into our current client base is much stronger than we may have looked at it before. And so, I think the renewed emphasis on that and our customer relationship management programs is starting to pay off.\nDaniel Perlin: On that same vein, Bill, could you talk a little bit about the deal pipeline and conversion cycles you're seeing? I know Rahul called out specifically wins within private markets, which has obviously been very strong. And then obviously with the Black Diamond, I'm just wondering how things are kind of setting up, how those conversations are going today? And are you feeling better about conversion cycles as we sit here now or pretty much the same as maybe it's -- I don't know six, nine months ago? Thank you.\nWilliam Stone: Yes, I would say that -- I think our pipeline in our fund administration businesses is over $400 million, so that's a lot of revenue. Now you got to close it, right? And then you got to get them live. And so it's not a -- not just a walk in the park, but it does indicate kind of the lead we have in a number of our areas. Intralinks is seeing ticks up in their lead generation and our ability to close on additional M&A that's happened in that marketplace. And I think, the private markets looks like it's going to remain strong through the end of the year. And we have -- we were a little light on license revenue, but 606 and renewals is always kind of a crapshoot. And I think that Q3 was particularly soft, but that ought to rebound a little bit in Q4 and also in 2024.\nDaniel Perlin: That's great. Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: Thank you. The next now to Peter Heckmann at D.A. Davidson.\nPeter Heckmann: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to follow-up on a couple of pieces. Now you noted that a little bit light on software revenue. I assume that was primarily the legacy software businesses. And just trying to clarify if there was a particularly tough comparison there, and I know you don't do it in your filings, but if you could quantify roughly the amount of software license revenue in the quarter, that would be helpful.\nRahul Kanwar: I think the difference in what we expected versus where we ended up from a software license revenue was in the order of magnitude of about $20 million to 25 million in the quarter.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. But it does appear that it was concentrated within the legacy software businesses.\nRahul Kanwar: Yes, that's right. Primarily institutional and investment management business and some impact in advent as well.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. And then just on the retirement side, you know, 15% up in the quarter, sequential acceleration. I'm sorry if I missed it, but does that reflect the go live of -- of some of the large clients in the conversion pipeline?\nRahul Kanwar: Yes, it does. We're continuing to make progress, as you know, we did win a few large deals. I want to say about 18 to 24 months ago that we've been working hard on implementing. And where we are right now is we have one of them fully live and another one scheduled to go live in early 2024. And you're starting to see really the revenue benefit of that happening.\nPeter Heckmann: Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. We go next now to Andrew Schmidt at Citi.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions and welcome Brian. Brian, maybe. I could put you on the spot for a second. I know it's little bit early, but talk about just initial observations and maybe some early priorities you have as you hit the ground here. That would be helpful. Thanks a lot.\nBrian Schell: Yes. No, thanks for the question. And I would say the priorities that we have are continuing to try and build on the momentum here. As I said in my opening comments, I think that one of the things the finance group and our leadership is looking to do is, continue to enhance some of the tools that the leaders at the front lines are actually using with respect to the contracts to help make better decisions, more timely decisions. What they're looking at around pricing, what they're looking around implementing investment and expenses to drive future revenue growth. I think it has been important. I think the team is already -- has always been focused on looking at expenses and trying to make sure that the expense level and spend, variable and fixed, adjusts in accordance with, I'll call it, revenue outlook. So that revenue growth is obviously very important, but so is making sure that we have an appropriate margin that we're bringing to our shareholders. So I would say it's continuation along those lines. I think we'll continue to try and drive some incremental metrics to give increasing visibility to -- again, to continue to help understand what's driving the business and the strength that we see in it, that sometimes may be masked by the aggregate numbers and some of those trends. So we'll continue to try and highlight those. And lastly, I would say on the capital allocation piece, again putting that in perspective of how we view and how we're going to maybe be a little bit more proactive around what we're doing with respect to that cash flow, I think we've indicated, like I said, a more heavier lien and allocation towards share buyback and continue to be transparent about where we think we're going to put the capital to work.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. Appreciate that, Brian. Very helpful. And then if I could pick up on the margin comment, the implied fourth quarter margin, pretty good progress there. It looks like, if my math is right, up at least 200 bps year-over-year. As we look ahead, can you talk about an opportunity for maybe above-trend margin expansion, just given all the opportunities you have in front of you, whether it's digital workers, cost efficiency, obviously some top line scale hopefully, anything around that would be helpful? Thanks a lot.\nWilliam Stone: Yes, I think that as we've said on a number of these calls that driving our margins up, we don't find to be particularly difficult. We have great clients, we have great people and we continually look at productivity enhancements and Blue Prism has been a great addition to that, not only in us deploying 1,700 or 1,600 digital workers and -- by the end of this year and then also having also allowed us to grow and not add FTEs into our workforce. So we're pretty excited about that opportunity and even as a business itself, we have some talented people running that business and they have driven margins from a little bit negative when we acquired them in the second quarter of 2022 to probably going to end the fourth quarter at above 30% margins at Blue Prism, which is kind of a hallmark of SS&C is that, we manage our businesses, we drive high EBITDA, we pay down debt quickly, we're buying back stock. We're pretty bullish. Wall street is not particularly bullish, but we're pretty bullish.\nAndrew Schmidt: Yes. Thank you very much, Bill.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Alex Kramm at UBS.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good evening everyone. Just wanted to go and look at the fourth quarter organic growth guidance. If my memory serves me right, I think last quarter the cadence that was implied was something more in the midst of digits for the fourth quarter. So little bit of a, I guess, downdraft in your expectation here by a 1.5 or so. So can you just maybe help us understand what has changed in the last three months relative to prior expectations and what the swing factors could be still into year end?\nWilliam Stone: Yes, Alex, I think primarily the swings are -- there's a lot of stuff going on in the world, right? And just like the licensed businesses get -- people get skittish about major capital allocations. And so that was a little soft in Q3 and we're hoping it rebounds in Q4, but we're not trying to stick our neck out on license revenue. Like we said at the beginning, our recurring revenue growth in the third quarter was over 5% up. So that's primarily all of our fund administration businesses and other recurring revenue businesses. And so we got maybe a little conservative here in Q4, but we're trying to give you our best guess and then we're trying to go out and continue to build the business.\nAlex Kramm: Fair enough. And then maybe just more specifically, I don't think the GIDS business has come up, but obviously that's a very sizable business for you and an area of pain in the last few years, but seems to really be stable here in this 3% or so range. You feel pretty good about the outlook there and continue in this kind of environment at that range? Or is there still the ability to maybe even accelerate that into maybe something more in the mid-single digits? Or is that business just too mature and maybe the end markets are too tough that you're happy with what you're seeing?\nBrian Schell: I think that, one, we're happy with the progress, right? At the same time, we do believe there's more opportunity. If you kind of think about the end markets. The end markets include wealth managers in Europe, wealth managers in Australia. We're selling a comprehensive array of services and software. And as we think through our pipeline, that GIDS business has some of the biggest deals that we have as a company. So we're, I think, reasonably optimistic that we can accelerate the growth rate from where we are currently.\nWilliam Stone: And I would just add a little bit, Alex, that we're a technology company, right? So we need to make these products better and we compete against big gigantic financial institutions that you guys are very familiar with. And we think our ability to out innovate, our ability to deliver more product, our ability to have more intuitive systems is one of our greatest strengths. And some of GIDS, as you're well aware, is in a pretty mature business. But at the same time, if we can continue to innovate, then when we go up against our competitors, there is really -- they don't have a chance. I think that's our real opportunity and that's why we've stuck with the knitting and that's what we're doing both in GIDS. That's what we're going to do with DomaniRx. That's what we're doing across everything we're doing. That's why we remain reasonably bullish.\nAlex Kramm: Fair enough. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Ella Smith at J.P. Morgan.\nElla Smith: Hi. This is Ella Smith on for Alexei Gogolev from J.P. Morgan. So my first question is for you, Bill, surrounding M&A. Are you seeing anything for sale in the market? And if you were to pursue a tuck-in acquisition in the next six to 12 months, what products or businesses do you think could enhance or complement SS&C's existing offerings?\nWilliam Stone: Well, we're constantly in the market -- marketplace and it all depends on what's for sale, at what price and can we sell our stuff to their client base, and can we take what we buy and sell it into our client base. So I would imagine, just like [high risk] (ph) that we did here a couple of months ago, and we have a few other small tuck-ins that we'll probably do, we really like the Australian market. We really like the Canadian market as well as the US market. And there's some things that we like in the UK that we think are pretty interesting. So I think we might deploy $100 million in the next three to six months on acquisitions, but we don't have anything right now that we would be closing on in that range. So we like M&A, we think we're good at it. We think we can drive margins and give the people a good place to work. But you got to get them at the right price and you got to be disciplined about it. And so, that's how we operate.\nElla Smith: Great. Thank you very much, Bill. And I think this next question would be for Rahul or whoever wants to take it, but you've alluded to this that retirement did quite well in the third quarter, growing 15%, much higher than in the first and second quarters. I was hoping you could speak more to what's driving the growth there?\nRahul Kanwar: I think it's primarily -- we've been working on a number of large deals and bringing them live. And as they come live, we see our revenue take up. So that's -- there was some backlog on that revenue that kind of showed up in the quarter, which we were happy to see. And we do think that we have some more opportunity to have these kinds of step changes in 2024 as well.\nElla Smith: Great. Thank you all so much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We go next now to James Faucette at Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. Just a quick question on [Azus] (ph). It was great to see the press release on [ES Eclipse] (ph) earlier today. Any sense as to how the new client figure of 60 compares to last year that you can share with us, or maybe what a more normalized hedge fund formation market might look like. Just trying to get a sense on what growth trajectory and potential is for [indiscernible], especially on [ES Eclipse] (ph).\nWilliam Stone: I think there's kind of -- as it's kind of -- two things going on in that business, but I think as it relates to Eclipse, the number of new clients we have this year is maybe 1.5 times what we had in kind of a similar period last year. So we are accelerating. We're seeing kind of a lot of acceptance and it's not just new hedge funds, right? It also is -- we continue to add fixed income workflows, derivative workflows, other operational workflows, and so the kinds of organizations that this kind of suite of software and services, whether that's [indiscernible] or Eclipse, appeal to they keep getting bigger. So our markets are expanding and our sales progress is -- we're making progress there. There is a little bit of an impact of the kind of market volatility and equity volumes and things like that, which shows up in the numbers, but underlying that sales performance is very strong.\nJames Faucette: Got it, got it. And then I think in the last couple of years, pricing has been an issue across the industry. How should we think about, like, what the contribution of price has been to the growth this year, or at least your outlook for this year? And how should we anticipate that as a contributor for next year?\nBrian Schell: Yeah, so we've -- as we look at this and we kind of factor this in. And this, again, this is kind of a mix relative to the flows, inflows and outflows. I think we kind of talked about the -- I'll call it the $130 million to $150 million range. Again, sometimes it's hard to disaggregate to a single factor and that kind of builds over time, right, through -- and that could, call it, accelerating the 4Q to have incrementally more versus the third quarter. So we're seeing nice price increases, we're building in more and more contracts and a lot of them already have this in here for CPI adjustments or automatic adjustments, so they kick in. So we're seeing adoption, we're seeing it going in place. It's not an insidious contributor to incremental revenue growth. So I would expect to see more of that on a go-forward basis.\nWilliam Stone: Yes. And maybe I just add on the back of that, we're still -- what you're seeing in price, the numbers Brian just talked about, really still only represents in a given year maybe a third to half of our client base. Right? So as we get more automatic on these escalators and there's still conversations that we need to have in 2024, we do expect that'll continue to help us.\nJames Faucette: Sure, that makes sense.\nBrian Schell: And James, we also will continue to innovate that allows our clients when we do raise prices to feel good about what we're spending their money on. Right? So if you look at our R&D spend, it goes up every quarter, it goes up every year, that this year we'll spend close to $500 million. And that's besides spending like a $1.7 on Blue Prism or what we spend on [indiscernible] or what we spend on other things, that gives our clients a more robust offering across all the different segments we serve.\nJames Faucette: Yep, got it. Appreciate that. Thank you guys.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Surinder Thind at Jefferies.\nSurinder Thind : Thank you. Bill, just one big picture question here, just in terms of how are you thinking about just automation technologies in general, such as RPA here, and maybe the grander scheme of productivity enhancements. And I guess what I'm getting at is, obviously, there's a lot of hype around generative AI. So is there complementary stuff here? Is there competition here between the newer technologies or different technologies? How should we think about the market opportunity?\nWilliam Stone: Well, I think the whole key to this kind of a business is how efficient can you be, right? Let's not glamor here, right? You need to be in balance, right? You need to be in balance. Some of our customers do millions of trades a day, right? What they want us to do is make sure we process them, balance them, get you ready to trade the next day, right? And so, that's a big part of what we do, and it's a big part of how we're using the new technologies to allow us to spot problems before it becomes a crisis and to be able to always be there for our clients. And like when COVID hit and things like that, we had all kinds of clients coming to us, right? Because we stood up. We kept processing all through that stuff. And people learned that, wow, they don't really have fail-over. They don't really have the infrastructure that we have and what we've spent to have it. And so, I think some of those kinds of things are what these new technologies are allowing you to do somewhat easier, somewhat faster. But then you got to be careful. You have to still be in balance. You have to still be able to reconcile. You have to still be able to understand what that means, right? The humans have to be in charge. Otherwise, you start looking at this technology and decide it's always right. And it's not always right. So it's important to have the right controls, the right processes, the right procedures as you add sophisticated technology that artificial intelligence stuff and stuff like that that can sometimes be a little bit too artificial. So I think it's important for us to stay awake and put in the proper processes and controls to make sure that our customers are served well.\nSurinder Thind: That's helpful. And then just kind of turning to the health care business here. Just as we kind of look over the next year in DomaniRx and the investments that you've made, just any kind of an update there in terms of progress, how we should be thinking about the cadence. And then obviously, just -- in terms of just understanding near-term dynamics, it looks like the health care business has started to stabilize in its current format. So just any color there, please.\nWilliam Stone: Well, I think it is stabilizing. I think we've done a good job. We have really improved our relationships with our clients. We have some big opportunities even outside of DomaniRx, and we have huge opportunities with DomaniRx. We're on schedule to put upwards tens of millions of lives under DomaniRx in the first quarter of 2024, and we're poised to do that. So we're optimistic, and we think health care is an excellent segment to be in with a lot of opportunity and similar aging technology where our innovation capabilities and technology capabilities will be very well received.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then just in terms of as you think about the investments you made, like does health care operate relatively independently as everybody else within the organization? Or how should we think about that business in terms of, what I would call, the amount of investment that's going on there and your ability to kind of leverage internal resources?\nWilliam Stone: Well, again, remember, most of these health care organizations also have insurance backgrounds in them. And so a big singularity client is Aetna, CVS and Cigna and we're also pitching other big health care and insurance organizations like Anthem. And so, we think that the health and wealth process is also pretty important. And as you have an aging population, all of us that are working might have a relative or someone that gets ill or something and you need to be able to take care of them and really understanding the provider networks and being able to add value to all of our clients across all of our segments, I think it's symbiotic. And that's something that we've stayed with and we've made the investment. Yes, we took a couple of whacks on the chin, but hey, you don't get anywhere unless you -- as one of our great clients said to me once, you got to have perseverance to get through these large system developments.\nRahul Kanwar: And just to add to kind of the second part of that, there is a fair amount of overlap internally on the compute that we're using in the data centers and operational processes. So the businesses are helping each other.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. Okay. That’s it from me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take a follow-up question now from Peter Heckmann at D.A. Davidson.\nPeter Heckmann: I apologize if I missed it. Did you provide an updated target date for the first big conversion on Domani?\nWilliam Stone: Yes. We're going to convert -- we have a big drug discount card business that we're going to convert beginning in the first quarter of 2024, and that's tens of millions of lives.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. 2024. And then just in regards to some of the carryover investments from DST. Can you just remind us what's left in the unconsolidated affiliates and as well some of the investments? I think I would have expected that investment number to be falling a little bit and moving into the cash column, but still have a number of fairly illiquid investments in that category.\nBrian Schell: Yes, there's still more there. I would say the most illiquid is a lot of real estate that we are continuing to market and take a look at. That's a tough market right now, and particularly in some of the properties with respect to office buildings located in downtown centers. There's still some investments that are actually yielding positive results, but we're not pulling those into earnings on an active basis, even though it is a positive number. So I would say there's still a bit of balance sheet hang that we are doing a reasonably good job of keeping cash flow neutral. But is it quite covering everything that's out there? Maybe not, but it's getting close. So we are winding it down. Those real estate assets are probably going to take some time that are still sitting out there.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And gentlemen, it appears we have no further questions this afternoon. Mr. Stone, I'd like to turn things back to you, sir, for any closing comments.\nWilliam Stone: Well, again, we appreciate all of you being on. We appreciate the questions we got, and we appreciate where we stand, and we look forward to talking to you after the end of the year. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Stone. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the SS&C Technologies Q3 2023 Earnings Call. Again, I would like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great day. Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "William Stone",
            "content": "Thanks, Justine, and thanks everyone for joining. Let's all welcome Brian to his first SS&C earnings call. He has been with us for two months and has found his bearings. We're excited about his ideas and intellect he brings to the organization, and I encourage all of you to get to know him. Results for the third quarter are record adjusted revenue of $1,366.7 million, up 3.4% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.17. We also achieved our second-highest adjusted consolidated EBITDA in our history at $533.9 million. Our EBITDA margin was 39.1%, a 230 basis point increase from Q2 2023. Our third quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 2.3%, driven by strength in our alternatives, particularly private markets, Intralinks, Retirement and Blue Prism. Our recurring revenue growth was [amidst] (ph) the license and professional service revenue streams was up over 5%, which we think is an indicator of our underlying business' strength. The Financial Services retention rate for Q3 2023 was 97.3%, the highest level in the SS&C history. SS&C generated cash from operating activities of $826.7 million for the nine months ended September 30th, up 8.1% over the same period last year. In Q3 2023, we bought back 1.7 million shares for $96.9 million at an average price of $55.82. We also raised our common stock quarterly dividend of 20% to $0.24 per share, delivering $156.6 million in total cash return to shareholders in the quarter and $501.9 million year-to-date. SS&C paid down $54.7 million in debt in Q3 2023, bringing our net leverage ratio to 3.18 times consolidated EBITDA, attributable to SS&C. In the near term, we believe SS&C's common stock is undervalued, and we expect to maintain a higher level of stock repurchases versus debt paydown. We've made a lot of progress within the firm while Blue Prism's digital worker deployment. We have a 2,000 full-time equivalent headcount savings year-to-date, which is 7% of our January 1, 2023 employee base. Conservatively at 50,000 per FTE , this is $100 million in run rate savings. So far, the biggest successes have been within our large outsourcing businesses, GIDS, and Alternative Fund Services. One example is a GIDS client asked us to run a campaign to contact over 20,000 customers to clear their small cash balances. We programmed 25 Blue Prism Digital Workers to perform the follow-on processing, saving about $140,000 on contractors that would have been required to process the responses manually. Within Alternatives, operational functions such as manual statement downloads, reconciliation and break investigation and resolution, investor statements in contract notes, and loan closing and compliance have benefited from digital workers. We believe we have just begun to reap the benefits from this initiative. I'll now turn the call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Brian. Earlier this week, we hosted nearly 1,000 clients and prospects at our SS&C Deliver Conference in Austin, Texas. Delivering the Future was the theme of the conference, with a big emphasis on the power of AI and robotics process automation. We showcased over 40 solutions across the key market segments we serve, and initial feedback has been positive. I'll now open it up for questions. You know, Dan, I think the retention rates really reflects the concentration we've put on customer service and making sure that we run these customer satisfaction calls every month and we keep track of them and we're really putting a tremendous amount of emphasis. And we also believe that the ability for us to cross-sell and up-sell into our current client base is much stronger than we may have looked at it before. And so, I think the renewed emphasis on that and our customer relationship management programs is starting to pay off. Yes, I would say that -- I think our pipeline in our fund administration businesses is over $400 million, so that's a lot of revenue. Now you got to close it, right? And then you got to get them live. And so it's not a -- not just a walk in the park, but it does indicate kind of the lead we have in a number of our areas. Intralinks is seeing ticks up in their lead generation and our ability to close on additional M&A that's happened in that marketplace. And I think, the private markets looks like it's going to remain strong through the end of the year. And we have -- we were a little light on license revenue, but 606 and renewals is always kind of a crapshoot. And I think that Q3 was particularly soft, but that ought to rebound a little bit in Q4 and also in 2024. Yes, I think that as we've said on a number of these calls that driving our margins up, we don't find to be particularly difficult. We have great clients, we have great people and we continually look at productivity enhancements and Blue Prism has been a great addition to that, not only in us deploying 1,700 or 1,600 digital workers and -- by the end of this year and then also having also allowed us to grow and not add FTEs into our workforce. So we're pretty excited about that opportunity and even as a business itself, we have some talented people running that business and they have driven margins from a little bit negative when we acquired them in the second quarter of 2022 to probably going to end the fourth quarter at above 30% margins at Blue Prism, which is kind of a hallmark of SS&C is that, we manage our businesses, we drive high EBITDA, we pay down debt quickly, we're buying back stock. We're pretty bullish. Wall street is not particularly bullish, but we're pretty bullish. Yes, Alex, I think primarily the swings are -- there's a lot of stuff going on in the world, right? And just like the licensed businesses get -- people get skittish about major capital allocations. And so that was a little soft in Q3 and we're hoping it rebounds in Q4, but we're not trying to stick our neck out on license revenue. Like we said at the beginning, our recurring revenue growth in the third quarter was over 5% up. So that's primarily all of our fund administration businesses and other recurring revenue businesses. And so we got maybe a little conservative here in Q4, but we're trying to give you our best guess and then we're trying to go out and continue to build the business. And I would just add a little bit, Alex, that we're a technology company, right? So we need to make these products better and we compete against big gigantic financial institutions that you guys are very familiar with. And we think our ability to out innovate, our ability to deliver more product, our ability to have more intuitive systems is one of our greatest strengths. And some of GIDS, as you're well aware, is in a pretty mature business. But at the same time, if we can continue to innovate, then when we go up against our competitors, there is really -- they don't have a chance. I think that's our real opportunity and that's why we've stuck with the knitting and that's what we're doing both in GIDS. That's what we're going to do with DomaniRx. That's what we're doing across everything we're doing. That's why we remain reasonably bullish. Well, we're constantly in the market -- marketplace and it all depends on what's for sale, at what price and can we sell our stuff to their client base, and can we take what we buy and sell it into our client base. So I would imagine, just like [high risk] (ph) that we did here a couple of months ago, and we have a few other small tuck-ins that we'll probably do, we really like the Australian market. We really like the Canadian market as well as the US market. And there's some things that we like in the UK that we think are pretty interesting. So I think we might deploy $100 million in the next three to six months on acquisitions, but we don't have anything right now that we would be closing on in that range. So we like M&A, we think we're good at it. We think we can drive margins and give the people a good place to work. But you got to get them at the right price and you got to be disciplined about it. And so, that's how we operate. I think there's kind of -- as it's kind of -- two things going on in that business, but I think as it relates to Eclipse, the number of new clients we have this year is maybe 1.5 times what we had in kind of a similar period last year. So we are accelerating. We're seeing kind of a lot of acceptance and it's not just new hedge funds, right? It also is -- we continue to add fixed income workflows, derivative workflows, other operational workflows, and so the kinds of organizations that this kind of suite of software and services, whether that's [indiscernible] or Eclipse, appeal to they keep getting bigger. So our markets are expanding and our sales progress is -- we're making progress there. There is a little bit of an impact of the kind of market volatility and equity volumes and things like that, which shows up in the numbers, but underlying that sales performance is very strong. Yes. And maybe I just add on the back of that, we're still -- what you're seeing in price, the numbers Brian just talked about, really still only represents in a given year maybe a third to half of our client base. Right? So as we get more automatic on these escalators and there's still conversations that we need to have in 2024, we do expect that'll continue to help us. Well, I think the whole key to this kind of a business is how efficient can you be, right? Let's not glamor here, right? You need to be in balance, right? You need to be in balance. Some of our customers do millions of trades a day, right? What they want us to do is make sure we process them, balance them, get you ready to trade the next day, right? And so, that's a big part of what we do, and it's a big part of how we're using the new technologies to allow us to spot problems before it becomes a crisis and to be able to always be there for our clients. And like when COVID hit and things like that, we had all kinds of clients coming to us, right? Because we stood up. We kept processing all through that stuff. And people learned that, wow, they don't really have fail-over. They don't really have the infrastructure that we have and what we've spent to have it. And so, I think some of those kinds of things are what these new technologies are allowing you to do somewhat easier, somewhat faster. But then you got to be careful. You have to still be in balance. You have to still be able to reconcile. You have to still be able to understand what that means, right? The humans have to be in charge. Otherwise, you start looking at this technology and decide it's always right. And it's not always right. So it's important to have the right controls, the right processes, the right procedures as you add sophisticated technology that artificial intelligence stuff and stuff like that that can sometimes be a little bit too artificial. So I think it's important for us to stay awake and put in the proper processes and controls to make sure that our customers are served well. Well, I think it is stabilizing. I think we've done a good job. We have really improved our relationships with our clients. We have some big opportunities even outside of DomaniRx, and we have huge opportunities with DomaniRx. We're on schedule to put upwards tens of millions of lives under DomaniRx in the first quarter of 2024, and we're poised to do that. So we're optimistic, and we think health care is an excellent segment to be in with a lot of opportunity and similar aging technology where our innovation capabilities and technology capabilities will be very well received. Well, again, remember, most of these health care organizations also have insurance backgrounds in them. And so a big singularity client is Aetna, CVS and Cigna and we're also pitching other big health care and insurance organizations like Anthem. And so, we think that the health and wealth process is also pretty important. And as you have an aging population, all of us that are working might have a relative or someone that gets ill or something and you need to be able to take care of them and really understanding the provider networks and being able to add value to all of our clients across all of our segments, I think it's symbiotic. And that's something that we've stayed with and we've made the investment. Yes, we took a couple of whacks on the chin, but hey, you don't get anywhere unless you -- as one of our great clients said to me once, you got to have perseverance to get through these large system developments. Yes. We're going to convert -- we have a big drug discount card business that we're going to convert beginning in the first quarter of 2024, and that's tens of millions of lives. Well, again, we appreciate all of you being on. We appreciate the questions we got, and we appreciate where we stand, and we look forward to talking to you after the end of the year. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Our core businesses continued to grow nicely with Alternatives, Intralinks, and Retirement accelerating from last quarter. Our Alternatives business grew 8.4% in the quarter, boosted by the strength of our private markets business. We signed a very significant private credit client in Q3 and see opportunities to sustain and accelerate growth for the foreseeable future. Intralinks also accelerated in the quarter, growing over 10% despite M&A deal volume remaining low. The growth can be attributed to increase in contract values, longer due-diligence timelines and more large deals won. We released new tools to help us drive these large deals in contract values. DocuAI uses generative artificial intelligence to proactively deliver document summaries, suggested document classification, document translation and identify potential risks. Intralinks DealVault, a cloud-based storage solution designed for streamlined access to archives and efficient deal data management, recently launched and has attracted interest from corporate clients. In Q3, the largest new Black Diamond sales to date was closed. This client chose the Black Diamond platform to power their newly-launched Wealth Management business created through the acquisition of multiple RIAs and broker-dealers. We continue to invest in R&D and support our customers. We won four awards from Waters Technology, including Best Buy-Side Order Management System, Best Execution Management System, Best Portfolio Management System, and Best Accounting Provider. SS&C Blue Prism was also recognized by Gartner as a leader in the 2023 Magic Quadrant for robotic process automation for the fifth year in a row. We believe these recognitions are indicative of our market-centric approach to R&D. I'll join Bill and the rest of our management team in welcoming Brian to SS&C. And now I'll turn the call over to him to run through the financials. I think the difference in what we expected versus where we ended up from a software license revenue was in the order of magnitude of about $20 million to 25 million in the quarter. Yes, that's right. Primarily institutional and investment management business and some impact in advent as well. Yes, it does. We're continuing to make progress, as you know, we did win a few large deals. I want to say about 18 to 24 months ago that we've been working hard on implementing. And where we are right now is we have one of them fully live and another one scheduled to go live in early 2024. And you're starting to see really the revenue benefit of that happening. I think it's primarily -- we've been working on a number of large deals and bringing them live. And as they come live, we see our revenue take up. So that's -- there was some backlog on that revenue that kind of showed up in the quarter, which we were happy to see. And we do think that we have some more opportunity to have these kinds of step changes in 2024 as well. And just to add to kind of the second part of that, there is a fair amount of overlap internally on the compute that we're using in the data centers and operational processes. So the businesses are helping each other."

            "name": "Brian Schell",
            "content": "Thanks, Rahul, and thank you, Bill, for those kind remarks. I'd like to start by saying, I'm excited to be part of the SS&C leadership team and looking forward to help build on the strength of SS&C today with the ultimate goal of delivering long-term shareholder value. As noted in our press release, our Q3 2023 GAAP results reflect revenues of $1,365.9 million, net income of $156 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.61. And as Bill noted earlier in the call, our adjusted revenues were $1,366.7 million, up 3.4%. Adjusted operating income increased 6.4% and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.17, a 1.7% increase over Q3 2022. Adjusted revenues increased $44.7 million, or 3.4% over Q3 2022. Our acquisitions contributed $2.4 million or approximately 20 basis points. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $13.2 million or 1%. As a result, adjusted organic revenue growth on a constant-currency basis was 2.3%. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter of 2023 was $517.4 million, an increase of $31.3 million or 6.4% in the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating margins were 37.9% in the third quarter of 2023, as compared to 36.8% in the third quarter of 2022. The 110 basis point margin expansion reflects the positive impact of both revenue growth and disciplined expense management. While our cost structure has been impacted by general inflation, higher personnel costs, and increased professional fees compared to 2022, our core expenses only increased 30 basis points or $2.6 million, excluding acquisitions and on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $2 million in expenses and foreign currency increased costs by $8.4 million. And note that our expenses calculated on a similar basis is down $28.6 million or 3.3% sequentially. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA attributable to SS&C, defined in Note 3 in the earnings release was $533.9 million, or 39.1% of adjusted revenue, an increase of $32.2 million, or 6.4%, from Q3 last year. The 39.1% EBITDA margin reflects both a sequential and year-over-year improvement of 230 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. Net interest expense for the third quarter of 2023 was $117.3 million, an increase of $35.1 million from Q3 2022. The Q3 2023 net interest expense excludes $3.4 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter for the amended credit facility, including the senior notes were 6.87% compared to 4.55% in the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted net income, as defined in Note 4 in the earnings release was $295.9 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.17. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Share repurchases of 1.7 million, drove the diluted share count down to 253.9 million from 255 million in Q2. SS&C ended the third quarter with $447.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.9 billion in gross debt. SS&C's net debt as defined in our credit agreement, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $106.1 million held at DomaniRx LLC, was $6.6 billion as of September 30. Our LTM consolidated EBITDA used for covenant compliance was $2,063.8 million as of September 2023. Based on net debt of approximately $6.6 billion, our total leverage ratio was 3.18 times. Our secured leverage ratio was 2.21 times as of September 30. As we look forward to the fourth quarter and establishing our guidance, note that we will continue to focus on client service and assume that our retention rates will continue to be in the range of our most recent results. We will continue to manage our expenses with a cost-discipline approach by controlling and aligning variable expenses to ensure efficiency, increasing productivity, to improve our operating margins, to leverage our scale, and effectively investing in the business through marketing, sales, and R&D to take advantage of future growth opportunities. Specifically, we have assumed adjusted organic growth for Q4 in the range of 1.8% to 4.8%, resulting in adjusted organic growth for the year in the range of 2.1% to 2.9%. FX rates will be at current levels. Interest rates to remain flat through the end of the year, compared to the ending rate in the third quarter. GAAP tax rate of approximately 26% on an adjusted basis, which is unchanged from prior guidance. Capital expenditures to remain at 3.9% to 4.1% of revenues, which is unchanged from prior guidance, and a more weighted emphasis to share repurchases similar to what we did in Q3. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1,370 million to $1,410 million. Adjusted net income in the range of $305 million to $327 million. Interest expense, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount in the range of $116 million to $119 million, diluted shares in the range of 252 million to 254 million, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1. 21 to $1.29. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5,463.5 million to $5,503.5 million. Adjusted net income in the range of $1,159.9 million to $1,181.9 million. Diluted shares in the range of 254.5 million to 255 million. Adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.55 to $4.64 and cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1,180 million to $1,230 million. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Bill for final comments. Yes. No, thanks for the question. And I would say the priorities that we have are continuing to try and build on the momentum here. As I said in my opening comments, I think that one of the things the finance group and our leadership is looking to do is, continue to enhance some of the tools that the leaders at the front lines are actually using with respect to the contracts to help make better decisions, more timely decisions. What they're looking at around pricing, what they're looking around implementing investment and expenses to drive future revenue growth. I think it has been important. I think the team is already -- has always been focused on looking at expenses and trying to make sure that the expense level and spend, variable and fixed, adjusts in accordance with, I'll call it, revenue outlook. So that revenue growth is obviously very important, but so is making sure that we have an appropriate margin that we're bringing to our shareholders. So I would say it's continuation along those lines. I think we'll continue to try and drive some incremental metrics to give increasing visibility to -- again, to continue to help understand what's driving the business and the strength that we see in it, that sometimes may be masked by the aggregate numbers and some of those trends. So we'll continue to try and highlight those. And lastly, I would say on the capital allocation piece, again putting that in perspective of how we view and how we're going to maybe be a little bit more proactive around what we're doing with respect to that cash flow, I think we've indicated, like I said, a more heavier lien and allocation towards share buyback and continue to be transparent about where we think we're going to put the capital to work. I think that, one, we're happy with the progress, right? At the same time, we do believe there's more opportunity. If you kind of think about the end markets. The end markets include wealth managers in Europe, wealth managers in Australia. We're selling a comprehensive array of services and software. And as we think through our pipeline, that GIDS business has some of the biggest deals that we have as a company. So we're, I think, reasonably optimistic that we can accelerate the growth rate from where we are currently. Yeah, so we've -- as we look at this and we kind of factor this in. And this, again, this is kind of a mix relative to the flows, inflows and outflows. I think we kind of talked about the -- I'll call it the $130 million to $150 million range. Again, sometimes it's hard to disaggregate to a single factor and that kind of builds over time, right, through -- and that could, call it, accelerating the 4Q to have incrementally more versus the third quarter. So we're seeing nice price increases, we're building in more and more contracts and a lot of them already have this in here for CPI adjustments or automatic adjustments, so they kick in. So we're seeing adoption, we're seeing it going in place. It's not an insidious contributor to incremental revenue growth. So I would expect to see more of that on a go-forward basis. And James, we also will continue to innovate that allows our clients when we do raise prices to feel good about what we're spending their money on. Right? So if you look at our R&D spend, it goes up every quarter, it goes up every year, that this year we'll spend close to $500 million. And that's besides spending like a $1.7 on Blue Prism or what we spend on [indiscernible] or what we spend on other things, that gives our clients a more robust offering across all the different segments we serve. Yes, there's still more there. I would say the most illiquid is a lot of real estate that we are continuing to market and take a look at. That's a tough market right now, and particularly in some of the properties with respect to office buildings located in downtown centers. There's still some investments that are actually yielding positive results, but we're not pulling those into earnings on an active basis, even though it is a positive number. So I would say there's still a bit of balance sheet hang that we are doing a reasonably good job of keeping cash flow neutral. But is it quite covering everything that's out there? Maybe not, but it's getting close. So we are winding it down. Those real estate assets are probably going to take some time that are still sitting out there."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SS&C Technologies Q2 2023 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Head of Investor Relations, Justine Stone. You may begin.\nJustine Stone: Welcome and thank you for joining us for our Q2 2023 earnings call. I'm Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Pedonti, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, we need to review the Safe Harbor statement. Please note that various remarks we make today about future expectations, plans, and prospects, including the financial outlook we provide, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K which is on file with the SEC and can be accessed on our website. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of today, July 27th, 2023. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable financial measures is included in today's earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stone: Thanks Justine and thanks everyone for joining. Results for the second quarter are $1.363 million in adjusted revenue, up 2.5% and our adjusted diluted earnings for share were $1.08, an increase in interest expense which was $118 million in Q2 2023 compared to $68 million in Q2 2022, and general expenses have put some pressure on our bottom-line. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $502.4 million and our EBITDA margin was 36.8%, up 103 basis points from Q2 2022. Our second quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 2.5%, driven by strength in our alternatives business, particularly private markets, which was up over 20%, Intralinks and retirement businesses. SS&C generated cash from operating activities of $584.2 million for the six months ended June 30, up $132 million or 30.5% over the same period last year. We paid down $125 million in debt in Q2, bringing our consolidated net leverage ratio to 3.27 times and our net secured leverage ratio to 2.28 times consolidated EBITDA. In Q2, we bought back 2 million shares for $111.9 million at an average price of $56.17 per share, and we will continue to target 50% of our cash flow to stock buybacks and 50% to debt pay down. Our M&A strategy remains disciplined and we have yet to see movement on any large assets. We do think that there will be opportunity to do some tuck-in acquisitions in the near term. Expense management will be a priority for the remainder of the year. Our internal deployment of Blue Prism digital workers is well underway, and we are on track to see what your targets. We currently have over 500 digital workers deployed across all business units. We believe this is one of the fastest deployments of digital workers in Blue Prism's history. Currently, the largest use of Blue Prism is in our goods and fund administration businesses, but we see significant opportunity in retirement, health, regulatory, and tax reporting. Operational functions in production with digital workers include reconciliation, break investigation and resolution, statement downloads, daily price files, investor contract notes, and statements and reporting. We expect the FTE savings to accelerate in the back half of the year as these live processes are embedded in the business and the full benefits are realized. I'll now turn it over to Rahul.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks Bill. Our business continues to strengthen as we prioritize innovation and new product rollout across. Intralinks rebounded with 9% growth in Q2. Average deal sizes up, price increases have been implemented. Deal services, which offers redaction and NDA services, has become Intralinks fastest growing product. In our investor portal business, we launched InView, a purpose-built portal designed for investors to aggregate all of their fund reports into a single view and make data-driven decisions. Initial client feedback has been positive. As Bill mentioned, private markets continues to accelerate with strong growth in Q2. Private credit, in particular, is a big opportunity for us and our offering has made significant advancements as we go live on the SS&C private cloud environment. GoCheck integration, loan platform integration, our robust data platform are all key functionalities to manage complex fund structures. Retirement, which grew 7% in Q2, has several multimillion dollar opportunities in the pipeline. We recently surpassed $1 billion on our retirement income clearing and calculation platform and have grown the number of participants 42% since January. Sales remained strong in Q2, with headline wins in fund services, Advent, and GIDS. Some key attributes that our prospects cited were strong functionality, ability to purchase both software and services from a single vendor, and our commitment to innovation. Sales priorities remain disciplined execution, offering holistic and comprehensive solutions for customers and paying close attention to their onboarding experience. As one example, we recently announced Blue Prism has partnered with the National Health Services Shares Business Services team to provide additional services to the NHS in England. Using Blue Prism's intelligent automation platform, NHS organizations can improve patient care, expedite patient processing, and transform standardized services, contact center communications, HR, finance, and other corporate functions. These new capabilities mirror the needs of our pharmacy and health care customers in SS&C Health and review the kind of our health care products and services, including DomaniRx, along with Blue Prism to be a powerful solution. I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials\nPatrick Pedonti: Thanks. Results for the second quarter were GAAP revenues of $1,362.6 million, GAAP net income of $130.7 million and GAAP EPS of $0.51. Adjusted revenues were $1,363.4 million. Adjusted revenues were up 2.5%, adjusted operating income increased 6.7% and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.08, a 1.8% decrease from Q2 2022 due to the impact of higher interest rates on our debt. Adjusted organic revenue increase on a constant basis was 2.5%. Acquisitions contributed $5.8 million. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $3.4 million. We had strength across several product lines, including alternatives, GIDS transfer agency services, Blue Prism and the Intralinks businesses. Adjusted operating margins expanded in Q2 2023 as we manage expense growth. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2023 increased $30.5 million or 6.7% from the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating margins were 35.6% in the second quarter compared to 34.2% in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding acquisitions, expenses increased 0.6% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $3.8 million of expenses and foreign currency decreased costs by $6.2 million. Net interest expense in the second quarter was $118 million, an increase of $50.3 million or 74% from Q2 2022. Q2 2023 net interest expense includes $3.4 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter was 6.59% compared to 3.45% in the second quarter 2022. Adjusted net income, as defined in Note 4, was $274.6 million and adjusted EPS was $1.08, and effective tax rate was 26%. Diluted shares decreased to $255 million from $257 million in Q1. Higher share repurchases during the first and second quarter look to the decrease. On the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the second quarter with $439.7 million cash and cash equivalents and $7 billion of gross debt. SS&C's net debt, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $114.4 million held at DomaniRx, was $6.6 billion as of June 30th. Operating cash flow for the six months was $584.2 million and $136.7 million or 30.5% increase compared to the same period in 2022. And for the six months ended June 30th, we purchased treasury stock for a total of $246.6 million or 4.3 million shares at an average price of $57.78. We declared and paid a dividend of $101 million in common stock compared to $102 million last year. Net debt payments for the six months was $169.8 million. And for the six months, we paid $226.9 million of interest compared to $112.6 million in 2022. In the six months, we paid income taxes of $159 million comparable to $156.5 million in 2022 and our accounts receivable DSO was 53.1 days compared to 55.9 days as of June 2022. Capital expenditures and capitalized software totaled $121.4 million or 4.5% of revenue on a year-to-date basis. Our LTM consolidated EBITDA, which we use for covenant compliance, was $2,031.6 million as of June 30. Based on net debt of $6.6 billion total leverage ratio was 3.27%, and our secured leverage ratio was 2.28%. On outlook for the remainder of the year, I'll cover a few assumptions. First, we'll continue to focus on client services. Retention rates will continue to be in the range of our most recent results. We have assumed foreign currency exchange will be at current levels. Our outlook assumes software license business will have lower growth in the second half of the year compared to previous expectations. Adjusted organic growth for the year will be between 2% and 4%. Adjusted organic growth for Q3 will be in the range of 1.5% to 4.5%. We have assumed interest rates will stay consistent with current rates for the remainder of the year, and we will manage expenses and personnel costs to improve our operating margins. And we'll continue to invest in our business long term with capital expenditures in the range of 4% of revenues and I would expect our GAAP tax rate to continue to be approximately 26%. So, for the third quarter of 2023, we expect revenues in the range of $1,355 million to $1,395 million. Adjusted net income in the range of $287 million to $309 million and diluted shares in the range of $254 million to $256 million. For the full year, we expect revenues in the range of $5,469 million to $5,575 million. Adjusted net income in the range of $1,160 million to $1,225 million and diluted shares in the range of $254 million to $257 million. For the full year, we expect cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1,165 million to $1,335 million. The DST Arista 401(k) settlement, which we recently announced, is excluded from these cash flow estimates. If the court approves the settlement in 2023, we expect the impact on cash flow to be approximately $40 million net of taxes. And I'll turn it over to Bill for final comments.\nBill Stone: Thanks Patrick. and I want to congratulate you on your retirement. Patrick has been with SS&C since 1999. You've seen us through over 60 acquisitions, the go private transaction, and our 2010 IPO. Thank you for your accomplishments and your dedication. I also want to welcome Brian Schell to SS&C as our newly appointed CFO. Brian will join us SS&C on August 7th from his position as CFO of [Indiscernible]. Brian has MBA from George Washington University and has done Graduate Degree from the University of Notre Dame. Finally, SS&C has spent the past 37 years developing and acquiring a broad range of market-leading technology. We have added world-class service around these products. Multiple times, we have aggressively and extensively defended our intellectual property against misappropriation. We have done it successfully multiple times. On occasion, our professional fees will pick up as we hire expensive legal talent. And now, I will open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Thanks so much and let me add my congratulations to Patrick as well, and welcome to Brian. It looks like you continue to see real nice momentum in the organic growth came in at about 2.5% and the guide for Q3 and the full year is 3%. If I do the math, I think that implies 5% for Q4. I just want to confirm that, number one. And then that's a really nice acceleration from the beginning of the year. Maybe if I'm right on that 5%, could you maybe just help bridge maybe from the 1% to the 5% or maybe the 2.5% that you just put up to the 5%, maybe start there?\nBill Stone: Well, I think that we did 2.5% in Q1, in Q2 2.6% maybe. I think in Q3, we're expecting somewhere between 1.5% and 4.5%. And for Q4, I think, Patrick, what do we have for Q4 on the organic revenue growth?\nPatrick Pedonti: Q4 at the midpoint in Q4 at about 4.8%, so close to 5%.\nBill Stone: Yes. Does that answer your question, Kevin?\nKevin McVeigh: It does, Bill. And any sense that the professional fees on IT. Just any additional just thoughts around that? Because it seems like the delta on the EPS was interested, it sounded like some medical. And then I think those professional services that you just alluded to, is that right?\nBill Stone: Medical claims, obviously, interest expense is by far the biggest thing to impact EPS. But on operating basis, medical claims and professional fees were more than expected in Q2. And we -- you have no choice but seeing these things through to the end. But if you don't protect your IP, then we're not protecting the shareholders' assets. And so we will continue to do that. And like I said, we've been successful a number of times.\nKevin McVeigh: Makes sense. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. Bill, maybe you could just spend a moment talking about some of the you've got for these investments that you mentioned in the release. You sound pretty adamant that they're going to drive incremental revenue growth. The -- obviously, just talking about the organic growth?\nBill Stone: Well, I think, Dan, what we've done is we spent a lot of money building out a number of new systems and even in what has been a pretty tough financial market, even though it's gotten a little stronger than last quarter. But you can see on our AUA that ticked up about $15 billion in Q2, that's a good harbinger of some of the things that we've done for our clients that separates us from our competitors. And I think what we've done with the technology in our services business is to make it that it's a compelling offering for our clients and our prospects and we continue to take business from our competitors. I think it's still lumpy, right, particularly with the best funds. We have -- feels we think we would have sort of closed months ago that literally drag. And there's really, at least as far as we think that there's nothing we can do to make the biggest fund to go faster. So, that's one thing. And then on the technology, the Aloha products has been pretty strong. We've done pretty well with singularity. We've got real momentum in all the additional products that we've done with Black Diamond. We've combined Black Diamond with our trust accounting so that RIAs can continue to keep -- keep the assets that they've gathered when it goes generational and the generation puts it in trust for the kids, oftentimes, they lose that business because they don't have tri-counting capabilities. So that's been pretty popular for us. And Geneva continues to dominate in the large-scale hedge fund business. And I think we have a number of those private markets as we've said, it was up over 20% in Q2. So, there's any number of pockets of strength is in all the pockets to be a strength in the same quarter, right? So, I think it is -- it's just a cost. It's making sure we're executing at a very high level and that we go for the wins. And that's we're still a very profitable company. We generate tremendous amounts of cash. We're not going anywhere. We're still very competitive, and it's just a question of really getting the entire orchestra perfectly in tune. We still on?\nBill Stone: Dan, you have a follow-up?\nJustine Stone: Sounds like maybe we lost the operator.\nPatrick Pedonti: I think we lost the operator. Yes.\nBill Stone: I thought it was a really good answer though.\nJustine Stone: I believe we have Andrew Schmidt from Citi as our next question. The operator should be joining again soon.\nBill Stone: Go ahead, Andrew. We must not be connecting with the--\nJustine Stone: No, they can still hear us.\nBill Stone: Can Andrew hear us?\nJustine Stone: I think so. I just can't open his line from where I am.\nPatrick Pedonti: Yes. Yes.\nJustine Stone: Andrew, your line should be open hear us.\nBill Stone: Well, some of the things that we're working on as we have this lull in our conference call. We're excited about bringing Brian Schell on and he brings a lot of experience and expertise. You obviously have big shoes to fill with Patrick. But I think our opportunity to -- can grow is going to be tied to continuing to up our talent and execute. We have full pipelines. We have leading positions in lots of segments of financial services. We have a real opportunity in DomaniRx, and it's really bringing all that to fruition. I think that's the challenge that we have. And I think we're up for that challenge. And we're generating $502 million in EBITDA. That kind of gives you a feeling that you have enough resources to get it done.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. Glad to have us back online here. Bill, can you talk a little bit this trade settlement -- shorting the trade settlement cycle to one day plus and then eventually to T. that's been talked about for a very long period of time. Do you view that as a catalyst at all for some of your clients to consider upgrading older systems?\nBill Stone: I think that if they have to, then they will. And if they can continue to mandate it, like a lot of them have done so far, I think they'll continue to do that. So for it to be a mad dash to get new technologies in, I don't foresee that. But there will be some that want to take advantage of the increased capability of the newer systems, the security, the speed and then also the reconciliation parts of that stuff and making sure that everything gets processed in a very timely fashion. So, there will be some disruption, but I don't think there'll be a tremendous amount of incremental revenue. Like, I don't think there's a few hundred million or something like that, right? And to move the bar on SS&C, you got to do $100 million or $200 million.\nPeter Heckmann: Right. Okay. Okay. And then Intralinks up 9% is particularly impressive given that M&A continues to be down by 25%, 30% year-over-year. I know you mentioned one area and I didn't quite catch it, but can you talk about some of the areas outside of M&A where Intralinks is outperforming and allowing that business to continue to grow.\nBill Stone: Do you want to take that, Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: Sure. I think the biggest area outside of M&A is the alternatives area. That's the in-view portal that I mentioned in my comments. It's the LP communication, capital call distribution, statement distribution, those kinds of things. And as we continue to bring our businesses closer together, develop joint solutions, we're finding lots of opportunities to sell that web and LP communication system to our fund administration clients and going to market as sort of a joint package. And that's been attractive. So, that's another area where that alternatives business is growing even faster than the M&A business right now.\nBill Stone: And I think we have like redacting services and other investments to the core offerings that have also been pretty attractive.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay, that's helpful. And then just last question. Just in terms of the way you report in this quarter, you talked about a couple tough comp from software license fees. On an annual basis, I don't believe you're still disclosing this as a separate line item, but software license fees, are we kind of talking around $65 million, $80 million a year? Is that about the right level if we just delayed the provincial licenses?\nBill Stone: I don't really have that off the top of my head, Pete. I would guess that we sell, yes, probably something $20 million, $25 million a quarter.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay, all right. I appreciate it. I will get back in the queue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt of Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions and let me extend my congratulations to Patrick, and look forward to working with Brian when he comes forward. I wanted to ask on the operating expense base. Obviously, it's been a volatile couple of years, and there's been more variability there than historically. Maybe just talk about just your visibility when it comes to the expense base in terms of just what to expect? On one hand, you maybe had a few things, labor cost for the past year. Now, you have these legal fees picking up a little bit. On the other side of this, we also have Blue Prism benefits. So, just wondering just how will this balance out in terms of your overall margin structure and visibility going forward? Thanks a lot guys.\nPatrick Pedonti: Well, I think our -- if you look at our expenses on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions in Q2, I think it was up 0.6%. So, as an overall marker, to keep your expense growth at less than 1% is, I think, pretty impressive. And as much as we've been deploying and getting some of the benefits of Blue Prism, it's like -- it's a little bit like we're in spring training. For baseball, we're not going to get really hit our stride maybe until the middle of summer. So, I think we have a lot of opportunities to further our cost management, our expense management with the deployment of digital workers. And we think we can just give our workers current human workers better jobs with more interesting work and let the digital workers do the repetitive stuff that computers are great at. So we think we have a tremendous opportunity there. Occasionally, you'll have a situation where you think your IT has been misappropriated and then you got to go defend and that's not a cheap process. And -- but it's a necessary process. And so that happens and we had some excess medical claims in the second quarter. And that's going to happen. We have a big population and we want to make sure they have great health care. And so whatever that is, we're happy to pay it.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. Thank you for that. And to be clear, you're still -- it looks like -- correct me if I'm wrong, you're still expecting operating margin in the back half. Is that correct?\nPatrick Pedonti: We are.\nAndrew Schmidt: Okay. Fantastic. And then. Just lastly, it sounds like growth sort of expected some slowness in terms of license revenues. What's the expectation for just license revenue pull-through in the back half, just given that, that can be more variable relative to kind of the other sources of revenue. Just curious to get your visibility around that. Thanks a lot guys.\nBill Stone: Well, license revenues are kind of capital expenditures for our customers. And more and more, they're going for outsourced services, longer-term contracts and less large steel capital commitment. So, I would suggest that the license business will continue to evolve more term licenses, probably perhaps longer term, which might offset some of the move towards because on longer-term licenses, you get 606 recognition. So, there's a lot of moving parts and some of the stuff with the accounting and the reporting, GAAP and then adjusted GAAP and all that, it gets a little. So, for me, I watch cash. How much cash do we get coming in here? And cash doesn't lie. So, I think that's kind of my focus and how people interpret accounting rules is a difficult process.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Michael for James. Thanks for taking our question. Bill, I think at a conference in late May, you were talking to buyback potential in the $700 million range. And then we have the buyback announcement for roughly $1 billion. Is there anything we should be reading into in terms of the higher quantum there just in terms of your use of free cash flow?\nBill Stone: I mean I don't think so. I think if we find acquisitions that we want to buy that we can get at a price where we feel like we can we can make some money, then I think we will go after acquisitions first. But after that, we're going to pretty much split it between stock buybacks and debt repayment. If interest rates alleviate, we'll probably allocate more to stock buybacks than we would to debt pay down. But we're not going to go 100% either way. And we view it as art more than we view it as science are going try to be wise.\nUnidentified Analyst: Makes sense. Appreciate that. Maybe just a follow-up on the organic rev cadence throughout the rest of the year. It seems like a scaling on the organic revenue side with exit rates close to 5% in 4Q. But is there anything in the pipeline and/or what you guys are planning on doing from a pricing perspective that gives you the visibility into that 5% number in 4Q?\nBill Stone: It's a whole combination of things, right, including price increases and getting the large-scale deals that are already in that have revenue -- have that revenue flush through in Q4 and then it's selling new business. So, I think it's a combination of things, and there's work to be done, of course. But it's still July. We've got a lot of time, and we have a lot of really talented people. And we expect results and on balance, they deliver them.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks Bill.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist. Please go ahead.\nJoe Meares: Hey guys, this is Joe Meares on for Terry. Extend my congrats to Patrick and to Brian. It's always nice to see a fellow claim in the corporate. I have a question about Blue Prism. I think at the end of last year, you had expected about 100 digital workers, you have 500 now. Do you expect to get to 1,000 by the end of 2023?\nBill Stone: I think the numbers we gave at the last conference call was between 1,350 and 2,700. And I think Rahul can correct me if I'm wrong, but we would expect to have close to 2,000 by the end of the year.\nRahul Kanwar: I think that's right.\nJoe Meares: And just a follow-up. I think in the past, you've noted about a $50,000 savings per role that's migrated Blue Prism. Is that still accurate? Or are you seeing better over savings as you've implemented more of these workers?\nBill Stone: I would say that, that's still the kind of rough estimate of where we are. We -- as we automate different processes, there's more of a -- it might be a little bit wider of a range of what we say by digital worker. But I think we would still say the averages somewhere around $50,000, plus or minus 10%.\nJoe Meares: Great. Thanks so much guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey good evening. Can you speak to which part of the company where your intellectual property litigation is targeted? And has the potential effect of your IP had any impact on that business at this point?\nBill Stone: Yes, it's primarily in our fund services business. And I would say that we think it has that impact on our business. And -- so that's why we fight these things, Patrick, is that there -- you don't want to compete against people that are competing against you with your technology. That doesn't seem particularly fair.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. Makes sense. And then what are you seeing out there in terms of deal multiples? Obviously, SimCorp sold recently at a pretty lofty multiple as data. Are there pockets where multiples are starting to come in? Or is it all still pretty frothy?\nBill Stone: I don't quite understand either one of those deals, frankly. But obviously, those are smart people that do those things, and so they do. I just look at it that we make a whole lot of money. And if we keep our eye on the ball, we're going to get some nice pits and we're going to knock them out of the park. And there's no reason to -- I understand, right? I mean we want total shareholder value and we always want our stock to go up rather than go down but we live in a 90-day world on that stuff. But technology and big time customers that they don't really live on a 90-day world. . Sometimes they wait six months before they in contract and the contract doesn't change at all in those six months. So, it's getting in the cadence of your customers and making sure that you have enough pipeline that when people delay, you got other ones that you can accelerate. And so I think that's our real challenge is a $5.5 billion if you want to grow 10% didn't have any attrition, we still have to sell $550 million. We have 4% attrition, but we have to sell $750 million. That's a lot of revenue. That's a lot bigger than most of the people that we get to.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Yes hi. Good evening everyone. Just wanted to come back to organic growth for a second here because I don't think that's been asked on the actually the cut down. I mean you were at -- I think the midpoint was 3% before -- sorry, yes, 3% before -- before -- 3% now. You talked about the software licenses, so that makes sense. But is it at all? Or is there something else that you would highlight why the reduction? I mean, you did come in better in the second quarter here as well?\nPatrick Pedonti: I can take it.\nBill Stone: Go ahead, Patrick.\nPatrick Pedonti: Yes, I think it's all -- I mean, when you compare the outlook we provided a quarter going to this outlook, it's pretty much the software business. Advent as an institutional asset management. And we're seeing improvements in some of the other outsourcing business like alternatives, Intralinks, and our health business from where we expect it to be. So, it's mostly the software business. It's still growing in the back half of the year. It's still growing in the back half of the year, but not as much as we expected.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. And then maybe on a more positive note, the GIDS business, I don't think is kind of on this call at all to pretty solid back-to-back quarters, I mean, so in the context of the normal growth in that business, 3.5%, but seems strategicable. So just wondering if there's any incremental color if that's a good growth rate for the time being? Or if you're hopeful that it's not only stabilized, so we can actually accelerate from here?\nBill Stone: Well, I think we've done a pretty good job of repositioning that entire business. And I think that we have some optimism about being able to close big deals. But in the [Indiscernible] business, they're very large, tens of millions annually. So it's a long sales process. And so it is fraught with delays. So, while we have some optimism, I would say that we're watching that very closely. Rahul, any color?\nRahul Kanwar: Well, I think I agree with everything you said. I think the other thing that I would highlight is some of our largest opportunities in the company globally are in this business, right? So, to Bill's point, the sales cycle are a little bit longer. We have to keep our eye on it at all times. But in terms of a medium-term outlook, if you kind of look out even a couple of years, we do think that this business is capable of growing a lot faster than kind of low single digits than it is right now.\nAlex Kramm: All right. Very good. Thanks guys.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call to Stone.\nBill Stone: Thank you, Bailey. Again thanks everybody for being on the call. I can assure you that we are pretty focused and we look forward to talking to you at the end of October. And Patrick, thanks again. See you.\nPatrick Pedonti: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks Justine and thanks everyone for joining. Results for the second quarter are $1.363 million in adjusted revenue, up 2.5% and our adjusted diluted earnings for share were $1.08, an increase in interest expense which was $118 million in Q2 2023 compared to $68 million in Q2 2022, and general expenses have put some pressure on our bottom-line. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $502.4 million and our EBITDA margin was 36.8%, up 103 basis points from Q2 2022. Our second quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 2.5%, driven by strength in our alternatives business, particularly private markets, which was up over 20%, Intralinks and retirement businesses. SS&C generated cash from operating activities of $584.2 million for the six months ended June 30, up $132 million or 30.5% over the same period last year. We paid down $125 million in debt in Q2, bringing our consolidated net leverage ratio to 3.27 times and our net secured leverage ratio to 2.28 times consolidated EBITDA. In Q2, we bought back 2 million shares for $111.9 million at an average price of $56.17 per share, and we will continue to target 50% of our cash flow to stock buybacks and 50% to debt pay down. Our M&A strategy remains disciplined and we have yet to see movement on any large assets. We do think that there will be opportunity to do some tuck-in acquisitions in the near term. Expense management will be a priority for the remainder of the year. Our internal deployment of Blue Prism digital workers is well underway, and we are on track to see what your targets. We currently have over 500 digital workers deployed across all business units. We believe this is one of the fastest deployments of digital workers in Blue Prism's history. Currently, the largest use of Blue Prism is in our goods and fund administration businesses, but we see significant opportunity in retirement, health, regulatory, and tax reporting. Operational functions in production with digital workers include reconciliation, break investigation and resolution, statement downloads, daily price files, investor contract notes, and statements and reporting. We expect the FTE savings to accelerate in the back half of the year as these live processes are embedded in the business and the full benefits are realized. I'll now turn it over to Rahul. Thanks Patrick. and I want to congratulate you on your retirement. Patrick has been with SS&C since 1999. You've seen us through over 60 acquisitions, the go private transaction, and our 2010 IPO. Thank you for your accomplishments and your dedication. I also want to welcome Brian Schell to SS&C as our newly appointed CFO. Brian will join us SS&C on August 7th from his position as CFO of [Indiscernible]. Brian has MBA from George Washington University and has done Graduate Degree from the University of Notre Dame. Finally, SS&C has spent the past 37 years developing and acquiring a broad range of market-leading technology. We have added world-class service around these products. Multiple times, we have aggressively and extensively defended our intellectual property against misappropriation. We have done it successfully multiple times. On occasion, our professional fees will pick up as we hire expensive legal talent. And now, I will open it up for questions. Well, I think that we did 2.5% in Q1, in Q2 2.6% maybe. I think in Q3, we're expecting somewhere between 1.5% and 4.5%. And for Q4, I think, Patrick, what do we have for Q4 on the organic revenue growth? Yes. Does that answer your question, Kevin? Medical claims, obviously, interest expense is by far the biggest thing to impact EPS. But on operating basis, medical claims and professional fees were more than expected in Q2. And we -- you have no choice but seeing these things through to the end. But if you don't protect your IP, then we're not protecting the shareholders' assets. And so we will continue to do that. And like I said, we've been successful a number of times. Well, I think, Dan, what we've done is we spent a lot of money building out a number of new systems and even in what has been a pretty tough financial market, even though it's gotten a little stronger than last quarter. But you can see on our AUA that ticked up about $15 billion in Q2, that's a good harbinger of some of the things that we've done for our clients that separates us from our competitors. And I think what we've done with the technology in our services business is to make it that it's a compelling offering for our clients and our prospects and we continue to take business from our competitors.

Adjusted revenues were $1,363.4 million. Adjusted revenues were up 2.5%, adjusted operating income increased 6.7% and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.08, a 1.8% decrease from Q2 2022 due to the impact of higher interest rates on our debt. Adjusted organic revenue increase on a constant basis was 2.5%. Acquisitions contributed $5.8 million. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $3.4 million. We had strength across several product lines, including alternatives, GIDS transfer agency services, Blue Prism and the Intralinks businesses. Adjusted operating margins expanded in Q2 2023 as we manage expense growth. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2023 increased $30.5 million or 6.7% from the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating margins were 35.6% in the second quarter compared to 34.2% in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding acquisitions, expenses increased 0.6% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $3.8 million of expenses and foreign currency decreased costs by $6.2 million. Net interest expense in the second quarter was $118 million, an increase of $50.3 million or 74% from Q2 2022. Q2 2023 net interest expense includes $3.4 million of non-cash amortized financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter was 6.59% compared to 3.45% in the second quarter 2022. Adjusted net income, as defined in Note 4, was $274.6 million and adjusted EPS was $1.08, and effective tax rate was 26%. Diluted shares decreased to $255 million from $257 million in Q1. Higher share repurchases during the first and second quarter look to the decrease. On the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the second quarter with $439.7 million cash and cash equivalents and $7 billion of gross debt. SS&C's net debt, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $114.4 million held at DomaniRx, was $6.6 billion as of June 30th. Operating cash flow for the six months was $584.2 million and $136.7 million or 30.5% increase compared to the same period in 2022. And for the six months ended June 30th, we purchased treasury stock for a total of $246.6 million or 4.3 million shares at an average price of $57.78. We declared and paid a dividend of $101 million in common stock compared to $102 million last year. Net debt payments for the six months was $169.8 million. And for the six months, we paid $226.9 million of interest compared to $112.6 million in 2022. In the six months, we paid income taxes of $159 million comparable to $156.5 million in 2022 and our accounts receivable DSO was 53.1 days compared to 55.9 days as of June 2022. Capital expenditures and capitalized software totaled $121.4 million or 4.5% of revenue on a year-to-date basis. Our LTM consolidated EBITDA, which we use for covenant compliance, was $2,031.6 million as of June 30. Based on net debt of $6.6 billion total leverage ratio was 3.27%, and our secured leverage ratio was 2.28%. On outlook for the remainder of the year, I'll cover a few assumptions. First, we'll continue to focus on client services. Retention rates will continue to be in the range of our most recent results. We have assumed foreign currency exchange will be at current levels. Our outlook assumes software license business will have lower growth in the second half of the year compared to previous expectations. Adjusted organic growth for the year will be between 2% and 4%. Adjusted organic growth for Q3 will be in the range of 1.5% to 4.5%. We have assumed interest rates will stay consistent with current rates for the remainder of the year, and we will manage expenses and personnel costs to improve our operating margins. And we'll continue to invest in our business long term with capital expenditures in the range of 4% of revenues and I would expect our GAAP tax rate to continue to be approximately 26%. So, for the third quarter of 2023, we expect revenues in the range of $1,355 million to $1,395 million. Adjusted net income in the range of $287 million to $309 million and diluted shares in the range of $254 million to $256 million. For the full year, we expect revenues in the range of $5,469 million to $5,575 million. Adjusted net income in the range of $1,160 million to $1,225 million and diluted shares in the range of $254 million to $257 million. For the full year, we expect cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1,165 million to $1,335 million. The DST Arista 401(k) settlement, which we recently announced, is excluded from these cash flow estimates. If the court approves the settlement in 2023, we expect the impact on cash flow to be approximately $40 million net of taxes. And I'll turn it over to Bill for final comments. Q4 at the midpoint in Q4 at about 4.8%, so close to 5%. I think we lost the operator. Yes. Yes. Yes. Well, I think our -- if you look at our expenses on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions in Q2, I think it was up 0.6%. So, as an overall marker, to keep your expense growth at less than 1% is, I think, pretty impressive. And as much as we've been deploying and getting some of the benefits of Blue Prism, it's like -- it's a little bit like we're in spring training. For baseball, we're not going to get really hit our stride maybe until the middle of summer. So, I think we have a lot of opportunities to further our cost management, our expense management with the deployment of digital workers. And we think we can just give our workers current human workers better jobs with more interesting work and let the digital workers do the repetitive stuff that computers are great at. So we think we have a tremendous opportunity there. Occasionally, you'll have a situation where you think your IT has been misappropriated and then you got to go defend and that's not a cheap process. And -- but it's a necessary process. And so that happens and we had some excess medical claims in the second quarter. And that's going to happen. We have a big population and we want to make sure they have great health care. And so whatever that is, we're happy to pay it. We are. I can take it. Yes, I think it's all -- I mean, when you compare the outlook we provided a quarter going to this outlook, it's pretty much the software business. Advent as an institutional asset management. And we're seeing improvements in some of the other outsourcing business like alternatives, Intralinks, and our health business from where we expect it to be. So, it's mostly the software business. It's still growing in the back half of the year. It's still growing in the back half of the year, but not as much as we expected. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks Bill. Our business continues to strengthen as we prioritize innovation and new product rollout across. Intralinks rebounded with 9% growth in Q2. Average deal sizes up, price increases have been implemented. Deal services, which offers redaction and NDA services, has become Intralinks fastest growing product. In our investor portal business, we launched InView, a purpose-built portal designed for investors to aggregate all of their fund reports into a single view and make data-driven decisions. Initial client feedback has been positive. As Bill mentioned, private markets continues to accelerate with strong growth in Q2. Private credit, in particular, is a big opportunity for us and our offering has made significant advancements as we go live on the SS&C private cloud environment. GoCheck integration, loan platform integration, our robust data platform are all key functionalities to manage complex fund structures. Retirement, which grew 7% in Q2, has several multimillion dollar opportunities in the pipeline. We recently surpassed $1 billion on our retirement income clearing and calculation platform and have grown the number of participants 42% since January. Sales remained strong in Q2, with headline wins in fund services, Advent, and GIDS. Some key attributes that our prospects cited were strong functionality, ability to purchase both software and services from a single vendor, and our commitment to innovation. Sales priorities remain disciplined execution, offering holistic and comprehensive solutions for customers and paying close attention to their onboarding experience. As one example, we recently announced Blue Prism has partnered with the National Health Services Shares Business Services team to provide additional services to the NHS in England. Using Blue Prism's intelligent automation platform, NHS organizations can improve patient care, expedite patient processing, and transform standardized services, contact center communications, HR, finance, and other corporate functions. These new capabilities mirror the needs of our pharmacy and health care customers in SS&C Health and review the kind of our health care products and services, including DomaniRx, along with Blue Prism to be a powerful solution. I will now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials Sure. I think the biggest area outside of M&A is the alternatives area. That's the in-view portal that I mentioned in my comments. It's the LP communication, capital call distribution, statement distribution, those kinds of things. And as we continue to bring our businesses closer together, develop joint solutions, we're finding lots of opportunities to sell that web and LP communication system to our fund administration clients and going to market as sort of a joint package. And that's been attractive. So, that's another area where that alternatives business is growing even faster than the M&A business right now. I think that's right. Well, I think I agree with everything you said. I think the other thing that I would highlight is some of our largest opportunities in the company globally are in this business, right? So, to Bill's point, the sales cycle are a little bit longer. We have to keep our eye on it at all times. But in terms of a medium-term outlook, if you kind of look out even a couple of years, we do think that this business is capable of growing a lot faster than kind of low single digits than it is right now."

Today's call is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn today’s call over to Justine Stone, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJustine Stone: Hi everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Q1 2023 earnings call. I am Justine Stone, Head of Investor Relations for SS&C. On the call with me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Pedonti, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, we need to review the Safe Harbor statement. Please note the various remarks we make today about future expectations, plans, and prospects including the financial outlook we provide constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and can also be accessed on our website. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of today, April 27th, 2023. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. During today’s call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in today’s earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stone: Thanks Justine and thanks everyone for joining. We started 2023 with pretty strong revenues growing $1.363 billion and adjusted revenue up 5.2%, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share, while a little soft to $1.11 was within our range and was down 11.2% from last year. Rising interest rates obviously impacted our earnings, but we're in very good shape from a financial standpoint. We had a lot of inflation, too, especially in wages, and that also put some pressure on our bottom-line. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was over $500 million again at $509 million, and our EBITDA margin was 37.3%. First quarter with all the payroll taxes and health care expenses is normally the highest expense quarter we have. But we do expect to begin to see a lot of cost savings from our Blue Prism digital worker deployment. We believe the digital workers will drive margins and serve as a hedge against inflation. We currently have over 40 processes live and are on track to achieve our 2023 productivity goal. Our first quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 1.9. We saw good performance in alternatives in our global investor and distribution services business, retirement and our Institutional and Investment Manager segment. We generated net cash from operating activities of $254.8 million for the three months ended March 31, up 38.9% over the same period last year. We paid down $44.6 million in debt in Q1, bringing our consolidated net leverage ratio to 3.38 and our new -- our net secured leverage ratio 2.39 times of consolidated EBITDA. In Q1, SS&C bought back 2.3 million shares for $134.7 million at an average price of $59.9 and program to date treasury stock buybacks of $439.9 million for purchases of 7.8 million shares at average price of $56.34. We'll continue to target 50% of our cash flow to stock buybacks and 50% to pay down. We still look at lots of M&A while it remains disciplined, and we have yet to see any movement on large-scale assets, although we did see the German force, putting in a bid for SimCorp today. We do think we'll have opportunity for some tuck-in acquisitions before the end of the year. This April marks the fifth anniversary of the DST acquisition, which brought SS&C over $2 billion in revenue and a long list of large sophisticated clients. While we have doubled the profitability, accelerating their revenue growth, took investments in the product, the service and the leadership teams. We feel these investments are paying off, and our biggest prospects are currently in our GIDS and retirement businesses. We have all watched volatility in the financial services sector, particularly US banking over the past few months. SS&C is a strongly diversified company. We have seen limited impact to-date. As always, we will support our customers monitor the situation closely and react as necessary. I'll now turn it over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks Bill. Our business remains strong despite a volatile macroeconomic backdrop with several of our business units improving their competitive positioning. Our alternatives fund administration business posted 6.6% growth in Q1 and now has assets under administration of $2.24 trillion. GIDS, which serves the world's largest asset managers grew 3.6% this quarter. We've invested heavily in the leadership technology and service organization of this business over the last five years and continue to do so. We won large customers over the past few years and entered into long-term contract renewals with others. These marquee names, including St. James Place, Capital Group, Brooks McDonald, JPMorgan, Van land, and most recently, Mind Super provide a solid foundation from which to continue to grow. We have prioritized innovation and are working on dozens of new products and services across the company, whether it be SS&C BrightLine for tax, SS&C Everywhere for data connectivity and Insights, or SS&C Private Cloud for a purpose-built compute solution, these products solve important issues for our customers give our employees creative ways in which to add value and strengthen our business. I'll mention some of the key deals for Q1. A large UK wealth client embarked on a strategic project to move their international accounts to SS&C's Bluedoor platform, an alternative asset manager chose SOMS and fixed link services after a comprehensive RFP process, a $30 billion in AUM, private equity and real estate firm chose us and fund services, a current brokerage client chose SS&C's All Serve solution to help scale and expand the clients offering in the alternatives market, an $80 billion real estate manager with a non-traded REIT shows the suite of SS&C's fund services and retail all transfer agency services. We'll now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials.\nPatrick Pedonti: Thanks. Results for the first quarter were GAAP revenues of $1.327 million; GAAP net income of $126 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.49. Adjusted revenues were $1.634 billion. Adjusted revenues were up 5.2%. Adjusted operating income decreased 1.1% and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.11, 11.2% decrease over Q1 2022 due to the impact of higher interest rates on our debt. Adjusted revenue increased $67.2 million or 5.2%. Our acquisitions contributed $64 million. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $19.9 million or 1.5%. Adjusted organic revenue increase on a constant currency basis was 1.9%. We had strength in several product lines, including alternatives against transfer agency services business and institutional investment management business. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $493 million, a decrease of $5.7 million or 1.1% from the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating margins were 36.2% in the first quarter compared to 38.5% in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding acquisitions, expenses increased 5% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $52 million in expenses and foreign currency decreased cost by $19.6 million. Our cost structure has been impacted by general inflation, wage inflation and increase in business travel compared to 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $509 million or 37.3% of adjusted revenue, a decrease of $5.9 million from Q2 2022. Net interest expense for the quarter was $111.9 million, an increase of $62.6 million or 127% from Q1 2022. In Q1 2023, net interest expense includes $3.5 million of noncash amortized financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter for the amended credit facility, including our senior notes, was 6.21% compared to 3.11% in the first quarter of 2022. We recorded a GAAP tax provision of $52.5 million or 29% of pre-tax income. Adjusted net income was $284.4 million and adjusted EPS was $1.11, and the effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares increased to 257 million from 256.4 million in Q4. The higher average stock price partially -- was partially offset by share repurchases during the quarter. On cash flow and balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $433.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $7.1 billion of gross debt. SS&C's net debt, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $130.2 million that are held at DomaniRx, was $6.8 billion as of March 31st. Operating cash flow for the three months was $254.8 million, $1.3 million increase from the same period in 2022. Some highlights on cash flow for the three months. We bought back treasury stock for $134.7 million and repurchased 2.3 million shares at an average price of $59.19. In July 2022, the Board authorized the new stock repurchase program of up to $1 billion in stock buybacks. Program to date, treasury stock buybacks are $439.9 million for purchases of 7.8 million shares at an average price of $56.34. Net debt payments in the quarter were $44.6 million. And we paid total of interest of $138 million in the quarter compared to $74.2 million in 2022. On income taxes, in the quarter, we paid $20.9 million compared to $42 million in the first quarter of 2022. Our accounts receivable DSO was 53.5 days as of March 31st compared to 52.3 days as of March -- as of December 2022 and 52.7 days as of March 2022. Capital expenditures and capitalized software was $53.1 million or 3.9% of adjusted revenue for the quarter. Spending was predominantly for capitalized software to investment in research and development and IT infrastructure. Based on our net debt of approximately $6.8 billion, our total leverage was 3.38 times and our secured leverage was 2.39 times as of March 31st. On outlook for the year, first, I'll cover a few assumptions. We'll continue to focus on client service, and we expect retention rates to continue in the range of most recent results. We have assumed foreign currency exchange will be at current levels for the remainder of the year. And as a result, organic growth for the year will be in the range of 2% to 6%, and adjusted organic growth for Q2 will be in the range of 0.5% to 3.5%. We have assumed interest rates will increase in additional in the range of 35 to 50 bps through the remainder of the year compared to the average rate in the first quarter. We'll continue to manage our expenses during the period by controlling variable expenses and increased productivity to improve our operating margins. We'll continue to allocate free cash flow to both debt pay down and stock buybacks, and we continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be about 26%. So, for the second quarter of 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.3345 billion to $1.3745 billion. Adjusted net income in the range of $276.5 million to $293 million, and diluted shares in the range of $256.5 million to $257.5 million. And for the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $5.455 billion to $5.655 billion. Adjusted net income in the range of $1.190 billion to $1.285 billion and diluted shares in the range of 255 million to 258.5 million. And on cash from operating activities, we expect that to be in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.375 billion. And I'll turn it back over to Bill for final comments.\nBill Stone: Thanks Patrick. We expect revenue accelerated in Q3, Q4, and we expect the growth to be broad-based across a lot of our different businesses and we will be able to convert a bunch of backlog revenue. We have price increases that have already gone into effect until the revenue will begin to tick up, and we also have a very full pipeline. We have invested heavily in our product and service suite, and we remain excited about our opportunities. It's been a difficult way to get to here, but I think we're in really good shape going forward. And I'll now open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much and congratulations on the results. I look at the organic growth, it seems like it implies about 2% on average for the first half of the year and then the midpoint is 4% for the full year. So, wondering maybe just -- is it the same buckets, pricing, new business backlog and new products that drive that? Or is there maybe just to ring-fence that a little bit with the incremental drivers or as we think about the back half of the year?\nBill Stone: Kevin, I think that's primarily what it is. I mean we have a number of large-scale deals that we have sold over the last two or three years. And it seemed like they're never going to come to fruition, but they are coming to fruition, and they're going live. And with that, it releases a lot of revenue into our financial statements. And as I said, we still have full pipelines with goods, which is our -- primarily our transfer agency business growing 3.6% in the first quarter, that's quite a turnaround. And so I think we're making progress across all of those things, and I think that that's -- plus the price increases are also starting to take effect. So, I think we're in reasonably good shape for the second half of 2023.\nKevin McVeigh: That's terrific. And then just one quick follow-up. It seems like the AUA was actually up sequentially, the first time about four quarters, and that's despite some disruption in your quarter across the markets. Any thoughts around that? What's driving that?\nBill Stone: Rahul, do you want to take that?\nRahul Kanwar: Sure. We had pretty good inflows into both our hedge fund and our private equity businesses during the course of the quarter. So it's a combination of new fund launches, some organic and performance-related growth in these clients as well as new client wins. So, as you know, it's kind of the first time we've seen net uptick in a few quarters and -- but we're pretty happy about it. But we do expect to see based on the comments Bill just made about the strength of our pipeline, we're certainly seeing some momentum in the market.\nBill Stone: And I would say I'd say also that we believe we remain the strongest competitor by somewhat. And I think that there is a lot of volatility in that market, and a lot of the larger scale investment managers prefer to have our steady hand. And I think that's played out pretty well for us.\nKevin McVeigh: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. Good evening. Bill, I wanted to just take your temperature in terms of discussions that you've had with your clients. This is obviously true for Rahul as well. Kind of pre-SVB and post-SBB, you made it sound like there's not been any kind of fallout from that, and that's good to hear. But I'm just wondering kind of the posturing of what they're saying. I understand you have a backlog and it's going to get converted to these large clients, which I think is encouraging for organic growth. I'm just wondering where they sit today in kind of their readiness to release capital in order to drive new contracts with you guys?\nBill Stone: Yes. And as you noted, right, a lot of what we're expecting in the second half, we have already signed and are in the midst of bringing them live. So it's -- it is really a continuation of the last 12, 18, 24 months. And -- but there's a lot of skittishness in the financial markets, particularly the banking markets. And while we don't have a huge client base and mid-level banks, we do have something. So, we're monitoring that as closely as we can. You do kind of see that whether it's Silicon Valley or First Republic or Signature that you're really kind of on the mid spot between traditional banking and financing venture capital and other investments. So I'm not sure that the contagion is quite -- I don't think it's anything like 2008, 2009. And I think that's why it hasn't had much impact on us to-date. Of course, we'll watch it as closely as we can.\nDan Perlin: Yes. Just a quick follow-up on the -- I guess the commentary around digital workers you had in the release. It seems like you're reiterating this 1,300 to 2,700. Can you just remind us where that sits in terms of cost savings? I think we had allocated something like $65 million at the low end of that range for annualized cost savings. But I just want to take your temperature on where we sit on that as well. Thank you.\nBill Stone: No, I mean it's nail in the head, Dan, $65 million. We're estimating about 1,000 in savings as we deploy digital workers per worker. And knock on wood that's pretty much what we see. And in some cases, the improvement in productivity is drastic. So we're very optimistic that if we keep our nose the grindstone and build great digital workers, we'll have a great outcome. So, that's what people are focused on.\nDan Perlin: Excellent. Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hey Bill, Rahul, Patrick. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to ask about the GIDS business. Maybe just talk about just the nature of the investments and what you're doing there. That would be helpful. And then the 3.6% growth, the positive flip much better than we were anticipating. Could you just sort of disaggregate that and maybe talk about the drivers there, whether it's existing client growth, new client launches, things like that. Just curious to understand the drivers a little bit more there.\nBill Stone: Well, we named as a global investor and distribution systems and it's the largest investment managers in the world use that service, then -- we always felt that if you could deliver a better interface to better client interaction with the system and really had good process and procedures that there was opportunity all over the place because we didn't think our competitors would do the same thing. And while it might have taken us a little longer than we had hoped, we do think that we have built some purpose-built software that is easier to use and is getting much more client satisfaction. And then we've had any number of large-scale wins and large-scale renewals that has really helped the revenue side. I don't know if, Rahul, do you have anything else to add to that?\nRahul Kanwar: Just on the investments. The investments have been kind of in really all aspects of that business. So, we have invested heavily in the technology to the point Bill just made, digital interface, web interface, mobile apps, just workflow and systems. We have also brought in a lot of sales talent, a lot of management talent. And I think that the key to all of this is that the large clients that we have won over the last six, nine months, we've kind of worked through that implementation process and they're coming live, and that's helping our numbers.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. Thank you for that. And then a question on the just -- I think, Patrick, you mentioned just wage inflation. I just wanted to drill down on that a little bit. Is that more of a flow-through effect from actions you took last year? Or are you seeing something more recently that's exacerbating wage issue. Just want to be clear in terms of what you're seeing about the cost of labor environment?\nPatrick Pedonti: Yes, it is mostly actions we took post April 2022 that are impacting us in Q1 when you compare it to prior years. But we're seeing in the current year, wage inflation slow down a little bit.\nAndrew Schmidt: Perfect. Thanks so much guys. Appreciate the help.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes, hey. Thanks everyone. Just -- maybe just as a follow-up for the question. It's just was just asked, but margins in the quarter certainly missed, I think Street expectations and our own. So, maybe we're just modeling it right. But I know you just talked about the wage inflation, but was there something else that you hadn't expected in the quarter that surprised you? Or again, is it just the Street not thinking about it correctly, since you said the wage inflation should trade off in April? And then related to that, as we think about the remainder of the year, I guess, what gives you confidence that you can get that margin expansion that you had talked about on prior calls. Is it just the Blue Prism I think that is really going to help the margins here? Or is there something else that you're working on to make sure margins are meeting your targets?\nBill Stone: Well, I think what the expense process was primarily, as Patrick said, the wage was from actions we took at the end of -- throughout 2022, really. And so I don't know that we were surprised as much as it all kind of came into the first quarter. And again, it's -- we're pretty confident on our ability to drive margins. And yes, I think 37.3% on adjusted EBITDA bars down maybe 100, 200 basis points. But I don't think that's -- we're very confident in our margin driving capabilities. And what we want to make sure we do is invest in the people and the processes and the capabilities to go get to $65 million to $130 million in savings through Blue Prism and then also constantly invest back in our products and services. As Rahul said, we're really bringing out new things, whether it's BrightLine or GoCentral or SS&C Everywhere or all those kinds of things that we think differentiate us. And it's the reason that we win most of the platform business that is out to bid.\nAlex Kramm: All right. Fair enough. And then maybe a little bit bigger picture. There's been in the last quarter, last six months, whatever you want to use, much more talk about AI, ChatGPT, et cetera. Just wondering how you view those capabilities in your own business. I think some people are arguing like, you can -- you may be able to do a lot with that and maybe Blue Prism isn't that same kind of fear. But at the same time, I think there's others who say like, hey, this could actually be super disruptive to your business. So, I know it's a big picture question for a call like this, but just wondering how much time you're spending on that and what you're evaluating?\nBill Stone: Well, Alex, I don't think that Fintech in general, has a very big moat. Almost anybody that's on this call can start a Fintech company. You need to be able to have an idea. You need to be able to have some development talent to be able to deliver a product. Now, doing that and turning it into a $5.5 billion company with 100 offices in 40 countries and a suite of products and services that are pretty much world-class, that's a pretty big moat, so that when companies such as UBS or any of the other great big investment banks or any of the great big hedge fund platforms or private equity platforms or private hedge platforms or real estate organizations, this is pretty sophisticated, pretty regulated, pretty minutia, pretty detailed. And I think that we've worked very hard to have the best people. We have the best training. We think we have the best solutions for our customers. And I think that we move quickly to buy Blue Prism. We believe that this intelligent automation and its corollaries and AI and machine learning and natural language processing and the rest of it is what's going to happen and either you get in front of it or you're so far behind that pretty much you're on the block.\nAlex Kramm: Fair enough. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nPeter Heckmann: Thank you. I have a quick one on DomaniRx. Could you give us an update on the platform development there and whether or not you continue to think that -- you have a good shot at moving your one large processing customer to the new platform in 2023?\nBill Stone: Well, I think our target, set is $124 million -- and I think that we're in reasonable shape. I know that we have had some Domani Board meetings. I know Rahul has been too, and we do pretty much constant updates on that platform. And I would say we are cautiously optimistic. Rahul, do you want to comment further?\nRahul Kanwar: Bill, I think you got it. We're kind of on target with our development plans so far, and we're keeping a close on.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay, that's helpful. And then this is a follow-up. I mean, how are you thinking about on the private equity, real estate, private asset side? How are you thinking about mark-to-markets there? Maybe just remind us how much of that part of the business relies on fixed minimums versus basis points?\nBill Stone: It's primarily basis points. There's some things that we do that are piece meal, whether that's K-1s and tax return type things and financial statements and -- but it's primarily a basis point charge.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. And so just in terms of how that's worked historically, I guess, is -- would you expect there to be a six-month, 12-month lag in terms of when asset values change and when they start to update those values? Or do they do it really more quarterly?\nBill Stone: Yes, I'd say quarterly.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. So we should be seeing it in the numbers already?\nBill Stone: Yes, I think so.\nPeter Heckmann: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist. Your line is open.\nJoe Meares: Hey guys, this is Joe Meares on for Terry. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one that I had is just I wanted to confirm that I heard correctly that organic growth in the quarter for revenue is 1.9%. And then just curious what financial services organic growth was in the first quarter. I think it was 1.3% last quarter. So, just curious if there is any inflection there?\nPatrick Pedonti: You're right that the total organic growth was 1.9%. And when you're referring to financial services, I assume you're referring to ex-health care, right? And that was 2.5% in the quarter.\nJoe Meares: Okay, perfect. And then just as a follow-up there. I think last quarter, you had mentioned that your expectation for the health care market was for it to be down 10% in 2022. Just curious if there's any change in expectations there?\nPatrick Pedonti: No, that's approximately what we expect.\nBill Stone: Yes, 2023.\nPatrick Pedonti: 2023, right.\nJoe Meares: Perfect. Thanks so much guys, Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. I want to touch quickly on M&A. In your prepared remarks you made reference to acquisition in Europe, SimCorp today. Just wondering how you're thinking about valuations, what you're seeing in valuations, particularly it sounds like you're trying to get some things done between now and the end of the year and just basically -- you obviously built a lot of value over the years via acquisitions, just how you're thinking about that as an opportunity right now?\nBill Stone: Yes, James. I would say it's pretty similar. I mean everyone talks about that prices are maybe pausing and then it looks like at least the headline numbers on SimCorp is about 30 times EBITDA. So, it's not pausing very quickly, I would say. So, all I think that there are assets that are going to be sold, I think the owners of those assets are going to have to, in general, take some haircuts and I don't know that they're ready to do that yet. I think SimCorp has kind of been on the market for a while. And I think maybe the Borse has some other assets that they want to put together. And so I think that maybe was serendipitous for them. And I don't know exactly where are we with FIS, where are we with a few of the other assets that are out there. But some stuff ought to shake loose. And I think the more that people care about their customers, the better opportunity we have.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Got it. And then going back to looking at the second half ramp, it sounds like between some of the new contracts and pricing and some of the other things that you actually have pretty good line of sight into that acceleration. And it doesn't sound like you're really dependent too much on macro at least improving. Just want to make sure that, that's -- I'm understanding that correctly and where there could be sensitivity if macro were to deteriorate a little between now and then?\nBill Stone: Yes, I think that's a pretty accurate characterization of where we are. I think the macro would have to deteriorate to the point where as someone said earlier, has it made it to where people are not going to allocate capital to new systems or new processes. But as large-scale financial institutions get under pressure, often their way to control costs is to outsource. And that's really a pretty big strength of ours. And we have any number of large-scale conversations going on with very large mutation. So, we'll have our opportunities. It's like always, you got to execute.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Thanks a lot for those comment Bill.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: That was quick. Hello again. I just wanted to squeeze in a couple of follow-ups. One, and maybe you mentioned this, but I think you said pricing has been solid. Can you be a little bit more specific what kind of pricing you've been realizing? And maybe you could actually say what businesses you're maybe realizing more or less than maybe what the company average is?\nBill Stone: I just think, Alex, that we're looking at between $100 million and $150 million in price increases realized in 2023 and probably the biggest ones are in alternative stand up and the goods business.\nAlex Kramm: Okay, fantastic. Thanks for that. And just a very quick one here. Just from an understanding perspective, you gave those numbers that you have done 40 process automations now, and you also talked about the 1,300 to 2,700 people. Can you just give us a little bit of a flavor like when you talk about these 40 processes, like how many people were you actually able to, I guess, reallocate or eliminate positions? And when -- and going forward, like again, like the 130 to 2,700, like how many processes is that I just trying to get a flavor for how many things you're automating and how many like per used case, how many people that it actually would affect?\nBill Stone: Yes, I mean it's a pretty broad rate, right? So, if we can build the digital worker to do pretty sophisticated reconciliations then we'll have all kinds of opportunities to deploy hundreds probably whereas in some of the other things, even things that are pretty broad scale, there's maybe not as many things done like validating 1065s and K1 tax returns or validating investment statements because one digital worker can do so much work, I don't really need to deploy that many. So, it's more of one-to-many and many-to-many. And then it's not very often that you have to deploy many-to-one, but it is something that the capabilities of the individual digital worker, the sophistication of the process is what determines how many and how fast.\nAlex Kramm: Okay, fair enough. Maybe I'll follow up there. And just very quickly, just to squeeze one in. On Blue Prism since we're on the topic, the 10.9% growth, that's been decelerating over the last few quarters. So, I think originally, when you bought the company, it was, I think, 15-plus maybe even in the 20s. So is that a sales cycle thing? Or what's going on, on the external side with Blue Prism?\nBill Stone: No, we're optimistic that, that accelerates from the rest of the year, too.\nAlex Kramm: Good enough answer. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Bill Stone for closing remarks.\nBill Stone: Again, we really appreciate all of you coming on our call and we look forward to talking to you after the second quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Stone",
            "content": "Thanks Justine and thanks everyone for joining. We started 2023 with pretty strong revenues growing $1.363 billion and adjusted revenue up 5.2%, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share, while a little soft to $1.11 was within our range and was down 11.2% from last year. Rising interest rates obviously impacted our earnings, but we're in very good shape from a financial standpoint. We had a lot of inflation, too, especially in wages, and that also put some pressure on our bottom-line. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was over $500 million again at $509 million, and our EBITDA margin was 37.3%. First quarter with all the payroll taxes and health care expenses is normally the highest expense quarter we have. But we do expect to begin to see a lot of cost savings from our Blue Prism digital worker deployment. We believe the digital workers will drive margins and serve as a hedge against inflation. We currently have over 40 processes live and are on track to achieve our 2023 productivity goal. Our first quarter adjusted organic revenue was up 1.9. We saw good performance in alternatives in our global investor and distribution services business, retirement and our Institutional and Investment Manager segment. We generated net cash from operating activities of $254.8 million for the three months ended March 31, up 38.9% over the same period last year. We paid down $44.6 million in debt in Q1, bringing our consolidated net leverage ratio to 3.38 and our new -- our net secured leverage ratio 2.39 times of consolidated EBITDA. In Q1, SS&C bought back 2.3 million shares for $134.7 million at an average price of $59.9 and program to date treasury stock buybacks of $439.9 million for purchases of 7.8 million shares at average price of $56.34. We'll continue to target 50% of our cash flow to stock buybacks and 50% to pay down. We still look at lots of M&A while it remains disciplined, and we have yet to see any movement on large-scale assets, although we did see the German force, putting in a bid for SimCorp today. We do think we'll have opportunity for some tuck-in acquisitions before the end of the year. This April marks the fifth anniversary of the DST acquisition, which brought SS&C over $2 billion in revenue and a long list of large sophisticated clients. While we have doubled the profitability, accelerating their revenue growth, took investments in the product, the service and the leadership teams. We feel these investments are paying off, and our biggest prospects are currently in our GIDS and retirement businesses. We have all watched volatility in the financial services sector, particularly US banking over the past few months. SS&C is a strongly diversified company. We have seen limited impact to-date. As always, we will support our customers monitor the situation closely and react as necessary. I'll now turn it over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail. Thanks Patrick. We expect revenue accelerated in Q3, Q4, and we expect the growth to be broad-based across a lot of our different businesses and we will be able to convert a bunch of backlog revenue. We have price increases that have already gone into effect until the revenue will begin to tick up, and we also have a very full pipeline. We have invested heavily in our product and service suite, and we remain excited about our opportunities. It's been a difficult way to get to here, but I think we're in really good shape going forward. And I'll now open it up for questions. Kevin, I think that's primarily what it is. I mean we have a number of large-scale deals that we have sold over the last two or three years. And it seemed like they're never going to come to fruition, but they are coming to fruition, and they're going live. And with that, it releases a lot of revenue into our financial statements. And as I said, we still have full pipelines with goods, which is our -- primarily our transfer agency business growing 3.6% in the first quarter, that's quite a turnaround. And so I think we're making progress across all of those things, and I think that that's -- plus the price increases are also starting to take effect. So, I think we're in reasonably good shape for the second half of 2023. Rahul, do you want to take that? And I would say I'd say also that we believe we remain the strongest competitor by somewhat. And I think that there is a lot of volatility in that market, and a lot of the larger scale investment managers prefer to have our steady hand. And I think that's played out pretty well for us. Yes. And as you noted, right, a lot of what we're expecting in the second half, we have already signed and are in the midst of bringing them live. So it's -- it is really a continuation of the last 12, 18, 24 months. And -- but there's a lot of skittishness in the financial markets, particularly the banking markets. And while we don't have a huge client base and mid-level banks, we do have something. So, we're monitoring that as closely as we can. You do kind of see that whether it's Silicon Valley or First Republic or Signature that you're really kind of on the mid spot between traditional banking and financing venture capital and other investments. So I'm not sure that the contagion is quite -- I don't think it's anything like 2008, 2009. And I think that's why it hasn't had much impact on us to-date. Of course, we'll watch it as closely as we can. No, I mean it's nail in the head, Dan, $65 million. We're estimating about 1,000 in savings as we deploy digital workers per worker. And knock on wood that's pretty much what we see. And in some cases, the improvement in productivity is drastic. So we're very optimistic that if we keep our nose the grindstone and build great digital workers, we'll have a great outcome. So, that's what people are focused on. Well, we named as a global investor and distribution systems and it's the largest investment managers in the world use that service, then -- we always felt that if you could deliver a better interface to better client interaction with the system and really had good process and procedures that there was opportunity all over the place because we didn't think our competitors would do the same thing. And while it might have taken us a little longer than we had hoped, we do think that we have built some purpose-built software that is easier to use and is getting much more client satisfaction. And then we've had any number of large-scale wins and large-scale renewals that has really helped the revenue side. I don't know if, Rahul, do you have anything else to add to that? Well, I think what the expense process was primarily, as Patrick said, the wage was from actions we took at the end of -- throughout 2022, really. And so I don't know that we were surprised as much as it all kind of came into the first quarter. And again, it's -- we're pretty confident on our ability to drive margins. And yes, I think 37.3% on adjusted EBITDA bars down maybe 100, 200 basis points. But I don't think that's -- we're very confident in our margin driving capabilities. And what we want to make sure we do is invest in the people and the processes and the capabilities to go get to $65 million to $130 million in savings through Blue Prism and then also constantly invest back in our products and services. As Rahul said, we're really bringing out new things, whether it's BrightLine or GoCentral or SS&C Everywhere or all those kinds of things that we think differentiate us. And it's the reason that we win most of the platform business that is out to bid. Well, Alex, I don't think that Fintech in general, has a very big moat. Almost anybody that's on this call can start a Fintech company. You need to be able to have an idea. You need to be able to have some development talent to be able to deliver a product. Now, doing that and turning it into a $5.5 billion company with 100 offices in 40 countries and a suite of products and services that are pretty much world-class, that's a pretty big moat, so that when companies such as UBS or any of the other great big investment banks or any of the great big hedge fund platforms or private equity platforms or private hedge platforms or real estate organizations, this is pretty sophisticated, pretty regulated, pretty minutia, pretty detailed. And I think that we've worked very hard to have the best people. We have the best training. We think we have the best solutions for our customers. And I think that we move quickly to buy Blue Prism. We believe that this intelligent automation and its corollaries and AI and machine learning and natural language processing and the rest of it is what's going to happen and either you get in front of it or you're so far behind that pretty much you're on the block. Well, I think our target, set is $124 million -- and I think that we're in reasonable shape. I know that we have had some Domani Board meetings.

There's some things that we do that are piece meal, whether that's K-1s and tax return type things and financial statements and -- but it's primarily a basis point charge. Yes, I'd say quarterly. Yes, I think so. Yes, 2023. Yes, James. I would say it's pretty similar. I mean everyone talks about that prices are maybe pausing and then it looks like at least the headline numbers on SimCorp is about 30 times EBITDA. So, it's not pausing very quickly, I would say.

Yes, I mean it's a pretty broad rate, right? So, if we can build the digital worker to do pretty sophisticated reconciliations then we'll have all kinds of opportunities to deploy hundreds probably whereas in some of the other things, even things that are pretty broad scale, there's maybe not as many things done like validating 1065s and K1 tax returns or validating investment statements because one digital worker can do so much work, I don't really need to deploy that many.

            "content": "Thanks. Results for the first quarter were GAAP revenues of $1.327 million; GAAP net income of $126 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.49. Adjusted revenues were $1.634 billion. Adjusted revenues were up 5.2%. Adjusted operating income decreased 1.1% and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.11, 11.2% decrease over Q1 2022 due to the impact of higher interest rates on our debt. Adjusted revenue increased $67.2 million or 5.2%. Our acquisitions contributed $64 million. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $19.9 million or 1.5%. Adjusted organic revenue increase on a constant currency basis was 1.9%. We had strength in several product lines, including alternatives against transfer agency services business and institutional investment management business. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $493 million, a decrease of $5.7 million or 1.1% from the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating margins were 36.2% in the first quarter compared to 38.5% in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding acquisitions, expenses increased 5% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added $52 million in expenses and foreign currency decreased cost by $19.6 million. Our cost structure has been impacted by general inflation, wage inflation and increase in business travel compared to 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $509 million or 37.3% of adjusted revenue, a decrease of $5.9 million from Q2 2022. Net interest expense for the quarter was $111.9 million, an increase of $62.6 million or 127% from Q1 2022. In Q1 2023, net interest expense includes $3.5 million of noncash amortized financing costs and OID. The average interest rate in the quarter for the amended credit facility, including our senior notes, was 6.21% compared to 3.11% in the first quarter of 2022. We recorded a GAAP tax provision of $52.5 million or 29% of pre-tax income. Adjusted net income was $284.4 million and adjusted EPS was $1.11, and the effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Diluted shares increased to 257 million from 256.4 million in Q4. The higher average stock price partially -- was partially offset by share repurchases during the quarter. On cash flow and balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $433.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $7.1 billion of gross debt. SS&C's net debt, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $130.2 million that are held at DomaniRx, was $6.8 billion as of March 31st. Operating cash flow for the three months was $254.8 million, $1.3 million increase from the same period in 2022. Some highlights on cash flow for the three months. We bought back treasury stock for $134.7 million and repurchased 2.3 million shares at an average price of $59.19. In July 2022, the Board authorized the new stock repurchase program of up to $1 billion in stock buybacks. Program to date, treasury stock buybacks are $439.9 million for purchases of 7.8 million shares at an average price of $56.34. Net debt payments in the quarter were $44.6 million. And we paid total of interest of $138 million in the quarter compared to $74.2 million in 2022. On income taxes, in the quarter, we paid $20.9 million compared to $42 million in the first quarter of 2022. Our accounts receivable DSO was 53.5 days as of March 31st compared to 52.3 days as of March -- as of December 2022 and 52.7 days as of March 2022. Capital expenditures and capitalized software was $53.1 million or 3.9% of adjusted revenue for the quarter. Spending was predominantly for capitalized software to investment in research and development and IT infrastructure. Based on our net debt of approximately $6.8 billion, our total leverage was 3.38 times and our secured leverage was 2.39 times as of March 31st. On outlook for the year, first, I'll cover a few assumptions. We'll continue to focus on client service, and we expect retention rates to continue in the range of most recent results. We have assumed foreign currency exchange will be at current levels for the remainder of the year. And as a result, organic growth for the year will be in the range of 2% to 6%, and adjusted organic growth for Q2 will be in the range of 0.5% to 3.5%. We have assumed interest rates will increase in additional in the range of 35 to 50 bps through the remainder of the year compared to the average rate in the first quarter. We'll continue to manage our expenses during the period by controlling variable expenses and increased productivity to improve our operating margins. We'll continue to allocate free cash flow to both debt pay down and stock buybacks, and we continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be about 26%. So, for the second quarter of 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.3345 billion to $1.3745 billion. Adjusted net income in the range of $276.5 million to $293 million, and diluted shares in the range of $256.5 million to $257.5 million. And for the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $5.455 billion to $5.655 billion. Adjusted net income in the range of $1.190 billion to $1.285 billion and diluted shares in the range of 255 million to 258.5 million. And on cash from operating activities, we expect that to be in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.375 billion. And I'll turn it back over to Bill for final comments. Yes, it is mostly actions we took post April 2022 that are impacting us in Q1 when you compare it to prior years. But we're seeing in the current year, wage inflation slow down a little bit. You're right that the total organic growth was 1.9%. And when you're referring to financial services, I assume you're referring to ex-health care, right? And that was 2.5% in the quarter. No, that's approximately what we expect. 2023, right."

Our alternatives fund administration business posted 6.6% growth in Q1 and now has assets under administration of $2.24 trillion. GIDS, which serves the world's largest asset managers grew 3.6% this quarter. We've invested heavily in the leadership technology and service organization of this business over the last five years and continue to do so. We won large customers over the past few years and entered into long-term contract renewals with others. These marquee names, including St. James Place, Capital Group, Brooks McDonald, JPMorgan, Van land, and most recently, Mind Super provide a solid foundation from which to continue to grow. We have prioritized innovation and are working on dozens of new products and services across the company, whether it be SS&C BrightLine for tax, SS&C Everywhere for data connectivity and Insights, or SS&C Private Cloud for a purpose-built compute solution, these products solve important issues for our customers give our employees creative ways in which to add value and strengthen our business. I'll mention some of the key deals for Q1. A large UK wealth client embarked on a strategic project to move their international accounts to SS&C's Bluedoor platform, an alternative asset manager chose SOMS and fixed link services after a comprehensive RFP process, a $30 billion in AUM, private equity and real estate firm chose us and fund services, a current brokerage client chose SS&C's All Serve solution to help scale and expand the clients offering in the alternatives market, an $80 billion real estate manager with a non-traded REIT shows the suite of SS&C's fund services and retail all transfer agency services. We'll now turn it over to Patrick to run through the financials. Sure. We had pretty good inflows into both our hedge fund and our private equity businesses during the course of the quarter. So it's a combination of new fund launches, some organic and performance-related growth in these clients as well as new client wins. So, as you know, it's kind of the first time we've seen net uptick in a few quarters and -- but we're pretty happy about it. But we do expect to see based on the comments Bill just made about the strength of our pipeline, we're certainly seeing some momentum in the market. Just on the investments. The investments have been kind of in really all aspects of that business. So, we have invested heavily in the technology to the point Bill just made, digital interface, web interface, mobile apps, just workflow and systems. We have also brought in a lot of sales talent, a lot of management talent. And I think that the key to all of this is that the large clients that we have won over the last six, nine months, we've kind of worked through that implementation process and they're coming live, and that's helping our numbers. Bill, I think you got it. We're kind of on target with our development plans so far, and we're keeping a close on."

Please go ahead.\nJustine Stone: Hi, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for our Q3 2024 earnings call. I’m Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C Technologies. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Schell, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, we need to review the Safe Harbor statement.

During today’s call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in today’s earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stone: Thanks Justine, and welcome everyone. Our third quarter results are record adjusted revenue of $1,466.8 million, up 7.3%. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.29, up 10.3%. We also reported record adjusted consolidated EBITDA of 566.2 million with 38.6% EBITDA margins. Our third quarter adjusted organic revenue growth was 6.4%. This growth was driven by strength in our Alternatives, GIDS, WIT and Intralinks businesses. The surprise upside came largely in our GIDS and WIT businesses, accelerated license revenue in the Wealth and Investment Technologies business and non-recurring professional services fees in the global investor and distribution solutions business. Global Investor Distribution services business drove the outperformance. Our recurring revenue growth rate for financial services was 7.2%, which includes all software-enabled services and maintenance revenue. Third quarter cash from operating activities was $336.6 million, up 39% from Q3 2023. Our cash flow conversion percentage from the quarter was 103%. We bought back 1.2 million shares for $89.4 million at an average price of $72.72 per share. [Indiscernible] high quality acquisitions, we continue to believe share repurchases are the best capital use. In September, we closed the $670 million Battea-Class Action Services acquisition. Battea meets our financial criteria, about $95 million in annual revenue, growing high single digits and 45% plus EBITDA margin. This acquisition will immediately accretive to earnings. Battea’s offering is synergistic with our fund administration business and we’re already making progress cross-selling. I’ll now turn this call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail.\nRahul Kanwar: Thanks, Bill. We had another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 6.4%. The wealth and investment technology business unit grew 10.9% for the quarter. The reorganization from earlier in 2024 has brought development teams together and we’re currently integrating the capabilities of our Aloha solution into the new Genesis platform. This will accelerate our ability to deliver the deepest set of cloud native front-to-back technology to the investment management market. The Black Diamond Wealth Platform has reached a major milestone with the rollout of advanced grouping functionality. This initiative enables Black Diamond advisors to further personalize their client reporting and compete effectively in the alternative asset reporting space for RIAs and family offices. Our Global Investor and Distribution Solutions business had another strong quarter and in addition to new business wins, we have brought in additional revenue through special projects at our largest clients. Healthcare industry is facing higher than expected utilization and rising costs for Medicare – and Medicare advantage. SSNC is poised to support our healthcare clients and prospects through these headwinds. With the integration of our DomaniRx platform, automation opportunities and liftouts, we can reduce the operating costs for health insurers over time. Q4 is off to a strong start for SSNC health. We signed two large license deals for about $8 million in revenue at the beginning of October that will push from Q3. Our internal automation efforts are progressing as well. Since acquiring Blue Prism in 2022, our total revenue has grown about $600 million and our headcount is down. For 2024 year-to-date we estimate a benefit of approximately 1,050 full time equivalents thus far in the year because of rolling out Blue Prism digital workers as well as automating and optimizing existing processes. We’ll now turn it over to Brian to run through the financials.\nBrian Schell: Thanks, Rahul, and good day everyone. As noted in our press release, our Q3 2024 GAAP results reflect revenues of $1.466 billion, net income of $164 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.65. Our adjusted non-GAAP results include revenues of $1.467 billion, an increase of 7.3% over Q3 2023, and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.29, a 10.3% increase over Q3 2023. The adjusted revenue increase of $100 million over Q3 2023 was primarily driven by incremental revenue contributions from the WIT alternatives, GIDS and Intralink businesses. Acquisitions contributed $8 million with about $4 million attributable to Battea, and foreign exchange had a favorable impact of approximately $5 million. As a result, adjusted organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis was 6.4%. Our core expenses increased 6.8% or $58 million excluding acquisitions and on a constant currency basis. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $566 million or 38.6% of adjusted revenue, an increase of $32 million or 6% from Q3 2023. Net interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $110 million, a decrease of $11 million from Q3 2023. Adjusted net income was $327 million, up 10%, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.29, an increase of 10.3%. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. An increase in the average share price drove the diluted share count up to 254.1 million from 252.3 million at Q2 ‘24. SSNC ended the third quarter with $694.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $7.2 billion in gross debt. The higher-than-normal cash balance reflects opportunistic borrowing that will be deployed during the fourth quarter. SSNC’s net debt, as defined in our credit agreement, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $159 million held at DomaniRx was $6.7 billion. Our last 12-month consolidated EBITDA used for covenant compliance was $2,279 billion. Based on net debt of approximately $6.7 billion, our total leverage ratio was 2.9 times. As we look forward to the fourth quarter and the remainder of the year with respect to guidance, note that we will continue to focus on client service and assume that retention rates will remain in the range of our most recent results. We will continue to manage our expenses with a cost disciplined approach by controlling and aligning variable expenses to ensure efficiency, increasing productivity to improve our operating margins and leverage our scale and create capacity and effectively investing in the business through marketing and sales and R&D to take advantage of future growth opportunities. Specifically, we have assumed foreign currency exchange and interest rates to remain at current levels. A tax rate of approximately 26% on an adjusted basis, which is unchanged from prior guidance, capital expenditures to be 4.1% to 4.5% of revenues, which is also unchanged from prior guidance, and a stronger weighting to share repurchases versus debt reduction, subject to changes in market conditions or financing needs. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.46 billion to $1.5 billion and 2.4% organic revenue growth at the midpoint; adjusted net income in the range of $329 million to $345 million; interest expense, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, in the range of $110 million to $112 million; diluted shares in the range of 254.6 million to 255.6 million; and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.29 to $1.35. For the full year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5.815 billion to $5.855 billion and 4.9% organic revenue growth at the midpoint; adjusted net income in the range of $1.299 billion to $1.315 billion; diluted shares in the range of 253.6 million to 253.8 million; adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $5.12 to $5.18; and cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.33 billion to $1.37 billion. And now back to Bill.\nBill Stone: Thanks, Brian. We feel our business is strengthening and we were able to expand our horizons. The Battea purchase is already showing very positive signs. Our Deliver client conference was a great success and I would like to thank David Rubenstein for being our keynote speaker. I will now open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJeff Schmitt: Thank you. Could you discuss the market opportunity for DomaniRx? Just because I think the top three players in that space handle maybe 70% or 80% of prescription claims, I think. And you’ve just mentioned before, you don’t plan on kind of focusing on that group that much. So how big is sort of the remaining market opportunity from a revenue perspective? And then how are kind of those early conversations going?\nBill Stone: Yes. We would say you’re right, it’s probably about 70%, 80% is what the UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, CVS, and Cigna, and Express Script process. I think there’s something like five billion to six billion scripts a year in the United States. So, if you take 20% of six billion, you got 1.2 billion and if you take 30%, you get 1.8 billion. Right? So, that’s a lot of scripts. So, we think we have a lot of run room. We also think that we can license our technology maybe to one of those three or maybe more. And we also have a large number of others that are like us or like the big three but a lot smaller, so they might do 200 million, 300 million scripts rather than the 1.5 billion scripts. So we think there’s plenty of run room. We think there’s a lot of things in healthcare that need help with. And so pharmacy claims is one, but there are other things like medical claims and other things that we think we’re well-positioned to be able to help the healthcare industry.\nJeff Schmitt: Okay. Great. And then just on the Trust Suite business, I think you’ve mentioned it last quarter but it’s the InnoTrust combination. Could you discuss kind of the size of that business and the type of growth you’re seeing there? How does that stack up versus competitors like an SEI’s [ph] product?\nBill Stone: Yes. I think the Trust Suite product really does take, the InnoTrust product and Black Diamond and really creates a very pleasant user interface and a lot of capability with technology that is pretty state-of-the-art. Most of the trust systems out in the marketplace today are multi-decade old, and we think that we have a lot of run room and we’ve been pretty pleased with the acceptance rate of Trust Suite.\nJeff Schmitt: Any sense just on the size of that business today from a revenue perspective or in the growth or...?\nBill Stone: Well, it’s still a little nascent, but we would expect it to do probably in 2024 upwards to $10 million in revenue. And then in 2025, we would expect to see perhaps a multiple of that.\nJeff Schmitt: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Bill, can you provide maybe any color on the outlook for 4Q in terms of the slowdown in the organic growth rate that’s implied? And then is there some – maybe some licensing noise or licensing deals and things like that or how should we think about 4Q number?\nBill Stone: Yes. I think the major thing with Q4 in 2024 compared to 2023 is Q4 of 2023 was substantially better than any of the other quarters in 2023. So we’re kind of getting a little bit of a comp challenge to us. And we have a big pipeline. We have a lot of stuff going on. We’re always cautious. We’ve had three or four pretty good quarters in a row and we expect Q4 to be a pretty good quarter, too.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then in terms of the follow-up, just obviously, a lot of news in the healthcare space with potentially Cigna and Humana back in merger talks, some weak results out of Elevance and some other things. What’s the potential impact or is there any read-through there? Are things something that we should be aware of related to DomaniRx?\nBill Stone: No. I think, as Rahul spoke earlier, we got a pretty big uplift in revenue for healthcare in October, stuff that had pushed from September. I still think we have a great opportunity here. DomaniRx is really new technology, that there’s nothing like it out in the marketplace that can handle scale. A lot of people that used our RxNova system considered it the gold standard for Medicare and Medicare Advantage already, and DomaniRx is far exceeding RxNova’s capabilities.\nSurinder Thind: So Bill, I guess, just to clarify, is the commentary there that there shouldn’t be any strategic impact on the relationship there that you have? Or I guess, that’s what I was trying to get at rather than the actual near-term business.\nBill Stone: You mean Humana and Cigna?\nSurinder Thind: That is correct, yes.\nBill Stone:\n.: So we think there’s plenty of opportunity for us. Whatever happens with Humana, Cigna, we think it will be positive towards us. And lots of stuff is happening in healthcare as Rahul had alluded to before, and we just have to play it out. But everybody is concerned about their health. People are not going to stop spending money on their health, and we think it’s a very good spot for us to be in.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you, Bill. That’s helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hey, Bill. Hey, Rahul. Hey, Brian. Thanks for taking my questions this evening. I wanted to just maybe ask a question on 2025. I know it’s a little bit early but you do have the 4% to 8% medium-term organic growth outlook out there. Wondering if 2025, if you think about it within the context of that, if it’s shaping up similar to the medium-term? And then if you could just talk about maybe the pipeline or the sales cycles accordingly. Because I know, obviously, there’s a lot of work that’s done in advance to hit those targets. So if you could comment on just your visibility there in terms of what you’re seeing in the pipe, that would be great. Thanks a lot.\nBill Stone: Yes. I think that we have – I think our salesforce is the strongest it’s been, so we have a lot of people out there banging on doors and we have a lot of capable people. We have tremendous number of opportunities all over the world. You got to win, right? And then you got to get them live so the revenue streams in. But I would say that we’re pretty bullish on 2025. And we have the resources, we have the cash. We have access to markets. We’re really excited about the cross-sell opportunities with Battea. I think that we have an opportunity to surprise you positively.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. That’s great to hear, Bill. Very constructive. And then if I could just ask about R&D. I think one of the highlights at the Analyst Day was just the breadth of the product pipeline. It’s bigger than I’ve seen in some time. Has there been a shift towards more spend on organic R&D? Obviously, with the step-down in M&A and more focus on organic growth, it would make sense. But I’m just curious about just the philosophy in terms of new product R&D spend. Thank you very much.\nBill Stone: Yes. Why don’t I – I’ll give you a little answer and I’ll let Rahul kind of get in a little deeper. But if you notice on our percentage of CapEx, we’re at 4.1% to 4.5%. Historically, we’ve been at 3%, 3.5%. So we have poured a lot more money into R&D, and our CTO, Anthony Caiafa, he’s gotten a little older. He’s 38 so he knows how to spend faster so we think that, that will probably continue. Rahul?\nRahul Kanwar: The thing I would add to that is as we have organized our business increasingly effectively, right, and had more and more products and services pointed at specific segments of the market or specific types of customers, what we need to build has become increasingly clearer. So we get a lot of good feedback from our sales force. We get a lot of good feedback from the folks covering those accounts. And a lot of times, we can get anchor clients and folks that want to partner with us on funded development, which then results in revenue a lot faster. So it’s easier to back those kinds of things and that’s part of the positive dynamic that’s going on.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. Good evening. I just want to revisit the fourth quarter organic number again. Sorry, maybe to beat a dead horse here. But like the 2.4% versus the 6.4% you did this quarter and I went back and just was looking at your comps, so it’s definitely easier across some of them but by no means all of them. So that 400 basis point deceleration, is there any way you can just help kind of contextualize maybe the areas where we should be focused on that as we think about modeling across those segments? And then in that same kind of question, Bill, I thought I heard you say there was maybe some bigger license fees that you pulled into this quarter around Wealth and Investment. And did that influence maybe this kind of fourth quarter, I guess, guidance around the organic number as well? Thanks.\nBill Stone: Yes. Again, I’ll give you a little, Dan, and I’ll have Rahul maybe a little bit more or Brian in. We did have a really good Q3 for wealth and investment technology and the global investor and distribution services business. So we’re not quite ready to see if they can repeat that in Q4, although we’re optimistic they’ll have good quarters. So I think that’s a little bit. And then as I said before, I think the comp is a little more difficult in Q4 than it was in Q3.\nRahul Kanwar: Yes. And Bill, I would just add on that last point on comp, if you look at the 2023 by quarter, first three quarters, we did about $1.360 billion in each quarter, right, approximately. And in Q4, we did $1.411 billion. So Q4 was $45 million to $50 million higher than the other three quarters and that’s really what you’re seeing. If you kind of look at our Q4 guidance in absolute numbers, we’re ahead of any other quarter this year. Our low point is $40 million ahead of our low point the prior quarter. So we feel good about where we are. Most of this is a comp issue.\nDan Perlin: Got it. Okay. No, that’s really helpful. That’s really helpful. Thank you. Just on Blue Prism for the moment in terms of cost opportunities, and I think you said you’re like, I don’t know, a little over 1,050 maybe kind of automated employees. Like where – how much further can we go with that? Are you expecting that to continue to be a meaningful contributor to the ability to have a more efficient cost structure as you go into next year? Or are we kind of top ticking that a little bit for the organization? Thank you.\nBill Stone: Yes, Dan, I think that’s a great question and I think we are pretty enthusiastic about where we can go with our Blue Prism digital workers. Brian could get into it more deeply. But we’ve done an awful lot of acquisitions so we have an awful lot of systems. We like to have fewer systems and more digital workers. And I know we have plans to do that throughout accounting and finance, and Nick Wright in the global investor and distribution services business has done a great job of deploying digital workers and Bhagesh Malde in our fund administration businesses as well as many others. And so we’re pretty optimistic, I think, on Blue Prism’s capabilities.\nDan Perlin: That’s great. Thank you very much.\nBrian Schell: I was just going to add to that, that just across, I’ll call it, more infrastructure to Bill’s point, right? So we don’t want to create the digital worker for 10 different systems and then be able to have to rebuild. So we’re leveraging that, the broader consolidated system. And so to echo Bill’s point, we are pretty enthusiastic about what we’re going to be able to leverage. And then the other point that we’ve made on prior phone calls is that I think the level of sophistication continues to increase over time as well about the impact that some of the digital workers can have as we mature as an organization and our learnings continue to increase about how to utilize the digital workers.\nBill Stone: But we also are integrating – we’re integrating AI into this, too, its large language models and other things are also enhancing Blue Prism’s capabilities.\nDan Perlin: All right. I want to say thank you for the last time, but I never really wanted to touch it off. That was my mistake so my apologies.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thank you. Brian, I think you may have mentioned that you were carrying a higher-than-expected cash balance that you expect to deploy in Q4. Would that be a kind of capital return, M&A? Just any thoughts around that?\nBrian Schell: Yes. I wouldn’t necessarily assume M&A on any material size for Q4 as far as I’m seeing around that purposes. But we are – like I said, we took an opportunistic point of view on the funding, given where rates were and what we were able to raise that at versus our current cost structure. So we’re looking to, again, effectively deploy that share repurchase in combination with the rest of our operating cash flow and further debt reduction, again, utilizing that lower cost of funds, we’ll have executed that in Q4.\nKevin McVeigh: Got it. And then just obviously, the organic growth was really strong, but it sounds like there were – was it $8 million in total health care licenses that were pushed? So is the way to think about it would have been that much stronger if that was in there and now that could shift it to Q4. Is that right?\nBrian Schell: That’s right.\nKevin McVeigh: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from DA Davidson. Please go ahead.\nPeter Heckmann: Hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. As regards Battea, I understand or at least I inferred from a comment you made at the Investor Day that, that revenue can be somewhat project-oriented. I guess how should we think about modeling that? Is there something to think about in terms of seasonality? Or is it just to kind of look to you guys in terms of one quarter out in terms of how you expect that business to contribute?\nBill Stone: Yes. I think, first of all, it’s interesting you call class action lawsuits projects. We would tend to call them lawsuits. And so you’ve got the vagaries of the court system. But I think additionally, there is some seasonality in Battea and Q4 tends to be the largest quarter of the four quarters. And there’s a bunch of court cases that have already been adjudicated. The courts have to release the payments on the class actions and that’s when we get paid. But we’re – we would say that we’re going to try to give you all as much insight into Battea as we can. They have 900 clients, we have 22,000. We think there’s an opportunity for a lot of extension in the Battea’s business.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. That’s fair, that’s fair. And then just in terms of thinking about the fund shareholder recordkeeping business and some of the acceleration, I guess I had speculated just looking at money market flows that the industry may have gotten a number of several million accounts just from flows back into money market accounts . Do you think that affected the GIDS’ organic revenue? And if so, is there a way to quantify it?\nRahul Kanwar: I think most of our strength in the GIDS organic revenue is really just coming from as we’re building technology, we’re attracting more and more customers and maybe customers that are in slightly different segments then. So we have many more wealth management firms, which some of our biggest clients are wealth management firms, but we’ve got a number of new prospects. And as we continue to build out our call center capabilities and BPO capabilities, more and more of these customers are willing to lift out internal functions and give them to us and that’s a part of it. So while the macro trends in the market may have had some impact, most of it is just us expanding our product suite.\nBill Stone: It also, too, I think, would be important for people to understand that an awful lot of the large-scale financial firms in the United States and more so even around the world have a very difficult time deploying large-scale new systems. So their choices are to try to build a great big system, maybe go to a body shop, Indian body shop like a Tata or an HCL or an Infosys or one of the other ones, that is fraught with challenges. And an increasingly attractive solution for them is to lift it out to us. We have world-class data centers. We have world-class developers. We have world-class processes. And I think as they see it, they get increasingly intrigued.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay, that’s helpful. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMike Infante: Hey, it’s Mike Infante on for James. Thanks for taking our questions. I just wanted to follow up on some of the comp commentary again. There’s obviously a wealth of variance factors as we think about 2025 organic growth. But given the comps will get progressively tougher, at least relative to the 4Q 2023 comp as we progress throughout the year, how should we be thinking about some of the drivers that can push you to the midpoint or beyond next year? Thanks.\nRahul Kanwar: In general, I think I would just come back to, we feel like our business is strengthening, right? So we do have – we haven’t been through the 2025 revenue planning and budgeting processes yet. But we do feel like you can kind of look at our recurring revenue, financial services as a sort of a leading indicator that the stable reoccurring and recurring revenue base is continually growing and that ought to help us in 2025.\nBill Stone: The other thing is, if you look at Q3 of 2024 compared to Q3 of 2023, we added $100 million in revenue. So people look at these fintech companies and talk about them. They did $200 million in revenue for a year. We added $100 million in Q3. And I think – we’re not saying that our business is strengthening because we think we’re going to slow down. We think we’re going to accelerate. Look, the deals are bigger, the size of the organizations are bigger, the size of the number of people that we would absorb are higher. So with all of that becomes some increased analysis, increased negotiation on contracts. And so we’re being cautiously optimistic, but we’re not backing away from the midterm 4% to 8%.\nMike Infante: That’s clear. Maybe just on Blue Prism. Obviously, a lot of internal expense savings in the form of lower headcount. But I’d be curious to hear just how you’re thinking about how the net new opportunity for Blue Prism has evolved from late and some of the initiatives that you have in place to return that business to double-digit growth next year? Thanks.\nBill Stone: Yes. We think that’s a great question. We are doing a lot internally here. We have some management changes we’ve done. We’re accelerating our amount of money that we are pouring into Blue Prism. We’ve moved some really top technologists that Anthony had brought in. So we’re excited about what we can do with Blue Prism and reaccelerating the growth. Again, we’re still getting Magic Quadrant when people analyze it. And I think the addition of AI and the large language models and then obviously, OpenAI is going to be all the more change in the world. But you got to be on top of it. And I think we’ve done a pretty good job of really maximizing the potential internally on Blue Prism and then we’re going to redouble our focus on the external opportunities.\nMike Infante: Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexei Gogolev from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nElla Smith: Hi, this is Ella Smith from Alexei’s team. Thanks so much for taking our question. So first, I was hoping you could speak to the strong growth in alternatives AUM. Can you remind us what’s driving that strong growth year-to-date and how do you think about the forward growth of alternatives?\nBill Stone: We think primarily the strong growth in alternatives based on brilliant management. Other people might think it’s – the market is pretty strong, right? And the hedge fund industry traditionally has pretty good risk-adjusted return levels. And I think as you look at our client base, almost all the large-scale platforms are SSNC clients. And over the last several years, they have gotten the lion’s share of all the new capital that have flowed into hedge funds, same with private equity funds and now private credit. So we think we’re well positioned to continue to be a beneficiary of our clients’ success. And so we have a lot of focus on making sure that we’re adding value, bringing out new technologies, new capabilities, new processes, and then being able to really help like our international clients as they move to T+1. In the U.S., we’re going to move to shorter than T+1, right? When you look at the Gen Xers, they’re used to Venmo. I don’t think moving money takes 24 hours, right? So I think those kinds of things are going to be shorten. Obviously, that takes a lot of the risk out of the system, but systems that process that have to be really locked and loaded in it. That’s something we’re pretty good at.\nElla Smith: That makes a lot of sense, Bill. Thank you. And for my follow-up, I’m sorry if I missed this, but I noticed the strong step-up in organic growth for Wealth and Investment Technologies. Could you please remind us what drove that? Was there a big deal or two signed there?\nBill Stone: Really big. No, we did have a strong Wealth and Investment Technologies, we’re up 10.9%, I believe. And we’ve got a couple of large license deals in Q3, and that really helped drive the organic revenue growth.\nElla Smith: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you all so much.\nOperator: As there are no further questions at the queue at this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Bill Stone for closing remarks.\nBill Stone: Again, thanks, all of you, for being on the call and thank the analysts for asking really pointed questions which we appreciate. I do think that we’re pretty optimistic about where our business sits and that we hope to talk to you again in 2025 and surprise you positively. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Rahul, and good day everyone. As noted in our press release, our Q3 2024 GAAP results reflect revenues of $1.466 billion, net income of $164 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.65. Our adjusted non-GAAP results include revenues of $1.467 billion, an increase of 7.3% over Q3 2023, and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.29, a 10.3% increase over Q3 2023. The adjusted revenue increase of $100 million over Q3 2023 was primarily driven by incremental revenue contributions from the WIT alternatives, GIDS and Intralink businesses. Acquisitions contributed $8 million with about $4 million attributable to Battea, and foreign exchange had a favorable impact of approximately $5 million. As a result, adjusted organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis was 6.4%. Our core expenses increased 6.8% or $58 million excluding acquisitions and on a constant currency basis. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $566 million or 38.6% of adjusted revenue, an increase of $32 million or 6% from Q3 2023. Net interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $110 million, a decrease of $11 million from Q3 2023. Adjusted net income was $327 million, up 10%, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.29, an increase of 10.3%. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. An increase in the average share price drove the diluted share count up to 254.1 million from 252.3 million at Q2 ‘24. SSNC ended the third quarter with $694.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $7.2 billion in gross debt. The higher-than-normal cash balance reflects opportunistic borrowing that will be deployed during the fourth quarter. SSNC's net debt, as defined in our credit agreement, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $159 million held at DomaniRx was $6.7 billion. Our last 12-month consolidated EBITDA used for covenant compliance was $2,279 billion. Based on net debt of approximately $6.7 billion, our total leverage ratio was 2.9 times. As we look forward to the fourth quarter and the remainder of the year with respect to guidance, note that we will continue to focus on client service and assume that retention rates will remain in the range of our most recent results. We will continue to manage our expenses with a cost disciplined approach by controlling and aligning variable expenses to ensure efficiency, increasing productivity to improve our operating margins and leverage our scale and create capacity and effectively investing in the business through marketing and sales and R&D to take advantage of future growth opportunities. Specifically, we have assumed foreign currency exchange and interest rates to remain at current levels. A tax rate of approximately 26% on an adjusted basis, which is unchanged from prior guidance, capital expenditures to be 4.1% to 4.5% of revenues, which is also unchanged from prior guidance, and a stronger weighting to share repurchases versus debt reduction, subject to changes in market conditions or financing needs. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.46 billion to $1.5 billion and 2.4% organic revenue growth at the midpoint; adjusted net income in the range of $329 million to $345 million; interest expense, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, in the range of $110 million to $112 million; diluted shares in the range of 254.6 million to 255.6 million; and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.29 to $1.35. For the full year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5.815 billion to $5.855 billion and 4.9% organic revenue growth at the midpoint; adjusted net income in the range of $1.299 billion to $1.315 billion; diluted shares in the range of 253.6 million to 253.8 million; adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $5.12 to $5.18; and cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.33 billion to $1.37 billion. And now back to Bill. I was just going to add to that, that just across, I'll call it, more infrastructure to Bill's point, right? So we don't want to create the digital worker for 10 different systems and then be able to have to rebuild. So we're leveraging that, the broader consolidated system. And so to echo Bill's point, we are pretty enthusiastic about what we're going to be able to leverage. And then the other point that we've made on prior phone calls is that I think the level of sophistication continues to increase over time as well about the impact that some of the digital workers can have as we mature as an organization and our learnings continue to increase about how to utilize the digital workers. Yes. I wouldn't necessarily assume M&A on any material size for Q4 as far as I'm seeing around that purposes. But we are – like I said, we took an opportunistic point of view on the funding, given where rates were and what we were able to raise that at versus our current cost structure. So we're looking to, again, effectively deploy that share repurchase in combination with the rest of our operating cash flow and further debt reduction, again, utilizing that lower cost of funds, we'll have executed that in Q4. That's right."

            "content": "Thanks Justine, and welcome everyone. Our third quarter results are record adjusted revenue of $1,466.8 million, up 7.3%. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.29, up 10.3%. We also reported record adjusted consolidated EBITDA of 566.2 million with 38.6% EBITDA margins. Our third quarter adjusted organic revenue growth was 6.4%. This growth was driven by strength in our Alternatives, GIDS, WIT and Intralinks businesses. The surprise upside came largely in our GIDS and WIT businesses, accelerated license revenue in the Wealth and Investment Technologies business and non-recurring professional services fees in the global investor and distribution solutions business. Global Investor Distribution services business drove the outperformance. Our recurring revenue growth rate for financial services was 7.2%, which includes all software-enabled services and maintenance revenue. Third quarter cash from operating activities was $336.6 million, up 39% from Q3 2023. Our cash flow conversion percentage from the quarter was 103%. We bought back 1.2 million shares for $89.4 million at an average price of $72.72 per share. [Indiscernible] high quality acquisitions, we continue to believe share repurchases are the best capital use. In September, we closed the $670 million Battea-Class Action Services acquisition. Battea meets our financial criteria, about $95 million in annual revenue, growing high single digits and 45% plus EBITDA margin. This acquisition will immediately accretive to earnings. Battea's offering is synergistic with our fund administration business and we're already making progress cross-selling. I'll now turn this call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Brian. We feel our business is strengthening and we were able to expand our horizons. The Battea purchase is already showing very positive signs. Our Deliver client conference was a great success and I would like to thank David Rubenstein for being our keynote speaker. I will now open it up for questions. Yes. We would say you're right, it's probably about 70%, 80% is what the UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, CVS, and Cigna, and Express Script process. I think there's something like five billion to six billion scripts a year in the United States. So, if you take 20% of six billion, you got 1.2 billion and if you take 30%, you get 1.8 billion. Right? So, that's a lot of scripts. So, we think we have a lot of run room. We also think that we can license our technology maybe to one of those three or maybe more. And we also have a large number of others that are like us or like the big three but a lot smaller, so they might do 200 million, 300 million scripts rather than the 1.5 billion scripts. So we think there's plenty of run room. We think there's a lot of things in healthcare that need help with. And so pharmacy claims is one, but there are other things like medical claims and other things that we think we're well-positioned to be able to help the healthcare industry. Yes. I think the Trust Suite product really does take, the InnoTrust product and Black Diamond and really creates a very pleasant user interface and a lot of capability with technology that is pretty state-of-the-art. Most of the trust systems out in the marketplace today are multi-decade old, and we think that we have a lot of run room and we've been pretty pleased with the acceptance rate of Trust Suite. Well, it's still a little nascent, but we would expect it to do probably in 2024 upwards to $10 million in revenue. And then in 2025, we would expect to see perhaps a multiple of that. Yes. I think the major thing with Q4 in 2024 compared to 2023 is Q4 of 2023 was substantially better than any of the other quarters in 2023. So we're kind of getting a little bit of a comp challenge to us. And we have a big pipeline. We have a lot of stuff going on. We're always cautious. We've had three or four pretty good quarters in a row and we expect Q4 to be a pretty good quarter, too. No. I think, as Rahul spoke earlier, we got a pretty big uplift in revenue for healthcare in October, stuff that had pushed from September. I still think we have a great opportunity here. DomaniRx is really new technology, that there's nothing like it out in the marketplace that can handle scale. A lot of people that used our RxNova system considered it the gold standard for Medicare and Medicare Advantage already, and DomaniRx is far exceeding RxNova's capabilities. You mean Humana and Cigna? .: So we think there's plenty of opportunity for us. Whatever happens with Humana, Cigna, we think it will be positive towards us. And lots of stuff is happening in healthcare as Rahul had alluded to before, and we just have to play it out. But everybody is concerned about their health. People are not going to stop spending money on their health, and we think it's a very good spot for us to be in. Yes. I think that we have – I think our salesforce is the strongest it's been, so we have a lot of people out there banging on doors and we have a lot of capable people. We have tremendous number of opportunities all over the world. You got to win, right? And then you got to get them live so the revenue streams in. But I would say that we're pretty bullish on 2025. And we have the resources, we have the cash. We have access to markets. We're really excited about the cross-sell opportunities with Battea. I think that we have an opportunity to surprise you positively. Yes. Why don't I – I'll give you a little answer and I'll let Rahul kind of get in a little deeper. But if you notice on our percentage of CapEx, we're at 4.1% to 4.5%. Historically, we've been at 3%, 3.5%. So we have poured a lot more money into R&D, and our CTO, Anthony Caiafa, he's gotten a little older. He's 38 so he knows how to spend faster so we think that, that will probably continue. Rahul? Yes. Again, I'll give you a little, Dan, and I'll have Rahul maybe a little bit more or Brian in. We did have a really good Q3 for wealth and investment technology and the global investor and distribution services business. So we're not quite ready to see if they can repeat that in Q4, although we're optimistic they'll have good quarters. So I think that's a little bit. And then as I said before, I think the comp is a little more difficult in Q4 than it was in Q3. Yes, Dan, I think that's a great question and I think we are pretty enthusiastic about where we can go with our Blue Prism digital workers. Brian could get into it more deeply. But we've done an awful lot of acquisitions so we have an awful lot of systems. We like to have fewer systems and more digital workers. And I know we have plans to do that throughout accounting and finance, and Nick Wright in the global investor and distribution services business has done a great job of deploying digital workers and Bhagesh Malde in our fund administration businesses as well as many others. And so we're pretty optimistic, I think, on Blue Prism's capabilities. But we also are integrating – we're integrating AI into this, too, its large language models and other things are also enhancing Blue Prism's capabilities. Yes. I think, first of all, it's interesting you call class action lawsuits projects. We would tend to call them lawsuits. And so you've got the vagaries of the court system. But I think additionally, there is some seasonality in Battea and Q4 tends to be the largest quarter of the four quarters. And there's a bunch of court cases that have already been adjudicated. The courts have to release the payments on the class actions and that's when we get paid. But we're – we would say that we're going to try to give you all as much insight into Battea as we can. They have 900 clients, we have 22,000. We think there's an opportunity for a lot of extension in the Battea's business. It also, too, I think, would be important for people to understand that an awful lot of the large-scale financial firms in the United States and more so even around the world have a very difficult time deploying large-scale new systems. So their choices are to try to build a great big system, maybe go to a body shop, Indian body shop like a Tata or an HCL or an Infosys or one of the other ones, that is fraught with challenges. And an increasingly attractive solution for them is to lift it out to us. We have world-class data centers. We have world-class developers. We have world-class processes. And I think as they see it, they get increasingly intrigued. The other thing is, if you look at Q3 of 2024 compared to Q3 of 2023, we added $100 million in revenue. So people look at these fintech companies and talk about them. They did $200 million in revenue for a year. We added $100 million in Q3. And I think – we're not saying that our business is strengthening because we think we're going to slow down. We think we're going to accelerate. Look, the deals are bigger, the size of the organizations are bigger, the size of the number of people that we would absorb are higher. So with all of that becomes some increased analysis, increased negotiation on contracts. And so we're being cautiously optimistic, but we're not backing away from the midterm 4% to 8%. Yes. We think that's a great question. We are doing a lot internally here. We have some management changes we've done. We're accelerating our amount of money that we are pouring into Blue Prism. We've moved some really top technologists that Anthony had brought in. So we're excited about what we can do with Blue Prism and reaccelerating the growth. Again, we're still getting Magic Quadrant when people analyze it. And I think the addition of AI and the large language models and then obviously, OpenAI is going to be all the more change in the world. But you got to be on top of it. And I think we've done a pretty good job of really maximizing the potential internally on Blue Prism and then we're going to redouble our focus on the external opportunities. We think primarily the strong growth in alternatives based on brilliant management. Other people might think it's – the market is pretty strong, right? And the hedge fund industry traditionally has pretty good risk-adjusted return levels. And I think as you look at our client base, almost all the large-scale platforms are SSNC clients. And over the last several years, they have gotten the lion's share of all the new capital that have flowed into hedge funds, same with private equity funds and now private credit. So we think we're well positioned to continue to be a beneficiary of our clients' success. And so we have a lot of focus on making sure that we're adding value, bringing out new technologies, new capabilities, new processes, and then being able to really help like our international clients as they move to T+1. In the U.S., we're going to move to shorter than T+1, right? When you look at the Gen Xers, they're used to Venmo. I don't think moving money takes 24 hours, right? So I think those kinds of things are going to be shorten. Obviously, that takes a lot of the risk out of the system, but systems that process that have to be really locked and loaded in it. That's something we're pretty good at. Really big. No, we did have a strong Wealth and Investment Technologies, we're up 10.9%, I believe. And we've got a couple of large license deals in Q3, and that really helped drive the organic revenue growth. Again, thanks, all of you, for being on the call and thank the analysts for asking really pointed questions which we appreciate. I do think that we're pretty optimistic about where our business sits and that we hope to talk to you again in 2025 and surprise you positively. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. We had another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 6.4%. The wealth and investment technology business unit grew 10.9% for the quarter. The reorganization from earlier in 2024 has brought development teams together and we're currently integrating the capabilities of our Aloha solution into the new Genesis platform. This will accelerate our ability to deliver the deepest set of cloud native front-to-back technology to the investment management market. The Black Diamond Wealth Platform has reached a major milestone with the rollout of advanced grouping functionality. This initiative enables Black Diamond advisors to further personalize their client reporting and compete effectively in the alternative asset reporting space for RIAs and family offices. Our Global Investor and Distribution Solutions business had another strong quarter and in addition to new business wins, we have brought in additional revenue through special projects at our largest clients. Healthcare industry is facing higher than expected utilization and rising costs for Medicare – and Medicare advantage. SSNC is poised to support our healthcare clients and prospects through these headwinds. With the integration of our DomaniRx platform, automation opportunities and liftouts, we can reduce the operating costs for health insurers over time. Q4 is off to a strong start for SSNC health. We signed two large license deals for about $8 million in revenue at the beginning of October that will push from Q3. Our internal automation efforts are progressing as well. Since acquiring Blue Prism in 2022, our total revenue has grown about $600 million and our headcount is down. For 2024 year-to-date we estimate a benefit of approximately 1,050 full time equivalents thus far in the year because of rolling out Blue Prism digital workers as well as automating and optimizing existing processes. We'll now turn it over to Brian to run through the financials. The thing I would add to that is as we have organized our business increasingly effectively, right, and had more and more products and services pointed at specific segments of the market or specific types of customers, what we need to build has become increasingly clearer. So we get a lot of good feedback from our sales force. We get a lot of good feedback from the folks covering those accounts. And a lot of times, we can get anchor clients and folks that want to partner with us on funded development, which then results in revenue a lot faster. So it's easier to back those kinds of things and that's part of the positive dynamic that's going on. Yes. And Bill, I would just add on that last point on comp, if you look at the 2023 by quarter, first three quarters, we did about $1.360 billion in each quarter, right, approximately. And in Q4, we did $1.411 billion. So Q4 was $45 million to $50 million higher than the other three quarters and that's really what you're seeing. If you kind of look at our Q4 guidance in absolute numbers, we're ahead of any other quarter this year. Our low point is $40 million ahead of our low point the prior quarter. So we feel good about where we are. Most of this is a comp issue. I think most of our strength in the GIDS organic revenue is really just coming from as we're building technology, we're attracting more and more customers and maybe customers that are in slightly different segments then. So we have many more wealth management firms, which some of our biggest clients are wealth management firms, but we've got a number of new prospects. And as we continue to build out our call center capabilities and BPO capabilities, more and more of these customers are willing to lift out internal functions and give them to us and that's a part of it. So while the macro trends in the market may have had some impact, most of it is just us expanding our product suite. In general, I think I would just come back to, we feel like our business is strengthening, right? So we do have – we haven't been through the 2025 revenue planning and budgeting processes yet. But we do feel like you can kind of look at our recurring revenue, financial services as a sort of a leading indicator that the stable reoccurring and recurring revenue base is continually growing and that ought to help us in 2025."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand today's call over to Justine Stone, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJustine Stone : Welcome everybody and thank you for joining us for our Q2 2024 Earnings Call. I’m Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C Technologies. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Brian Schell, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, we need to review the Safe Harbor Statement. Please note the various remarks we make today about future expectations, plans, and prospects, including the financial outlook we provide constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factor section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and can also be accessed on our website. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of today, July 25th, 2024. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in today's earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com. I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Stone : Thanks, Justine, and welcome, everyone. Our second quarter results are record adjusted revenue of $1,452.4 million, up 6.5% and $20 million ahead of our forecast. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.27, up 17.6% adjusted consolidated EBITDA was [$558.9 million] (ph) for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was up 170 basis points, the 38.5%. Our second quarter adjusted organic revenue growth was 6.4%. The revenue acceleration was driven by strength in our alternatives, GIDS, wealth and investment technology and Intralinks businesses. The surprise upside came largely in our GID business, the outperformance driven by seasonality and some accelerated license revenue. Our recurring revenue growth for financial services was 7.7%, which includes all software enabled services and maintenance revenue. Second quarter cash from operations were $385 million up 16.8% from Q2 2023. Our cash flow conversion percentage for the quarter was over 120%. We paid down $25.2 million in debt in Q2 2024. Bring our net leverage ratio to 2.84 times, consolidated EBITDA. In Q2 2024, we bought back 3.7 million shares for $227 million at an average price of $62.17 per share, this is the highest share buyback in one quarter in SS&C's history. Last week, the Board Of Directors renewed a one year, $1 billion common stock repurchase program. We continue to believe stock repurchases are a good use of our capital. On the M&A front, valuations are still elevated, but we are seeing an increase in relevant targets coming to market. We will continue to look, but our returns need to be as attractive or greater than buying back our own stock. I'll now turn it over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail.\nRahul Kanwar : Thanks, Bill. Our business had a good quarter with the strongest organic revenue growth since 2021. Our alternative fund administration business had strong growth across the board in private markets, hedge funds, and retail alternatives where we provide both fund administration and transfer agency services and support registered alternative and interval funds. SS&C is uniquely positioned to serve this growing area with the combination of our transfer agency and fund administration services. We have seen early success in the wealth and investment technology business unit collaborating on client relationship management and sales opportunities. Trust Suite, momentum continues, the sales pipeline is robust and we're being invited to participate in the largest RFPs in the market. DomaniRx's second release was put in production on July 1st and the platform can now process claims for all lines of business. We have processed over 100 million claims since going live in January and have migrated our first new client onto the platform. Domani's key strengths include enhanced functionality running on the SS&C private cloud, will [stop] (ph) with self-service capabilities and customized reporting. I will now turn the call over to Brian to discuss the financials.\nBrian Schell : Thanks, Rahul. And good day, everyone. Our Q2 2024 GAAP results reflect revenues of $1.452 billion, net income of $190 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.75. Our adjusted revenues were also $1.452 billion, an increase of 6.5% over Q2 2023. The increase of $89 million over prior year was primarily driven by incremental revenue contribution from the alternatives with GIDS and Intralinks businesses. Acquisitions contributed $4 million and foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $2 million. As a result, adjusted organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis was 6.4%. Our core expenses increased 3.3% or $29.2 million excluding acquisitions and on a constant currency basis. Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA attributable to SS&C was $559 million or 38.5% of adjusted revenue and increase of $57 million or 11.2% from Q2 2023. The 38.5% EBITDA margin reflects a year-over-year improvement of 170 basis points driven by the positive impact of both revenue growth and disciplined expense management. Net interest expense this quarter was $113 million, a decrease of $5 million from Q2 2023. Adjusted net income was $320 million, up 15.7%, and adjusted diluted EPS $1.27, an increase of 17.6%. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Increased share repurchases drove the diluted share count down to $252.3 million from $253.3 million in Q1 2024. SS&C ended the second quarter with $462.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.7 billion in gross debt. SS&C's net debt, as defined in our credit agreement, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of the $88.5 million held at DomaniRX was $6.3 billion. Our last 12 months consolidated EBITDA used for covenant complaints was $2.2 billion. Based on net debt of approximately $6.3 billion, our total leverage ratio was 2.84 times and our secured leverage ratio was 1.6 times. In May, we refinanced our Term B loan consisting of five tranches with a new single $3.9 billion Term B loan tranche as well as a $750 million senior note. The refinancing resulted in a $28 million non-cash loss on the extinguishment of debt and the capitalization of $35 million of new deferred financing fees. The refinancing activity resulted in extending our debt maturity by approximately 3.7 years and diversifying our funding sources, but still positioned to benefit from any reduction in short-term rates. As we look forward to the third quarter and the remainder of the year with respect to guidance, note that we will maintain our focus on client service and assume that retention rates will continue to be in the range of our most recent results. We will manage our expenses with a cost-discipline approach by controlling and aligning variable expenses to ensure efficiency, increasing productivity, improve our operating margins to leverage our scale, and effectively investing in the business through marketing, sales, and R&D to take advantage of future growth opportunities. Specifically, we have assumed foreign currency exchange rates will be at current levels, short-term interest rates to remain at current levels, a tax rate of approximately 26% on an adjusted basis, capital expenditures to be 4.1% to 4.5% of revenues, which is a slight reduction from prior guidance, and a stronger waiting to share repurchase versus debt reduction subject to changes to market conditions. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.42 billion to $1.46 billion and 5.3% organic revenue growth at the midpoint. Adjusted net income in the range of $304.6 million to $320.6 million. Interest expense excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount in the range of $107 million to $109 million, diluted shares in the range of 251.6 million to 252.6 million shares, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.21 to $1.27. For the full year of 2024, we are raising revenue guidance by $12 million and expect revenue to be in the range of $5.706 billion to $5.866 billion and 4.9% organic revenue growth at the midpoint. Adjusted net income in the range of $1.246 billion to $1.326 billion, diluted shares in the range of 250.9 million to 253.9 million shares. Adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.98 to $5.22 and cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.305 billion to $1.385 billion. Our updated 2024 guidance reflects our strong results in the first half of the year with a continued positive outlook for the remainder of the year. And now back to Bill.\nWilliam Stone : Thanks, Brian. We obviously have strong quarter on both the top and bottom-line. We continue to be bullish about our business and our updated guidance [has offset] (ph) 4.9% organic growth at the midpoint and $5.10 in adjusted diluted earnings per share. I'd also like to announce that on September 18th of 2024, we'll hold an Analyst Day at NASDAQ market site in New York City. Formal invites will go out in the coming weeks and please reach out to Justine if you have any questions. We also be hosting our SS&C deliver client conference in New Orleans, Louisiana on October 6 to 8. This premier event is designed for executives and decision makers across SS&C's solutions set and features hands-on learning, industry insights, and many networking opportunities. I'm pleased to announce this year's keynote speaker is my friend David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-chairman of the Carlyle Group, which SS&C was a portfolio company from 2005 until 2014. We look forward to hosting hundreds of our clients and prospects in October. I'd now like to turn it over to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.\nDaniel Perlin: Thanks. Good evening. Great to see the organic trends just continuing to improve here. I just had a quick question on the guidance. It looks like at the midpoint it seems to suggest, if we use kind of the midpoint for third quarter and then take the full year number, that the fourth quarter's organic growth kind of steps down a little bit, maybe more meaningfully. I'm just trying to understand, like is this just tougher comps as we kind of look at the numbers or something structural that we need to be mindful of -- or is this just kind of overall conservatism since we're not -- we're a little bit away from maybe putting up the numbers on the fourth quarter. Thanks.\nWilliam Stone: Yeah, Dan, I would just say that the Q4 is really a comp issue. Q4 of '23 was particularly strong and again as you well know we are in the process of meeting and beating our numbers. So we are still focused hard on making sure we have a strong number, but a number that we expect to hit.\nDaniel Perlin: Okay. No, that's great. And then just a quick follow-up. Your leverage is at 2.8 turns now. Obviously you just re-upped $1 billion buyback and you just did the biggest buyback in the company's history for the quarter. And you kind of mentioned a little bit, Bill about the M&A kind of environment in the pipeline. I'm just wondering what do you see out there? How is it stacking up in terms of overall capital allocation? I understand you got a hurdle rate for your buyback versus M&A. But it does sound like M&A is picking back up and even in kind of your -- I guess, is your Intralinks report that you recently put out it sounded like within North America, the deal flow was looking pretty good. So I would just love to get your thoughts on where you sit today given your balance sheet is pretty healthy.\nWilliam Stone: Yes. As you well know we've really built the company around organic revenue growth and acquisitions. We see a lot of stuff out there. We see things that are on the low end of ridiculously priced. So we are willing to look hard. We would like to deploy capital in acquisitions. We would like to further build out our portfolio of products and services. And in each of our business units are kind of beating the bushes for opportunities. So I wouldn't be surprised if we were able to close a couple of tuck-ins and maybe something a little more substantial. I don't see any $5 billion or $10 billion acquisitions on the near-term horizon, although SS&C will be in the running, if any of those things come on the market.\nDaniel Perlin: Excellent. Thank you Will.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hi, Will, Rahul, Brian, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe it's a higher-level question for me. Obviously, the last three quarters, we've seen you maintain at least mid-single digit organic growth. Maybe talk about the sustainability and visibility of consistently delivering that. And if anything, what's changed? I realize that we are a more stable level in terms of the GIDS performance. Health care is stable versus one years to two years ago, but if there is anything else deeper in the business that drives that stabilization that would be helpful. And I realize I might be jumping on the Analyst Day, but anything there would be helpful. Thanks a lot guys.\nWilliam Stone: Andrew, I’d just say in general that we have a strong focus on organic revenue growth. We have looked at a bunch of acquisitions, but the ones that we really like are pricing at 10 times revenue. So we don't like them that much at that price. So when you start focusing on organic revenue, you start looking on how you're pricing. We've done a pretty good job of getting a little more discipline there. And you also make sure that the pitches that we go out in order to cross-sell and up-sell, as well as new names are crisp and impacted. So I think we've done a good job there. And I think Rahul probably has a couple of anecdotes or additions that would also give you some clarity.\nRahul Kanwar: Yes. I think the thing that I would add to that is product development. We've spent a lot of energy over the last really several quarters, making sure that what we are selling into a particular type of customer will bring in all of SS&C to bear. And so that is starting to show up in larger deals and better win rates, and we expect that to continue.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. Thank you Will and Rahul. Yes, certainly shining through in the product updates that you are putting through to the market. So we see that. I appreciate those comments. And then maybe just a question on the outlook. Just the raise and the EPS outlook relative to the second quarter result and that in conjunction with higher level of share repurchase. I'm wondering if there was some reinvestment that was baked in or if there's some that you're kind of saving for some potential outperformance in the back half, it just looks like the raise was a little bit lighter than the outperformance. So anything there would be helpful. Thank you.\nWilliam Stone: Well again as we said, our GIDS business was particularly strong, and we don't expect a repeat of the strength of that business in Q3 or Q4. We have some opportunities but often they're multi-quarter sales cycles. We have a good pipeline, but that certainly could be a little bit of a headwind to us. And then we also are -- we're very excited about our trust suite that we're bringing out into the marketplace. It is getting a lot of positive reaction. And I think we’re executing and hopefully, it will surprise you positively.\nDaniel Perlin: Got it. Thank you Bill. And sorry, just one more housekeeping since you mentioned at the GIDS business, the accelerated license revenue? Like could you shed some light on that? Was that timing, just any details on that? And then I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks a lot for your responses here.\nRahul Kanwar: It is mostly timing. There were some deals that we had forecast that's coming in, in Q3 and Q4, and we were able to pull them into Q2.\nDaniel Perlin: Perfect. Thank you Rahul.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson.\nPeter Heckmann: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess how would you characterize the overall spending environment? And we hear you in terms of where certain areas are producing a little bit better organic growth. But I guess, what do you view in terms of like the next couple of years catalysts that could potentially cause you to look at switching vendors, upgrading? And what do you think are the demand drivers there? Is it regulatory? Is it technology? Or is it price?\nWilliam Stone: Well, I think it's all of those. I think price is probably the least important of the three. I also think as you see of these cyberattacks and the outages for large-scale businesses, they start looking hard at who their vendors are in and how much money are there vendors putting into their security walls and their expertise and the number of layers they have in order to kind of stop the bad guys. And similar to things like made off in others that caused a real fee change in and how people did their books, whether they did them in-house or they did them with an outside administrator. I think technology is going to be one of those things that, yes, you saved a few hundred thousand and maybe even a few million over three-year or four-year deal, and then you got burned for about 15 or 20. And they are going to start deciding that playing technology on the cheap is a risky business. So I think that's going to be a real driver. I also think how you deploy the newest technologies, whether that is deep learning, machine learning, RPA, AI, ML, all of those things, right? I think the key there is has to work, and it has to work better than what you had before. You can't go show them something that's really pretty and it's slow or it doesn't -- isn't as accurate. So there's a lot of things that go into deploying new technologies. It's not just, well, we use large language models. And we are really steeped in AI. And maybe, I think those kinds of things are real opportunities for us. And I think as long as we focus and deliver applications that show that, hey we are here for the long term. We're going to give you improvements every quarter, every 6 months, every year, and you're going to see that your business improves because you chose the right partner.\nPeter Heckmann: Yes, that's helpful. And then just any comments just on wealth specifically mentioned it as one driver of organic growth. But I guess, how would you characterize there? Is that more on the adviser tech side or more on the [long-only] (ph) side?\nWilliam Stone: I think it's in both. You're going to have, obviously the wealth and investment technology is a very strong area. And just as you've seen on Envestnet getting sold or at least in the process of being sold. And all the number of mergers and private equity buying into different wealth technology companies, I don't see that stopping. There is however many trillions being transferred from generation to generation and the younger people getting this money are not going to wait for a monthly statement or a quarterly statement or along those lines, they're going to want instantaneous access to their money. And I think things like you see on the T+1 and other things where the regulators are understanding when you have things like Venmo and other instantaneous money movers, people don't want to wait 24 hours for trade to settle or the money to be available or anything else. So you're going to have to be nimble enough to handle the people that are recipients the current generations really large scale wealth accumulation.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Alexei Gogolev with JPMorgan.\nAlexei Gogolev: Hi, Bill, [indiscernible] Gogolev here. Great to hear from you. Last time we met you flagged growing confidence that SS&C will be able to achieve high single-digit organic revenue growth in the mid-term. So sort of following up on some of the questions that my colleagues have asked, are you seeing some sort of time or pockets of opportunity that could drive further growth acceleration?\nWilliam Stone: I think we see that, Alex. I think the question is that you have to not just see them, you have to act on them and you have to get ink on paper. And I think the large-scale things that we think are happening are people to outsource and even for us to take various lift-out where we can give them tremendous expense savings, better technology and a happier client base, and we can earn a lot of money in processing that business. We think there's a number of those that are in the marketplace. We think we are well positioned. So I think those types of things and then things like what we're rolling out as new products and new services as they kick in, I think you'll see increasing organic revenue growth. I think the reduction in year-over-year revenue in health care went from 8.5% to 4.5% or 8.5% to 4.8%. I think Q3 will be better than that may be breakeven or even a little better on a growth basis. And then I think we'll start accelerating in Q4 and throughout '25 and '26. So I think there's a number of different catalysts that can drive mid to high single digits, but it's execution. We've got great strategies.\nAlexei Gogolev: Understood, Bill. And just to build up on the answer that you just provided. You've always positioned having your own data centers and infrastructure is a strong competitive advantage. Could you discuss how your customers reacted to outages last week? And if you've seen any incremental demand on the back of that?\nWilliam Stone: Well, I think we've had many follow-up calls with customers of ours that in their stack, they had some of the companies that had real difficulty in our own tech stack, we have very little of the companies that have had problems. So knock on probably [fib marble] (ph) here. We are well served by our technology team that's very disciplined and also as many layers security around our data processing centers. We run our own private cloud. It doesn't mean we don't get attacked. Of course, we get attacked by everybody else. But we are not Amazon. We're not Azure. We're not a Target. And the number of people coming after us is a mere fraction of what we go after large-scale disruption of the US economy. So we are confident in what we're doing. We spend tons of money and we believe that we are getting value.\nAlexei Gogolev : Understood. Thank you very much Bill.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Bill, can you maybe talk about the pipeline that DomaniRx given that you've now had a few successful clients on the platform, what you're seeing, maybe what the conversations are like and just time frame for any new announcements?\nWilliam Stone: Well, we have a good pipeline and we have a pipeline with very large health care insurance claims payers. And I think we have a better bread box. So we have a great opportunity if we can execute in a way that those large-scale organizations say, you can handle this. Not only can you handle it, DomaniRx has very little latency. It is processed up second, a number of our competitors are processing in multi-second. And when you are doing millions of claims, that's very unpopular. But we think we have some competitive advantage there. As Rahul said before, we have self-service capabilities. We have very strengthened reporting capabilities and a lot of good things for finance, so that they can really understand where they're spending money and on which drugs and which market. So we think we have great opportunities. There's vagaries in every market, there's vagaries here too. So we have to execute, but we put 1.5 million hours into Domani. And as I tell our prospects and clients, it works and that's a pretty big statement.\nSurinder Thind: That's helpful. And just as clarify -- is it larger deals, longer sales cycle in the rest of your business? Or how should we think about that?\nWilliam Stone: I wouldn't necessarily say longer sales cycles, but most health care plans start [1] (ph). You give the opportunities on a January 1, '24. Damn, it's July '24. And now we get a big opportunity on January 1, '25. And for the biggest ones, you're really going to have to be planning starting now and hopefully taking them line on 1/1/26. But there are enormous type companies that can pay upwards to $100 million a year on some of these claims processing things that they do. And we just need to be ready. The system has to continue to get better and we have to continue to delight our customers.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. And then on Blue Prism, just any update there, what you are seeing externally? And then just as a follow-up on the earlier comments about obviously doing a lot of continued work in AI/ML and it takes a lot of time to prove those technologies. But just update on the internal efficiency initiatives there and if there is any change that you see coming not necessarily this year, but as you look out over the next 1, 2, 3 years that maybe you can squeeze a bit more from an efficiency perspective?\nRahul Kanwar: Yes. We are continuing to roll out Blue Prism within SS&C. In some ways, we are building momentum because as more people get trained up, we have more capacity to have additional processes, be subject to that robotic process automation and AI type enhancements. We are also -- we just released the next generation of Blue Prism, which actually as part of its workflow as GenAI capabilities, so you can use GenAI natural language type interface to design your workflows, which makes it easier for us to roll out internally but also improves our product differentiation from others in the marketplace. So we feel really good about Blue Prism and how it's helping us, and we certainly expect it to accelerate from here.\nWilliam Stone: And I would just add to that, that what we find when people start to embrace it, their jobs get better. And some people -- we have a lot of green eyeshades and a lot of warm bands around this SS&C. So often, you have to bring the horses to water multiple times, and it's best if it's really summing up. So they're thirsty. So I think those opportunities is where we have things where, wow, I wish I would have done this a year ago because it makes their job better, it makes the treasury parts of their job, sort of not drudgery anymore because they're not doing it. They have some digital work we're doing it. So I think we are sticking to the knitting. We constantly monitor how many digital workers by business unit. And I know they are very happy about all the calls that Rahul and I make to them.\nSurinder Thind : Thank you Bill. That’s helpful.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Thanks a lot. A couple of broad questions. I want to follow up on the Blue Prism question and I appreciate your comments there. Just wondering what you see as the competitive landscape right now? And I love to hear how you're thinking about that opportunity having evolved to [weight-in] (ph) specifically whether or not you think you maybe can be the beneficiary of some of the hiccups we've seen from some of the public RPA vendors?\nWilliam Stone: Yes. We think if we keep our hiccups at a very minimum, will be a big recipient because our business is profitable, sweatening to sustainable. It means we can invest. I know that a lot of these companies that you follow in and bunch of your colleagues follow. It is how much money, private equity money can we burn before we have to be profitable. And I think a little bit that fuse has kind of played its way out. So now you have to build sustainable businesses. And I think that's what we've done. We also have to accelerate our revenue growth. And I think we've added a new Chief Revenue Officer, we have some high expectations there. But it is all proof in the pudding. You can get up to bat, but someone got to hit the ball. And I think that's the thing we are driving that. And I think we are more than cautiously optimistic. But I wouldn't tell you that we are drunkenly optimistic either. So we are going to execute, and I think we should begin to see double-digit revenue growth in Blue Prism for the foreseeable future.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Silver forecasting is always appreciated. As far as the Genesis platform, I'd love to hear the early feedback from your customers on the product and specifically, what you're trying to do with the capability set across Advent, Eze, and GlobeOp. I guess I'm trying to get a sense for what portion of your customer base do you think this will be most applicable for? And how do you think that Genesis will impact that segment?\nRahul Kanwar: So when we combined Advent and then subsequently institutional and investment management, that combined business is now maybe a little over $1.5 billion in annual revenue and has a lot of the different products that are geared towards wealth asset managers, financial institutions, particularly on the software side. And it's only been a few months, but we find what we are able to do is start to take a look at product road maps for products like Genesis and Aloha and Singularity and others. And make sure that things that we think are worthwhile to build, we're putting the right amount of muscle kind of, and we're making sure that we've got a good launch plan and a good customer validation process. And that's starting to show up in some of the results. So early days, but it feels like we're on the right track.\nJames Faucette: Appreciate that.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kevin McVeigh of UBS.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you so much. And congratulations on really just terrific results. Maybe just for Bill. Bill, given the kind of technology efficiencies that Blue Prism are bringing to bear, is it changing the go-to-market strategy with your clients? I mean I know you've spoken a lot about bigger kind of lift and shift opportunities? Has it accelerated that process? And does the efficiencies at Blue Prism bring to bear afford you kind of a wider lens in terms of go-to-market strategy? Just given some of the potential returns as a result of the efficiencies. I wanted to start there because it feels like there's a step function change in the business from a revenue growth perspective that just is beyond kind of some of the segmentation. And I just wanted to maybe try to frame that a little bit.\nWilliam Stone: Well, I think, Kevin that was the intent when we bought Blue Prism was to buy something that was horizontal that would act as almost like the floor for all of our different applications and services to kind of hang off on or to improve with and be able to present a technological differentiator that we can train everybody on across the enterprise. Now the enterprise is pretty broad, and we've done 75 acquisitions. So there is a lot of teaching and training and implementing a Blue Prism both internally at SS&C. And then as we take people out it fits externally, they get a lot of confidence because we're using it, right? We are eating our own dog food. We're processing on Blue Prism across almost every one of our disciplines inside SS&C. And so that's the whole holly-grail of this thing. And I think that it is -- we think the train has left the station. But I think there was a hill to get the train up first, right? You got to get into those places and you had to really start to educate the IT departments of our clients. When traditionally, we've been functional experts talk to us about retrospective or prospective accounting rules or how to value a multistep bond or whatever it is, right? But now you got to go in and talk about large language models and how you're going to deploy machine learning or RPA and that's an education. And I think we're doing it and we're doing it pretty well. And we have a very talented tech team.\nKevin McVeigh: That makes a lot of sense. And then just does that afford bigger opportunity, Bill? Because obviously, you're talking to a wider audience. So it almost sounds like it's more transformational opportunities. So most of those clients scale and size, I guess just given the complexity of what you are taking.\nWilliam Stone: It does, but it also brings in every tech-focused consulting firm and horizontal consulting firm and tech firm, right? Now you run into all the -- what we used to call manpower shops out of India, whether that's Cognizant or Tata or Infosys or any of the other ones, unless you start bumping into Accenture and the ones here in the states. So it's a different kind of a competitive landscape. We really like that we bring expertise in what our clients are trying to do, so we can kind of help their IT people and try to explain to them. That's not how this really works. This is how it works. This is what really momentum trading means. This is what -- how traders and portfolio managers are looking at risk in their portfolios. And what is the value of real-time versus near real time and being able to go across what they're doing in technology and show them that you are going to spend $5 million doing it that way, if you spend $500,000, you would get the same result. But you would be a hero because you save the organization $4.5 million. And in some of these places have enormous budgets. A couple of hundred million dollars for firms that are a couple of hundred people or 300 people, 400 people. So there's a lot of opportunity in there, but there is a lot of competition.\nKevin McVeigh: That’s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I will now hand today's call over to Bill Stone for any closing remarks.\nWilliam Stone: Thank you, Tamica, and thanks, everybody, for being on the call. We really appreciate it. We are working hard for you as we always have. We like to work hard for you and give you great results. So until next time, we'll be out there working on great results. Thanks again.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "William Stone",
            "content": "Thanks, Justine, and welcome, everyone. Our second quarter results are record adjusted revenue of $1,452.4 million, up 6.5% and $20 million ahead of our forecast. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.27, up 17.6% adjusted consolidated EBITDA was [$558.9 million] (ph) for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was up 170 basis points, the 38.5%. Our second quarter adjusted organic revenue growth was 6.4%. The revenue acceleration was driven by strength in our alternatives, GIDS, wealth and investment technology and Intralinks businesses. The surprise upside came largely in our GID business, the outperformance driven by seasonality and some accelerated license revenue. Our recurring revenue growth for financial services was 7.7%, which includes all software enabled services and maintenance revenue. Second quarter cash from operations were $385 million up 16.8% from Q2 2023. Our cash flow conversion percentage for the quarter was over 120%. We paid down $25.2 million in debt in Q2 2024. Bring our net leverage ratio to 2.84 times, consolidated EBITDA. In Q2 2024, we bought back 3.7 million shares for $227 million at an average price of $62.17 per share, this is the highest share buyback in one quarter in SS&C's history. Last week, the Board Of Directors renewed a one year, $1 billion common stock repurchase program. We continue to believe stock repurchases are a good use of our capital. On the M&A front, valuations are still elevated, but we are seeing an increase in relevant targets coming to market. We will continue to look, but our returns need to be as attractive or greater than buying back our own stock. I'll now turn it over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Brian. We obviously have strong quarter on both the top and bottom-line. We continue to be bullish about our business and our updated guidance [has offset] (ph) 4.9% organic growth at the midpoint and $5.10 in adjusted diluted earnings per share. I'd also like to announce that on September 18th of 2024, we'll hold an Analyst Day at NASDAQ market site in New York City. Formal invites will go out in the coming weeks and please reach out to Justine if you have any questions. We also be hosting our SS&C deliver client conference in New Orleans, Louisiana on October 6 to 8. This premier event is designed for executives and decision makers across SS&C's solutions set and features hands-on learning, industry insights, and many networking opportunities. I'm pleased to announce this year's keynote speaker is my friend David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-chairman of the Carlyle Group, which SS&C was a portfolio company from 2005 until 2014. We look forward to hosting hundreds of our clients and prospects in October. I'd now like to turn it over to questions. Yeah, Dan, I would just say that the Q4 is really a comp issue. Q4 of '23 was particularly strong and again as you well know we are in the process of meeting and beating our numbers. So we are still focused hard on making sure we have a strong number, but a number that we expect to hit. Yes. As you well know we've really built the company around organic revenue growth and acquisitions. We see a lot of stuff out there. We see things that are on the low end of ridiculously priced. So we are willing to look hard. We would like to deploy capital in acquisitions. We would like to further build out our portfolio of products and services. And in each of our business units are kind of beating the bushes for opportunities. So I wouldn't be surprised if we were able to close a couple of tuck-ins and maybe something a little more substantial. I don't see any $5 billion or $10 billion acquisitions on the near-term horizon, although SS&C will be in the running, if any of those things come on the market. Andrew, I'd just say in general that we have a strong focus on organic revenue growth. We have looked at a bunch of acquisitions, but the ones that we really like are pricing at 10 times revenue. So we don't like them that much at that price. So when you start focusing on organic revenue, you start looking on how you're pricing. We've done a pretty good job of getting a little more discipline there.

So we think we have great opportunities. There's vagaries in every market, there's vagaries here too. So we have to execute, but we put 1.5 million hours into Domani. And as I tell our prospects and clients, it works and that's a pretty big statement. I wouldn't necessarily say longer sales cycles, but most health care plans start [1] (ph). You give the opportunities on a January 1, '24. Damn, it's July '24. And now we get a big opportunity on January 1, '25. And for the biggest ones, you're really going to have to be planning starting now and hopefully taking them line on 1/1/26. But there are enormous type companies that can pay upwards to $100 million a year on some of these claims processing things that they do. And we just need to be ready. The system has to continue to get better and we have to continue to delight our customers. And I would just add to that, that what we find when people start to embrace it, their jobs get better. And some people -- we have a lot of green eyeshades and a lot of warm bands around this SS&C. So often, you have to bring the horses to water multiple times, and it's best if it's really summing up. So they're thirsty. So I think those opportunities is where we have things where, wow, I wish I would have done this a year ago because it makes their job better, it makes the treasury parts of their job, sort of not drudgery anymore because they're not doing it. They have some digital work we're doing it. So I think we are sticking to the knitting. We constantly monitor how many digital workers by business unit. And I know they are very happy about all the calls that Rahul and I make to them. Yes. We think if we keep our hiccups at a very minimum, will be a big recipient because our business is profitable, sweatening to sustainable. It means we can invest. I know that a lot of these companies that you follow in and bunch of your colleagues follow. It is how much money, private equity money can we burn before we have to be profitable. And I think a little bit that fuse has kind of played its way out. So now you have to build sustainable businesses. And I think that's what we've done. We also have to accelerate our revenue growth. And I think we've added a new Chief Revenue Officer, we have some high expectations there. But it is all proof in the pudding. You can get up to bat, but someone got to hit the ball. And I think that's the thing we are driving that. And I think we are more than cautiously optimistic. But I wouldn't tell you that we are drunkenly optimistic either. So we are going to execute, and I think we should begin to see double-digit revenue growth in Blue Prism for the foreseeable future. Well, I think, Kevin that was the intent when we bought Blue Prism was to buy something that was horizontal that would act as almost like the floor for all of our different applications and services to kind of hang off on or to improve with and be able to present a technological differentiator that we can train everybody on across the enterprise. Now the enterprise is pretty broad, and we've done 75 acquisitions. So there is a lot of teaching and training and implementing a Blue Prism both internally at SS&C. And then as we take people out it fits externally, they get a lot of confidence because we're using it, right? We are eating our own dog food. We're processing on Blue Prism across almost every one of our disciplines inside SS&C. And so that's the whole holly-grail of this thing. And I think that it is -- we think the train has left the station. But I think there was a hill to get the train up first, right? You got to get into those places and you had to really start to educate the IT departments of our clients. When traditionally, we've been functional experts talk to us about retrospective or prospective accounting rules or how to value a multistep bond or whatever it is, right? But now you got to go in and talk about large language models and how you're going to deploy machine learning or RPA and that's an education. And I think we're doing it and we're doing it pretty well. And we have a very talented tech team. It does, but it also brings in every tech-focused consulting firm and horizontal consulting firm and tech firm, right? Now you run into all the -- what we used to call manpower shops out of India, whether that's Cognizant or Tata or Infosys or any of the other ones, unless you start bumping into Accenture and the ones here in the states. So it's a different kind of a competitive landscape. We really like that we bring expertise in what our clients are trying to do, so we can kind of help their IT people and try to explain to them. That's not how this really works. This is how it works. This is what really momentum trading means. This is what -- how traders and portfolio managers are looking at risk in their portfolios. And what is the value of real-time versus near real time and being able to go across what they're doing in technology and show them that you are going to spend $5 million doing it that way, if you spend $500,000, you would get the same result. But you would be a hero because you save the organization $4.5 million. And in some of these places have enormous budgets. A couple of hundred million dollars for firms that are a couple of hundred people or 300 people, 400 people. So there's a lot of opportunity in there, but there is a lot of competition. Thank you, Tamica, and thanks, everybody, for being on the call. We really appreciate it. We are working hard for you as we always have. We like to work hard for you and give you great results. So until next time, we'll be out there working on great results. Thanks again."

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Our business had a good quarter with the strongest organic revenue growth since 2021. Our alternative fund administration business had strong growth across the board in private markets, hedge funds, and retail alternatives where we provide both fund administration and transfer agency services and support registered alternative and interval funds. SS&C is uniquely positioned to serve this growing area with the combination of our transfer agency and fund administration services. We have seen early success in the wealth and investment technology business unit collaborating on client relationship management and sales opportunities. Trust Suite, momentum continues, the sales pipeline is robust and we're being invited to participate in the largest RFPs in the market. DomaniRx's second release was put in production on July 1st and the platform can now process claims for all lines of business. We have processed over 100 million claims since going live in January and have migrated our first new client onto the platform. Domani's key strengths include enhanced functionality running on the SS&C private cloud, will [stop] (ph) with self-service capabilities and customized reporting. I will now turn the call over to Brian to discuss the financials. Yes. I think the thing that I would add to that is product development. We've spent a lot of energy over the last really several quarters, making sure that what we are selling into a particular type of customer will bring in all of SS&C to bear. And so that is starting to show up in larger deals and better win rates, and we expect that to continue. It is mostly timing. There were some deals that we had forecast that's coming in, in Q3 and Q4, and we were able to pull them into Q2. Yes. We are continuing to roll out Blue Prism within SS&C. In some ways, we are building momentum because as more people get trained up, we have more capacity to have additional processes, be subject to that robotic process automation and AI type enhancements. We are also -- we just released the next generation of Blue Prism, which actually as part of its workflow as GenAI capabilities, so you can use GenAI natural language type interface to design your workflows, which makes it easier for us to roll out internally but also improves our product differentiation from others in the marketplace. So we feel really good about Blue Prism and how it's helping us, and we certainly expect it to accelerate from here. So when we combined Advent and then subsequently institutional and investment management, that combined business is now maybe a little over $1.5 billion in annual revenue and has a lot of the different products that are geared towards wealth asset managers, financial institutions, particularly on the software side. And it's only been a few months, but we find what we are able to do is start to take a look at product road maps for products like Genesis and Aloha and Singularity and others. And make sure that things that we think are worthwhile to build, we're putting the right amount of muscle kind of, and we're making sure that we've got a good launch plan and a good customer validation process. And that's starting to show up in some of the results. So early days, but it feels like we're on the right track."

            "content": "Thanks, Rahul. And good day, everyone. Our Q2 2024 GAAP results reflect revenues of $1.452 billion, net income of $190 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.75. Our adjusted revenues were also $1.452 billion, an increase of 6.5% over Q2 2023. The increase of $89 million over prior year was primarily driven by incremental revenue contribution from the alternatives with GIDS and Intralinks businesses. Acquisitions contributed $4 million and foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $2 million. As a result, adjusted organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis was 6.4%. Our core expenses increased 3.3% or $29.2 million excluding acquisitions and on a constant currency basis. Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA attributable to SS&C was $559 million or 38.5% of adjusted revenue and increase of $57 million or 11.2% from Q2 2023. The 38.5% EBITDA margin reflects a year-over-year improvement of 170 basis points driven by the positive impact of both revenue growth and disciplined expense management. Net interest expense this quarter was $113 million, a decrease of $5 million from Q2 2023. Adjusted net income was $320 million, up 15.7%, and adjusted diluted EPS $1.27, an increase of 17.6%. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Increased share repurchases drove the diluted share count down to $252.3 million from $253.3 million in Q1 2024. SS&C ended the second quarter with $462.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.7 billion in gross debt. SS&C's net debt, as defined in our credit agreement, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of the $88.5 million held at DomaniRX was $6.3 billion. Our last 12 months consolidated EBITDA used for covenant complaints was $2.2 billion. Based on net debt of approximately $6.3 billion, our total leverage ratio was 2.84 times and our secured leverage ratio was 1.6 times. In May, we refinanced our Term B loan consisting of five tranches with a new single $3.9 billion Term B loan tranche as well as a $750 million senior note. The refinancing resulted in a $28 million non-cash loss on the extinguishment of debt and the capitalization of $35 million of new deferred financing fees. The refinancing activity resulted in extending our debt maturity by approximately 3.7 years and diversifying our funding sources, but still positioned to benefit from any reduction in short-term rates. As we look forward to the third quarter and the remainder of the year with respect to guidance, note that we will maintain our focus on client service and assume that retention rates will continue to be in the range of our most recent results. We will manage our expenses with a cost-discipline approach by controlling and aligning variable expenses to ensure efficiency, increasing productivity, improve our operating margins to leverage our scale, and effectively investing in the business through marketing, sales, and R&D to take advantage of future growth opportunities. Specifically, we have assumed foreign currency exchange rates will be at current levels, short-term interest rates to remain at current levels, a tax rate of approximately 26% on an adjusted basis, capital expenditures to be 4.1% to 4.5% of revenues, which is a slight reduction from prior guidance, and a stronger waiting to share repurchase versus debt reduction subject to changes to market conditions. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.42 billion to $1.46 billion and 5.3% organic revenue growth at the midpoint. Adjusted net income in the range of $304.6 million to $320.6 million. Interest expense excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount in the range of $107 million to $109 million, diluted shares in the range of 251.6 million to 252.6 million shares, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.21 to $1.27. For the full year of 2024, we are raising revenue guidance by $12 million and expect revenue to be in the range of $5.706 billion to $5.866 billion and 4.9% organic revenue growth at the midpoint. Adjusted net income in the range of $1.246 billion to $1.326 billion, diluted shares in the range of 250.9 million to 253.9 million shares. Adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.98 to $5.22 and cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.305 billion to $1.385 billion. Our updated 2024 guidance reflects our strong results in the first half of the year with a continued positive outlook for the remainder of the year. And now back to Bill."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SS&C Technologies First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Justine Stone, Head of Investor Relations. Justine, you may begin your conference. \nJustine Stone: Welcome, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm Justine Stone, Investor Relations for SS&C Technologies. With me today is Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rahul Kanwar, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Schell, our Chief Financial Officer. \n Before we get started, we need to review the safe harbor statement. Please note that various remarks we make today about future expectations, plans and prospects, including the financial outlook we provide, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in our Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K which is on file with the SEC and can also be accessed on our website.\n These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of today, April 25, 2024. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is included in today's earnings release, which is located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ssctech.com.\n I will now turn the call over to Bill. \nBill Stone: Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone. Our first quarter results are record adjusted revenue of $1,435.8 million up 5.3%, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.28, 12.3% increase. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $556.8 million for the quarter, a record high for Q1, and our EBITDA margin came in at 38.8%.\n Our first quarter adjusted organic revenue growth was 4.7%, the first quarter revenue acceleration was driven by strength in our alternatives, retirement, Intralinks and Ops adviser businesses. Our recurring revenue growth rate for Financial Services was 6.5%, which includes all software-enabled services and maintenance revenue.\n For the 3 months ended March 31, 2024, cash from operating expenses from operating revenue was $180.5 million. We paid down $79.9 million in debt in Q1 2024, bringing our net leverage ratio to 2.95x and our net secured leverage ratio to 2.02x.\n We bought back 800,000 shares for $52.9 million at an average price of $63.24. The internal deployment of Blue Prism digital workforce across SS&C continues to go well. The 150 basis point year-over-year increase in our EBITDA margin can be attributable in large part to this initiative. A recent Forrester study found an average SS&C Blue Prism client saw a return on investment figure of 330% over 3 years.\n The key benefits include business growth, improved productivity compliance cost avoidance and improved employee experience and retention. As one of the largest users of Blue Prism technology, we are experiencing these results firsthand. \n Earlier this month, we held our first Deliver Europe conference, which was held at the Fairmont in Windsor in the U.K., hosting over 250 clients. The enthusiasm and energy over a 2-day event was evident and we've received universal positive feedback.\n I'll now turn the call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail. \nRahul Kanwar: Thanks, Bill. Our business had a strong quarter with notable strength in Intralinks, retirement and wealth and investment technologies. We saw improvement in software purchasing and long-term renewal decisions in Q1, which positively impacts our software businesses. This past quarter, we combined our Institutional Investment Management or I&IM business with wealth and investment technologies led by Karen Geiger and Steve Leivent. This change allows us to align several of our software products and services geared toward banks, insurance companies and wealth and asset managers.\n Our objectives are to enable accelerated innovation, take advantage of scale to deliver enterprise solutions and benefit from a consistent sales and marketing process. We also combined our retirement business with global investor and distribution solutions in order to deliver a seamless customer experience to our shared clients and once again, take advantage of greater scale and resources. \n Initial feedback from our customers on these changes has been very positive. We continue to progress on optimizing our cost base and strengthening our offering through use of Blue Prism and other AI and automation technologies.\n In our Fund Services business, notable capabilities include intelligent automation that processes over 2 million loan notices each year, enabling customer interaction and support requests through our internally developed large language models and a variety of other advanced protocols.\n I will now turn it over to Brian to run through the financials. \nBrian Schell: Thanks, Rahul, and good day, everyone. As noted in our press release, our Q1 24 GAAP results reflect revenues of [ $1.35 billion ], net income of $158 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.62. And as Bill noted earlier in the call, our adjusted revenues were a quarterly record $1.436 billion, up 5.3%, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.28, up 12.3% and versus Q1 '23. \n Adjusted diluted EPS includes $0.03 in dividend income received on investments previously excluded from adjusted earnings. Going forward, reported adjusted diluted EPS and guidance will include dividend income.\n The adjusted revenue quarterly increase of $72 million was primarily driven by incremental revenue contributions from alternatives and Intralinks. Acquisitions contributed $3 million and foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $6 million. As a result, adjusted organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis was 4.7%. Our core expenses increased 1.9% or $16 million excluding acquisitions and on a constant currency basis.\n Adjusted consolidated EBITDA attributable to SS&C, defined in Note 3 in the earnings release was $557 million or 38.8% of adjusted revenue, an increase of $48 million or 9.4% from Q1 '23, the 38.8% and EBITDA margin reflects a year-over-year improvement of 150 basis points. The 150 basis point margin expansion reflects the positive impact of both revenue growth and disciplined expense management. \n Net interest expense for the first quarter of '24 was $116 million, an increase of $4 million from Q1 '23. The average interest rate in the quarter for the amended credit facility, including the senior notes, was 6.86% compared to 6.21% in the first quarter of '23.\n Adjusted net income, as defined in Note 4 in the earnings release was $324 million the adjusted diluted EPS was $1.28. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Despite the quarterly share repurchase activity, a higher average stock price drove the diluted share count up to 253.3 million from 252.1 million for Q4 '23.\n SS&C ended the first quarter with $413 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.7 billion in gross debt. SS&C's net debt, as defined in our credit agreement, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $95 million held at DomaniRx was $6.4 billion as of March 31. Our last 12-month consolidated EBITDA used for covenant compliance was $2.156 billion as of March 2024.\n Based on net debt of approximately $6.4 billion, our total leverage ratio was 2.95x, down from 3.05x at year-end. Our secured leverage ratio was 2.02x as of March 31. The $3.5 billion of our term loan B matures in April 2025, and we are currently evaluating our debt financing options, looking to go to market in the near future. \n As we look forward to the second quarter and the remainder of the year with respect to guidance, note that we will remain focused on client service and assume that retention rates will be in the range of our most recent results.\n We will continue to manage our expenses with a cost disciplined approach by controlling and aligning variable expenses to ensure efficiency, increasing productivity to improve our operating margins to leverage our scale and effectively investing in the business through marketing, sales and R&D to take advantage of the future growth opportunities ahead of us.\n Specifically, we have assumed foreign currency exchange will be at current levels, interest rates to remain at current levels with the potential of a couple of short-term rate declines in late 2024 and our refinancing will not materially impact our interest rate expense but is obviously subject to varying market conditions.\n GAAP tax rate of approximately 26% on an adjusted basis, which is unchanged from prior guidance. Capital expenditures to remain at the 4.3% to 4.7% of revenues, which is unchanged from prior guidance and a similar historical weighting share repurchases and debt reduction.\n For the second quarter of '24, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.412 billion to $1.452 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $295 million to $311 million; interest expense, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount in the range of $112 million to $114 million; diluted shares in the range of $253 million to $254 million, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.16 to $1.22.\n For the full year 2024, we are raising revenue guidance by $7 million, and we expect revenue to be in the range of $5.695 billion to $5.855 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $1.242 billion to $1.322 billion, diluted shares in the range of $252 million to $255 million, adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.93 to $5.17 and cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.302 billion to $1.382 billion.\n Our updated 2024 guidance reflects our strong results in the first quarter with a continued positive outlook for the remainder of the year. That also reflects our cost disciplined approach and expected margin expansion over the course of the year.\n Now I'd like to turn it back over to Bill for final comments. \nBill Stone: Thanks, Brian. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank a long-term director Mike Daniels for his dedication and support. Mike has been on our board for over 10 years and will not stand for reelection. He's been an important adviser during this time seeing SS&C growth from $700 million in revenue to over $5.5 billion. We wish him well in his future endeavors. We've had a strong start to 2024, and we are working hard to maintain this momentum. \n I'd like now to open it up to questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. \nDaniel Perlin: Just a quick question on the organic growth trends. They look like they continue to improve here. And I'm just wondering if you can maybe help parse this out given the current environment we're in and maybe some of these incremental kind of go-to-market strategy changes or maybe fine-tune end points. \n So how much of the kind of improvement and maybe expected improvement going forward is in kind of just overall demand picking up, Bill, versus kind of sales execution or product realignment and maybe some of this go-to-market motion that's changing for some of these other business segments. \nBill Stone: Well, I think, Dan, and nice to hear from you. We have had an awful lot of development work done in our businesses, and we've created a number of new solutions for our different clients, and that's getting traction. Particularly our trust product, OmniTrust that we've married to our Black Diamond. So now wealth advisers can also handle trust, which is important as their clients start to move money to their children and others. And I think that's been a big opportunity for us.\n And we've also done a number of other things where our delivery to our clients has been improved and our execution on the implementations has also improved. So I think the combination of those things, some more discipline on the pricing, and we're still winning. We're still winning big deals. And as they go live, I think our financial picture will look brighter as we go through the year. \nDaniel Perlin: Yes. That's great. Just a quick follow-up. The $0.03 in the quarter that's related to the dividend income. Just -- I guess a couple of things. One, was that originally contemplated in kind of the original guidance you gave for 2024 and the $0.03 obviously going forward is going to be adjusted. So what's in -- if it wasn't what's included now? And maybe can you just walk me through what the mechanics of that are? I might have just missed it Sorry. \nBrian Schell: Yes. No, there was -- this is Brian. Thanks. The $0.03 was not part of the original guidance. As we look through the appropriate components of adjusted earnings, we felt like these investments were appropriate to be included the last year, if you look at it for presentation purposes, you'll see we actually included it in last year's EPS numbers as well. So you can see it on an apples-to-apples basis. So on a go-forward basis, it's there, we think it's appropriate and try to bring any visibility or clear that we can to the numbers. \nDaniel Perlin: So should we be using $0.03 a quarter is kind of the run rate, I think the year-over-year comparison was adjusted, but I just want to make sure I'm not getting over my skis or over adjusting or under adjusting. \nBrian Schell: The big I'd say, contribution to the year is actually just the first quarter. I would say for the remainder of the year, it probably rounds to probably another $0.01 overall for the next 3 quarters. So it's not a huge adjustment but we just thought it was relevant given how we reflected the rest of our investments and various interest income items to be included in our overall adjusted results. \nDaniel Perlin: Got it. And just to be clear, it's $0.01 for the remaining 3 quarters, not $0.01 per quarter. \nBrian Schell: Correct. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt from Citi. \nAndrew Schmidt: Bill, Rahul, Brian. So a quick question on the revenue outlook. It looks like the upper end came down. Just curious what drove that and how that might tie into the organic growth expectations for the remainder of the year? \nRahul Kanwar: Andrew, I think the only thing that happened -- we're actually at least as optimistic about the remainder of the year as we were at the start. I think the only thing that happens is as we get closer the ranges get tighter, we get a little more precise, right? So that's really all that's happening. I think the midpoint is actually higher than it was the last time we gave guidance. \nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. Perfect. And then maybe we could talk about just the visibility on the organic growth. Obviously, an area where we get a lot of questions. If you could characterize kind of how you build that up and whether -- what you have sort of in the queue, if you will, for organic growth is sort of high versus moderate versus low, how you would rank the opportunities there? \nBill Stone: Yes. I would say right now, as of April 25, that were probably stronger than cautiously optimistic.  We tend to be accountants cautiously optimistic as kind of for most people, wildly optimistic for us. So I think the natural conservatism gets -- sometimes gets the best of us. But we have a lot of business that we sold in the first quarter that we have not recognized yet. But it's already sold we've already got some of the cash that's coming in, and we think we have lots of opportunities. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Alexei Gogolev from JPMorgan. \nAlexei Gogolev: Bill, could you elaborate on the combination of divisions that was discussed? What does that mean in terms of cross-sell opportunity R&D investments into products to make sure that they speak better to each other? And perhaps, is there any room for margin upside from the combination of those divisions? \nBill Stone: Yes. That's a great question. We feel that we're up 27,000 people. We have 140 offices in 40 countries we deliver over 100 products and 100 services. So it is operating a large business. And the more we can concentrate like products in the business units that are most apt to create new products, create new service, create ways in which to deliver those products and services and then also be able to leverage all the corporate services that we have, whether it's marketing and sales, different implementation teams all of that type of stuff, we think, is really much more effective when you take asset management and products for large-scale asset managers and put all those products under Karen Geiger and Steve Leivent, for instance, and then also have go-to-market strategies for each 1 of those large segments.\n And I think the same thing is true when we took retirement and put it in with the global distribution or the global investor and distribution business. I think we get leverage. We get as Rahul said in his remarks. We get some leverage, we get some scale, we get some better chances to cross-sell, and we're, again, pretty optimistic about the results of that. \nAlexei Gogolev: And Brian, could I also ask you a quick question about the components within Alternatives division. What was the growth of private markets in the quarter? \nBrian Schell: The private market side, 10%-ish was the number of private. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from D.A. Davidson. \nPeter Heckmann: I have several kind of related questions on the Healthcare segment. Could you give us an update on the progress of DomaniRx and any initial conversions that have occurred year-to-date. One, I was curious, I don't really -- I don't think, we see the numbers based on your explanation, but Change Healthcare, which is one of the prescription processing hubs ahead of malware attack. And I'm curious if that affected the healthcare business at all in the quarter? And then lastly, would you expect that healthcare segment to be up or down revenue-wise for the year? \nBill Stone: Yes, that's pretty insightful, Pete, I could talk to you. Yes, Change Healthcare has been a nice supplier of revenue to us that we'll start -- you'll start seeing in the second quarter, somewhat in large chunks. So we're -- we've already sold it. We're already delivering, we have a number of pretty big scale clients, including some of the large scale drug manufacturers. So we're optimistic about where we can go with this. \n DomaniRx has held upgrade throughout the 4 months. It's been in production, we get almost no defects. We get great client feedback, and we have lots of new business that's going to go on at the DomaniRx over the next 8 or 9 months, and we're optimistic about our pipeline. \nPeter Heckmann: Great. Great. And so just in terms of like the revenue growth for the year, do you think we can get back to positive revenue growth this year? Or we be thinking maybe more 2025? \nBill Stone: I think we'll be positive this year. And whether we do $295 million or $300 million probably somewhere in that vicinity. And the one great thing about healthcare is that there's lots of revenue to be had. So you just need to go execute. And if you do that, you're in pretty good shape. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt from William Blair. \nJeffrey Schmitt: Are you still getting price increases kind of above normal in any of your businesses? And how much did pricing impact organic growth in this quarter and the last? \nRahul Kanwar: Yes. I think as we're getting more disciplined, as Bill pointed out and more methodical about this process, what we've also been able to do is put the price increases in the contracts on an automatic basis. So it's not as much of an effort and everybody expects them. \n So in 2023, we think we got about $150 million in price. Our expectation for 2024 is probably a similar number. There's a little bit of art as much as science with the renewals and what constitutes price versus upsell and those kinds of things, but that's about what we would expect for the year. \nJeffrey Schmitt: Okay. And then just back on alternatives organic growth, I think it was 5% or 6% in the quarter. You mentioned the private markets slowed. I think you've been growing over 20%. It dropped down to 10%. What sort of drove that slowdown? I mean I think you were getting -- I thought you were getting 5% or 6% price increases there last year, but what sort of drove that slowdown? \nBill Stone: Yes. I would make sure that we all understand the jargon we're using. When you talk to private markets, that's a number of different flavors of private. So private credit in the first quarter grow -- probably grew significantly more than 10%. But when you put it with private equity and maybe our real estate business, then it all averages out maybe to 10%. But private credit has been quite strong. \nRahul Kanwar: Yes. And maybe another way to look at it is if you look at the AUA change you'll see we're at $2.4 trillion. So there's really nothing in the underlying growth of any one of those areas where it's not growing at least as well as it was before. And as a matter of fact, we think our hedge fund business is growing better than it did last year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. \nJames Faucette: Just wanted to quickly check on from a capital allocation perspective and M&A pipeline. Bill, there's clearly capacity here for some leverage. And you called out a senior hire to assist with M&A last quarter. What does the deal pipeline look like right now? And what kind of assets should we think about you targeting? \nBill Stone: Well, I don't think we're looking anywhere differently than where we are today. And so I think you guys at Morgan Stanley and a number of others, UBS advised asset mark and [ GCCR ] asset mark would have been a target for us as well. And I would say those types of companies could be targets. I think that things that are in fund administration, we still buy and buy pretty quickly. And I think there's opportunities again, we've probably done 5 or 6 lift-outs and I think we would continue to do those. \nJames Faucette: Got it. Appreciate that commentary. And then I wanted to ask kind of a technology-related question, especially tied to the transfer agency business. Some of the asset managers, we talked to or look at their transcripts and other public commentary are speaking to the impacts of tokenization and their ability to drive down transfer agency costs. Do you think that's more anecdotal in nature? Or how should we be thinking about medium to long-term growth algo of your transfer agency business more broadly? \nRahul Kanwar: So we're seeing a little bit of that. Most of what we're seeing is clients piloting certain things that they want to do in a tokenized format, and we have a couple of clients that we're collaborating with -- but right now, it's not -- it does not have a significant impact on our business. And honestly, it's probably too early to even view it as any kind of a significant trend. \nBill Stone: And the other thing I think, James, is that  what we have done is take our transfer agency and our capabilities and alternatives administration. So now retail at, we combine those 2 things and we're not selling you -- we're not selling you one or the other. We're selling them as a bundle. \n So if you just want our transfer agency, you want to give your administration to somebody else, we're not taking that business. So that discipline and that ability to have a product that is superior and then making sure that we are the beneficiaries that superior technology when we sell it. So that's been a pretty good market team for us as well. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVay from UBS. \nKevin McVeigh: Great and congratulations on the results. Anything to call out? I mean the Intralinks growth was really, really terrific, I think it was 23%, obviously a big, big increase. Anything to call out that drove that? \nBill Stone: I really think that they continue to innovate on their the primary virtual -- data room business. I mean they add AI into that. They do really smart searches, they brought out a redacting agent to be able to help you get so much data and so much paper in those data rooms, it's important to have ways to be able to collate it and search it quickly. So that's been pretty effective, and it's been very resilient. So I think we're optimistic for all of 2024, and we don't see things slowing down even after that. \nKevin McVeigh: That's super helpful, Bill. And then just the AUA, if my math is right, it looks like it increased 3% sequentially versus flat, sequentially last year and almost double percentage increase sequentially over the last couple of quarters. Anything to call out there? Because obviously, it hasn't been a great market and it seems like there's been some real nice incremental growth there. \nRahul Kanwar: There's been pretty broad-based growth across all of our alternatives, right? So in the hedge funds, we did see some market benefit, but we also saw the benefit of winning a number of new deals private markets, as Bill just said, continues to be really strong for us, and we've added a number of clients there. \n So the AUA doesn't correlate always exactly with revenue because yields are different depending on the guidance of funds and assets we win. But overall, the trend is pretty positive. \nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I turn the call back over to Bill for closing remarks. \nBill Stone: Again, we appreciate all of you being on the call today. Again, we feel good about the first quarter and recognize that's 25% a year. So we've still got work to do, and we're hard at it. So we appreciate the support and see you in 90 days. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Rahul, and good day, everyone. As noted in our press release, our Q1 24 GAAP results reflect revenues of [ $1.35 billion ], net income of $158 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.62. And as Bill noted earlier in the call, our adjusted revenues were a quarterly record $1.436 billion, up 5.3%, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.28, up 12.3% and versus Q1 '23. \n Adjusted diluted EPS includes $0.03 in dividend income received on investments previously excluded from adjusted earnings. Going forward, reported adjusted diluted EPS and guidance will include dividend income.\n The adjusted revenue quarterly increase of $72 million was primarily driven by incremental revenue contributions from alternatives and Intralinks. Acquisitions contributed $3 million and foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $6 million. As a result, adjusted organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis was 4.7%. Our core expenses increased 1.9% or $16 million excluding acquisitions and on a constant currency basis.\n Adjusted consolidated EBITDA attributable to SS&C, defined in Note 3 in the earnings release was $557 million or 38.8% of adjusted revenue, an increase of $48 million or 9.4% from Q1 '23, the 38.8% and EBITDA margin reflects a year-over-year improvement of 150 basis points. The 150 basis point margin expansion reflects the positive impact of both revenue growth and disciplined expense management. \n Net interest expense for the first quarter of '24 was $116 million, an increase of $4 million from Q1 '23. The average interest rate in the quarter for the amended credit facility, including the senior notes, was 6.86% compared to 6.21% in the first quarter of '23.\n Adjusted net income, as defined in Note 4 in the earnings release was $324 million the adjusted diluted EPS was $1.28. The effective tax rate used for adjusted net income was 26%. Despite the quarterly share repurchase activity, a higher average stock price drove the diluted share count up to 253.3 million from 252.1 million for Q4 '23.\n SS&C ended the first quarter with $413 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.7 billion in gross debt. SS&C's net debt, as defined in our credit agreement, which excludes cash and cash equivalents of $95 million held at DomaniRx was $6.4 billion as of March 31. Our last 12-month consolidated EBITDA used for covenant compliance was $2.156 billion as of March 2024.\n Based on net debt of approximately $6.4 billion, our total leverage ratio was 2.95x, down from 3.05x at year-end. Our secured leverage ratio was 2.02x as of March 31. The $3.5 billion of our term loan B matures in April 2025, and we are currently evaluating our debt financing options, looking to go to market in the near future. \n As we look forward to the second quarter and the remainder of the year with respect to guidance, note that we will remain focused on client service and assume that retention rates will be in the range of our most recent results.\n We will continue to manage our expenses with a cost disciplined approach by controlling and aligning variable expenses to ensure efficiency, increasing productivity to improve our operating margins to leverage our scale and effectively investing in the business through marketing, sales and R&D to take advantage of the future growth opportunities ahead of us.\n Specifically, we have assumed foreign currency exchange will be at current levels, interest rates to remain at current levels with the potential of a couple of short-term rate declines in late 2024 and our refinancing will not materially impact our interest rate expense but is obviously subject to varying market conditions.\n GAAP tax rate of approximately 26% on an adjusted basis, which is unchanged from prior guidance. Capital expenditures to remain at the 4.3% to 4.7% of revenues, which is unchanged from prior guidance and a similar historical weighting share repurchases and debt reduction.\n For the second quarter of '24, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.412 billion to $1.452 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $295 million to $311 million; interest expense, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount in the range of $112 million to $114 million; diluted shares in the range of $253 million to $254 million, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.16 to $1.22.\n For the full year 2024, we are raising revenue guidance by $7 million, and we expect revenue to be in the range of $5.695 billion to $5.855 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $1.242 billion to $1.322 billion, diluted shares in the range of $252 million to $255 million, adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.93 to $5.17 and cash from operating activities to be in the range of $1.302 billion to $1.382 billion.\n Our updated 2024 guidance reflects our strong results in the first quarter with a continued positive outlook for the remainder of the year. That also reflects our cost disciplined approach and expected margin expansion over the course of the year.\n Now I'd like to turn it back over to Bill for final comments. Yes. No, there was -- this is Brian. Thanks. The $0.03 was not part of the original guidance. As we look through the appropriate components of adjusted earnings, we felt like these investments were appropriate to be included the last year, if you look at it for presentation purposes, you'll see we actually included it in last year's EPS numbers as well. So you can see it on an apples-to-apples basis. So on a go-forward basis, it's there, we think it's appropriate and try to bring any visibility or clear that we can to the numbers. The big I'd say, contribution to the year is actually just the first quarter. I would say for the remainder of the year, it probably rounds to probably another $0.01 overall for the next 3 quarters. So it's not a huge adjustment but we just thought it was relevant given how we reflected the rest of our investments and various interest income items to be included in our overall adjusted results. Correct. The private market side, 10%-ish was the number of private."

            "content": "Thanks, Justine, and thanks, everyone. Our first quarter results are record adjusted revenue of $1,435.8 million up 5.3%, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.28, 12.3% increase. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $556.8 million for the quarter, a record high for Q1, and our EBITDA margin came in at 38.8%.\n Our first quarter adjusted organic revenue growth was 4.7%, the first quarter revenue acceleration was driven by strength in our alternatives, retirement, Intralinks and Ops adviser businesses. Our recurring revenue growth rate for Financial Services was 6.5%, which includes all software-enabled services and maintenance revenue.\n For the 3 months ended March 31, 2024, cash from operating expenses from operating revenue was $180.5 million. We paid down $79.9 million in debt in Q1 2024, bringing our net leverage ratio to 2.95x and our net secured leverage ratio to 2.02x.\n We bought back 800,000 shares for $52.9 million at an average price of $63.24. The internal deployment of Blue Prism digital workforce across SS&C continues to go well. The 150 basis point year-over-year increase in our EBITDA margin can be attributable in large part to this initiative. A recent Forrester study found an average SS&C Blue Prism client saw a return on investment figure of 330% over 3 years.\n The key benefits include business growth, improved productivity compliance cost avoidance and improved employee experience and retention. As one of the largest users of Blue Prism technology, we are experiencing these results firsthand. \n Earlier this month, we held our first Deliver Europe conference, which was held at the Fairmont in Windsor in the U.K., hosting over 250 clients. The enthusiasm and energy over a 2-day event was evident and we've received universal positive feedback.\n I'll now turn the call over to Rahul to discuss the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Brian. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank a long-term director Mike Daniels for his dedication and support. Mike has been on our board for over 10 years and will not stand for reelection. He's been an important adviser during this time seeing SS&C growth from $700 million in revenue to over $5.5 billion. We wish him well in his future endeavors. We've had a strong start to 2024, and we are working hard to maintain this momentum. \n I'd like now to open it up to questions. Well, I think, Dan, and nice to hear from you. We have had an awful lot of development work done in our businesses, and we've created a number of new solutions for our different clients, and that's getting traction. Particularly our trust product, OmniTrust that we've married to our Black Diamond. So now wealth advisers can also handle trust, which is important as their clients start to move money to their children and others. And I think that's been a big opportunity for us.\n And we've also done a number of other things where our delivery to our clients has been improved and our execution on the implementations has also improved. So I think the combination of those things, some more discipline on the pricing, and we're still winning. We're still winning big deals. And as they go live, I think our financial picture will look brighter as we go through the year. Yes. I would say right now, as of April 25, that were probably stronger than cautiously optimistic.  We tend to be accountants cautiously optimistic as kind of for most people, wildly optimistic for us. So I think the natural conservatism gets -- sometimes gets the best of us. But we have a lot of business that we sold in the first quarter that we have not recognized yet. But it's already sold we've already got some of the cash that's coming in, and we think we have lots of opportunities. Yes. That's a great question. We feel that we're up 27,000 people. We have 140 offices in 40 countries we deliver over 100 products and 100 services. So it is operating a large business. And the more we can concentrate like products in the business units that are most apt to create new products, create new service, create ways in which to deliver those products and services and then also be able to leverage all the corporate services that we have, whether it's marketing and sales, different implementation teams all of that type of stuff, we think, is really much more effective when you take asset management and products for large-scale asset managers and put all those products under Karen Geiger and Steve Leivent, for instance, and then also have go-to-market strategies for each 1 of those large segments.\n And I think the same thing is true when we took retirement and put it in with the global distribution or the global investor and distribution business. I think we get leverage. We get as Rahul said in his remarks. We get some leverage, we get some scale, we get some better chances to cross-sell, and we're, again, pretty optimistic about the results of that. Yes, that's pretty insightful, Pete, I could talk to you. Yes, Change Healthcare has been a nice supplier of revenue to us that we'll start -- you'll start seeing in the second quarter, somewhat in large chunks. So we're -- we've already sold it. We're already delivering, we have a number of pretty big scale clients, including some of the large scale drug manufacturers. So we're optimistic about where we can go with this. \n DomaniRx has held upgrade throughout the 4 months. It's been in production, we get almost no defects. We get great client feedback, and we have lots of new business that's going to go on at the DomaniRx over the next 8 or 9 months, and we're optimistic about our pipeline. I think we'll be positive this year. And whether we do $295 million or $300 million probably somewhere in that vicinity. And the one great thing about healthcare is that there's lots of revenue to be had. So you just need to go execute. And if you do that, you're in pretty good shape. Yes. I would make sure that we all understand the jargon we're using. When you talk to private markets, that's a number of different flavors of private. So private credit in the first quarter grow -- probably grew significantly more than 10%. But when you put it with private equity and maybe our real estate business, then it all averages out maybe to 10%. But private credit has been quite strong. Well, I don't think we're looking anywhere differently than where we are today. And so I think you guys at Morgan Stanley and a number of others, UBS advised asset mark and [ GCCR ] asset mark would have been a target for us as well. And I would say those types of companies could be targets. I think that things that are in fund administration, we still buy and buy pretty quickly. And I think there's opportunities again, we've probably done 5 or 6 lift-outs and I think we would continue to do those. And the other thing I think, James, is that  what we have done is take our transfer agency and our capabilities and alternatives administration. So now retail at, we combine those 2 things and we're not selling you -- we're not selling you one or the other.

            "name": "Rahul Kanwar",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Our business had a strong quarter with notable strength in Intralinks, retirement and wealth and investment technologies. We saw improvement in software purchasing and long-term renewal decisions in Q1, which positively impacts our software businesses. This past quarter, we combined our Institutional Investment Management or I&IM business with wealth and investment technologies led by Karen Geiger and Steve Leivent. This change allows us to align several of our software products and services geared toward banks, insurance companies and wealth and asset managers.\n Our objectives are to enable accelerated innovation, take advantage of scale to deliver enterprise solutions and benefit from a consistent sales and marketing process. We also combined our retirement business with global investor and distribution solutions in order to deliver a seamless customer experience to our shared clients and once again, take advantage of greater scale and resources. \n Initial feedback from our customers on these changes has been very positive. We continue to progress on optimizing our cost base and strengthening our offering through use of Blue Prism and other AI and automation technologies.\n In our Fund Services business, notable capabilities include intelligent automation that processes over 2 million loan notices each year, enabling customer interaction and support requests through our internally developed large language models and a variety of other advanced protocols.\n I will now turn it over to Brian to run through the financials. Andrew, I think the only thing that happened -- we're actually at least as optimistic about the remainder of the year as we were at the start. I think the only thing that happens is as we get closer the ranges get tighter, we get a little more precise, right? So that's really all that's happening. I think the midpoint is actually higher than it was the last time we gave guidance. Yes. I think as we're getting more disciplined, as Bill pointed out and more methodical about this process, what we've also been able to do is put the price increases in the contracts on an automatic basis. So it's not as much of an effort and everybody expects them. \n So in 2023, we think we got about $150 million in price. Our expectation for 2024 is probably a similar number.
